                                 TOPE of the West Midlands Police.

           V HALE                Yes Vincent HALE, Solicitor for Mr

                                 MARSHALL.

           PC 9032               Police Constable Stephen BROWN of the

                                 West Midlands Police.

           DCS 6930              Thank you.    The time now is 1118 on

01.03                            the 19th of June 1990 (190690).       At

                                 the conclusion of the interview Mr
MARSHALL              ROGER                                                3


                              MARSHALL I will give you a notice

                              explaining exactly what will happen

                              to the tapes.   Do you understand?

           RM                 Yes.

           DCS 6930           On the 15th of April 1989 (150489) a

                              disaster occurred at Hillsborough

                              Football Stadium and 95 people died.

                              Following a Public Inquiry Report the

                              Chief Constable of South Yorkshire

                              consulted with the Director of Public

                              Prosecutions and as a result West

                              Midlands Police were requested to do

                              a criminal investigation.   The

                              investigation came at the same that

                              certain members of the public

01.33                         decided to make specific allegations

                              against named police officers.      You're

                              one of those officers and you have

                              already been served with Regulation 7

                              Notices dealing with those specific

                              complaints.   The nature of those

                              complaints and the particular duty you

                              were performing at Hillsborough would

01.49                         suggest that you may have contributed

                              to the deaths of sane of those that

01.56                         died, also that you may have failed to

                              perform your lawful duty as a police

                              officer on the 15th of April 1989

                              (150489) at Hillsborough.   I will




                                                                               545
MARSHALL              ROGER


                               explain the specific allegations to

                               you in interview, but do you under­

                               stand the nature of this interview

                               which raises both the criminal and

                               discipline matters.    Before you answer

02.16                         I need to formally caution you, you do

                               not have to say anything unless you

                               wish to do so but what you say may be

                               given in evidence.    Do you understand

                               the purpose of the interview?

           RM                 Yes.

           DCS 6930           Thank you.   I'll remind you that you

                               are not under arrest and you need not

                               remain here unless you wish to do so.

                               In addition, you are entitled to the

                               legal representation which you have

                              present in the form of Mr HALE, and

                              there is if you did require it a legal

                              aid notice there for your guidance.

                              Do you understand what I've just said

                              then?

           RM                 Yes sir.

02.50      DCS 6930           You gave evidence initially at the

                              Public Inquiry of which there has been

                              a transcript.   Do you agree with that?

           RM                 Yes.

           DCS 6930           You also provided to that Inquiry a

                              written statement or recollection

                              which was given to the West Midlands

                              Police.

           RM                 Yes.

           DCS 6930           You accept that?

           RM                 Yes.

03.12      DCS 6930           You've also provided to me today a

                              document of 19 pages, 19 pages and a

                              separate document headed 'Check list

                              for all defendants' two sides, which

                              you have asked to be considered, one

                              by me but also by the Director of

                              Public Prosecutions and any other

                              persons, and you have accordingly

                              signed a caption at the end of that

                              which says that you understand it may

                              be used in evidence.   Do you agree?

           RM                 Yes.

           DCS 6930           Thank you.Perhaps to start off with

                              can we just agree that I un.... you

                              know that you're shown on video at at

                              various times during ...

           RM                 Yes.

           DCS 6930           the 1989 (000089) match.   Can I just

04.03                         ask you to view Document number 136

                              on the video and just confirm for me

                              at this stage that that the shots I'm

                              doing include yourself.    It may well

                              be that sane time later you may want

                              to refer to them or I will, it just

                              clears it at this minute that there's
MARSHALL              ROGER


                              no doubt.

04.23      DCS 6930           For the benefit of the audio we are

                              now actually looking at at that docu­

                              ment which shows the video and should

                              show Mr MARSHALL that.     I should

                              explain with this particular video

                              that we are seeing that there is no

                              time and we can't give a specific time

                              to it.    It's a BBC hand held camera

                              that although the operator gives a

                              time of when he started it and it runs

                              for six minutes, he cannot say that it

                              ran continually for six minutes frcm

                              that time.     Can you fast forward PC

                              BROWN to the point where we think Mr

                              MARSHALL is shown.

05.04                         (PC BROWN fast forwarding video tape).

05.23      DCS 6930           For the benefit of the audio we're

                              still going through, we've now found

                              that.    You agree with us that's

                              yourself ...

           RM                 Yeh.

           DCS 6930           Mr MARSHALL on that part.    Thank you.

                              I don't think there's another part to

                              that. Thank you.

           DCS 6930           Would you tell me your length of

                              police service at the, at the moment

                              and your present posting please.

                              Riding Constabulary as a Cadet in

                              1960 (000060) and became a Constable

                              in 1962 (000062).    My present posting

                              is Deputy Divisional Conmander of

                              Sheffield North Division.    I took up

                              that posting in 1987 (000087).

06.05      DCS 6930           Thank you.   Could you tell me your

                              experience of policing Hillsborough

                              since you've been in the South

                              Yorkshire Police.

           RM                 Yes the first occasion I got involved

                              with policing football matches at

                              Hillsborough was in 1977 (000077) and

                              I did three years experience working

                              actually Hanmerton Road Division where

                              the Hillsborough ground is located and

                              then I moved on to other postings,

                              eventually coming back to Hillsborough

                              in 1987 (000087).

           DCS 6930           1987 (000087).

           RM                 Yes.

           DCS 6930           Does that mean that you were not

                              present at the 1981 (000081) Semi-

                              Final when I think we already know

                              crushing occurred on the Leppings Lane

                              terraces?

           RM                 I was not present.

           DCS 6930           You were not present?

           RM                 No.

           DCS 6930             Thank you.    Were you on duty at the

                                 the 1987 (000087) Semi-Final?

           RM                   No.

           DCS 6930             No.    So the first time that you

                                 actually come on to semi-final work at

07.16                            Hillsborough is in 1988 (000088).

           RM                   I did police one semi-final and I think

                                 that was one between Arsenal and

                                Liverpool, but that would be round

                                 about 1980'ish   (000080) I think.

           DCS 6930             ints...

           RM                   I'm not, I'm not too sure of the date

                                but it would be ...

           DCS   6930           Prior to the 1981 (000081) incident?

           RM                   Yes.   The   reason it stands out in my

                                mind is I, I arrested a chap on the

                                Spion Kop who'd actually fired one

                                of these pyrotechnic flares straight

                                into the North Stand, and that's why

                                it star... it stood out in my mind.

           DCS   6930           And we ...   we're satisfied that's

                                previous to the 1981 (000081) final?

           RM                   That was certainly prior to, prior to

                                198... 1981 (000081) because in 19...

                                in 1981 (000081) I was promoted Chief

                                Inspector and I went to Barnsley, and

                                served a short period at Barnsley,

                                went to the Police Staff College on

                                 (000088) and I know that this matter

                                 has been put to you before, there is,

                                 there was the suggestion that the

                                 tunnel, the central tunnel to those

                                 pens three and four was closed off ...

           RM                    Mm.

           DCS 6930             at some stage and Iknow thatyou've

                                 already said that you were unaware of

                                 that.

           RM                   Mm.

20.44      DCS   6930           If, ifpolice officers haddone     that,

                                 do you think again that you would have

                                 been aware of it?   Is it the sort of

                                 thing that they would have come to you

                                 and told you afterwards?

           RM                   Yeh they would, they wouldn't have,

                                 they may not have told me personally,

                                but I feel siare that that would, that

                                would have featured in, in one of the

                                written serial debrief notes.   I feel

                                sure that that would have happened.

                                those gates as was suggested, I think

                                you've got a view on that.

                                to close off the tunnel, simply

                                have to bear me while I stand up and

                                actually demonstrate,

           DCS 6930             Mm yeh.

           RM                   and you must interpret for the tapes

                                the tunnel, right.

21.49      DCS 6930             Mr MARSHALL'S pointing now to that

                                central tunnel that leads to pens

           RM                   Right, now then the gates, the gates

                                there are double gates, right,

           DCS 6930 N           Yes.

           RM                   and they open back in that fashion,

                                so they're actually in fact up

                                against the wall an' they will not

                                open outwards.    You're with me?

           DCS 6930             Yes.

           RM                   Right.    Now then if a situation arises

                                where this is full and there's

                                emergency inside, it doesn't take too

                                much imagination to visualise what

                                would be the result of people wanting

                                to exit through that tunnel and coming

                                up against completely closed

           DCS 6930           Mr MARSHALL has just pointed to those

                              on the map to where those gates are

                              that close off that tunnel.

22.55      DCS 6930           You may be aware that I've spoken to

                              or have interviewed in fact Police

                              and obviously other officers have been

                              spoken to.   Certainly and I think it's,

                              it's been brought up before that there

                              there has been different systems in

                              the past for putting crowds into those

                              particular terraces.   Certainly both

                              where those gates that you've just

                              referred to have been closed.     Now,

                              for example, PC SMITH said he

                              believed it was at a time when they

                              used to bring the supporters in and

                              fill in the pens one at a time.    Would

                              you have been aware of that type of

           RM                 No.

           DCS 6930           No.   PC ILLINGWORTH, on the other

                              hand, has said that he thought and

                              he's worked the concourse area before

                              which we would understand, if you

                              accept the concourse area being the

                              area between the turnstiles and the

                              back of the West Stand, that he has

                              seen the gates closed and he'd

                              assumed before it was because that

                              the pens were full and to stop people

                              totally contrary to your view and to

                              actually changed operational roles

                              and I discussed with Brian MOLE what

                              I'll do once we knew we were going to

                              get the semi-final, said well I'll,

                              I'd, I'd looked after the Nottingham

                              on the '88 (000088) sir, so I said I

                              coming in as a new commander, did you

                              ever consider it may have been better

                              to revert back to to your experienced

                              role if you like, without changing.

           DCS 6930           Yes.

           RM                 Yeh.

           DCS 6930           That leads me on to that side of it.

                              Would those officers understand that

                              they were under your command outside

                              albeit if they read the order it

                              appears they're always under Mr

                              GREENWOOD and he briefed them.

           RM                 Yes.

27.56      DCS 6930           Would they understand from a briefing

                              that you were in control outside?

           RM                 I'm not quite sure what they would

                              understand.

           DCS 6930           No.

           RM                 I mean I cannot, that's something

                              you'd have to ask them.

           DCS 6930           Okay fine.    But what you're saying is

                              that if anything needed to be done you

                              would take on the responsibility of

                              saying to them ...

           RM                 Yeh.

           DCS 6930           you need to do this, you need to do

                              that.

           RM                 Yeh, yes.   I mean, I've never seen,

                              I've never sought to evade

           DCS 6930           No.

           RM                 for the fact that that whatever was

                              done wasn't done.    I was in charge

                              outside and you know there is no way

                              that I would expect Roger GREENWOOD to

                              be, to pick up a responsibility at

                              this stage in respect of anything

                              which happened outside.

           DCS 6930           No no, it's really is just ...

           RM                 Yeh.

           DCS 6930           clarifying the the organisation and

           DCS 6930           Okay fine.    I mean they, within your

                              command, was it a factor that safety

                              featured in your briefing in any way?

           RM                 I have to say no no it did not, but

                              the factor of safety was one of the

                              things which Mr DUCKENFIELD included

                              in his briefing, not only to the

                              Inspectors and to the the Chief

                              Inspectors, but also to the entire

                              part of my brief.

30.23      DCS 6930           You refer quite a bit to public order

                                 reason why the emphasis is, is on

                                 Semi-Final which I found disturbing

                                 and distasteful, for instance, there

                                 was a fight and a stabbing which took

                                 place in in Hillsborough Park,

                                 raided, there was seme shoplifting

                                which took place down in the precinct

                               know of that should have perhaps

                               attracted your attention to the fact

                              you were present at Mr DUCKENFIELD's

                              briefing and he specifically talked

           DCS 6930           As a reserve serials do we understand

                              that they were reserve serial for

                              your specific reserve serials?

           RM                 They weren't mine, they were reserve

                              the entire operation.

00.37      DCS 6930             A reminder Mr MARSHALL that you are

                                 still under caution as at the start of

                                 the interview.     I think you were, you

                                 actually said in your statement and to

                                 the Public Inquiry originally that

                                 somewhere around you believed about

                                 2.25 (1425) time was a., a sort of

                                considerable build up of people,

           RM                   Mm.

           DCS   6930           and Ibelieve      that it was then pointed

                                out to you that it was probably more

                                likely to be 2.17 (1417) because of a

                                a particular aspect that was recorded.

           RM                   Yes.

           DCS   6930           Mm and, and I know from reading the

                                document that you presented to me that

                                you still think that that time is not

                                quite accurate.

           RM                   Yes I,   it's my view that the time was

                                later than the 2.17 (1417) which was




                                                                                  53 4

                              recorded in, in a log in the, in the

                              Control Box.

           DCS 6930           I'll ccme onto that a little bit later

                              on because it, it does relate to what

                              I'm, I just want to talk about now

                              that y... we have got a situation

                              where there was a considerable build up

                              of supporters that I think you

                              described as as build up quite

                              significantly late on around 2.35

                              (1453) time.

           RM                 Mm.

01.50      DCS 6930           But if if we move back earlier in the

                              day, you do relate to a number of

                              supporters frequenting public houses



           RM                 Yes.

           DCS 6930           you relate to their behaviour and many

                              otter things of that nature.   Did you

                              take any positive acts to request

                              those supporters to get to the ground

                              early and if so could you tell me

                              what they were?

                              No, no positive actions as such

                              because I think having regard to the

                              weather, having regard to the the,

                              the numbers involved, I think any

                              blandishments which either my, which

                              I or my officers would have given




                                                                             b85

                                 would have been met with derision

                                 because clearly the the people were

                                 enjoying a drink at a variety of

                                 public houses and would continue to

                                 do so irrespective of any sort of

                                 advice which police officers would

                                 give them.

           DCS 6930             Mm.    I mean was there anything that

                                would have given you reason to do that,

                                was there anything that would have

                                 suggested that you had a problem

                                 coming up that that would have made

                                 you think to do that sort of thing?

03.20       RM                   No I, one associates football matches

                                with, with heavy drinking and that was

                                 precisely what was taking place.

           DCS 6930             So in terms of if you like speeding up

                                the movement of supporters ...

           DCS   6930           there is nothing that you felt was

                                necessary early on, you felt

                                everything was alright an'

           RM                   Yes.

           DCS   6930           there wasn't a problem?

03.58      DCS 6930             You pointed out in fact at at seme

                                stage, I think you pointed out to the
MARSHALL              ROGER                                            45


                              to the Public Inquiry that you were

                              concerned about the s ... people

                              serving drunks at, to the one public

                              house and you actually sent officers

                              to that pub specifically to ...

           RM                 Yes.

           DCS 6930           to warn of that.

04.17      RM                 Well I yes I heard seme radio traffic

                              that that that concerned me in respect

                              of two public houses, one was the

                              Horse and Jockey where there was

                              supposed to be a hundred, I think a

                              hundred and fifty Liverpool fans

                              sitting outside the pub drinking, and

                              whilst they weren't, you know they

                              weren't causing an immediate problem,

                              the pub was in a residential area an'

                              I didn't think it would be long before

                              the locals would be feeling threatened

                              perhaps by this, by this presence, and

                              I sent a dog van up into the area with

                              PC, PS who, an 'F' Division Dog

                              Handler sent him to the area just to,

                              to monitor that situation.   Similarly

                              that Liverpool fans had drunk him dry

                              the year before and that he had

                              were problems, that would have caused

                              you to believe that you were again

                              going to have a problem later on, in

                              do get at semi-finals a number of

                              people who ccme without tickets and,

                              these people because if given they

                              given they they will run around the

                              another, and in the past they have

                                 conjecture, but I do believe that

                                 there were a lot of non-ticket hoi...

                                 although we will never ever know how

                                many, how many actually were present.

                                 statement some of the reasons why I

                                think that non-ticket holders were

                                 there and I don't think I need to

                                were substantial numbers of non­

                                ticket holders and I think that the,

                                the Inquiry perhaps didn't take proper

                                account of that fact.

                              shots seem to me to show that a lot of

                              people had actually got into their

                              places in the stadium quite early on

                              before the, before the kick-off.     Now

                              the 1980, 89 (000089) situation I

                              think is a complete contrast to that

                              in so far as there there are literally

                              thousands and thousands of people

                              approaching those turnstiles from

                              and the situation seems to me to be

                              very much different from that of 1988

23.49      DCS 6930            I think you, you've just sort of said

                              clarify with the video.    For the

                              benefit of the audio is now on and

                              why you're not happy with that time of

           RM                 Em.

25.33      DCS 6930           I mean if we moved on, if we fast

                              forward this to that time, is there

                              anything there that would assist us in



           RM                 Well ...

           DCS 6930           or you inexplainingthat?

           RM                 Only in so far as the the numbers that

                              will be, that were approaching the

                              turnstile area.   No I can, I can only

                              refer to to the evidence that I've

                              given to the Public Inquiry that it

                              was, it was my view that it was about

                              2.25 (1425) when Inspector SYKES and I

                              had a discussion about the numbers of

                              people who were approaching the

                              turnstile area and were spilling off

                              the pavements into Leppings Lane and I
MARSHALL              ROGER                                             64


                              took the view that at that stage for

                              the safety of, of the fans we ought

                              to close the road to traffic and again

                              that wasn't a decision which I, I took

                              lightly because Leppings Lane as you,

                              as you've probably seen is a, is a

                              thoroughfare.     It's one of the main

                              thoroughfares of the city and it's a

                              bus route.   If you close it you've

                              then got the job of, of redirecting

                              all the casual vehicular traffic

                              that's going to come up and down it

                              and, and direct that elsewhere, and in

                              any event the the, the closure that

                              was attempted wasn't entirely

                              successful because the video continues

                              to or shows ...

           DCS 6930           Sh...

           RM                 the vehicles continue to to move up

                              and down that that road right up to

                              kick-off.

           DCS 6930           The reason I ask that is this, if we

                              fast forward this to to about the

27.10                         2.17 (1417) mark.    For the benefit of

                              the audio PC BROWN is now fast

                              forwarding to 2.17 (1417).

                              still fast forwarding.

31.08      DCS 6930           The point that I wa... I was hoping to

                              make was one whether it helped you at

                              all, but but secondly that if if we got

                              that slight confusion over you

                              believing it was 2, nearer 2.25 (1425)

                              frcm the other things that you've

                              recounted does it mean that there is

                              the possibility that though six or

                              described later could have been that

                              six or seven minutes earlier, or are

                              you satisfied with if you like with

                              the way your statement actually refers

                              that it it comes around that sort of

                              2.35 (1435) time?   Because if the

                              2.17's (1417) right in your

                              chronological build up, is it possible

                              with that?

32.03      RM                 No I'm I'm, I'm happy with what I said.

           DCS 6930           Obviously ... accepting it happened

                              but it was just a matter of

                              clarification as to whether it's made

                              you think that since then that maybe

                              it happened a little bit earlier than,

                              than you originally thought.

           RM                 No, I think it was I think it was

                              slightly before half past two (1430)

                              when I spoke to Gordon SYKES about

                              closing the road.

           DCS 6930           About closing the road.

           RM                 Mm.

                              particular point, did it again cross

                              your mind and I think this is perhaps

                              the area where you told the Public

                              Inquiry, did it again ever give you

                              any consideration of suggesting that

                              you should say to Mr DUCKENFIELD what

                              about delaying the kick-off cause I'm

                              not going to get them in.     Was there

                              any point, did you you ever reach that

                              point?

           RM                 No it didn't cross my mind.

           DCS 6930           It didn't cross your mind.

                                he wouldn't delay the kick-off for

                                 that reason ...

                                that.

           DCS   6930           Would that have affected do you think

                                your thoughts on whether you should

                                request the delay knowing that he

                                wouldn't have delayed it anyway

                                because it was purely because of

                                off was delayed was an, was a matter

                              I suggest to them that kick-off should

                              be delayed.     I mean, in hindsight, if

                              you as you ask roe now in the in the

                              light of what was has happened then

                              clearly it might have been a very

                              urgent consideration, but having said

                              that I don't think it would have made

                              the slighest difference to the, to the

                              problems which took, which were

                              occurring outside the turnstiles ...

34.17      RM                 an' an' I say that in, with the utmost

                              seriousness that the delaying of kick-

                              off was a, was a question for Mr

                              MURRAY and Mr DUCKENFIELD, having

                              regard to the intelligence which which

                              they were, they were, they could have

                              have obtained or had received from

                              from other people out and about on the

           DCS 6930           I mean to you was it a rigid policy or

                              almost empty football ground 'cos all

                              these people are here outside.

           DCS 6930           If we, if we look at the control

                              responsibility that you had for the

                              crowd outside,

           RM                 Yeh.

           DCS 6930           and those supporters arriving, we know

                              that they are coming down Leppings

                              Lane frcm the various directions and

                              and ccming into that funnel area ...

           RM                 Yeh.

38.35      DCS 6930           before the turnstiles and you have

                              already said that you asked for the

                              road to be closed off ...

           RM                 Yes.

           DCS 6930           that it didn't work straightaway.

           RM                 Yeh.

           DCS 6930           I think in fact you went up and saw a

                              police officer and and gave ...

           RM                 Yes.

           DCS 6930           him an instruction.

           RM                 That's right.

           DCS 6930           Did you mention that to me?

           RM                 Yes I went up to the junction with

                              Catchbar Lane and there was a bobby

                              there with three South Yorkshire ....

                              buses and he asked me what the buses

                              were to do.   I said let 'em go through

                              and then I wirelessed control and tell

                              them to speak to                   who

                              was their traffic manager who I had a

                              very close working relationship with,

                              and advise him Leppings Lane was to

                              be shut.

           DCS 6930           Now the reason for that, if I

                              understand it right, was really for

                              the safety of supporters walking along

           RM                 Yes.

                              particularly concerned that there was

                              a problem again with supporters going

                               into the ground at that point.

           RM                  No because the the, the people who

                              were, who were waiting to get in that

                               stage were generally well behaved.

           DCS 6930           Mm.     So at that point although there's

                              people flowing in towards the roads

                              or having to walk in the roads there

                              is still no crowd problem as, as it

                              turns out.     The, the result is that

                              you eventually describe how very

                              quickly the build up does get out of,

                              out of hand.

           RM                 Yeh.

           DCS 6930           And we we do know now that there was

                              a problem with the tickets that there

                              was seme confusion in people's minds

                              about where to go to.

           RM                 That's right.

           DCS 6930           Did you recognise that problem at the

                              time?

           RM                 No.

           DCS 6930           Did any of your police officers on

                              those turnstiles in any way try and

                              communicate that to you?

           RM                 No.

40.34      DCS 6930           Do you think it was a significant

                              problem?

                              In hindsight, yes, because people were

                              had found themselves in the wrong area




                                                                               617

                              or against the wrong turnstile to get

                              into the ground.

           DCS 6930           Now can I, can I ask you to explain

                              that because ...

           RM                 Yeh.

           DCS 6930           what what you're actually saying is

                              that if people, if I've interpreted

                              this right from what you're saying

                              and from what my knowledge is and see

                              if you agree with this, that people

                              that were to use turnstiles shall we

                              say 9 to 16 ...

           RM                 Yes.

           DCS 6930           could have ccme into the turnstiles

                              for A to G and couldn't walk across,

                              they'd have to go back out the iron

                              if the problem was the other way round

                              the same situation.

           RM                 Yes.

           DCS 6930           There wasn't the matter of just moving

                              sideways from turnstile to turnstile.

           RM                 That's right because ...

41.28      DCS 6930           Would you describe to me what that

                              particular, on this map here which I'm

                              particular fencing?

                              Well it to all intents and purposes it

                              looks like a gate but it, but it is a,

                              in fact it is a gate, but it's a very

                              very long metal gate which is painted

                              blue and I guess it's in the region of

                              about six feet in height, maybe maybe

                              slightly more, and that runs the

                              entire length of the, the waiting area

                              in front of the turnstiles, so it's a

                              very solid and immovable object, it it

                              doesn't move and it's fixed in

                              position.

                              had become a problem is, does that

                              open?

           RM                 No.

                              effect of being a steel wall.

                              with the tickets on the day, is there

                              anything you could have done to

                              alleviate the problem of people going

                              to the wrong turnstiles and going

                              backwards.

           RM                 The... and there are things that that

                              could have been done, yes. There there

                              could have been frequent announcements

                              where to go, but the problem was, was

                              compounded by people being unsure and

                              and asking police officers all the

                              time went by.

                               that you you are still under caution

                               before we cormence.     I think when we

                               what could have been done and that

02.15      DCS 6930           Would you agree it, it's also

                              reasonably well known that supporters

                              going on at the semi-final, but I did

                              hear reports of people bribing

                              turnstiles operators.     I heard reports

                              of, of people trying to get underneath

                              the pommel wheel of the turnstiles were

                              actually climbing over the top of the,

                              actually non-ticket holders trying to,

                              trying to get through a turnstile.

                              something of a problem because he's,

                              it was a problem on the day, is there

                              anything positive that you could have

           DCS 6930           Can I perhaps now go back to something

                              we dealt with a little earlier where I

                              actually put the wrong tape on, it

                              and 48 (1416), and if you remember the

                              the question was on the terms of

           DCS   6930           Does that bring back anything in terms

                                 of trying to help as to whether that,

                                 perception is that it was later when

                                 I made a request to, to the Control

                                 Rocm to, to actually close the road.

                                think, you think at that time to think

                                about closing the road or does it look

                                reasonable?

                              have been an option or a thought?

                              because of the, the numbers of people

                              would you agree that in fact I think

                              at that earlier on at that time both

                              gates are open and the only one that's

                              shut appears to be the one at the very

                              end of the River Don.    Was there any

                              conscious decision that you know of as

           RM                 No.

13.48      DCS 6930           The reason I ask is this that you

                              would be aware that people have said

                              that in 1988 (000088) the queuing

                              appeared to be better and easier and

                              open appears to funnel them shall we

                              say directly towards A and G, would

                              you had no particular policy over

                              opening of those iron gates, those

                              iron perimeter gates, so in fact

                              people could come into that area

                              between the gates and the turnstiles

                              between, in a wider situation than

                              they did before, than they did in 1988

                              (000088), in other words there is a

                              narrow entrance whereas in '89 (000089)

                              it appears they had more room to come

                              access to A to G.

           RM                 Don't think, th.. those gates are for

                              access down the the roadway to the

                              back of the South Stand.

           DCS 6930           Down to South Stand, but you c ....

                              you obviously also go into the, the A

                              to G turnstiles don't you ...

           RM                 Yes.

           DCS 6930           into the, the bank.   The other

                              perimeter gates the other side, is

                              there any policy on how many of those

                              are open or are they always all open?

           RM                 They're all always open.

           DCS 6930           They're always all open.   I think now

                              we're up to 14.22, 23 (1422) (1423).

                              We're looking at the same video and

18.45                         I don't know again whether you can

                              but would you agree it still seems

                              that there's only the one gate open?

                              I can slow it down and show you on

                              there.    At 1425 on the video we're

                              now looking there.    You see the iron

                              perimeter gates there, they do appear

                              to be shut, apart from the one which

                              is alongside giving access.    Can you

                              just go back again with that one

                              please.

19.36      DCS 6930           Again would you accept that it it

                              certainly appears that there is only

                              one gate open at sort of 1425.

           RM                 Yes.

           DCS 6930           Again you would think that that is

                              quite unusual.

           RM                 Well it's it's unusual from the normal

                              match day experience because those

                              gates cure open on normal match day.

           DCS 6930           Mm.    Would it, can I ask about those

                              gates and you say that they give

                              access down and if I can point and I'm

           RM                 Yes.

           DCS 6930           They would do.

           RM                 Yes.

           DCS 6930           But on this specific match that was

                              not (interruption) going to take

                              place.

           RM                 No no, there were barriers at two

                              points.   There was if I can just

                              demonstrate on your map, there was

                              seme crowd control barriers there, and

                              there was seme crowd control barriers

                              the audio pointed to two sets of

21.09      DCS 6930            But there are games where fans would

                               be able to walk down that?

           RM                  On on normal League games yes, the

                               possible because of the necessity to

                               avoid large concentrations of people

                               and in the South Stand access road.

           DCS 6930           Do I take it that that's the reason

                               you would normally expect to find more

                               gates opened because the general

                              a very small crowd basically, getting

                              situation at 1425 when we talked about

                              the closure of the road, and ...

           DCS 6930           On the other tape.

           RM                 and my submission that that there is

                              no difference.    There's a lot of

                               (000089) because we know at about 1447

                              you made your first ...

           RM                 Yes.

25.46      DCS 6930           Having seen that now at 1446 from 1988

                               (000088) and considering what you were

                              faced with at the same time in 1989

                               (000089), and you've just mentioned

                              the difference of 1425, is there

                              anything else you would want to

                              ccnment as a result?

                              in 1989 (000089) with that crowd, do

                              you think you would have controlled

                              the situation?

                              (1440) you have said and I think it's

                              your statement at about page 15, how

                              unruly and volatile the supporters

                              became and that was a change in their

           RM                 Yes.

           DCS 6930           Can you, can you give me some examples

                              of what you mean by that?

                              appreciate that a, that a ... that I'd

                              an overview of the situation, so I

                              went to stand on a parapet which had

                              been vacated by a BBC camerxnan, and

                              literally the area was heaving with

                              people and people were just, were just

                              shoving their way into into the, into

                              the pack, despite the best efforts of,

                              of the mounted men.     Now I can use the

                              time 2.44 (1444) as a base time

                              because that was a time when the radio

                              went down and I had to change channels

                              from the match channel which is 25 to

                   the, at that stage I, I'd asked for

                   some help to control the situation,

                   I'd asked for some Tannoy announcement

                   over, over the Tannoys outside the

                   ground and BUXTON, PC BUXTON to come

                   with the Landrover with the Tannoy

29.09              that message got through, now I can,

                   I can sort of cast my mind back to the

                   the situation, there was a Merseyside

                   mounted officer in the middle of this

                   situation and he was being jostled

                   from side to side, there was the

                   police officers in their way were,

                   they were struggling with people,

                   they were sort of fear, fear I think

                   written on the face of one or two

                   people and there were clearly people

                   being being crushed, forced into that

                   and the the mounted officers were

                   doing their very very best to to

                   actually stop that happening, but they

                   were they weren't stopping, there was

                   no stopping those those people in that

                   situation.   At one stage I saw a young

                   lad lifted up, passed over the heads

                              becoming very very concerned indeed

                              the radio was still defective and I

                              I've a distinct memory of, of leading

                              up to the request to open the gates

                              of actually using my radio and getting

                              no response, jumping down off the

                              parapet and going to Inspector ELLIS

                              because of your experience inside the

                              what you were actually asking for

                              could have caused a problem inside?

           RM                 No.

           RM                 I'd I'd, I'd no idea where they would

08.52      DCS 6930           Because what you're actually saying is

                              you felt that there was sufficient

                              room for all of those people outside

                              anyway.

           RM                 Yes I said that earlier.

           DCS 6930           I, I just want to clarify so that we,

                              because the question I've just asked

                              you.   Now as we know that iron peri­

                              meter gate got forced and virtually

                              then the stream followed on and,

                              and actually tagged on to the end of

                              the people that were intially going

                              through, so you do you agree that you

                              ended up with a situation where those

                              frcm outside Leppings Lane also joined

                              in and walked through Gate C?

10.07      DCS 6930           No.   Because the gates were were open

                              for some cons.... certainly Gate C

                              was open for some considerable time

                              and I think it's fair to say we're

                              not too sure, it's difficult to

                              actually pinpoint some of the others;

                              we know they opened and closed.    At

                              any stage - one, did you ask for the

                              closing those gates or or attempting

13.31      DCS 6930            Can you remember why you did it?

           RM                  What, yes it was, it was a radio

           RM                  Th... I well I ...

           DCS 6930            Approximately is it?    When you say 30

                              in as a result that you, you then knew

                              there was a problem.

           RM                 Well there was a pitch in.. initially

                              a pitch invasion, that that was what

                              was reported to me over the radio,

                              that there was a pitch invasion and

           DCS 6930           Yes.

           RM                 it wasn't, it wasn't much reason in

           DCS 6930           Did you have to send them to a

                              you did?

16.11      RM                 Er yeh.     I, I personally was was in a

                              state of shock, I must admit, because

                              as I, I never made any secret of the

                               fact that at that stage I thought that

                              this appalling disaster was my total

                              personal responsibility and I sort of

                              had to get a grip of meself to to do

                              something positive.     Now I directed

                              officers two, two to each casualty to

                              take them out to the ground because it

                              was fairly clear straight away they

                              couldn't get an ambulance into the

                              ground, into the concourse area at the

                              back which was actually thronged with

                              blamed by many many people for this

                              disaster.    We were having to cope with

                              same time as cope with casualties,

                              seme of the young officers were just

                              as, were were, were in the same sort

                              of shock as I was.    They were trying

                              to give people mouth-to-mouth

                              give them cardiac massage.     I

                              eventually established three areas on

                              saw the Fire Brigade came eventually,

                              the ambulances took a lifetime to

                              every dead person so that we could

                              all the deceased, what you felt were

           RM                 Yes.

20.54      DCS 6930           Accepting this, and it's worth

                              reminding you now that you know and I

                              know that the Judge said that you were

                              correct to open that Gate C, and I

                              mean it's important to remember that

                              know that it was obviously, you were

                              bit to, can you remember when you

                              first spoke to, when you first spoke

                              to Mr DUCKENFIELD at all, perhaps in

                              a, in a, in a sort of briefing

                              situation?

           RM                 Time seemed to have no meaning and I

                              was eventually summoned to the Control

                              Box, and I walked to the Control Box

                              and I remember Mr JACKSON being there

                              and I remember David DUCKENFIELD being

                              there and Bernard MURRAY, and they all

                              of them were were in a state of shock,

                              and and it's at that point that I was

                              asked by Mr JACKSON what had happened

                              and I told Mr JACKSON that we had been

                              completely overwhelmed by the crowd

                              and as a result of which I'd, I'd

                              opened the gates.   I, I didn't say it

                              that I'd asked David DUCKENFIELD to,

                              I said I'd opened the gates and he

                              said couldn't you hold them and I

                              said no.

           DCS 6930           Can I, can I just clarify ...

                              said something about you didn't tell

          Your ref; MJF/VSC

          Dear Sir,

          Hillsborough Disaster - Superintendent Roger MARSHALL

          1.     Superintendent MARSHALL and I have now carefully considered the
 complaints made by Mr Trevor HICKS, Mr Leslie JONES and Mrs Joan

 MsBRIEN.

 2.   As you are aware, the issues have already been dealt with at a

 Judicial Enquiry which lasted 31 days, taking the oral evidence of 174

witnesses.   So far as the police in general are concerned, a conclusion

was reached that their failure to control the crowd was the major cause

of the disaster.

 3.   The senior officers were castigated for being defensive and

evasive in their evidence to the Enquiry.

4.    Consequently, any enquiry into senior police officers involvement

in this matter begins with an assumption of guilt, which they have to

displace.

5.    I must therefore make it clear at the outset that Superintendent

MARSHALL will not be content merely to answer further questions tending

to highlight the admitted human and mechanical failures of

communication which may have contributed in some degree to the overall

disaster.

6.    If the bias is to be shifted, it will be necessary to bring in

positive evidence to show that all the alternative theories put forward

by various critics could not have been put into effect on that day and

that Superintendent MARSHALL was faced with an inpossible situation

substantially different from 1988 (000088) for example.    Because of

the almost insuperable prejudice against the police caused by a hasty

interim report it will also be necessary to show that the interim

report was seriously flawed because most of the available evidence

concerning the behaviour of a substantial number of fans outside the

ground was suppressed or ignored and not given proper prominence at the

Enquiry.

7.    The report indicates that 3,776 statements were taken.   It must be

doubted whether the judge read all those statements.   The considerable
                                                                      PAGE   3
                                                                      S4A

 pressure on him to produce an interim report as quickly as possible,

 makes it likely that he only saw what was put before him.     My

 information is that a considerable body of evidence which would have

 shown the difference between the 1988 (000088) crowd and the 1989

 (000089) crowd was suppressed.     That difference is vital to any

 'hindsight' view of what the police ought to have done to control the

 1989 (000089) crowd and as to how effective any use of force or

 coercion would have been.

 8.      It seems likely that if all available evidence had been placed

 before the judge, he would have taken a different view, even if only in

 the emphasis he gave to the various factors.    He did take a very

 different view in the final report - see Page 6, para 34 to Page 9 para

 50.    It only remains for me to add that 'Hooliganism' takes many forms

and that a belief that the Liverpool fans had been cheated in the

ticket allocation coupled with an intention not to accept the position

but to travel to the ground and attempt to gain entrance in one way or

another is a form of hooliganism which could have the same consequences

as a more easily recognised display.

9.      Most importantly, the senior police officers would not have felt

that deep sense of injustice which they must have felt when the

evidence was being distorted before their very eyes - no doubt in the

laudable aim of not causing further distress to the relatives of the

dead.

10.     As it was, not only was external evidence suppressed but the

officers themselves, Superintendent MARSHALL in particular, were

prevented from answering questions as soon as it appeared that they

wished to call the behaviour of the fans into question.     It was

obviously thought that the police were trying to excuse themselves -

the interim report says as much.    If the evidence had been before the

Enquiry, the judge (and incidentally the complainants) would have




                                                                                 689
                                                                   PAGE     4
                                                                   S4A

 better understood what the police officers had endured and how it must

 have affected their decisions.    The officers' concern would not have

 been mistaken for guilty defensiveness or evasion, at least so far as

 Superintendent MARSHALL is concerned.

 11.    I must therefore ask, in accordance with the well-established

 principle in cases in which natural justice governs procedure, that all

 the evidence be disclosed - not merely that part which favours the

 prosecutor's (complainant's) case.    I could obtain the evidence by the

 simple expedient of placing an advertisement in the local newspaper

 asking the people who volunteered statements to come forward but that

 would, of course, involve a duplication of time, effort and expense

 which ought to be avoided when the statements are already available.

 It would also delay any final disposal of this matter by months if not

 years.

 12.   I am anxious not to take that step for the further reason that it

would undoubtedly be interpreted as an attack on the dead.     Sirrple

 logic ought to convince the complainants that their children who had

obviously entered the ground early to be at the front, were not guilty

of whatever is alleged against those who came late and who caused the

unstoppable crush which was the actual cause of the deaths.

Unfortunately, sinple logic has deserted this matter and a great deal

of bitterness has been instilled in the police as well as the relatives

by this confusion of the behaviour of the innocent fans who died with

that of the fans whose actions killed them, including, regrettably,

some of the fans with excess alcohol who had arrived late and pushed

their way to the front, where they died.

13.    I wish to make this distinction very clear.   There have been so

many 'leaks' to the Press in recent times that it is more than likely

that it will be made public that the findings of the enquiry will be

challenged in some respects.   I therefore wish to place on record that




                                                                                690

  the complainants' children and most of those who died are by the very

  circumstances of their deaths excluded from the charges of la^e and

  irresponsible arrival at the game which was a major factor of

  difference frcm previous games and which was the primary cause of the

  deaths.     It will however be unavoidable, given the seriousness of the

  charges against Superintendent MARSHALL, that if this enquiry

  proceeds, the truth concerning the fans mentioned at the end of the

 previous paragraph will come out - and may rub off onto other, innocent
  fans.

  14.     It is not necessary for my purposes to show that any substantial

 part of the crowd outside the ground was very much the worse for drink.

 The ordinary person's refusal to 'apply the brakes' when danger loans

 is well evidenced by motorway crashes, where drink is rarely a factor.

 Here again, however, the truth cannot be ignored in such a serious

 matter and you must know that there is overwhelming evidence of serious

 abuse of alcohol by significant numbers of those who caused the crush.

 15.    Similarly, one man may be humorous and considerate but two or more

 similar men, lovable though they may be individually, may act very

 differently together when challanged by authority.     Good humour with

 'drink taken' (to quote the Judge's description of at least a

substantial part of the crowd) turns very easily to violent aggression.

In addition to those who had seriously abused alcohol, there was a

very significant number who fell into the category described by the

judge.     Any experienced police officer knows that that category is more

difficult to deal with than the out-and-out drunks.

16.     In view of what has already been published as a totally

unrealistic picture of gentle and well-behaved fans, who would have

responded to a siirple barrier at some distance from the ground, it

would be foolhardy in the extreme to try to deal with the disciplinary

allegations without presenting the real picture.     It is necessary to




                                                                                 691

•                                                                         S4A

     counter the almost total refusal to recognise the impossibility of some

     70 men in the turnstile area controlling 5,000 men who did not wish to

     be controlled.    That unrealistic view can be explained by the intense

     emotion which surrounded the death of so many people and the very human

     desire not to cast the slightest reflection on the dead.     There was

     also a perceived necessity for special pleading, against all

     experience, that English fans could be trusted to return to European

     football and therefore needed to be exonerated from all blame for

     Hillsborough.

     17.    Incidents world-wide as well as in this country show that there is

     a particularly aggressive attitude on the part of a larger proportion

     of football fans than the fans of any other sport or musical gathering.

     Violence and tragedy are more likely among football supporters than in

     any other sphere, except polital gatherings.   There is much experience,

    on the continent and in the United Kingdom, of attempting to police

    crowds (usually football or political) without consensus.     It leads

    inevitably to the use of tear-gas, riot shields, rubber bullets and the

    like.    There is much evidence to suggest that any attenrpt to hold up or

    divert the crowd at Hillsborough, by whatever means, could have led to

    scenes like the London poll-tax riots, in addition to the deaths.

    18.    We are obviously in a position to call evidence from experienced

    police officers, not directly involved in this matter, that if

    arresting every unruly person were the answer (which, as shown above,

    it isn't) an allocation of 70 men is hopelessly inadequate.     You

    yourself will be familiar with the dilemma that every arrest which is

    made takes at least one officer away, more likely two or three, and

    that this self-perpetuating spiral of diminution of forces makes the

    Enquiry's over-sinple recommendations inpractical.    If the whole force

    of available men had been diverted to the Liverpool fans, which, of

    course, was inpractical - and could have been criticised as pre-judging




                                                                                     692
                                                                    PAGE    7
                                                                    S4A

 their behaviour - other areas would have been unpoliced and the danger

 of riot would have been increased.

 19.     Reccrnmendations 45 and 47 - The police should 'prevent., any

 over-crowding ..and ..take appropriate steps to remedy it' and

 'ticketless fans should not be allowed to enter ..' are virtually

 impossible of attainment without the co-operation of the crowd.     They

 were certainly not attainable at the time without the benefit of the 61

 recommendations which apply to other parties involved.

 20.     The same impossibility applies to the suggestions in the

 disciplinary notices, which state what the ccnplainants allege ought to

 have been done as if it were a sixtple matter to achieve.    It is worth

 repeating the other dilemma - that increasing the number of police

 officers can also lead to greater confrontation and public disorder.

 21.     If these complainants do proceed, I feel that further distress

will be caused for the very reason that the general public (at the very

 least those who live in the vicinity of the Hillsborough ground) is

mostly sympathetic to the view that football fans are more prone to

violence than others - and they may not differentiate between the

innocent who were killed and those who survived or died in

circumstances which confirm their guilt.

22.    It is difficult to see how these internal disciplinary

proceedings, which have substantial protection from disclosure in the

civil proceedings, can advance the cause of those interested in future

safety.     Apart from the Enquiry itself, there is still the inquest to

come and the civil proceedings, which will concentrate the minds of

anyone who has to organize a similar event in future.     Superintendent

MARSHALL will never forget that day and, if he has anything to do with

it, will strain every nerve to ensure that nothing like this happens

again.    The Police Force and the public need his experience in

organising future events, but will be unable to utilize him whilst




                                                                                693

•    these charges remain hanging over him.
                                                                       S4A



     23.     In the final report, blame is allocated widely, and very evenly

     spread, but no-one else appears to be 'on trial' except in civil

     proceedings which are already assured of success against someone

     because the behaviour of third-parties who cannot be identified and who

     are uninsured will not affect the complainants' cases.

     24.    It is strange that the police are singled out by the complainants

    when out of 76 specific recommendations for the future, only 15 apply

     directly to the police and virtually all the recommendations are stated

    more in hope than in expectation that their implementation will cure

     the problem.

     25.    The complainants initiated these complaints after reading the

    interim report, which is understandable.     They did not attend the match

     (or if they did, they were with the orderly majority inside, not with

    the disorderly minority outside) and did not have first-hand knowledge

    of what it was like for a 'thin blue line' of police officers

    confronted by an unruly, to say the least, crowd of many thousands.        If

    all the evidence had been placed before the Enquiry, the complainants

    themselves would have had proper material on which to base their own

    view.

    26.     As it is they were motivated by the interim report and by an

    insensitive Press - not by the final report - and they might take a

    different view if they had access to all the evidence.     As an

    alternative to a full-scale enquiry into the behaviour of the minority

    of fans who caused these deaths, you might like to consider showing the

    complainants samples of the evidence which was not made public at the

    enquiry.

    27.    When they have considered any additional evidence which you feel

    able to let them see, we would like them to read the final report

    carefully and take a fresh decision as to whether Superintendent




                                                                                    694

                                                                     S4A
  MARSHALL is deserving of their continued attention in these

  disciplinary proceedings.

  28.    If the complainants continue to insist that one or two individuals

  (police officers) out of the dozens, at least, of persons in various

  capacities between whom the final report shares the blame, should be

 punished in addition to the punishment they have already endured by

 being present and having even the smallest contribution towards these

 deaths on their consciences, Superintendent MARSHALL will understand

 their feelings.    When their dead, and totally innocent relatives have

 been confused in the Press with the sort of football hooligans that

 everyone deplores, it must have hurt the complainants very much.

 29.    However, he cannot go so far as letting himself be convicted,

 whilst others go free, and he hopes the complainants will not take it

 personally if he does not accept their complaints but fights with all

 his might to preserve his previous exemplary character and his

 self-respect.

 30.    Superintendent MARSHALL suffered a period of intense vilification

 at the outset because he was accused of opening the gates and virtually

causing the tragedy single-handed.    As is now known, his part was to

request the gates to be opened as a safety measure.    This was a

request taken only after the most careful consideration of the

alternatives and under intense pressure from colleagues who were at

the forefront of the crush.    It went against everything that the

police were trying to achieve in preventing ticketless persons from

gaining entry and he was most reluctant to give in to them.

Eventually, he saw a young boy being passed over the heads of the

crowd, apparently unconscious, or dead for all he knew, and he could

delay no longer.    He made his request, which was entirely the proper

course for him to take. His action in that respect has now been

completely vindicated by the Enquiry.   All the evidence concerning the




                                                                                69
                                                                        PAGE     1

•     opening of the gates was available, on video, to show the true
                                                                        S4A



      position and he was personally assured by the Judge and by counsel

      that it was appreciated that he had no choice in the circumstances, or

     many more deaths would have occurred outside the gates.

     31.      If he has to continue to defend his actions, I am confident that

     he will be able to show that those who suggest that other courses

     would have provided a solution to the problem are just as misguided as

     those who suggested leaving the gates closed for the dead to pile up

     against them.

     32.   The complainants might like to consider whether they are at

     present at their maximum position, with full public and private

     sympathy.     There could certainly be a backlash, if not against the

     complainants themselves, who happen to represent totally innocent

     victims, against seme of the other dead fans who were not free from

     blame.

     33. If they wish to proceed, I am sorry that without wishing to appear

     too critical of their present complaints, I must ask them to be rrore

    specific.     As presently worded, the complaints are too vague to be

    answered, except the one concerning the gate, which Superintendent

    MARSHALL can answer by reference to the findings of the Enquiry, as

    well as the additional evidence which he will bring forward.

    34.    Respectfully, what is required is something as specific as, "You

    should not have requested the opening of the gates", to which a

    specific answer can be given.

    35.    If, for example, it is suggested that a barrier or barriers should

    have been erected at certain points, please specify at which points and

    of what material, size and strengh the barrier should have been

    constructed to withstand the pressure.     Please also indicate what steps

    should have been taken to monitor alternative routes to the ground,

    taking into account every possible way around the proposed barriers,




                                                                                     696
  with a plan and detailed indications of the number of men, with what

  equipment, that would be required to man each barrier and each

  alternative route.

  36.    It would be useful if the complainants could be shown the

 comparative videos of crowd build-up at the 1988 (000088) match as well

 as the 1989 (000089) match and if they could indicate what evidence

 they suggest the police had in advance to forecast the difference.

 37.     Obviously, without knowing precisely how the complainants suggest

 that a different plan would have guaranteed success, it is not possible

 to answer the complaints, except in the general terms of this letter or

 by bringing forward all the available evidence, over a period of some

 weeks, at the proposed interview session.

 38.     I must reserve the right, on seeing the complainants detailed

 proposals, to request further clarification if the proposals are still

 generalized.     I am sorry to be so demanding but it must be remembered

 that Superintendent MARSHALL is faced with possible manslaughter

 charges in respect of 95 deaths.    it should perhaps not be necessary to

 apologize for any proper and legal steps which are considered necessary

 for his defence.

39.     lord Justice TAYLOR rightly observed that the policing of football

matches has become a military operation.     The fact that this country,

which has so far failed to succeed in this military operation, also

failed to respond perfectly to every military situation in the last

world-war and that we lost many encounters against superior strength is

well documented.     However, by concentrating on beating the enemy

instead of wasting our time and effort in fighting each other, we

eventually succeeded.

40.     In respect of Hillsborough, the Judge inevitably found that all

those who had responsibility for public safety failed in almost every

case to achieve a standard of perfection which 'might' - and I
stress 'might' - have avoided the tragedy.    I am bound to observe that

the final report, which was not subject to the same pressure of time,

is much more objective and even-handed than the interim report which

unfairly singled out the police.   It seems that mature reflection has

revealed the obvious - that the police alone could not have put into

effect all the recommendations which have now been made.     It has taken

95 deaths and a - Ninth I - public enquiry to make the football clubs,

the Football League and local authorities recognize that overall

numbers and the standard of accommodation - to name but two facts which

are totally outside police control - need substantial revision.

41.   A very significant feature, which must occur to anyone prepared to

be impartial and objective, is that the various other agencies who are

criticised in the final report had months or years in which to consider

their position, and still got it wrong.    Superintendent MARSHALL had a

matter of minutes, in the most extraordinary and traumatic

circumstances, to make his decisions.     I am sure I need not say more on

this point - it is so obvious.

42.   Superintendent MARSHALL is not prepared to join in a 'fishing

expedition' confined to bolstering the allegation that the police alone

were responsible for what occurred and that the fans outside the ground

played no culpable part, but he is prepared to co-operate in

ascertaining, for the benefit of those who have to control crowds at

future events, which of the complainants proposals are practical - at

what probable cost in money and co-operation from the other agencies

involved - and which are merely uninfoimed criticism which is incapable

of practical implementation and which can only serve to make matters

worse.

    Voluntary statement of Superintendent Roger MARSHALL

    Page and Paragraph numbering is consecutive to those of the letter

    dated 6th June 1990 (060690) referred to below.

     I have already provided much information concerning the events of 15th

    April 1989 (150489) at the Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground,

    lappings L a m end, where I was in charge outside the ground.

    I refer to my statement of evidence supplied to the investigating force

    and to the transcript of my evidence at the TAYLOR Enquiry.      I also

    wish to refer to the letter from my solicitor to Chief Superintendent

    FOSTER dated 6th June 1990 (060690).   Because of the need for

    expedition, it now seems unlikely that that letter will be forwarded to

    the complainants, through their solicitors.   It also seems unlikely,

    given their vested interest in the civil proceedings, that the

    complainants would be prepared to give ground, at least until their

    civil proceedings have been disposed of.   That is a pity, as I

    genuinely feel for them in their bereavement, but I hope that

    subsequent events, including the present World Cup events, will

    persuade them that it is not easy as they suggest to control crowds

    without tear-gas and riot shields - and not even then!

    For ease of reference, I propose to number my following observations

    consecutive to the 42 paragraphs of my solicitor's letter of 6th June

    (060690).
43.   I am prepared to acknowledge that the statements mentioned above

contain a true and accurate statement of my evidence given fresh after

the event but subject to the comment that I was rigorously

cross-examined at the TAYLOR Enquiry by the Judge and by counsel for

interested parties who were all concerned to show that the fans outside

the ground in the half-hour or so before kick-off at 3.0 pm (1500) were

good-natured and orderly, with a few exceptions, and that they were

nothing out of the ordinary for the police to control.    As a

consequence, everything that was said to me and the reception of my

answers was slanted by the impression that the crowd on that day was

not the sort of crowd that everyone had become accustomed to seeing at

football matches, ie unruly and fighting with each other or the

opposite team's fans, and that consequently it had no part whatever to

play in the tragedy.

44.   Scant evidence was placed before the Enquiry about the actual

behaviour of those fans in the time leading up to their approach to the

turnstiles. I believe that an unnecessarily legalistic view may have

been taken - that particular fans could not be identified as being in a

particular condition or as being in the crowd which caused the crush

and that any evidence about them would have been inadmissible or

prejudicial.

45.   I am not at all happy about this approach.   The fact is that many

of the fans who caused the crush were under the influence of drink to

seme extent - seme of them quite badly.   I believe that a Court -

particularly a jury - could properly take into account the behaviour of

large number of fans not only on this occasion but on virtually every

other occasion on which fans in large numbers attend football matches.

I make this statement because the allegations made against me - that I

could have dealt with the large number of fans on the day in seme way

which would have caused them to approach the ground, the turnstiles and
                                                                   PAGE    15
                                                                   S4A

eventually the stands inside the ground in an orderly manner, is pure

speculation and hypothesis.     Consequently, I consider I am entitled to

refer to many other similar events to show that any such hypothesis is

contrary to all known experience of football matches and crowd

behaviour and that there is not the slightest evidence to show that the

crowd at Hillsborough was so different from normal as to make the

hypothesis likely to be true.     In fact, almost all the evidence,

including the suppressed evidence, is to the contrary - it was not an

unusually well-behaved crowd.    Although there were marry family groups

and people who could have been expected to be well-behaved, I refer

elsewhere to the effect that even small numbers of self-centred,

brutally selfish persons can have on a larger group.     From my

observations - from about 2.35 pm (1435) onwards - this crowd was bound

to react with considerable hostility if attempts had been made to

control it by force.

46.   I say that on the day the crowd was not amenable to any form of

instruction from the police - partly because of the fact that any crowd

which is intent on going somewhere will not take kindly to being held

up or stopped in any way - particularly when kick-off time is

approaching and they fear they are going to be excluded from the ground

- and partly because there is a great deal of evidence that this

particular crowd had significant numbers in it of

(a)   people who had been drinking heavily and

(b)   people who had no tickets and could therefore only gain access by

creating such a crush that the police would have to open the gates to

relieve that crush and they could therefore slip in.

47.   Although there were plenty of people after the event with tickets

saying that they had got in without showing their tickets, it is not

surprising that none of those without tickets went on television to say

how they had managed to beat the system.




                                                                                701
                                                                  PAGE     16
                                                                  S4A

 48.    Any experienced policeman knows that such tactics are used

 regularly.    I believe that the problem was greater than usual on that

 day.

 (a)    because there was what may well have been a genuine grievance

 against the Football Association for choosing Hillsborough as a venue

 for the fixture, knowing that it would result in allocating Liverpool

 less tickets than they ought to have had.    The allocation also made it

more expensive for Liverpool, who had 14,000 (approx) seated and 10,000

standing, whereas Nottingham Forest had 6,000 (approx) seated and

 18,000 standing.

 (b)    because it was a hotter day than the previous year and they stayed

outside the ground drinking for longer than they did the previous year.

 (c)    because, having been the previous year, many of the fans would

think that there was not as much need to arrive early because they

thought they knew their way around the ground.     The previous year,

being the first occasion, they had generally ccme earlier so as to be

able to find their way.

49.     I am entitled to refer to other examples of crowd behaviour to

defend myself when it is alleged that it would have been such a siitple

matter to filter or control this crowd.

(a)     At the cup-final, that very year, when the dead were so recently

being mourned it ought to have been in everyone's mind, I allege that

seme thousand Liverpool fans stormed gates at Wembley trying to force

their way in without tickets.    Evidence of that fact was available

(from a senior Heme Office source and corroborated by a senior

Metropolitan Police Commander) to the TAYLOR enquiry but was suppressed

as being probably too prejudicial,    if we are speculating as to whether

a small number of police could have controlled the crowd on the day of

the disaster, I have no hesitation in saying that they could not have

controlled them because such a crowd can only be policed with its

consent.   I saw enough with my own eyes to know that that crowd had

clearly rejected the measures which were in place to facilitate

entrance to the stadium.

(b)   There is a fundamental misunderstanding by many people as to the

function of the police at large gatherings of people.    The police can

only do certain tasks such as searching for weapons (the necessity for

which is itself a commentary on the difficulties which some do not

appear to appreciate) and to act as traffic directors etc.    Once a

crowd of any size takes it upon itself to go out of control, there is

very little that the police can do about it.    This has been seen time

and again and should not need too much stressing.

(c)   As recently as Saturday 16th June, 1990, (160690), at the World

Cup in Cagliari where there had been a total ban on alcohol sales

(which the South Yorkshire Police were not allowed to impose at

Hillsborough) a crowd of only 1,000 fans was approaching the ground at

seme distance.   The police attempted to slow them down or stop them by

placing a road block across the road backed by large numbers of

police - way beyond anything the police had available at Hillsborough.

The crowd, as at Hillsborough, was alleged to be good-humoured.     The

result was a riot with fans and police injured and the chasing of

suspects through the streets with considerable disruption to the local

population.

In the event, only nine fans were found to be worthy of keeping in

custody for identifiable offences.

50.   This leads me to my next contention, which is that no evidence was

before the Enquiry concerning crowd behaviour in general and the effect

on a crowd of only a small number influenced by drink or by seme other

motive leading to a rejection of authority.    I have made seme enquiries

and believe that an expert will be able to show that a comparatively

small number of persons can influence a crowd out of all proportion to
their number.     I know from other evidence and from my own observations

that the proportion of people who were in drink or for other reasons

refusing to accept authority on that day was much higher than 'just a

few'.     I do not quarrel with Lord Justice TAYLOR'S description of them

as a minority, even an unruly minority, but it was a very influential

minority.

51.     I also refer to the Trafalgar Square riots.   I annexe, as an

indication of how false is the hypothesis that the crowd at

Hillsborough was good-humoured and therefore amenable to police

direction, a statement issued on behalf of the defendants in Trafalgar

Square claiming that they too were lively and good-humoured.     We all

know what the results were when the police tried to control that crowd.

52.     I said, time and again in my evidence, that although the crowd had

apparently been good-humoured up to about 2.35 pm (1435), the mood then

changed or developed and deteriorated dramatically.      I knew from my own

observations at the time and from the evidence related to me by many

other persons that one factor in the crowd's behaviour was the

considerable quantity of alcohol which had been consumed by many of

them.     I said then - and I repeat now - that the crowd as a whole was

determined to get into the ground and showed no restraint whatever,

even when it was obvious that people in front were in distress.         I

realized that it was not the sort of crowd advance that we see

regularly when there is a pitch invasion or a confrontation between

two rival groups but it was an advance of an army which could not be

stopped.    There was plenty of available space behind them and at the

sides for them to have relieved the pressure, but they just kept

caning on, despite tannoy warnings and all the efforts of the foot

police and mounted police. If physical barriers could have stopped

them, they would have stopped at the perimeter gates or at the

turnstiles.     In fact, they forced the perimeter gates open, carrying a
                                                                       PAGE   19

police horse and several policemen with them, when we tried to close

them to relieve the pressure.     The large inner steel gate (Gate A) was

being shaken deliberately - not just moving under the pressure of the

crowd.   The gate was being shaken in a deliberate atbanpt to force it

open. 53.   On the suggestion that has been made that we could have

filtered the crowd in some way further away from the turnstile area:

(a)   To my knowledge no such filtering had been carried out the

previous year, 1988 (000088), despite suggestions to the contrary by

some people.   The video clearly shows buses and cars moving freely

along Leppings Lane right up to the time of kick-off in 1988 (000088).

There was no filtering or holding-up of the crowd on that occasion.

The crowd merely came earlier and in a more orderly fashion.

Furthermore, any interference with the free passage of people along

Leppings Lane, at either end, would have aroused considerable

resentment from the local residents and business population, who use

this road in considerable numbers to and from their hones, stops etc.

Leppings Lane is a main thoroughfare in the city, the closure of which

entails a substantial detour for vehicles and pedestrains.       The

practical difficulties are considerable.     There are so many

side-streets and other entrances to Leppings Lane, which the fans would

have sought out if they had seen a road block at the ends.

(b)   It would have needed an enormous body of men, far more than we had

available on the day to cover both ends of Leppings Lane - not just a

few more men but enough men to control a riot situation, including

dealing with prisoners.     We had no way of knowing that we would be

faced with such a situation and had planned only for an ordinary

sporting occasion - as we had done many times before.     That was not

complacency.   We have a system of obtaining 'intelligence' reports from

the Liverpool Police.     We received no reports whatever that there was

any reason to believe that the crowi would be any different from the




                                                                                   705.

 previous year.   The teams were exactly the same.   They were allocated

 the same ends of the ground and the same proportion of tickets.      The

 game was a sell-out on both occasions, so the numbers with tickets must

 have been the same.

 (c)   I tried to prevent vehicles from passing along Leppings Lane when

the crowd was so great that I feared a road accident involving fans.

The exact time is in dispute.     I still think it was later than the

Enquiry accepted (2.17 pn) (1417).     In any event the attempt was

unsuccessful - we hadn't enough men to control vehicles, let alone

pedestrians and supporters.

54.    I believe there must have been many more without tickets on the

day of the disaster.   When I was approached by Inspector PURDY who

asked me to consider opening the exit gates to allow speedier access

into the stadium there were still thousands outside the ground in

lappings Lane, as the video shows.     I was worried about the build-up

outside the ground and the numbers were so great that I thought the

terraces must be nearly anpty - there were so many outside.     I had no

information from inside the ground as to the numbers that had been

admitted.   It was a reasonable assumption for me to make at the time.

However, with the benefit of hindsight, although there was some room in

the side pens, I believe that an overall assessment should show that it

would have been inpossible to accommodate all those outside the ground,

even if they had been packed in an orderly fashion, and it therefore

follows that there must have been a substantial number of fans outside

the ground without tickets.     They would have had no prospect of gaining

entrance in the ordinary way.    One way they could have gained entrance

was by causing a situation in which the police had no option but to

open the gates.   Although there is a great deal of speculation about

this whole matter, this is precisely what happened.

I will deal with the complaints individually, although many matters are




                                                                                 706
 covered by the notes I have already made.   I apologize for any

 repetition but it is inevitable in such a complex matter.   The enquiry

 itself went over the same matters time and again.   The allegations are

 too important to me for me to take any chance of missing any point

which tends to discount the sweeping allegations which have been made.

Complaint by Mr HICKS -

Failed to prevent a dangerous build-up of supporters outside of the

gates.

55.   There was a lack of equity in the allocation of turnstiles.

Nottingham Forest had 60 turnstiles available for their fans, Liverpool

had 23.   I had no control over this allocation.   The need for

segregation of fans, of course, arose from their previous behaviour.

56.   The turnstiles allocated to Liverpool were inadequate to allow the

ingress of the number of fans outside the ground at 2.35 pm (1435) in

time for the kick-off at 3.0 pn (1500) - even if they had been

well-behaved.   It is understood that the Health and Safety Executive

estimated that at the rate which the turnstiles could accommodate, many

of the fans would not have gained access by 3.30 pn (1530) but for the

opening of the gates.

57.   It is arguable that if all those without tickets had stayed away,

the number would have been so much less that the turnstiles could have

coped.

58.   No intelligence was received from Merseyside police that the crowd

would be unusual.

59.   The police planning and manpower were based on the 1988 (000088)

game which was uneventful.

60.   In the event, the numbers that arrived between 2.35 pm (1435) and

3.00 pm (1500) could not have been controlled by the manpower available

without the crowd's full co-operation - which was not forthcoming.

61.   There was no co-operation from the fans because those fans who
                                                                  PAGE    22

 were prepared to co-operate were unable to do so because of a

 significant element whose reason was coloured by the amount of alcohol

 they had taken combined with their determination to gain entrance to

 the stadium.    The presence of this significant element and the sheer

 size of the crowd thwarted the efforts of the police officers to

 control them.   The crowd could easily see the injuries and crushing

 which was being caused to those in front near the turnstiles but it was

 still unable to control itself and hold back.

 62.   All officers were correctly briefed and deployed - for a sporting

occasion.   The excessive drinking and the sense of grievance of those

who had not been allocated tickets were unusual and created a climate

which would have led to serious disorder and inevitable confrontation

if extra police had tried to prevent them from gaining access to the

ground.   Any attempt to separate such fans from the genuine, sober fans

with tickets would have been bound to lead to a riotous situation.

Arguing with a drunken man needs no explanation of its futility.

Arguing with a man with no ticket is equally futile because he always

has an explanation - his brother or his mate waiting for

him at the turnstiles with his ticket, for example.    The inability of

the fans themselves, as well as the police, to be able to differentiate

successfully between the genuine fan and the trouble-maker is what

leads to the common riot situation when each side (police and

spectators) blames the other and protests its own innocence.

63.    Control of the Leppings Lane turnstile area was vested in the

hands of very experienced senior police officers who along with the

sergeants and constables had been hand-picked by Chief Inspector RFAT.r

and Inspector SEWELL because of their enormous experience of

controlling football crowds.    South Yorkshire had even gone to the

extent of obtaining mutual aid from Merseyside Police who supplied

mounted officers whose task was to police the approach to the




                                                                               703

 turnstiles. These officers were used to policing Liverpool fans at

 Anfield Stadium and they too expressed to me the view that the

 behaviour of the crowd in Leppings Lane was unprecedented.   If they

 couldn't control the crowd, no-one could.

 64.   Equipment failures undoubtedly contributed to the confusion but I

 was able to ccnmunicate my views by alternative means.   Any suggestion

 that the crowd could have been controlled by overwhelming force, even

 if it had been available, is pure speculation.   All evidence available

 tends to show that a crowd in this condition of a combination of

 excitement, alcohol and unswerveable intention to get into the ground

 could not have been controlled by any means which would be acceptable

 to the British public.

Complaint by Mr HICKS - continued

Failed to control movement of supporters after the opening of Gate 'C'

 65.   The opening of Gate 'C' did relieve the pressure outside the

turnstiles.   To that extent, it was a safety measure which succeeded.

When the gate was closed again, the pressure outside was reduced so

much that it was controlled.   Even the fans who went through the gate

did not pose any immediate threat to safety.   If they had continued at

a walking pace (as the video shows they started off) and had had

adequate signposting or other direction to the emptier parts of the

stand, there might still have been no difficulties.   It has been

assumed that fans went into the centre stand behind the goal because of

sheer accident or lack of control.   That is not necessarily the case.

Many fans consider that the premier viewing position is behind the goal

and may well have continued to crush into the centre stand even though

they could see that there was space at each side.   Even then, there

might have been no tragedy if the corroded barrier had not collapsed.

Most of the deaths were in front of that barrier and it seems obvious

that that was the final cause of the tragedy coupled, probably, with




                                                                              709

    be remembered that almost 25     (21 out of 88) of the dead male fans had

    in excess of 80 milligrams per cent of alcohol in their blood and it

    is understood that these persons entered the stadium through gate 'C'

    and then found their way to the front of pen 3.

    66.   Without trying to evade responsibility by saying that it was

    someone else's job, I must say that once the fans were inside the

    ground, they were out of my jurisdiction.     I must make it clear again

    that I believed on reasonable evidence that the Liverpool area of the

    ground must have been fairly empty when there were so many fans still

    outside the ground.     They did not rush in through the gate in a

    disorderly fashion and I had no reason to anticipate that they would

    crush into the central pen in excessive numbers. It highlights the

    difficulties when it is considered that Inspector WHITE, who might have

    been able, due to his considerable experience, to influence matters

    inside the ground, was absent at the relevant time dealing with a

    prisoner.

    Complaint by Mr HICKS - continued

    Failed to respond to the developing tragedy and were slow to effect a

    rescue operation

    67.   This is a very vague allegation which is almost impossible to

    answer factually.     All I can say is that I did everything within my

    power as quickly as I could and as soon as the full extent of this

    disaster became apparent.     It was like Hell on earth.   I was personally

    in a state of shock and was surrounded by white-faced, shaken, police

    officers who were doing their best.     It took a great deal of effort on

    m y part to get a grip on myself and start giving what orders I could to

    alleviate the situation.     I have told the Enquiry that at that time I

    felt that the whole disaster was my personal respons ibil ity and that I

    had killed all those people.    Once again, the fans cannot stand outside

 this matter as if they played no part in it.    During these terrible

 norents sane fans responded with decency and altruism.   Others, sadly,

 acted very badly during the rescue attempts, vilifying my officers and

 making their job even harder to do.   I can only forgive Mr. HICKS for

making such an outrageous allegation against me and my men by reason of

 his own extreme distress at the time the complaint was made.      I would

 hope that now that he knows more about it, he would withdraw this

allegation.

Complaint by Mrs McBRIEN

You failed to prevent a build-up of Liverpool supporters at the

turnstiles in Leppings Lane by inadequate policing arranganents.

68.   This is the same as the allegation by Mr. HICKS and I have already

dealt with it fully.

Complaint by Mrs McBRIEN continued

You should not have requested Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD to open

the gates under any circumstances and thereby giving unlimited and

uncontrolled access to the football ground by supporters.

69.   I am sorry for Mrs McBRIEN and can readily understand her feeling

that the fans causing the crush should have been allowed to suffer the

consequences of their own misconduct rather than be allowed to

continue their actions inside the ground with the consequences we all

now know, including the death of Mrs. McBRIEN'S son.    Unfortunately, I

had no means of knowing what would happen inside the ground.       I

believed that there was adequate room for all the fans - there had

certainly been enough room on previous occasions. I could not

anticipate that a corroded barrier would break, causing extra crushing

at the front of the pen.   Although I complain about the findings of the

TAYLOR Enquiry in many ways, the judge and counsel for all parties did

assure me that in the circumstances I had no alternative but to ask for

the gates to be opened.    It was another part of the chapter of




                                                                                   71 I

 accidents, which had many parts, that Gate 'C' was opened first.     If

 one of the other gates had been opened, there is at least a chance that

 many of the fans would have gone to other parts of the stadium instead

 of the centre pen.    Even then however, it cannot be ruled out that the

 choice of the centre pen by many fans was deliberate and was bound to

 lead to crushing, which the barriers ought to have contained.

 Complaint by Mr JONES -

 You failed to control and filter the crowds away from the irrmediate

 vicinity of the turnstiles even after 14.17 hours (1417) when it was

 obvious you had lost control of the turnstile area.    In any event, you

 should have acted by 14.30 hours (1430) at the latest.

 You gave no actual order to restrict the approach of those fans or

 after 14.30 hours (1430) to actually stop fans entering Leppings Lane.

 70.    I do not agree that we had lost control of the area by 14.17 hours

 (2.17 pm) (1417).    Even at 2.30 pm (1430) it was not unduly alarming.

The real problems arose from about 2.35 pm (1435).

71.     However, it doesn't make much difference because, as I have said

at length earlier, it would not have been practical to try to control

the crowd at a greater distance from the ground.    The numbers involved

from 2.35 pm (1435) were so great that they would have overwhelmed any

filters or barriers at the ends of Leppings Lane in exactly the same

way that they overwhelmed the officers in the irrmediate vicinity of

the turnstiles. The most likely result vrould have been an angry

break-through of thousands of fans, which vrould have resulted in them

arriving at the turnstiles at a run and in a greater state of

excitement, with even worse results.    As it was, the crowd could not be

contained by a wrought-iron perimeter gate which was much stronger than

any temporary barrier we could have placed at the ends of Leppings

Lane.    The crowd brushed aside the perimeter gates, when we tried to

close them, taking a mounted policeman and his horse along with them.




                                                                                712

          72.     This crowd was unstoppable without hundreds more policeman with

         access to riot gear and other equipment and would have totally altered

         the nature of the occasion which should have been a pleasant afternoon

         of football. Numerous occasions since then at home and abroad have

         shown how difficult it is to stop any crowd which is determined to get

         through.

         73.    I did not give an order to my men to try to do the inpossible

         simply because it was inpossible.     We tried to restrain them as best we

         could.     In the end, the only way was to do what the police in Sweden

         did only a week or so afterwards, despite having said in advance that

         they wouldn't do so, ie to open the gates and risk the fans without

         tickets getting in, in the hope of avoiding trouble outside the ground.

         As I have said before, what happened next was the result of many

            idents ccming together. On many other occasions, the only result

        would have been that fans without tickets would have had their way once

        again.      The breaking of the barrier was the final event which caused so

        many deaths.      I had no means of anticipating that event.

        I have read through the above before signing it.      It is a true record

        of my answers to the allegations brought against me and I understand

        that it may be used in evidence in respect of the complaints made

    n March 31st, 1990, the eve of the implementation of the poll tax in England and Wales
    jndon. It was a lively and good-humoured protest, catling for mass non-payment of the n,UIWU                 LUA.


    je to incredible police stupidity and brutality in driving horses into an ordinary sit-down protest at Downing Street, and later
    unchmg a wave of baton charges by riot police into a packed Trafalgar Square, a huge night-long battle was provoked.

   xording to the latest figures, 4 0 9 demonstrators and passers-by were arrested and charged that day, and the courts have been
   lposing severe penalties. For the first time ever, the Crown Prosecution Service have set up a special unit to deal with the cases,
   jncc have siezed 9 0 hours of video and 3 0 ,0 0 0 photos. 125 officers are are working full-time on the case - the largest
   vestigation ever mounted by the Met. A further 39 people have been charged on the basis of this evidence, and in some cases as
   result of the hysterical media wrtch-hunt. Police harrassment of anti-poll tax activists and events has been stepped up.
   ie Fightback is Launched.
   n May 3rd, a National Defence Campaign was launched, involving defendants, solicitors, anti-poll tax activists and supporters,
  was agreed that the Campaign wnnlri-
  Jnconditionally support all those arrested.

  Demand the support of the whole Anti-Poll Tax Movement and other sympathetic organisations.

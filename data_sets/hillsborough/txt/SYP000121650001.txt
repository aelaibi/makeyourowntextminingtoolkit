                At    the above       football            match   I was      deputed         to work at       the Leppings

                Lane    end t ur n s t i l e s       numbers      1 and 2 w i t h PC 3223 Hickman..                    We were                on

                duty    from a p p r o x i m a t e l y      IS noon       (1200)       at the      turnstiles.,        We were

                instructed        to sea r c h all           fans    e n t ering       the ground,       these      be i ng the

                Li verpoo l      s upporters.              In the m a in       the     flow of s upporters            were        in

                good humour an d             genoral        search i n g carried out with o u t                p r o b 1e m s »        In

                the    initial      stages       there was a c on si d e r a b l e amount                of    canned alcohol

                found and the             s u p p o rt er s were g iv e n the           opportunity        of giving           it up

                or    not entering           the ground.            Moist deci d e d         to hand it to the            turnstile

                operators       as a gift.                As the kick        off time         neared,    the    crowd outside

                the    turn s t i l e s    began to swell            from the o r d e r l y         line of about          3

                abre a s t    to 6 an d 7 abreast.                  All    the     t urnstiles       queues     then merged

                into one       crowd       in front         of the      t ur n s t i l e s   and   it became      impossible                  to

                ensure       the fans        had the        correct       tickets       or to carry        out any

                searching.          The      crowd was        pressing         forw a r d to such a degree                that         1

                was    pinned to the wall                  at the side         of the        turnstile     unable      to move.

                Fortunately         1 being'at             N o . 1 turnstile,          next    to Gate A on the SWF G map

                I was able        to force my way out and                      go towards L e p p i n g s Lane where

                there were M o u n t e d Office rs                and     inform them of the             position.             The

             Mounted              Officers           came        to    the       front       of     the       queue       and       forced       the       fans

             back        into        some        sort       of    order          but    still           not     sufficient            to       search        or

             check           tickets            properly.

             There           was     a     large       amount          of    f an s     t h at      had       the w r o n g         tickets          for     the

             turnstiles                  and     some       having          entered          the        stile      had      to      force       their        way

             out       causing             more      problems.               Without          any more             real       problems           the       g a me

             was       started and                I and          PC H i c k m a n       stayed           at     our      turnstile             until       h al f

             time        for       any      late       comers.              There       was        a moderate             amount          of    th e s e .        I

                r ec a l l     there        were       several           youths         who        had     no    tickets            and    t hey were

             trying            all       sorts       of     tricks          to    get       in,,        Producing           h al f    tickets,             that

             had       obviously                already          been       used       to    gain        entry and            by s o m e        means        had

             been        brought            out      of     the       ground.           Despite            fans       wishing         to       get    in,       even

             to       pay,        n o ne    were       allowed           in w i t h o u t          the     requisite             ticket.

             At       h al f      time      I entered              the      ground and              s t o o d at         p o in t    S on       the map.

             There           was     no     other         incident           worthy          of     note        t h at    I can       recall.              I w as

                right        at    the      b a ck     of    the       crowd       until           about        "10 m i n u t e s     before          full

             was       bulged and                dented.              Quite       a number              of y o u t h s      had      to    be    spoken           to

             and advised                   re    their       conduct.              It wa s          apparent             th at      they       had    b e en

             When        the       crowd         had      subsided           we    as       a Serial            continued            along       Leppings

             Lane        towards            Halifax          Road and             supervised               the     crowd.            Minor       public

                 v.     Notts.    Forest          Saturday         9th April            1988     (0 9 0 4 8 8 ) .

                 The     ingress       of m o u n t e d      police        officers           assisted         greatly         in

                 alleviating               the      c r u s h i n g at    the    turnstiles             where       I w a s p re s e n t ,

                 a 11hough       it         c o n t i nu e d t o be      t i g h 1 1y    pa c k e d ,

                 I could        not    give       an    indication          that        the    problem was              short       lived.          I

                 would     liken       the       crowd     to    the      flow    of     water       from      a tap w h i c h          then      ran

                 down     the    plug       h o le .     Th e    flow      became        greater         and      the    turnstiles             c o u ld

                 not     cope,    ie       the    basin would             fill    up.         It w a s       only whan        the       flow     of

                 supporters           to    the     stiles       slowed         that     the    position            eased,      that         to my

                 recollection              was    a few mi nu tes           before           kick    off.

                Having      watched           the      video      recordings            of L e p p i n g s        Lane    end       on N a t i o n a l

                TV      only,    it        was      a p p a r e n t that    the    crushing             in    1989 wa s far,             far' m o r e

                 severe     and       sustained          than      in the        previous           year     of     1988.

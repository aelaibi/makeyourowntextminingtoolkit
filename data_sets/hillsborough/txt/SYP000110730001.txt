BARNSLEY DIVISIONAL HEADQUARTERS




At   9*00   am    on Saturday     15 April   1989,   I reported at Barnsley Divisional

Headquarters together with a number of Police Constables also from the same

rota.    Our scale of duty was weekly leave but we had volunteered to work the

match.

I was in charge of serial 14 which was made up from the following officers

                 PS 13^1 Crawford

                 PC   136 Smallman

                 PC 1278 Lang

                 PC 1002 Wild

                 PC 2819 McManus

                 PC 2887 Grant

                 PC 1777 Branston

                 PC 2806 Butler

                 PC   975 Washington

                 PC 3232 Burton

                 PC 3347 Thomas

Police Constable 1278 Lang and Police Constable 33^7 Thomas replaced Police

Constable                    and Police Constable              who were         and annual

leave respectively.

We   left    Barnsley      Divisional   Headquarters     at   9.15   am   and   arrived   at

Hillsborough Football Ground at approximately 9.^0 am.
At 10.00 am this date, I attended the main briefing in the North Stand with

my   serial   where      we    were        briefed     by Chief    Superintendent      Duckenfield      and

Inspector     Sewell.          I    also    met    Inspector White,         *F * Division,    who was    in

command of serials 13 and 14 at the Leppings Lane end.

After a refreshments break, I reported to Leppings Lane end with my serial

at 11.00 am where we were briefed again by Inspector White who also covered

the emergency procedure.                  In the event of an emergency, Police Constable 975

Washington was to be deployed in the central tunnel.

Our terms of reference was the searching of fans coming through turnstiles

A-G at the rear of the West Stand, Leppings Lane end inside the ground, for

alcohol, weapons, etc.

We were in position at 11.15 am.

Several fans had started drifting into the ground by this time and I noticed

that    there was about six fans in the centreNorth pen.

From      then on until approximately 2.00 pm, there was a gradual increase of

fans    coming into the ground.                   The majority were good humoured and friendly.

There was no problems at this stage, but I                        did notice a number of supporters

outside    the turnstiles attempting to enter the ground without a ticket.                                I

saw money offered to several turnstile operators when I was present.                                 When

that   happened,         the       fans    did    an   about   turn   and    mingled   with    the   other

supporters who were queueing in an orderly manner outside.                             A few supporters

without tickets jumped the turnstiles and were ejected.

Approximately       at     2.00       pm,    I    deployed     Police   Constable      3232    Burton    to

supervise     the   programme             sellers behind us because           of the hassel     from the

supporters.     Police Constable 1002 Wild was deployed at the snack bar at the

rear of the West Stand also to supervise a number of fans.




                                                                                                              ■ft

Between 2.00 - 2.30 pm,                   it was obvious               there was a fairly large number of

fans outside the turnstiles without tickets.                                       During this time I was paying

particular       attention           to      the        turnstiles,         when       it    became     apparent         that    a

number    of operators            were taking payment.                       I therefore             flitted between A-G

turnstiles, with a view to catching them out.                                       There were no real problems

at this time.

About     2.30       pm    there      was           a    large       number       of    fans     coming         through       the

turnstiles, many of whom had been drinking                                   but were         not drunk.

Several    cans       of beer        and lager had been                      'binned' in the litter basket                       on

entry.     The mood of the majority of fans had changed and they were becoming

more aggressive.             The smell of drink was becoming more apparent.

At   thistime,        I    noticed           radio         reception         was       'poor'        and virtually            non­

existent.         I    was     not      in      a       position      to     receive any         messages       because          of

interference on the radio and also crowd noise, which by this time had been

increased tremendously.

Our serial Inspector,                Inspector White,                 was        not present from 2.30pm and I

did not see him until about 3-30 pm.

I was unable to estimate the number of                                fans        on entering the ground who                  came

to me and said, "Someone is going to get killedout there".                                              A lot        more were

abusive and           threatening. The mood worsened between 2.30 -                                     2.45 pm.           There

appeared         to be     a   number of                fans having          difficulty getting             through        the

turnstiles       because        of        the       sheer    weight          of    the supporters.              I    did      not

consider       the    seven     turnstiles                adequate         for    the       volume    and   I    did     notice

turnstile                 which      was the one             closest         to Gate                  had difficulty             in

operating.           On   closer        examination,             I    saw    that       it was       a double        turnstile

which    was     separated         by      a    dividing         wooden          partition.           Bolted        on   to     the
                                                        - 4 -



partition was large wooden blocks directly facing the turnstiles to prevent

illegal entry.             The sheer weight on this partition had distorted it and the

blocks had jammed against the turnstiles making them inoperative.                                          A number

of fans had climbed over or under the turnstiles at the point.

There   also        appeared       to be    some       difficulty        with    turnstile                 A Police

Officer       who    was    on     duty    outside      turnstile         'G'    was    in danger     of    getting

crushed and I pulled him over the turnstile into the ground.

I was subjected to threats and obscenities from a number of Liverpool fans

who    were    shouting,         "Get     fucking      out    there      and    get    something    done       before

someone gets killed".                Their mood was aggressive and it was obvious they had

been drinking.

A large number of approximately twenty fans had climbed over the perimeter

wall    onto    the    turnstile          roof.        Several     were     caught and ejected.                Whilst

ejecting one of these fans I saw a fattish Liverpool supporter hand a bundle

of ticket stubs to one of the fans on the turnstile roof, who in turn threw

them down to the crowd at the other side of the perimeter wall.

About 2.45 pm, Gate              'C' opened and about fifty fans burst through the gate.

I ran to the gate with Police Constable 1278 Lang and managed to secure the

gate, together with the stewards.

Despite       losing       radio    contact,       I    was    aware      that    the     situation      was    being

monitored by the CCTV camera positioned in the South side of the West Stand.

The    noise    was     tremendous,         the    mood       of   the    fans     near    kick    off     time   was

getting worse as they came through the turnstiles, many of whom would have

been    ejected       normally       for     their      attitude         caused       through   drink,     but    the

situation at this stage was not practicable.

Suddenly,      Gate        'C'   appeared     to burst        open again,         approximately 2.50 pm -

2.55 pm,       a large number of fans ran through into the centre tunnel of the
Leppings Lane end.

It    was    noticeable          at      this    time    that   the    situation      had    quietened     down

considerably.

Shortly      after 3*00 pm,              there was a radio/tannoy message that all officers

were required on the perimeter track.

I took my serial onto the perimeter track via the rear of the Police Control

into the South Stand and over the wall.                            I instructed them to stay together

as a serial because of the number of Police Officers who were on the field

at that time and I went straight to perimeter fence at pen 3-                                  I saw a large

bunch of people piled on top of each other against the wall and up against

the    security         fencing.         The number 3 gate was partially open and had been

wedged       by    a    number      of   bodies.        It   was    apparent   that    the     situation    was

serious at this stage and speed was essential.                              I was unable to get through

the    gate       because      of     the    bodies,     therefore,     I   climbed    onto     the   security

fencing and pulled several fans from the mass and over the fencing, together

with my serial.               The majority of these appeared in shock but were conscious.

I     then    went       to   the     gate      with    Chief   Superintendent        Nesbit    where,     with

difficulty, managed to pull a number of bodies away from the gate until it

could be opened fully.

We organised a chain of officers and dragged a great number of bodies from

this area.             Where there was a sign of life by checking the cartoid artery, I

attempted resuscitation and cardiac massage.

My serial was engaged in resuscitation and care of the bodies on the field.

I organised a number of Liverpool fans as stretcher bearers and they removed

the bodies to the gymnasium.

A number of officers on my serial,                        i e , Police Constable 2887 Grant, Police

Constable 2819 McManus,                  Police Constable 1278 Lang, all were instructed to
remain with the bodies.

During the whole        incident     on the      field I was not subjected to threats or

abuse,    but   I did    see    a number    of    flare-ups    mainly   by    fans who had been

drinking and were wandering about aimlessly.                   This was understandable under

the circumstances.        I did see a number of coins being thrown onto the field.

A   lot    of    Police        Officers,    St     John's Ambulancemen,        wereengaged    in

resuscitation.     Many were shouting for oxygen, which was not forthcoming.

Initially,my feelings were of frustration because I was unable                        to   get to

the people       becauseof the security fencing.              Perhaps if I could have, we may

have   been     able    to save   a lot more       lives.      The   actual   gates    were wholly

inadequate simply because there was not enough and the ones which are there

are too small.

When the ground was eventually emptied,                I escorted the Liverpool fans with

my serial out the Leppings Lane end to the main roundabout on Penistone                       Road

before returning to            the gymnasium, where    three officers on my            serial were

involved in the sudden death reports.

At 7-20 pm,      I returned to Claywheels Lane where some of the serial had a

meal as we waited transportation to Barnsley.                    Police Constable 2887 Grant

was the only officer           still engaged at that time with his 'body'.

At 8.00 pm I retired           from duty.

Understandably,        a number of my serial were upset by the situation but all

credit to them they did not show their emotion during the incident and all

performed creditably.

WILLIAM CAMERON CRAWFORD




    POLICE SERGEANT 13^1




    BARNSLEY DIVISIONAL HEADQUARTERS




At     9-00    am    on    Saturday   15   April   1989.   I reported   at   Barnsley     Divisional

    Headquarters         together with a number of Police Constables also from the same

    rota.    Our scale of duty was weekly leave but we had volunteered to work the

    match.

    I was in charge of serial 14 which was made up from the following officers

                    PS 13^1 Crawford

                    PC    136 Smallman

                    PC 1278 Lang

                    PC 1002 Wild

                    PC 2806 Butler

                    PC    975 Washington

                    PC 3232 Burton

                    PC 33^7 Thomas

Police Constable             1278 Lang and Police Constable 33^7 Thomas replaced Police

Constable                         and Police Constable               who were             and annual

leave respectively.

We      left    Barnsley       Divisional     Headquarters     at   9.15     am   and    arrived   at

Hillsborough Football Ground at approximately 9-^0 am.
At 10.00 am this date, I attended the main briefing in the North Stand with

my     serial    where      we       were     briefed       by Chief      Superintendent      Duckenfield       and

Inspector       Sewell.          I    also     met    Inspector         White,     *F ' Division,    who was        in

command of serials 13 and 14 at the Leppings Lane end.

After    a refreshments break,                 I reported to Leppings Lane end with my serial

at 11.00 am where we were briefed again by Inspector White who also- covered

the emergency procedure.                    In the event of an emergency, Police Constable 975

Washington was to be deployed in the central tunnel.

Our    terms    of reference           was the searching of fans coming through turnstiles

A-G at the rear of the West Stand, Leppings Lane end inside the ground, for

alcohol, weapons, etc.

We were in position at 11.15 am.

Several fans had started drifting into the ground by this time and I noticed

that     there was about six fans                          in the centre North pen.

From     then on until           approximately 2.00 pm, there was agradual                       increase      of

fans     coming into the ground. The majority                            were good humoured      and friendly.

There was no problems at this stage, but I                              did notice a      number of supporters

outside    the    turnstiles attempting to enter the ground without a ticket.                                       I

saw money offered to several turnstile operators when I was present.                                           When

that     happened,         the   fans        did     an    about    turn    and     mingled   with    the   other

supporters who were queueing in an orderly manner outside.                                    A few supporters

without tickets jumped the turnstiles and were ejected.

Approximately         at     2.00       pm,     I    deployed       Police       Constable    3232    Burton     to

supervise       the   programme         sellers           behind   us    because    of   the hassel    from the

supporters.       Police Constable 1002 Wild was deployed at the snack bar at the

rear of the West Stand also to supervise a number of fans.
                                                                    - 3 -



Between 2.00 - 2.30                   pm,       it was obvious there was a fairly large number of

fans outside             the turnstiles without tickets.                              During this time I was paying

particular         attention              to     the         turnstiles,        when       it    became        apparent       that    a

number    of     operators            were          taking payment.                I therefore           flitted between A-G

turnstiles,        with a view to catching them out.                                      There were no real problems

at this time.

About     2.30       pm        there        was          a    large       number      of     fans       coming        through       the

turnstiles, many of whom had been drinking but were not drunk.

Several      cans        of    beer       and        lager      had been          'binned'       in the    litter basket on

entry.       The mood of the majority of fans had changed and they were becoming

more aggressive.                   The smell of drink was becoming more apparent.

At    this     time,           I    noticed           radio         reception was          'poor'        and    virtually          non­

existent.            I    was       not     in       a       position     to      receive        any    messages       because       of

interference on the radio and also crowd noise, which by this time had been

increased tremendously.

Our   serial Inspector,                   Inspector White,                  was      not present from 2.30                 pm and I

did not see him until about 3.30 pm.

I was unable to estimate the number of fanson entering                                                  the ground who             came

to me and said,               "Someone is going to get killed                              out there". A lot more                  were

abusive      and         threatening. The mood                       worsened between 2.30 - 2.45 pm.                         There

appeared       to be           a     number of               fans      having difficulty                getting       through       the

turnstiles         because           of        the       sheer      weight      of    the        supporters.           I     did    not

consider       the       seven       turnstiles                adequate        for   the        volume    and     I    did    notice

turnstile                     which       was the one                 closest to Gate                     had difficulty             in

operating.           On       closer        examination,              I   saw      that     it    was    a double          turnstile

which    was       separated           by       a     dividing        wooden         partition.           Bolted       on     to    the

partition was large wooden blocks directly facing the turnstiles to prevent

blocks had jammed against the turnstiles making them inoperative.                                               A number

of fans had climbed over or under the turnstiles at the point.

There    also       appeared       to    be    some      difficulty          with     turnstile                 A Police

Officer       who    was    on     duty       outside     turnstile           'G'    was    in   danger    of    getting

crushed and I pulled him over the turnstile into the ground.

I was     subjected to threats and obscenities from a number of Liverpool fans

who    were    shouting,         "Get     fucking        out       there     and     get    something     done      before

someone gets killed” .               Their mood was aggressive and it was obvious they had

been drinking.

A large       number    of approximately twenty fans had climbed over the perimeter

wall    onto    the     turnstile         roof.          Several       were     caught      and ejected.            Whilst

ejecting one of these fans I saw a                            fattish Liverpool                  supporter          hand a bundle

of ticket stubs to one of the fans                            on the turnstile roof, who in turn                      threw

them down to the crowd at the other                           side of the perimeter wall.

About 2.45 pm, Gate                'C' opened and             about fifty fans burst through the                      gate.

I ran to the gate with Police Constable 1278 Lang and managed to secure the

gate, together with the stewards.

Despite       losing       radio    contact,         I   was       aware      that    the     situation       was    being

monitored by the CCTV camera positioned in the South side of the West Stand.

The    noise    was     tremendous,            the    mood     of      the    fans     near      kick   off    time    was

getting worse          as they came through the turnstiles,                            many of whom would have

been    ejected       normally          for    their      attitude           caused    through      drink,      but    the

situation at this stage was not practicable.

Suddenly,      Gate     'C'      appeared       to burst           open    again,      approximately 2.50             pm   -

2.55    pm,    a large      number of fans ran through into the centre tunnel of the
Leppings Lane end.

It    was    noticeable        at       this    time    that       the   situation     had    quietened     down

considerably.

Shortly      after     3.00    pm,      there    was a radio/tannoy message              that all officers

were required on the perimeter track.

I took my serial onto the perimeter track via the rear of the Police Control

into the South Stand and over the wall.                            I instructed them to stay together

as a serial because of the number of Police Officers who were on the field

at that time and I went straight to perimeter fence at pen 3-                                   I saw a large

bunch of people piled on top of each other against the wall and up against

the   security        fencing.          The    number    3 gate was partially open and had been

wedged      by    a   number       of   bodies.         It   was    apparent    that    the     situation    was

serious at this stage and speed was essential.                               I was unable to get through

the   gate       because      of    the    bodies,      therefore,       I   climbed    onto     the   security

fencing and pulled several fans from the mass and over the fencing, together

with my serial.            The majority of these appeared in shock but were conscious.

I    then    went     to   the      gate       with    Chief   Superintendent          Nesbit    where,     with

difficulty, managed to pull a number of bodies away from the gate until it

could be opened fully.

We organised a chain of officers and dragged a great number of bodies from

this area.         Where there was a sign of life by checking the cartoid artery, I

attempted resuscitation and cardiac massage.

My serial was engaged in resuscitation and care of the bodies on the field.

I organised a number of Liverpool fans as stretcher bearers and they removed

the bodies to the gymnasium.

A number of officers on my serial,                      i e , Police Constable 2887 Grant, Police

Constable        2819 McManus,          Police Constable           1278 Lang,    all were       instructed to
remain with the bodies.

During      the whole           incident   on   the    field I was not subjected to threats or

abuse, but           I   did    see   a number    of    flare-ups      mainly   by   fans who had been

drinking and were wandering about aimlessly.                           This was understandable under

the circumstances.               I did see a number of coins being thrown onto the field.

A    lot       of     Police      Officers,      St    J o h n ’s   Ambulancemen,    were    engaged    in

resuscitation.             Many were shouting for oxygen, which was not forthcoming.

Initially,           my feelings were of frustration because I was unable                      to get to

the people because of the security fencing.                          Perhaps if I could have, we may

have     been       able   to    save   a lot    more    lives.       The   actual   gates   were   wholly

inadequate simply because there was not enough and the ones which are there

are too small.

When     the    ground was eventually emptied,                 I escorted the Liverpool        fans with

my serial out the Leppings Lane end                     to the main roundabout on Penistone Road

before      returning          to the gymnasium,        where three officers on my           serial were

involved in the sudden death reports.

At   7.20      pm,    I returned to Claywheels Lane where                   some of the serial had a

meal   as we waited             transportation to Barnsley.             Police Constable 2887 Grant

was the only officer still engaged at that time with his ’body’.

At 8.00 pm I retired from duty.

Understandably,            a number of my serial were upset                 by the situation but all

credit     to them they did not show their emotion during the incident and all

performed creditably.

              SATURDAY, 9th April,1988,



              On Saturday,the 9th April,1988, 1 was detailed to perform duties in respect
of the F.A.Cup Semi-Final between Nottingham Forest and Liverpool at Hillsborough
Football Ground, Sheffield*
              I was paxt of the Police contingent from the Barnsley Srvii Sub Division which
consisted of two serials those being Serials 11 and 13• There was as Inspector in charge
of Sach serial ours being Inspector Hooley. My serial was made up of the Following;

             The serial was paraded at OS'+J that date and conveyed to Hillsborough by Force
Coach arriving at 0930. At 1000 1 was briefed in the North Stand before taking up actual
duties at the rear of the West Stand. 1 had deployed the officers in pairs. PC s|______
       and              were depl|red at the bottom of the stairs leading to the seated area

in. the West stand directly opposite Turnstiles 1-16?. PC's 12?8 Lang and_______ were
deployed,at the entrance to the West stand and nearest the Centre tunnel opposite
turnstiles A-G; The remainder of the serial were on general public order patrol in the
bar concourse in the West Stand and also the area behind the Leppings Lane end inside the
ground.
             The general behaviour and attitude of the fans on this date was very good with
the majority in the ground well before kick off time at 1500 * 1 do recall some of the
fans had been drinking and were in a good humour.This was not a problem.
             The only problem we did encounter was the number of Liverpool fans with tickets
for the terracing who attempted to get into the seated area of the west Stand by using
tickets passed down to them by the fans in the Stand. We had anticipated this and the
iour officers assisting the stewards at both entrances tore the corner of the tickets
ob entrance to the West Stand so that they would know if the tickets had been, passed
or to the Leppings % n e     terraces. This did not cause any prob1gm              «pcepted

  their plan had been ’rumbled*.
                At 1^.50 hours we had an instruction believed verbal, that no more fans were to
  be allowed in the central pens therefore the wooden gate at the rear of the tunnel was
  closed denying access. This was done by PC 1278 Lang.
                The game took place without incident and there was no arrsts by my serial.
                On conclusion of the game my serial supervised the fans leaving the ground and
  eventually we were deployed to remain at the junction with Catchbar Lane. The fans had been
  orderly and good humoured throughout the afternnoon not one member of my serial had cause
       to intervene, either before,during or after the match.

      WILLIAM CAMERON CRAWFORD




      POLICE SERGEANT 13^1




      BARNSLEY DIVISIONAL HEADQUARTERS




      At   9-00   am on   Saturday   15    April   1989.   I reported   at   Barnsley    Divisional

      Headquarters      together with a number of Police Constables also from the same

      rota.    Our scale of duty was weekly leave but we had volunteered to work the

      match.

      I was in charge of serial 14 which was made up from the following officers

                   PS 13*U Crawford

                   PC     136 Smallman

                    PC 1278 Lang

                   PC 1002 Wild

                    PC 2819 McManus

                   PC 2887 Grant

                   PC 1777 Branston

                   PC 2806 Butler

                   PC     975 Washington

                   PC 3232 Burton

                   PC 3347 Thomas

      Police Constable 1278 Lang and Police Constable 33^7 Thomas replaced Police

      Constable                  and Police Constable                who were           and annual

      leave respectively.

      We   left    Barnsley    Divisional     Headquarters     at   9-15     am   and   arrived   at

      Hillsborough Football Ground at approximately 9-^0 am.
 At 10.00 am this date, I attended the main briefing in the North Stand with

 my    serial    where      we       were    briefed      by   Chief     Superintendent      Duckenfield       and

 Inspector Sewell.               I    also    met       Inspector     White,    'F'   Division,      who was    in

 command of serials 13 and 14 at the Leppings Lane end.

After a refreshments break,                   I reported to Leppings Lane end with my serial

at 11.00 am where we were briefed again by Inspector White who also- covered

 the emergency procedure.                   In the event of an emergency, Police Constable 975

Washington was to be deployed in the central tunnel.

Our    terms of reference              was the      searching of fans coming through turnstiles

A-G at the rear of the West Stand, Leppings Lane end inside the ground, for

alcohol, weapons, etc.

We were in position at 11.15 am.

Several fans had started drifting into the ground by this time and I noticed

that      there was about six fans in the centre North pen.

From then on until           approximately 2.00 pm,                   there was a gradual       increase       of

fans      coming into the ground. The majority were good humoured                              and friendly.

There was no problems at this                      stage, but I did notice a number            of supporters

outside     the turnstiles attempting to enter the ground without a ticket.                                         I

saw money offered to several                      turnstile      operators when I was present.                When

that    happened,          the   fans       did    an    about    turn    and    mingled    with     the   other

supporters who were queueing in an orderly manner outside.                                  A few supporters

without tickets jumped the turnstiles and were ejected.

Approximately         at     2.00      pm,    I     deployed      Police       Constable    3232     Burton    to

supervise       the   programme         sellers      behind      us   because    of   the   hassel    from    the

supporters.       Police Constable 1002 Wild was deployed at the snack bar at the

rear of the West Stand also to supervise a number of fans.
Between 2.00 - 2.30 p m , it was obvious there was a fairly large number of

fans outside the turnstiles without tickets.                                     During this time I was paying

particular attention                to       the       turnstiles, when               it    became       apparent       that    a

number of operators                were      taking payment.               I therefore             flitted between A-G

turnstiles, m t h           a view to catching them out.                           There were no real problems

at this time.

About     2.30    pm        there       was        a    large       number      of     fans       coming        through      the

turnstiles, nany of whom had been drinking but were not drunk.

Several      cans of        beer    and       lager       had been        ’binned’ in the             litter basket on

entry.       The aood of the majority of fans had changed and they were becoming

more aggressive.             The smell of drink was becoming more apparent.

At    this     tine,    I    noticed          radio          reception       was      ’poor’       and    virtually         non­

existent.         I was       not       in    a        position     to    receive          any    messages       because       of

interference on the radio and also crowd noise, which by this time had been

increased tresendously.

Our     serial Inspector,           Inspector White,                 was not present               from 2.30 pm and I

did not see M m until about 3-30 pm.

I was unable to estimate the number of fans on entering the ground who came

to me and said, "Someone is going to get killed out there".                                              A lot more were

abusive and threatening.                     The mood worsened between 2.30 - 2.45 pm.                                   There

appeared       to l>e    a    number          of       fans    having      difficulty             getting       through     the

turnstiles       because       of       the       sheer       weight      of    the        supporters.           I    did   not

consider       the seven        turnstiles              adequate       for      the    volume       and     I   did     notice

turnstile               which       was      the       one    closest      to Gate                  had    difficulty          in

operating.        Ofa closer            examination,            I   saw   that        it    was    a double          turnstile

which    was     separated         by     a' dividing           wooden         partition.           Bolted       on    to   the
 partition was large wooden blocks directly facing the turnstiles to prevent

 illegal entry.              The sheer weight on this partition had distorted it and the

 blocks had jammed against the turnstiles making them inoperative.                                           A number

 of fans had climbed over or under the turnstiles at the point.

 There    also        appeared      to    be    some     difficulty        with    turnstile                 A Police

 Officer        who    was    on   duty        outside     turnstile        ’G ’ was     in danger      of    getting

 crushed and I pulled him over the turnstile into the ground.

 I was     subjected to threats and obscenities                           from a number of Liverpool fans

 who    were     shouting,         "Get    fucking       out    there      and    get    something    done     before

 someone gets killed".               Their mood was aggressive and it was obvious they had

 been drinking.

 A    large    number of approximately twenty fans had climbed over the perimeter

 wall    onto     the    turnstile        roof.          Several    were     caught      and ejected.          Whilst

 ejecting one of these fans I saw a                         fattish Liverpool               supporter         hand a bundle

 of ticket stubs to one of the fans                         on the turnstile roof, who in turn                     threw

 them down to the crowd at the other                        side of the perimeter wall.

About 2.45 pm, Gate                ’C ’ opened and          about fifty fans burst through the gate.

I ran to the gate with Police Constable 1278 Lang and managed to secure the

gate, together with the stewards.

Despite       losing     radio      contact,         I   was    aware      that    the    situation     was        being

monitored by the CCTV camera positioned in the South side of the West Stand.

The     noise    was     tremendous,           the   mood      of   the    fans    near    kick   off    time       was

getting worse as they came through the turnstiles, many of whom would have

been     ejected       normally      for       their     attitude         caused    through    drink,        but    the

situation at this stage was not practicable.

Suddenly,       Gate     *C’ appeared           to burst       open     again,     approximately        2.50 pm       -

2.55    pm,    a large number of fans ran through into the centre tunnel of the
 Leppings Lane end.

 It     was    noticeable          at    this     time     that      the   situation     had     quietened    down

 considerably.

 Shortly       after 3.00 pm,             there    was    a radio/tannoy message that all               officers

 were required on the perimeter track.

 I took my serial onto the perimeter track via the rear of the Police Control

 into    the South Stand and over the wall.                          I instructed them to stay together

 as a serial because of the number of Police Officers who were on the field

 at that time and I went straight to perimeter fence at pen 3.                                    I saw a large

 bunch of people piled on top of each other against the wall and up against

 the    security      fencing.           The     number    3   gate was partially open and had been

 wedged       by    a number       of     bodies.         It   was    apparent    that    the     situation    was

 serious at this stage and speed was essential.                                I was unable to get through

 the    gate       because    of    the        bodies,    therefore,       I   climbed    onto    the   security

fencing and pulled several fans from the mass and over the fencing, together

with my serial.              The majority of these appeared in shock but were conscious.

I     then    went     to    the        gate    with     Chief    Superintendent         Nesbit    where,     with

di ff ic ul ty, managed to pull a number of bodies away from the gate until                                     it

could be opened fully.

We organised a chain of officers and dragged a great number of bodies from

this area.          Where there was a sign of life by checking the cartoid artery, I

attempted resuscitation and cardiac massage.

My serial was engaged in resuscitation and care of the bodies on the field.

I organised a number of Liverpool fans as stretcher bearers and they removed

the bodies to the gymnasium.

A number       of officers on my serial,                  ie, Police Constable 2887 Grant, Police

Constable      2819 McManus,             Police    Constable         1278 Lang, all were instructed to
 remain with the bodies.

 During       the     whole      incident          on    the    fieldI was not subjected                to threats   or

 abuse,       but     I    did     see    a       number      of flare-ups    mainly     by   fans who       had been

 drinking and were wandering about aimlessly.                                 This was understandable under

 the circumstances.                I did see a number of coins being thrown onto the field.

 A     lot     of     Police        Officers,            St     John's     Ambulancemen,       were       engaged    in

 resuscitation.            Many were shouting for oxygen, which was not forthcoming.

 Initially,          my   feelings were             of frustration because           I was unable          to get to

 the people because of the security fencing.                                Perhaps if I could have, we may

 have    been       able    to     save       a    lot   more     lives.     The   actual     gates      were wholly

 inadequate simply because                        there was not enough and the ones which are there

are too small.

When     the    ground was eventually emptied, I escorted the Liverpool fans with

my serial out the Leppings Lane end to the main roundabout on Penistone Road

before       returning        to    the gymnasium,              where three officers          on my serial were

involved in the sudden death reports.

At   7-20      pm,    I returned          to Claywheels Lane where some                  of the         serial had a

meal    as     we waited transportation to Barnsley.                          Police Constable 2887 Grant

was the only officer still engaged at that                               time with his    ’b o d y ’.

At 8.00 pm I retired from duty.

Understandably,            a number of my                serial were upset         by the     situation but all

credit       to them they did not show their emotion during the incident and all

performed creditably.

                    NOTTINGHAM FOREST - v - LIVERPOOL F.A. CUP SEMI FINAL

                    SATURDAY .   9 th   April, 1 9 8 8 .




                    On Saturday,the 9 th April,1988 , I was detailed to perform duties in respect
    of the F.A.Cup Semi-Final between Nottingham Forest and Liverpool at Hillsborough
    Football Ground, Sheffield.

                    I was part of the Police contingent from the Barnsley fixvi Sub Division which
    consisted of two serials those being Serials 11 and 13. There was an Inspector in charge
    of Sach serial ours being Inspector Hooley. My serial was made up of the Following;

    66£ial 13

    PS 13^1       Crawford
    PC 3198       Akred
    PC 2083       Packer

    PC 1278       Iang

    PC

                   The serial was paraded at 08^5 that date and conveyed to Hillsborough by Force
    Coach arriving at 0930. At 1000 I was briefed in the North Stand before taking up actual
    duties at the rear of the West Stand, I had deployed the officers in pairs. PC s
             a n d ___________ were depl^ed at the bottom of the stairs leading to the seated area
    in the West stand directly opposite Turnstiles 1-16:. PC's 12?8 Lang a n d w e r e
deployed,at the entrance to the West stand and nearest the Centce tunnel opposite
turnstiles A-G; The remainder of the serial were on general public order patrol in the
bar concourse in the West Stand and also the area behind the Leppings ^ane end inside the
ground.

                  The general behaviour and attitude of the fans on this date was very good with
the majority in the ground well before kick off time at 1500. I do recall some of the
fans had been drinking and were in a good humour. This was not a problem.
                  The only problem we did encounter was the number of Liverpool fans with tickets
for the terracing who attempted to get into the seated area of the w est Stand by using
tickets passed down to them by the fans in the Stand. We had anticipated this and the
four officers assisting the stewards at both entrances tore the corner of the tickets
on entrance to the West Stand so that they would know if the tickets had been passed
on to the Leppings i&ne terraces. This did not cause any problem            and   th P   fa n s   accepted

 their plan had been 'rumbled'.

           At 14.50 hours we had an instruction believed verbal, that no more fane were to
 be allowed in the central pens therefore the wooden gate at the rear of the tunnel was
 closed denying access. This was done by PC 1278 Lang.

           The game took place without incident and there was no arrsts by my serial.
           On conclusion of the game my serial supervised the fans leaving the groung and
 eventually we were deployed to remain at the junction with Catchbar Lane. The fans had been
 orderly and good humoured throughout the afternnoon not one member of my serial had cause
  to intervene, either before,during or after the match.

BARNSLEY DIVISIONAL HEADQUARTERS




At   9.00   am on Saturday    15 April   1989 , I reported at Barnsley Divisional

Headquarters together with a number of Police Constables also from the same

rota.    Our scale of duty was weekly leave but we had volunteered to work the

match.

I was in charge of serial 14 which was made up from the following officers

             PS 1341 Crawford

             PC   136 Smallman

             PC 1278 Lang

             PC 1002 Wild

             PC 2819 McManus

             PC 1777 Branston

             PC 2806 Butler

             PC   975 Washington

             PC 3232 Burton

             PC 3347 Thomas

Police Constable 1278 Lang and Police Constable 3347 Thomas replaced Police

Constable                and Police Constable            who were             and annual

leave respectively.

We   left   Barnsley   Divisional   Headquarters   at   9*15       am   and   arrived   at

Hillsborough Football Ground at approximately 9*40 am.
At 10.00 am this date, I attended the main briefing in the North Stand with

my     serial    where      we       were    briefed   by Chief Superintendent          Duckenfield      and

Inspector Sewell.                I    also met      Inspector White,        'F'   Division,   who was     in

command of serials 13 and 14 at the Leppings Lane end.

After a refreshments break, I reported to Leppings Lane end with my serial

at 11.00 am where we were briefed again by Inspector White who also covered

the emergency procedure.                    In the event of an emergency, Police Constable 975

Washington was to be deployed in the central tunnel.

Our terms of reference was the searching of fans coming through turnstiles

A-G at the rear of the West Stand, Leppings Lane end inside the ground, for

alcohol, weapons, etc.

We were in position at 11.15 am.

Several fans had started drifting into the ground by this time and I noticed

that there was about six fans                     in the centreNorth pen.

From then on until               approximately 2.00 pm,          there was agradual       increase of

fans coming into the ground.                      The majority were good humoured and friendly.

There was no problems at this                      stage, but Idid notice a number of supporters

outside the turnstiles attempting to enter the ground without a ticket.                                    I

saw money offered to several turnstile operators when I was present.                                    When

that    happened,          the   fans       did   an   about   turn   and   mingled    with    the   other

supporters who were queueing in an orderly manner outside.                            A few supporters

without tickets jumped the turnstiles and were ejected.

Approximately         at     2.00      pm,    I   deployed     Police   Constable      3232    Burton    to

supervise       the   programme         sellers     behind us because        of   the hassel    from the

supporters.       Police Constable 1002 Wild was deployed at the snack bar at the

rear of the West Stand also to supervise a number of fans.




                                                                                                               ft
                                                               - 3 -



Between 2.00 - 2.30 pm,                        it was obvious there was a fairly large number of

fans outside the turnstiles without tickets.                                       During this time I was paying

particular          attention tothe                 turnstiles,         when       it    became       apparent          that     a

number of operators                  were          taking payment.             I therefore flitted between A-G

turnstiles, with a view to catching them out.                                           There were no real problems

at this time.

About     2.30          pm       there     was          a large    number         of    fans         coming     through       the

turnstiles, many of whom had been drinking                                   but were          not     drunk.

Several     cans        of beer          and       lager had been            ’binned’in         the litter basket              on

entry.      The mood of the majority of fans had changed and they were becoming

more aggressive.                 The smell of drink was becoming more apparent.

At   this      time,         I    noticed           radio      reception       was       ’poor' and           virtually non­

existent.           I     was     not     in       a    position       to    receive any messages                because       of

interference on the radio and also crowd noise, which by this time had been

increased tremendously.

Our serial Inspector,                    Inspector White,              was not present               from 2.30 pm and I

did not see him until about 3*30 pm.

I was unable to estimate the number of fans on entering the                                                ground who came

to me and said,              "Someone is going to get killed out there".                                   A lot more were

abusive and threatening.                           The mood worsened between 2.30 - 2.45 pm.                                There

appeared       to       be   a     number          of fans        having     difficulty           getting       through       the

turnstiles          because        of     the          sheer   weight        of    the supporters.               I    did    not

consider       the seven           turnstiles adequate                 for     the      volume       and   I     did    notice

turnstile               |, which        was        the one     closest       to Gate, had difficulty in

operating.           On      closer       examination,             I   saw that          it was a double             turnstile

which    was     separated           by        a    dividing       wooden      partition.             Bolted on         to   the
t                                                            _   n   _




    partition was large wooden blocks directly facing the turnstiles to prevent

    illegal entry.             The sheer weight on this partition had distorted it and the

    blocks had jammed against the turnstiles making them inoperative.                                            A number

    of fans had climbed over or under the turnstiles at the point.

    There     also      appeared     to     be    some     difficulty with             turnstile                 A Police

    Officer       who    was    on   duty        outside    turnstile           ’G ’ was     in danger      of    getting

    crushed and I pulled him over the turnstile into the ground.

    I was subjected to threats and obscenities from a number of Liverpool fans

    who    were    shouting,         "Get    fucking out             there     and    get    something    done     before

    someone gets killed".              Their mood was aggressive and it was obvious they had

    been drinking.

    A large number of approximately twenty fans had climbed over the perimeter

    wall    onto     the    turnstile       roof.          Several       were    caught      and ejected.          Whilst

    ejecting one of these fans I saw a fattish Liverpool supporter hand a bundle

    of ticket stubs to one of the fans on the turnstile roof, who in turn threw

    them down to the crowd at the other side of the perimeter wall.

    About 2.45 pm, Gate              'C' opened and about fifty fans burst through the gate.

    I ran to the gate with Police Constable 1278 Lang and managed to secure the

    gate, together with the stewards.

    Despite     losing       radio    contact,        I    was       aware     that    the    situation     was    being

    monitored by the CCTV camera positioned in the South side of the West Stand.

    The    noise     was    tremendous, the              mood    of      the    fans   near    kick   off    time      was

    getting worse as they came through the turnstiles, many of whom would have

    been    ejected        normally       for     their     attitude         caused     through    drink,        but   the

    situation at this stage was not practicable.

    Suddenly,      Gate     'C'   appeared         to burst open again,                approximately        2.50 pm      -

    2.55 pm, a large number of fans ran through into the centre tunnel of the
Leppings Lane end.

It    was    noticeable        at     this    time    that      the   situation     had    quietened     down

considerably.

Shortly      after 3.00 pm,           there was a radio/tannoy message that all officers

were required on the perimeter track.

I took my serial onto the perimeter track via the rear of the Police Control

into the South Stand and over the wall.                         I instructed them to stay together

as a serial because of the number of Police Officers who were on the field

at that time and I went straight to perimeter fence at pen 3.                                I saw a large

bunch of people piled on top of each other against the wall and up against

the security          fencing.        The    number 3 gate was partially open and had been

wedged      by    a   number     of   bodies.        It   was    apparent    that    the     situation    was

serious at this stage and speed was essential.                            I was unable to get through

the   gate       because    of      the    bodies,    therefore,      I   climbed    onto    the   security

fencing and pulled several fans from the mass and over the fencing, together

with my serial.            The majority of these appeared in shock but were conscious.

I    then   went      to   the      gate     with    Chief   Superintendent         Nesbit    where,     with

difficulty, managed to pull a number of bodies away from the gate until it

could be opened fully.

We organised a chain of officers and dragged a great number of bodies from

this area.        Where there was a sign of life by checking the cartoid artery, I

attempted resuscitation and cardiac massage.

My serial was engaged in resuscitation and care of the bodies on the field.

I organised a number of Liverpool fans as stretcher bearers and they removed

the bodies to the gymnasium.

A number of officers on my serial, ie, Police Constable 2887 Grant, Police

Constable 2819 McManus,               Police Constable          1278 Lang, all were instructed to
 remain with the bodies.

 During the whole        incident       on the field I was not subjected to threats or

 abuse, but    I   did   see   a number      of    flare-ups    mainly   by    fans who had been

drinking and were wandering about aimlessly.                    This was understandable under

the circumstances.          I did see a number of coins being thrown onto the field.

A   lot   of   Police       Officers,      St      John's    Ambulancemen,     were   engaged   in

resuscitation.        Many were shouting for oxygen, which was not forthcoming.

Initially, my feelings were of frustration                    because I was unable to get to

the people     because of the security fencing.                Perhaps if I could have, we may

have   been    able    to   save    a   lot more    lives.      The   actual   gates were wholly

inadequate     simply because there was not enough and the ones which are there

are too small.

When the ground was eventually emptied,                 I escorted the Liverpool fans with

my serial out the Leppings Lane end to the main roundabout on Penistone Road

before returning to          the gymnasium, where three          officers on my       serial were

involved in the sudden death reports.

At 7-20 pm,     I returned to Claywheels Lane where some of the serial had a

meal   as we waited transportation to Barnsley.                  Police Constable 2887 Grant

was the only officer         still engaged at that             time with his 'body'.

At 8.00 pm I retired         from duty.

Understandably,       a number of my serial were upset by the situation but all

credit to them they did not show their emotion during the incident and all

performed creditably.

I am an          Inspector             in t h e       South Yorkshire             Police.

On    15 A p r i l         198 9 w h e n       I was       a uniformed           Sergeant        I performed

d u t y at       Hillsborough                Football         S t a d i u m on the        occasion           of    th e

semi     final match                  between         Liverpool        and N o t t i n g h a m       Forest.          I was

in c h a r g e        of    Serial          14 w h i c h w i t h      Serial      13 h e a d e d      by     Sergeant

was    under          the    command           of     Inspector White.

I had       performed             duty       at     Hillsborough            Football       S t a d i u m on m a n y

previous          occasions.                 In p a r t i c u l a r     I was     on d u t y     for       the     1 988

semi     final.             On    that       occasion         I was      in c h a r g e    of    a    serial        that

was    responsible                for       the West         Stand     seating       area.           One    of     the

officers          of m y         service          then,      Co n s t a b l e Lang,       had    been       deployed

at    the    steps          leading          f r o m the      concourse          behind     turnstiles              A - G

to    the    seating.                 His    role      had    been     to as sis t        Stewards          examining

seating          tickets          but       his     location         being    close       to the       blue wooden

gates       at    the       entrance          to     the     tunnel      near     the     stand       had     led him

at    one    stage          to c l o s e      one      half    of     the    gate    for    a period              from

about       2.45       pm,       I do       not     know how long            this was       for,       to     assist        in

the    prevention                of    further         persons        going down          the    tunnel           into

pens    3 and          4,    I presume              because      of c o n g e s t i o n    in    those        pens.         I

was    aware          that       Police       Constable          Lang       did this       although           it w a s

not    as    a result             of m y      o r d e r i n g h i m to do         so.      I believe             that      he

did    it as          a result          of    his      being     ordered         to this        by a       supervisory

officer          at    least          Inspector         rank.         I am unable          to    say which

officer          gave       the       order       or w h e t h e r    it w a s    done     orally          or v i a      the

radio.           I have a recollection,                        as     I told      the     Inquest,          of    going

to    see Constable            Lang          to    ensure          he had        carried         out      the    order      so

that     tends       to i n d i c a t e       that       I h e a r d the          order        being       given       so   it

probably was            given via             the       radio.

After       the match         I did          not    include             this     occurrence              in my

debriefing           notes     as       I did       not       consider           it t o b e         relevant.

On    15 A p r i l    1989     I was          present             at    the    briefings            given       by Chief

Superintedent              Duckenfield              and       Superintendent               Murray          and    to h i s

two    serials        by    Inspector White.                           I did     no t m e n t i o n       the    closure

of    the    tunnel        in 1 9 8 8        at    any       of    these       briefings            and    nor did

Constable        Lang who was                 one       of    the       officers making                  up my    serial

in    1989.

My    serial,        in a c c o r d a n c e        with       the operational                  order       published

for    the match,           had     specific             responsibilites.                      In p h a s e      one    prior

to    kick    off     these were              to    ensure             that    supporters            entering

through       turnstiles            A    - G were             not       in p o s s e s s i o n      of    prohibited

items       (banners,        missiles,              weapons,             alcohol)         and       also    to ensure

order       was maintained               on       the    terraces.

We    were    in p o s i t i o n        at    11.15          am on the          concourse            at    the   rear       of

turnstiles          A - G.

Several       fans     had    started              drifting            into     the      ground          by this       time

and    I noticed         that      there          was    about           six    f an s    in     the      centre    North

pen.

From    then    on until           approximately                    2 . 0 0 pm,       there was            a gradual

increase       of    f a ns c o m i n g       into       the        ground.           The m a j o r i t y were           good

humoured       and     friendly.              There          was       no problems             at   this     stage,         but

I did     notice     a number        of    supporters              outside the        turnstiles

a tte mp t i n g to enter          the    ground without                a ticket.            I saw money

offered      to se ve r a l       turnstile          operators when              I was       present.          When

that     happened,        the     fans    did    an     about       turn and m i n g l e d       With         the

other     supporters        who     were       queuing         in an o r d e r l y m a n n e r         outside.

A    few supporters         without        tickets            jumped the         turnstiles         and were

ejected.        Approximately             at    2.00 pm,           I deployed        Police      Constable

3232    B u r t o n to    supervise        the       programme         sellers       behind       us     because

of    the hassle         from the        supporters.              Police      Constable         1002 Wild

was    deployed      at    the    snack        bar     at     t h e r e a r of   the W e s t     Stand         also

to    supervise      a number        of    fans.

Between      2.00    - 2.30       pm,     it w a s      obvious        there was         a    fairly        large

number     of   fans      outside        the    turnstiles without                  tickets.           During

this    time    I was      paying        particular            attention to          the     turnstiles,

when    it b e c a m e    apparent        that       a n u m b e r of o p e r a t o r s      were      taking

payment.        I therefore         flitted           between A - G turnstiles,                        with        a

v i e w to cat c h i n g    them    out.         There         w ere no real        problems           at     this

time.

About    2.30 p m there           was     a large           n u m b e r of   fans   coming       through

the    turnstiles,         many    of    whom had            been drinking          but w e r e        no t

drunk.      Several        cans    of     beer   and         lager had       been     ' bi n n e d '    in t h e

litter    basket         on entry.        The mood            of th e m a j o r i t y      of   fans        had

changed     and   they were         becoming more                 aggressive.           The     smell         of

drink was       becoming more            apparent.              At this      time,      I noticed             radio

rec eption was           'poor'    and    virtually             non e x istent.           I was        not     in a

position          to rec e i v e    any messages              because       of     interference          on the

radio       and    also     crowd       noise,       which     by this        time had          increased

tremendously.

Our    serial       Inspector,           Inspector White,               was      not    present        from 2.30

pm and       I did     not    see       him again          until    about        3 . 30 pm.

I was       unable     to    estimate          the    number       of   fans      on e n t e r i n g    the

ground who          came     to me       and    said,       "Someone        is    going       to get     killed

out    there."         A lot mo re were               abusive       and     threatening.               The m ood

worsened          between     2.30       - 2 . 4 5 pm.         There       appeared          t o be    a number

of    fans    having difficulty                 getting        through        the      turnstiles        because

of    the    sheer weight           of    the      supporters.             I did       not    consider        the

seven       turnstiles        adequate          for t he v o l u m e        and     I did      notice

turnstile                 which was          the     one    closest        to G ate               had

difficulty          in o p e r a t i n g .      On    closer       examination,              I s a w t h at    it

was    a double        turnstile          which was          separated           by a d i v i d i n g w o o d e n

Partition.           Bolted        on    to the       partition was              large wooden blocks

directly          facing     the    turnstiles             to prevent         illegal         entry.      The

sheer weight           on    this       partition          had distorted            it a n d     the    blocks

had    jammed       against        the    turnstiles making                them        inoperative.           A

number       of    fans     had    climbed         over     or u n d e r   the      turnstiles          at t h e

point.

There    also       appeared        to    be    some difficulty w ith                  turnstile                    A

danger      of     getting        crushed and          I pulled         h im over        the    turnstile

into    the       ground.         I was      subjected        to t h r e a t s     and    obscenities

 from a number             of      Liverpool         fans       who were         shouting,         "Get    fucking

 out   there       and     get       something done               before        someone      gets    killed."

 Their      mood was           aggressive           and    it w a s      obvious       they had          been

drinking.

A    large       number      of     approximately               twenty       fans h a d      climbed       over    the

perimeter wall               onto the          turnstile           roof.        Several       were       caught    and

ejected.           Whilst          ejecting         one    of    these       f an s   I saw a fattish

Liverpool          supporter            hand a bundle              of    ticket       stubs       to one    of t h e

fans       on    the    turnstile           ro o f , who        in t u r n    threw t hem down             to the

crowd       at    the    other        side     of    the    p e r i m e t e r wall.

About       2 . 4 5 pm,      Gate       'C'    opened       and     about       fifty       fans    burst

through          the    g a te .      I rari t o      the       gate     with Police          Constable         1 2 78

Lang     and managed               to s e c u r e    the    gate,        together with             the    Stewards.

Despite          losing      radio       contact,          I was        aware    that       the    situation was

being monitored                by     the     CCTV camera           positioned          in    the    South      side

of    the West          Stand.

The    noise      was      tremendous,              the    mood     of    the    fans       near    k i c k off

time was         getting worse                as    they    came       through        the    turnstiles,          many

of w h o m w o u l d      have       been ejected            normally           for    their       attitude

caused      through         drink,          but     the    situation         at t h i s      stage was       not

practicable.

Suddenly,         Gate      'C'      appeared         to    burst        open    again,      approximately

2.50 p m        - 2.55 pm,           a large        number        of     fans    ran    through       into the

centre      tunnel        of    the Leppings               Lane    end.

It w a s    noticeable             at   this       time     that       the   situation         had    quietened

down    considerably.

Shortly       after     3.00     pm,   there w a s    a radio/tannoy message         that   all

officers       were     required       on t h e   perimeter    track.

Throughout         this       tour   of d u t y I w a s   equipped with    a Police    radio

and    an e a r p i e c e .     Reception was        very poor   and there was

considerable          interference.           The    situation was      aggravated    by

crowd     noise.




* I did not hear any order given over the radio or verbally to
"Open the gates."

* I heard no radio message and was not otherwise told that the

question of opening the gates was being considered.

* I was not asked my view of the likely consequences of opening

Gate 'C' and I heard no one else asked for their view.

* I was not warned to make preparations to direct the crowd from

going into pens 3 and 4 via the tunnel.

* I was not asked my location, manpower availability or barrier
availability prior to Gate 'C' being opened.

* After Gate 'C' had been opened I heard no instruction to

prevent the crowd going into the tunnel.

When giving evidence to the Inquest I was asked whether if I had

been asked I would have been able to prevent the crowd entering

"the tunnel.          I indicated then that I believed it would have been
possible to close the tunnel in a matter of moments.

* Paragraph required here to explain Page 3 of document R170, ie

normally we have had a serial at the centre tunnel to direct to

the North or South pens when the centre pens had been filled.

This was not the case at this match and several of my serials

remarked on this.

BARNSLEY DIVISIONAL HEADQUARTERS




At   9.00    am   on   Saturday   15   April   1989,   I   reported   at   Barnsley   Divisional

Headquarters      together with a number of Police Constables also from the same

rota.    Our scale of duty was weekly leave but we had volunteered to work the

match.

I was in charge of £                    which was made up from the following officers:-




Police Constable                       and Police Constable                     replaced Police

Constable                     and Police Constable                 who were sick and annual

leave respectively.

We    left    Barnsley     Divisional      Headquarters      at   9.15     am   and   arrived   at

Hillsborough Football Ground at approximately 9-^0 am.
At    10.00 am this date,            I attended the main briefing in the North Stand with

my    serial    where      we   were        briefed       by    Chief    Superintendent           Duckenfield          and

Inspector       Sewell.         I    also    met     Inspector         White,     'F'      Division,     who     was    in

command of serials 13 and 14 at the Leppings Lane end.

After    a refreshments             break,    I reported          to Leppings      Lane end with my serial

at    11.00 am where we were briefed again by Inspector White who also covered

the emergency procedure.                   In the event of an emergency,                    Police Constable

                was to be deployed in the central tunnel.

Our     terms   of reference          was     the searching of fans               coming through turnstiles

A-G at the rear of the West Stand, Leppings Lane end inside the ground, for

alcohol, weapons,          etc.

We were in position at 11.15 am.

Several     fans had started drifting into the ground by this time and I noticed

that there was about six fans in the centre North pen.

From     then on until          approximately            2.00    pm,    there   was     a gradual        increase of

fans     coming   into     the ground.             The majority were good humoured and friendly.

There was no problems at this stage, but I did notice a number of supporters

outside     the   turnstiles          attempting to enter the ground                        without      a ticket. I

saw money       offered     to several             turnstile      operators when            I was present.             When

 that    happened,        tne       fans     did    an    about     turn    and    mingled        with     the     other

 supporters who were queueing in an orderly manner outside.                                       A few supporters

without tickets jumped the turnstiles and were ejected.

Approximately         at    2.00       pm,     I     deployed       Police      Constable                               to

 supervise      the   programme            sellers       behind    us   because       of    the   hassel       from    the

 supporters.       Police Constable                                 tfas deployed at the snack bar at the

 rear of the West Stand also to supervise a number of fans.
Between 2.00             - 2.30          pm,    it was        obvious      there was a fairly large number of

fans outside             the turnstiles                without       tickets.          During this time I was paying

particular       attention                to     the       turnstiles,          when        it    became        apparent        that    a

number    of     operators               were    taking        payment.          I     therefore          flitted between A-G

turnstiles,          with a view                to catching them out.                    There were no real problems

at this time.

About     2.30        pm      there            was     a     large       number        of     fans       coming          through     the

turnstiles, many of                      whom had been drinking but were                           not        drunk.

Several      cans        of       beer    and        lager    had    been       'binned' in           the     litter basket            on

entry.       The mood of the majority of fans had changed and they were becoming

more aggressive.                  The smell of drink was becoming more apparent.

At    this     time,          I       noticed        radio     reception          was        'poor'       and       virtually        non­

existent.            I     was           not    in     a     position      to receive any messages                        because of

interference             on the radio and also crowd noise,                                 which by this time had been

increased tremendously.

Our   serial         Inspector,            Inspector White,               was     not       present       from 2.30 pm and I

did not see him until about 3-30 pm.

I was unable             to estimate             the number of fans on entering the ground who came

to me and said,               "Someone is going to get killed out there".                                        A lot more were

abusive      and threatening.                        The mood worsened between 2.30 - 2.45 pm.                                     There

appeared        to       be       a    number        of    fans      having       difficulty             getting         through       the

turnstiles           because              of     the       sheer     weight of         the supporters.                      I   did not

consider        the       seven          turnstiles          adequate       for        the       volume       and    I    did   notice

turnstile        'G' , which              was        the     one    closest       to    Gate       'C' , had         difficulty         in

operating.            On      closer           examination,          I    saw     that       it    was    a     double      turnstile

which     was        separated            by     a    dividing        wooden         partition.               Bolted      on    to     the
partition was          large wooden blocks                 directly      facing the turnstiles                 to prevent

illegal       entry.       The sheer weight on this partition had distorted it and the

blocks    had jammed against                  the turnstiles making them inoperative. A number

of fans had climbed over or under the turnstiles at the point.

There    also       appeared       to    be    some       difficulty         with     turnstile       'A'.         A Police

Officer       who    was    on     duty       outside      turnstile          'G'    was     in    danger     of    getting

crushed and I pulled him over the turnstile into the ground.

I was     subjected to           threats       and obscenities            from a number of Liverpool                      fans

who    were     shouting,        "Get     fucking         out    there       and     get    something        done    before

someone gets killed".                   Their mood was aggressive and it was obvious they had

been drinking.

A large       number       of approximately twenty                    fans had climbed over              the perimeter

wall    onto     the    turnstile         roof.           Several      were     caught       and     ejected.         Whilst

ejecting one of these fans I saw a fattish Liverpool supporter hand a bundle

of ticket stubs to one of the fans on the turnstile roof, who in turn threw

them down to the crowd at the other side of the perimeter wall.

About 2.45 pm,          Gate       'C' opened and about fifty fans burst through the gate.

I ran to the gate with Police Constable                                              and managed to secure the

gate, together with the stewards.

Despite       losing       radio    contact,          I    was    aware       that    the     situation        was     being

monitored by the CCTV camera positioned in the South side of the West Stand.

The     noise    was       tremendous,         the     mood      of    the    fans     near       kick   off       time    was

getting worse          as they       came      through the            turnstiles,      many of whom would have

been     ejected       normally         for     their      attitude          caused        through    drink,        but    the

situation at this stage was not practicable.

Suddenly,       Gate       'C'   appeared        to burst         open    again,       approximately           2.50       pm   -

2.55    pm,     a large      number       of    fans      ran    through into         the centre tunnel of the
                                                           -    5   -




Leppings Lane end.

It    was    noticeable           at       this    time        that     the   situation          had     quietened     down

considerably.

Shortly      after       3*00    pm,       there    was    a radio/tannoy               message    that     all   officers

were required on the perimeter track.

I took my serial onto the perimeter track via the rear of the Police Control

into    the South Stand and over the wall.                                I instructed them to stay together

as a serial because               of the number of Police Officers                          who were on the field

at that time and I went straight to perimeter fence at pen 3.                                              I saw a large

bunch of people               piled on top of each other against                          the wall and up against

the    security         fencing.           The    number       3 gate       was       partially    open and had been

wedged       by    a    number        of   bodies.         It       was    apparent       that     the     situation    was

serious      at this stage and speed was essential.                                   I was unable to get through

the    gate       because       of     the    bodies,          therefore,         I    climbed     onto     the   security

fencing and pulled several                       fans from the mass and over the fencing,                         together

with my serial.                The majority of these appeared in shock but were conscious.

I     then    went       to     the    gate       with    Chief         Superintendent            Nesbit    where,     with

difficulty,            managed    to pull a number of bodies                          away from the gate until           it

could be opened fully.

We organised a chain of officers                          and dragged a great number of bodies                         from

this area.             Where    there was a sign of life by checking the cartoid artery, I

attempted resuscitation and cardiac massage.

My    serial was engaged in resuscitation and care of the bodies on the field.

I organised a number of Liverpool fans as stretcher bearers and they removed

the bodies to the gymnasium.

A number          of officers          on my serial,            :

                                                                                            kll were instructed to
remain with the bodies.

During     the       whole     incident         on      the    field   I was    not    subjected       to   threats or

abuse,     but       I   did      see   a    number       of    flare-ups      mainly      by   fans    who   had been

drinking and were wandering about aimlessly.                                   This was understandable under

the circumstances.                  I did see a number of coins being thrown onto the field.

A    lot       of    Police         Officers,            St    John's     Ambulancemen,          were       engaged   in

resuscitation.             Many were shouting for oxygen, which was not forthcoming.

Initially,          my    feelings         were    of    frustration because            I was unable          to get to

the people because of the security fencing.                                Perhaps if I could have, we may

have     been       able     to     save    a     lot    more    lives.        The    actual    gates were       wholly

inadequate          simply because              there was not enough and the ones which are there

are too small.

When     the    ground       was     eventually          emptied,      I escorted the Liverpool               fans with

my serial out the Leppings Lane end                              to the        main roundabout on Penistone Road

before        returning        to    the    gymnasium,           where three      officers      on my       serial were

involved in the sudden death reports.

At   7.20      pm,       I returned         to Claywheels          Lane   where       some   of the     serial had     a

meal     as    we waited          transportation to Barnsley.                    Police Constable

was the only officer still engaged at that time                                with his 'body'.

At 8.00 pm I retired from duty.

Understandably,              a number        of my       serial    were    upset      by   the situation but all

credit        to them they did not show their emotion during the incident and all

performed creditably.

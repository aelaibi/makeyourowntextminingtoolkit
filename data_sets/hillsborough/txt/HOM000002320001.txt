Ev a n s ,    620     Yates,         Cerrone         and      Duffy        took    up     their     specific             duties

outside         of     the     turnstiles.                The     time      n ow was       approximately                  11.15        a.m

although           the     turnstiles             w e r e n ’t d u e       to be     opened       until        11.45          a.m.         I

was     working          in c o m p a n y       with      Police       Constable           115    Huckstepp              at     turnst

•A’.

At     this     time       there       were       only     a small          number       of     fans      in   the        immediate

vicinity.             Even        when      the    turnstiles              were    open       there were            only        a smah

number        of     Liverpool            fans     entering.               The    mood     at    this      time was             happy

with many            fans     joking with               us,     at    this       time    it w a s      possible           to searcl

every person               entering          through          our     turnstile.              However,         as    time w e n t

on     it w a s      very     noticeable             to m e       that      although          there     were        an

increasing            number         of     fans     arriving,             many    were       choosing         to    sit       o u t side

t he    ground        or     stand        away     from       the g r o u n d      at    Leppings         Lane,          even        at

this     point        it o n l y       appeared          to be a           'normal'        match.

It w a s      noticeable             though        that w h e n        a prisoner           needed        escorting              to       the

gymgnasium            area,         it m e a n t     two m e n        leaving        the      turnstile         a r ea.          To

escort        fans       to o u r     control           a r ea,      the    gymnasium           exit    gate        'B*       ha d    to

be     opened        to a l l o w      us    through.

Although,           due      to     the w o r k     being         carried         out,     I was       unaware           of    time

throughout,              I believe           at    about        2.15       p.m.    I escorted           a Liverpool                  fan

to     the    g y n m a s i u m he        had     had    his      ticket,        stolen     and     only       possessed              the

ticket        stub.

We     went     through           exit      gate     ’B ’ to get            to    the    gymnasium,            at    this        time          t

crowd        outside        was      still        growing,           although       people were            still          jo v i a l

and     it w a s      still         in o r d e r     to s e a r c h        virtually        every person                 entering

the     ground.

It h a d      been       a surprise             to s e e      the n u m b e r      of L i v e r p o o l    fans       who       had

around        the     ground,         it w a s      also       noticeable           that m a n y       fans,        especially

However,        despite           it     only      being       some       lb m i n u t e s           I had    been       a w a y , the

steward        at    tn e    exit        gate      refused          to    allow me             back     through          s h o w i n g me

the    number       of      people        outside.             At    that       t i me        X thought           it w a s      guite

astounding           th e    numbers          that       had      arrived           in s u c h        a short       space         of    time

Understanding               the     reason         for    not       being       allowed              outside       the     ground           via

outside.

Once     outside          again        I managed           to g e t       to    the       railings           by    turnstiles               A-G

bu t    felt    quite        helpless            as     there       was        no p o s s i b l e      w a y of     returning

to a      turnstile,           there         appeared          to be           so m a n y fans         to    so     f ew

Policemen.               It w a s      now    that       a superior             officer,              although          I ’m n o t      sure

who,      i n s t r u c t e d me       to go       to    the w r o u g h t          iron p e r i m e t e r         gates         facing

Leppings        Lane        to e n s u r e       that      the      gate       closest           to    the    river        was     kept

shut.

j      along    with        all     but      two      of m y      serial,           did       no t    possess       any         personal

radios.

 I noticed          that     there were               two m e m b e r s        of    the       Police M o un t e d              Section

trying       to s t o p      the       crushing          t ha t     was    occurring.                 However,          the      horses

were making              little         i m pact,       in f a c t       the    c r ow d was           getting          very      angry

at     th e w a y    they were             jumping         about.

 The    crowd       at     this     point        were      getting          very         heated        as    time was            getting

 Policemen          actually working                    the    turnstiles.                    I nd eed,      with       the      amount

 of p e o p l e     outside            it w o u l d     have      been      virtually                impossible            to    turn

 anyone       away who         had       g o t through            to     a turnstile.

 The     perimeter            gate     I was       at w a s       shut      after        a struggle,               the        idea b e i n g

  that       if ali     the         perimeter        gates        were      shut,          the c r u s h by          the

 t u rn s tiles       wouid         be e a s e d    however,            fans        just      outside         these          gates        were

 by n o w g e t t i n g        v e r y irate,        shouting            and        some      hurling         abuse          towards            us

 Unfortunately,                it c o u l d    be     seen        that      there w e r e            a number           of     young

 children        in tins            crowd     outside          the      gates        and       I feared           for     their          safet

 Immediately           to m y r i g h t        was       a wrought             iron      fence followed                   by a

 crowd was          g-radually p u s h i n g             harder         an d    on n u m e r o u s         occasions              I was

 having       difficulty holding                    this       gate       shut.          I w a s by m y s e l f              on     this

 gate.        It w a s        noticeable           t h at    large        numbers            of p e o p l e       although

 possessing           tickets,          did NOT know where                      that         part     of     the g r o u n d wa s

 and many were                unable       to get        out      of    the c r o w d         to get         to    that       p ar t      of

 the g r o u n d     after          being     instructed               on w h e r e      they        s h o u l d be.

At     one    point       I    allowed my            perimeter             gate       to be o p e n e d            to a l l o w a

 father       and    hi s      young               son      and    a pregnant                 woman        to go        t h r o u gh ,         the c

at     this p o i n t         held    back    and a l lo w e d            them       through before                 pushing              again

when     the g a t e          was    shut.

The     time m u s t        now have         been        getting         close          to    th r e e     o ’c l o c k      an d       1 felt

a surge.            I was       unable       to h o l d        the      gate     shut,            but m a d e     sure        that        I

was     pushed       behind          the    fencing         to m y       right.              At    this     point         I wa s

fearful        for m y        own     s a f e t y but       there was            a greater               fear     for

s u p p o r t e r s ’ safety          as    they c ru s he d            through         the gate.               Somehow             I

managed        to s h u t      the     gate    ag ai n ,       but       increasingly more                      and m or e              fans

were     climbing         over        fencing        to m y       left w h i c h           runs       parallel            to the

river,       in o r d e r      to ge t       round       the p e r i m e t e r          gates.            I also        witnessed

numerous        people         climbing        on     the w a l l         between             turnstiles           1-16        and

t u r n s t i l e s A-G,       gaining        e ntry by g oi ng                o v er    this wall.

Soon     after      the       first        surge     there was            a great            surge,         I was       thrown

behind       fencing          to m y    right       as      the g a t e w a s           forced open and                   I s a w the

 Peopie were               failing           to. tne       fl oor      as    tne    r u sh of       people        pushed          them

 over,         now    i wa s       extremely             aware       tnat     there w e r e         going        to be some

On a coupl e               of    occasions            I moved          across my          gateway         area        to    try an d

hold      the        crowd       back        to g i v e     these       people       chance         to get        up.

However,             the    ones        on     the g r o u n d d i d n ' t         seem      to r e a l i s e     the       vast

numbers          pushing           ind-eed,         I witnessed              on e m a n w h o h a d         f a l l e n over,

not      from my           serial,           was    present.            We    urged people              to c a l m d o w n a n d           toi

towards          the       turnstile            area.           I was       amazed     how quickly               s u c h a large

number         of     peopie           had    cleared           from    the    area       outside         the W e s t         Stand

turnstiies.                 Only        a few peopie              remained,          looking          for    shoes          and    other

i t ems     of       property           they had           lost      in the        surge.

As     I looked            towards           the g r o u n d ,      I saw       that      EXIT GATE          ’C ’ h a d b e e n

o p e n ed .         I felt       some        relief        as    I was       in no d o u b t         that       if    this h a d n ' t

opened many people                       would        have       died       outside.

As     I walked           round with               other        officers       outside         of     t u r n s t i l e s A - G , the

general          comments              were     of h o w q u i c k l y        the a r e a      had cleared.                   It w a s

now     I heard           th e    first         tannoy message                I had h eard            ail    a f t e r no on and

that w a s          for    the         fans    at    the      Leppings         Lane     e nd     to s t o p p u s h i n g .

Believing            it w a s          a message           for    those       outside,         I thought              that     it w a s       a

bi t    late        for    that,         but       it w a s      obviously meant               for     those          i n s i d e as

after      a few moments,                     it w a s      heard       on p e r s o n a l     radios        possessed            by

some      officers          that         all     officers         were        required         inside        the g r o u n d .

I made my way               i n to       th e g r o u n d ,      around        the     rear      of    the W e s t         Stand       onto

    I was met         with    the        signt           of    a large       number        of     Policemen          stood       up

    against      the    fencing              of     tne W e s t       Stand       terrace'obviously yelling                           a nd

 urging         supporters             to go         oackwards.              on     the p i t c h      there were          numerous

 peopie         obviously          injured.

 Due     to     the    numbers           of P o l i c e m e n at           the      fencing        1 stayed          on   the p i t c h

with       injured          peopie many                  struggling          to b r e a t h e .         I comforted             as m a n y

as     I could         but    it            was     becoming          apparant           that     as m o r e w e r e      being

brought          onto       the    pitch            the       injuries      were       g e t t i n g wo r s e .      The medic al

 facilities            at    the            time     appeared           inadequate,             but no     organisation could

envisage          what       was       happening.

 I remember            comforting                 on e    supporter         and      on    looking        up,     seeing        a dead

body pulled             onto       the p i t c h a f t e r             that       it w a s      one a f t e r     another.

Liverpool             supporters who were                           injured began            to rip a d v e r t i s e m e n t

boards          out    to u s e        as m a k e s h i f t         stretchers,            a nd    I then assi s te d             to

transfer          the d e a d          bodies            to the      other        e n d of      the pitch.             Some     fans

s t il l      preferred           to    s n ou t         abuse      towards        us.

The     Nottingham            Forest              fans were          still        c h a n t i n g at     the    liverpool             fans

causing          some       annoyance,              making          it n e c e s s a r y     for a P o l i c e       barrier           to

be p l a c e d        across       the pitch.                  However,        when        I joined         this     cordon,           the

movement          of    injured             and dead was               well    underway.

At     5 .3 0   p.m.        I returned              to the          North     Stand        to w ai t      further

instructions,               before           doing         so,      I collected            names       and a d d r e s s e s     of

some       people       stood          on    the         Leppings       Lane       terrace        and     handed       them       to a

collecting             Sergeant.              At     this        time      the g a m e     had been            called      off       an d

most       supporters          had          gone     from        the gr o u n d .

TO     SUMMARISE

            On g et ti ng        into       the      stadium       from Leppings             Lane,     tne       supporters        were

            had     just    hit       the       crossbar        w hich wiii       obviously           have       cause     excitement

            amongst        the       cr o wd .       As w i t h    all    late    entrants          to f o o t b a l l m a t c h e s ,

            when     the      crowd        are     excited,        peopie       rush      to the n e a r e s t        area     to see

            what     is g o i n g         on.      In t h i s c a s e     I believe          the c r u s h       f r o m ou t s i d e ,    a

             deaths      would         have       occurred        outside       the g r o u n d .       The      decision        to o p e n

             the    gate      was      in m y       opinion,        the   only     one      possible.

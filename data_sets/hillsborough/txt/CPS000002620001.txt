plea rejected
FAMILIES of the Hillsborough disaster victims have beentold that
there is no chance of Jack Straw changing his mind and ordering a
fresh inquiry into the tragedy. The Home Secretary yesterday broke
off from visiting a party conference in Southport, Merseyside for an
unscheduled hour-long m eeting w ith 11 m em bers ot tne
Hillsborough Family Support Group.
   Thev are angry sifter his recent Commons announcement dashed
 houes of a new legal probe into the circumstances surrounding the
 96 deaths a t the FA Cup semi-final in 1989. The decision was in line
 with the recommendation of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith who had
 been asked by Mr Straw to conduct an ‘independent scrutiny of all
 the evidence. Outside yesterday’s meeting, chanting protesters
 mounted a noisy demonstration with banners, posters and pictures
 of their dead loved ones.                    .              ,    , . __
   Support group chairm an Trevor Hicks, whose teenage daughters
 Victoria and Sarah died in the disaster, said they had pointed out
 flaws in Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s report but Mr Straw had been
 adamant there would be no new inquiry. Mr Hicks said: Obviously
  we are disappointed that he said he would not change his mind but
  he has listened to us and he has agreed to meet us again in Liverpool
 ^A lthough the families had accepted to a degree’ that there would
 be no new inquiry, Mr Hicks said they were still unhappy with the
 inquest’s accidental death verdict. ‘The minimum action we want
 now is the quashing of the inquest verdict of accidental death.

         damning. He said:

     met by all our beef suppliers, whether in the UK or other European

LABOUR leader Tony B lair today
declares w ar on sleaze by vowing to
sack Labour MPs hit by cash scandals.
  In. an exclusive interview w ith The
Mirror, he said any member of his gov­
ernment caught taking bungs or back­
handers will be fired immediately.
   And any backbench MP discovered
to have pocketed cash for asking par­
                                                                                       Moment w e caught com ic
liamentary questions will be dumped.
  M r B lair’s hardline is in sharp con­
trast to Prem ier John M ajor’s dither­
ing over his scandal-hit party.
   Today M r Blair starts his election
tour of B ritain which he hopes will
end a t No 10. He insisted Labour will
not resort to negative campaigning.

    clear about this. Paying one’s fair share of tax is
    not merely a civic duty, it’s a fine and noble thing.
    A fter all, w h o a m o n g st u s h a sn ’t felt a w arm thrill o f v irtu e
    at th e sig h t o f th e d e d u c tio n s from ou r m o n th ly pay slip?
    O n the other hand, m aking a few bob w ith ou t the taxm an taking a
    huge chunk o f it isn ’t such an u npleasant th o u g h t either, is it?
    Which is why it’s well worth your while popping into Barclays just now. We’ve declared the kind

    of tax-free zone around some of our sayings plans which should make even a dyed-red-in-the-

    wool Marxist’s heart beat a little faster. For instance, did you know that as a higher rate taxpayer,

    you could earn up to 66%* extra on your savings with one of our range of tax-free savings plans?
    A nd even i f you pay tax at a lower or basic rate, they could earn you an extra 25%. Suppose you saved £9,000 at, say, 6%+ interest,

    earning you £540. W ith an ordinary savings account, the taxman w ould want £216 o f that from a higher rate payer. Whereas w ith

    one o f our plans, you get to keep every penny o f your p ro fit. A nd it ’s all perfectly legal, so your conscience can sleep perfectly

    soundly at night. I f we were you (which o f course, out o f banking.hours, we are), we’d pop into our nearest Barclays branch or ring

    0800 400 100 absolutely free, to fin d out m ore about our tax-free savings plans. A nd le t                                                                                                                                                             ^

    THE HOUSE DETECTIVES, BBC2,8pm
    IF THERE'S something wrong in
    your neighbourhood who ya
    gonna call? House detectives?
    Ghostbusters might be more
    suited to tonight’s investigation
    with Juliet Morris in Essex, where
    the owners of two houses are
    worried about evil spirits.




                       PEAK PRACTICE, ITV, 9pm
                       ONLY dear Dr Shearer (Adrian Lulds)
                       seems blind to his wife's increasingly       J

                       irrational behaviour. But when he
                       receives some shocking news that
                       threatens his family and puts the life
                       of a patient at risk, he is finally forced
                       to turn to his colleagues for help.




     EMMERDAIE, ITV, 7pm
     CONTRARY to popular belief it’s
     never quiet in the country, par­
     ticularly in Emmerdale where
     concern is high over the iden­
     tity of the abandoned baby.
     And murder suspect Frank Tate
     (Norman Bowler) now feels
     betrayed by his family.

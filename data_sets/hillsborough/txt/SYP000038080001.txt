            Dear Mr Dear

            May I, on behalf of the Chief Constable, forward the attached
            letter and copy acknowledgement for your information.

            I believe that the officers referred to, who returned property
            to        , were from your enquiry team and as such you may wish
                                                                                                            ’       nA’
            to make them aware of the contents of the letter.

            Yours sincerely

   Dear

   Thank you for your letter of 29 July and for the kind comments you
   made about my officers.

   I am deeply moved by the fact that you felt able to write following
   the tragic events at Hillsborough and the grief that you and your
   family must be enduring.

   I will ensure that your letter is brought to the attention of the
   officers you mention who will undoubtedly share the sentiments I have
   expressed.

   Yours sincerely

                     I was appointed a Constable of the Sheffield and Rotherham

                     Constabulary on 19' January 1973, and after            initial traintn'jlw^te

                     posted to Attercliffe Division,           I remained ther^' until October             1974

                     during which time      I worked many times at Hillsborough*               On© of the

                     occasions was a semi       final when I worked on Peniston'e R o a d -with the

                     Newcastle supporters.        Even though they had a bad reputation it^i/as -a

                     family day out and I spent the Whole of the match                       with the

                     supporters    in the North Stand.                               - .V;

                     In October    1974,   I was transferred to the H a c k e n t f m r p e S u b Division

                     of the South Yorkshire Police and I remained there until April                       1989.

                     Throughout this period I have worked in uniform at all                   the football

                     grounds    in the South Yorkshire Police area,          but-. aa^n.lV'/*^:i'''Braroa.'ri

                     Lane and Hillsborough.        I would imagine that throughout my service I

                     have performed duties at a 10,0 plus football matches.                   I have worked

                     about 3 or 4 semi finals at Hillsborough.             The last being in April

                     1988 between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.               I worked on a static

                     point on Penistone Road and I did not encounter any trouble.

                     I worked at Hillsborough on one occasion,            which I think was a s e m i

                     final a number of years ago when a part of the wall                 in front of the

                 ’       Spion Hop collapsed.      I do not know why it did collapse but- together

                         with other officers the situation was      contained and the crowd was

                         moved away from the wall and we then formed a cordon across the

                         damaged area.  We worked on the Spion Hop side of the wall sandwiched
                               ■v,                                           .■    •       ,.
                         between the damage and the crowd. At no time was there  any violence

                         towards me or my fellow officers       on this occasion. As   I've said I

                         think that it was a semi final but it could have been smother major

                         football match.

                         When I have worked at Hillsborough I have usually ^ o r ^ d (qflgi tfre Spion

                         Kop or the Psnistone Road side of the ground,       but I have forked on

                         Leppings Lane and the surrounding area,       but not at Lepptngs Laiie

                         turnstiles, .

                         I think that during my service I have worked every duty a uniformed

                         Police Constable would work at a        Football match.

                         I commenced duty at Hackenthorpe       Police Station at 8>30 am Saturday,

                         II April   1989, and I was    immediately contacted by PS Payne who

                         informed me that I was to work under him on ssr ial       14 on the Lejfpings

                         Lane turnstile.     He informed me basically my duties and w© were t h e n 1

                         conveyed to the ground in a rented double decker bus.      When I         .

                         commenced my duties I was not issued with a personal railio, nor was I

                         given one later that d a y .

                         yhen we arrived at the ground we went to the North St^od,           on the       /

                         numbered seats assigned our serial awaiting a briefing which was

                         conducted on the main by Ch. S u p t . Duckenf ie1d , but .with assistance

                         of other officers,8'

                         After this,   briefly Insp. Purdy spoke to me about the duties while we

                         consumed breakfast on the North S t a n d .   W© also spoke '■About our

                         personal   lives as W e   have known each other for a number of years and

                         have in fact worked at football matches together.

                         After this we went to the Leppings Lane side of the ground where all
         our duties,        for the full match were explained to us.              I was present
*   ''


         there when Insp. Sykes gave us a brief outline of the overall, duties

         at that, side of the ground.

         I knew what my duties were for the full match and prior to my taking

         position outside the turnstiles             I went    into the West Stand to look at

         the lay out as        I was to go there and perform duties after the kick off

         Having don© this I returned to behind the stand where I joined my

         col l ea gu es .

         Prior to us taking our duties up,              I went together ^ith                 Yates.
                                                                                  vrr _ ■
         to the sweet shop situated on Leppings Lane between the entrances

         and Vere Road.         After   purchasing some sweets I had a Very short

         conversation with a girl behind the counter who told me that some of

         the Liverpool        fans had arrived outside the ground about 7.43 M                 that

         morning and some of them had been consuming cans of alcohol.                        She did

         say that they had not          caused any t r o u b l e .

         Upon returning to turnstiles A to G I- took up my position outside

         turnstiles D and E.

         Obviously I was aware that we were searching supporters for offensive

         weapons and also enforcing the law relating to alcohol                    in particular

         persons attempting to gain entry with drink or if they were drunk.

         There was a dribble of people coming through the turnstiles about

         12 noon and it was possible to search nearly everyone coming through.

         The majority of these early supporters were families,                    fathers,    sons

         and the like.

         1   noticed on one occasion that a Liverpool                supporter,   a white male

         probably about        18/19 went to one of the other turnstiles A t G,                 As

         he approached the entrance he was accompanied by a small ^roup of

         Liverpool     supporters of a similar description as he, but as they got

         nearer they stood still and he walked through on his own.                     He was

         challenged by another Police Officer and consented to be searched.

               Because there were     very few people    coming through he was subjected         to

               a .-thorough search. On completion of this he did       not attempt to go

               through the turnstiles but returned to his friends and they all then

               left the entrance and stood on the bridge over the Don and began-

               drinking Alcohol    from cans,   which they placed on the bridge Wall.            I

               informed my fellow      officers of what had occurred and to be vi gi lant

               if they -all tried to enter again.

               Nearly all the supporters who     came through in thift time werle orderly

               and did not appear to have been drinking.        Shortly after starting to

               search them I sustained 2 cuts to my fingers, which were more of a

               result of my hard skin and then I went to the First Aid room below

               the north stand where    X obtained some plasters f r o w a St.    Johns

               ambulance nurse and I then returned to my position,           I was Away from

               »y post for about 5 minutes.

               In body searching the supporters attempting to enter the ground I

               realised that to search them correctly I would be able to smell their

               breath for alcohol/intoxicants.      As a result    I performed a thorough

               search on them and always smelled their breath.        ^believe     that    t

               entered into a friendly attitude towards the supporters to such a

               degree that I would make a fuss over any child who I would perform a

               cursory body search to the laughter of the person accompanying them.

               In fact in performing this kind of searching        I got my right trouser

               knee dirty and was    light heartedly told to clean it by either Sgt.

               Payne or Insp. Purdy.

               As the crowds built up it was not possible to search the supporters

               in the same manner,    but I did endeavour to search as many as I could.

               In this period I noticed that WPG Huckstepp was advising a supporter

               not to enter the ground as he was the worse for drink, and appeared

               to have fallen in something wet because his trouser          legs were wet.

               Around this point    it appeared to me that the majority of male
                                                                          PAGE        5
                                                                          R373

supporters had been drinking       intoxicants of some form as not only

could I smell    it on their breath but    it was   in the air as well.       I

did not stop anyone entering the ground because they were drurik> but

having said this a lot of them appeared to have been drinking.

About   1.40 pm I was aware that PS Payne had detained a matt for

attempting to enter the ground with 2 cans of Heinekefi and 1 assisted

him to the Police     room under the north stand.      I then returned to my

post.

I continued to body search people entering turnstiles B and E»

I knew that there had been a problem with the allocation of tickets

to the Liverpool     supporters   in that some had been given tickets for

the Spion Hop and they were coming to the Leppings Lane to try and

get   in»   I was told by a uniformed Inspector      (he had '& full beard" but

I do not know his name) who was behind the turnstilfs that a small

amount of them could be let through.          But having :iaid this I .did not

personally let anyone through and in fact after a short time the

permission had been withdrawn and the supporters w.ere/informed to'

enter a small enclosure on the Spion K o p specifically for th#                       \

I think that at this time I was working with PC 620 and about 2.25 pm                 j

he told me that he was going to leave me as together with another                     j

officer he had detained someone for possession of a controlled drug

 and that they were taking the person to the North Stand Police Room.

 on his own and that there were two other officers working turnstiles     j

A to C.     i cannot recall who these officers were.                                  j
                                                                                      I

                                                                                      I
building up.     It was a friendly crowd but obviously a lot of them had              j

been drinking as I could smell      it on their breath and in the air.            I

was still able to by this time      'frisk'   people entering the ground.
I then became aware of another      problem,   this of people trying to

enter thei ground without a ticket and attempting to pay an entrnace

fee to the turnstile operators.       I did not personally see any of the

turnstile ofperators D and E take any money or let anyone through

without a ticket,    they just   refused them entry and this   caused a

problem in that    I had to pull the person back out of the turnstiles

against the queue.     I cannot recall   how many times I did this but it

would have 3 or 4,     Because of this I then began asking the fans if

they had tickets and refused those without to actually e n t e r t h e

entrance of the turnstiles.      On another occasion ap old man got stuck

in turnstile D because at first he could not find his ticket and then

he had difficulty getting it out of his clothing.        A lot of the fans

told me that they had tickets but were not showing, them to me, they

just   produced them to the turnstile operator,     and I formed the

opinion that this w a s   because they were frightened of the tickets

being stolen.

When PC Yates left me     <at this time 4 of the serial were absent)      I

was able to move to a position between the two tu^ristiles entrances

with my back against a piece of wood running from ground to ceiling

dividing the two entrances.      I think that   it was around this time

that   I saw I n s p . Pu rdy to my left, stood on something and he asked me

how I was to which I replied I was alright.        Initially I was not

being crushed and I held my arms out across the entrances still

attempting to stop supporters blocking the turnstiles up.         It was at

this time I decided that it was     impossible to search anyone coming

through so I still monitored people entering the turnstiles.

AT one stage I was aware that an officer from behind the turnstiles

told me that a man attempting to enter had in fact been thrown out

of the ground.    My immediate feelings were that he would attem pt to

jump over the turnstile    into the ground so I physically pulled hiro
back away from the e n t r a n c e .   I think that this occurred shortly

after 1 returned from the Police           room when I assisted PS P a y n e , but 1

cannot be sure.

The next thing that happened was there was a pushing of the crowd

towards the' turnstiles and I was         crushed against      my   chest.     I thought

that    it w*s    someone at the    rear pushing asthe crowd? shortly

afterwards,       backed away from me.

I was then aware that a mounted Police Officer                (from another force)

rode up to me,       basically between the queues for turnstiles D and E

and F and <3 and told me to move out of the            way.    I immediately jrioved

against the       wall   between turnstile E and F whi ch was a smal 1 cl.par

area.     I was again aware that Insp. Purdy asked about my safety.                     1

again told him I ws alright,           in fact I was joking and laughing with

the supporters as by this time 1 was getting extremely warm and hot

and sweat was pouring down my face.            Obviously I was face to face with

them and I again could smell           intoxicants on their brieaths, no^t

everyone but a lot of them.

I coUld see the same m o u n t e d officer who spoke t o ^ e ,        he was about

4 yards away from me and he kept           pointing to the crowd that was

adjacent to him telling them to stop pushing.               The crush then became

worse and together with DC Duffy 1 decided to try                and get out,      I

also think at some stage I was told to            get out b y I n s p .   Purdy.   We

tried to follow the mounted officer           in the   'wake’ that he left as he

made his horse go backwards but PC Duffy fell to the floor.                     He was

jeered by the crowd but none attempted            to hurt him.       He got to his

feet and I told him that we would have            to get out another w a y . He

suggested trying to go through the queue to Turnstile F and G and

under the metal       barrier.     I told him that it was impossible because

of the number of supporters there.            They were all     packed in like

sardines.        People were shouting because they were getting              crushed.
(There wre only a few shouting)         PC Duffy m a n a g e d to get through

turnstile E.    I could not follow him I was being crushed against the

wall between E and F I could not move,         I could not move my arms.

Then a man in front of me started shouting "My wife's            pregnant,      stop    i

pushing.He      said this a number of times and the crowd appeared to                   \

pull   back slightly allowing the couple slight breathing space.                ! saw   j

my chanc# to help this g i r l .and also get out of this situation,             so I

pushed myself behind this girl and shouted for the crowd:to stop

pushing I held my arms against the entrance to the. turnstiles while

her husband pushed his foot against the wall,          therefore pushing

against the crowd.     In this way the girl got through the turnstile

and I followed.     Her husband got stuck on the outside of the

turnstiles.    When I got- to the inside of the turnstile I colds not see

any of my serial.     I was out of breath and extremely hot.          :0efore I

could do anything    I heard the sound of raised voices f r o m within

turnstile £ and I immediately went there where I saiw a white male

about 3S arguing wit h the turnstile operator,         basicariy he was

demanding to be let in as he had given his ti cket^to the operator- and

he wasn't being allowed entry,          I spoke with the turnstile operator

and he said the man had not given him a ticket and he was lying.                  I

got hold of this man and noticed that his breath smelt of alcohol and

I pulled him from the turnstile and together with another officer I

ejected him out of a gate situated on the G side- of the .turnstile

(the one given entry to lane running behind the south stand).                I then

went back to behind the turnstiles.         On looking through them, towards

the queues    I could see that the supporters were being crushed against

the entrance to the turnstiles.         They were all shouting and screaming

and it appeared to me that they were only coming through the

turnstiles very slowly.          I then saw a supporter within the turnstile

attempt to pay money to enter the ground.           This was again refused by
the operator and I          ejected him.      At this time the Supporters outside         j

were screaming that someone was              going to be crushed to death unless          j

something was done.           The next thing     I    recall was a man entering one       j

of. the turnstiles and he had a child on his shoulder®.                 The man was       j

very red in the face and was shouting for someone to take his child                       i

and I saw a uniformed Sergeant             (Identity unknown)     take the child from     j

the man and then the man came through the turnstiles..                 It was about       |

this time that when the supporter® managed to come through the                            j
turnstiles that some of them were fal 1 ing, to their krte@s» they werf                   j

obviously in a distressed condition most were gasping for, air.                    Some   j

of them were shouting at us that something had got to be done, as they j

feared someone would be killed.

At this point       I    decided to find my serial        on the outside of the

turnstiles to see if I could help get the people away from the

turnstiles.     I       went through the large       concertina gate adjacent to          ,i

turnstile G.        The gate was shut        behind me.      Just outside the gate I

saw a group of uniformed officers talking to a g r o u p o f about 6.men

in civilian clothes.           On© of the group of these mfn were showing the

officers a Merseyside Police Warrant Card.                  I am sure that the

officers were telling them that they could not let them, in,                 I    only

heard a small       part of this     conversation but I formed the opinion that

the group of 6 men were Police Officers from Merseyside wanting entry

into the ground.

At this time there were a lot of supporters around this gate,                    they

were   pleading with the officers that something had got to be done as

people were being          crushed and they feared for their lives.

I told them that I could not let them through the gate,

A few seconds later          I saw Insp. P u r d y    coming through the crowd of

supporters from Leppings Lane.             He was pointing towards the gate I

had just come through and was saying something                 like "Open the gates,
                                                                                  PAGE         10

open the g a t e s " .   'This was not di rectly said to jive,but appeared to be

said to the officers in general that were stood outside the gate.                        X

can recall saying to the officer:           "We carn't o ^ n   the ..gates w e * 11

have trouble      inside."     The   Inspector said that the^ahad got to be

opened to save      life outside the turnstiles.          The gates wer© openedV             I

do not know what time         it was they were opened arid unlocked from

within after an officer had shouted from the outside.                After a short               ■|

time Insp. Purdy gave the order to close them.               I cannot say how m a n y

people entered through this gate but it was opened for about 20 to 30

seconds.      It was not opened fully,          probably between & to 10 feet.           It

was   impossible to stop the supporters            running through but having said

this when the order was given to close the gates 1' c o u l d hot see any

probleiTis and they were       immediately closed.                                               •

In .my previous attendances at the football matches             I have never known               ;

a gate opened to let supporters enter              in this manner.   From ifty

 experiences, when gates have been broken down by fans it is
■    -.V  •                                       '''■          f                                "
 impossible in the initial stages to stop the flow into the ground due

to the numbers trying to enter.            I have experienced a gate being

broken down at Bramall Lane an d it does allow a lot of people to

enter quickly.                                                                 V

There was only a small         crowd of supporters outside the gate when it

was closed but within a matter of seconds they were coming to us,

pleading with us to do something again as the situation had not been

solved directly outside the entrance to the turnstiles.                  Sortie of them

were showing me their tickets and saying              let me through the gates,

I ’ve got a ticket.          Again Id id not want to open this gate arid              let ;

those with tickets           enter as I felt that because of the numbers of the

crowd that a surge by them would force the gates completely open and

we would not be able to contain the situation.                                •

At some stage shortly after this Insp.              Purdy told me that he-would
get the mounted section to form a barrier against the entry to the

gate and filter through those with tickets.           Within seconds there

were a number of mounted officers outside this gite and tfie order Was

again given for    it to be open from inside.        It waswopiened and there

was a steady stream of supporters moving through.            I personally did

not take any tickets from those entering.

All those entering at this time appeared to be orderly and distressed

from being crushed.       A short time after the gates were opened         I

noticed that the crowd still appeared to be entering through th®

gates of Leppings Lane.       I shouted to Insp. Purdy that the gates had

to be shut to stop people coming       into the bottleneck.       I am not sure

if the Inspector heard me.        I walked to the gates and it appeared

tHat there were a number of officers,         including mounted officers

allowing supporters to enter by showing their          tickets.    1 noticed at

this -time' there was     still a crush against the entrance to the

turnstiles,   but there was a     large area behind the queues      that   was

free of supporters.        I then noticed that some supporters were

climbing onto a metal      dividing wall    between our turnstile and those

turnstiles adjacent to ours.        I shouted at them to get down,         They

appeared to be climbing onto the wall and over the top of the

turnstiles.     These youths were climbing from the other side of the

wall from me.     They didn't appear to take any notice of me and then a

Policewoman (identity not known)       said to me that there was an

Inspector on top of the turnstiles         letting them gain entry i n t o t h e

ground over the top of the turnstiles.          I looked to the top of the

turnstiles and saw Insp. Bennett stood there.           Because of this I

allowed them to continue.       I then saw a supporter walking towards me

with a can of pop and I told him not to take it in and then I heard

the sound of another gate being opened.           1 do not know what time this

was.   I think that     it was Gate 8 adjacent to Turns'til'e -.A;     The crowd

then entered the ground through this gate.            A very short time later I          :

can recall hearing over a personal         radio,    that all Police Officers

were to go to the playing area,

■I ran through to behind the West Stand,            I did not go through the

turnstiles but I cannot for the life of me remember which gate I ran

through*     As   I ran to the enclosure    I. remember running behind Insp,

Purdy.     We ran along the back of the West Stand underneath the Police

Control '8ok,     in front of the south stand and onto the pitch,

I could see a lot of officers on the ptich and some fans            climbing

over the perimeter fence in front of the West Stand.             My immediate

thought were that the fans were       invading the      pitch.

1 then recalled      Insp. Purdy    saying something like "Form a line across

the pitch" to face the crowd.        Before    I could do anything a uniformed

Sergeant    (Unknown but he had a full beard and I think he works or has

worked -at.'-'Hammerton Road Police Station)        told me to accompany him       \

with other officers to behind the terraces and pull the fans away
                                                                          \ ■' '
from the standing area.        I could see that there were sufficient

officers on the pitch so I ran with this S e r g e a n t and^ a group df other

officers.     I did not    inform   Insp. Purdy what I was doing. I saw that

it was important to get the         people away from the rear.     I ran along

the same route that       I had taken to get to the pitch,       1 Was the last          j

officer of this group and I ran along the tunnel giving entry to the

terraces.     This tunnel was empty.       There were no injured persons at

the rear of the stand when I ran into the tunnel.

As I got to the exit of the tunnel         (onto the terrace)    I saw that the

other officers      ran down into the crowd so I stopped at the exit and

began pulling people back off the terraces and telling them to go

along the tunnel      to the rear of the stand.        I was doing this for a

matter of minutes.        Some of the youths   I spake to in this manner

smelt of drink.
#The next thing     I can recall was a supporter backing through the exit

from the terraces shouting         "There's   people dead down there."      I

couldn't believe what         I heard so I walked through the. crowd stood at

the ex'it and looked towards the perimeter fence.            I could see a

Policewoman on top of the fence trying to pull a lifeless body over

the fence.      I formed the opinion that this person was dead.            I mo ved

forward to help but         in doing this   I could see that there was a large

number of Police Officers at the material            point so I decided to pull

the crowd away from the terraces.             I remained pulling people away

from the centre stand enclosure.            By this time some of the crowd had

been volatile and were swearing at me            calling me a murderer.     I

continued to pull people away and some of them had arguments with me

about the dead and dying people.            In the most diplomatic terms

 possible X urged them to go through the tunnel.            The majority that

argued with me,       face to face smelt of intoxicant*-,     then Police

Officers began to bring injured people through the terraces and along
         .                                        "v ,."■■■   'i   ,
the tunnel I tried to keep the entrances and exits free in order that

they could get through.

When all the movement began to stop from Police Officers and

supporters bringing injured through the crowd appeared to turn on the

Police.     They personally started accusing me of murder and likening

it to the Heysel Stadium disaster.

 I still kept the exit free and then I was told by Insp, Walker to go

 to the rear of the tunnel and stop the fans attempting to get back

 into the te rr a c e s .   When 1 got there there was a number of officers

 stopping the supporters from re-entering the terrace.             Some of the

youths and men were obviously drunk and were arguing with officers to

 be allowed back because they had been parted from their friends.                I

 stopped in this position for a considerable period.              I then

accompanied     doctors through the tunnel        to the pitch.    I think I took
two doctors through.       Eventually it appeared that the supporters

began to leave the stadium and when they did I went back onto the

playing area where     I reported to PS Payne.     We were then instructed

by a Chief   Inspector    (identity not known)   to go onto the terraces and

the the names of supporters still there.         But by this time they had

a l l gone # n d I d i d n ’t get any names.
   '          --f                    •


I did not handle any of the bodies.

I must «ay that when the people were b^ing crushed against the

turnstiles' I did fear for th* safety of them and I have formed the

opinion that had the gates not been opened then 1ife wQuld hav? been

lost outside the turhstiles.

I then.returned to the Worth Stand and after being stood down I

returned to El and went off duty at 7 pm.

Later that night I .examined my body and found that my If gs were

covered in bruises there was a large one on my right knee,           I had

also got some bruising to my lower half of my body.           I canhot explain

where or why I sustained these injuries.                  .      :     ^

  From     the time we a r r i v e d           in H i d d l e w o o d Rd,   shor tly after             11.00 am

  (1100)      it was n o ti ce ab le           that there were a l r e a d y a number of

  football        fans     in the area.            They were       purch asi ng          food stuffs from the

  local      shops and wal ki ng about                   the streets,       a l t h o u g h they a p p e a r e d to

  be well       behaved at        this time.

  As time went           on,    the number of football                sup^rters               increased.        I saw

  ma n y of them dr inking             cans of beei^oj><farger and whilst on patrol                                 in

  Mi d d l e w o o d Rd,      we were a p p r o a c h e d by a number of people asking

  di re c t i o n s   to the nearest            public      house a n d to off             licences.         I did not

  know the w h e r e a b o u t s      of any       public house or off                 licences        in the area

  but    later        learnt that the nearest                public house was along W a d l s e y Ln                     in

  the op posite          d i r e c t i o n to the football          ground.

  Dur in g    this time,         su pp o r t e r s were st ea di ly ma ki ng their way to the

  football        ground.        Ho we v e r    others were still             intent         on finding a pub or

  off    licence to purchase alcohol                       prior to going to the football                       ground.

  I saw several            groups of youths               st anding ar ou n d or           in seated areas          near

  to the shops,            chatting vi r t u a l l y all         of them drinking                   cans.

  Ab ou t 2. 1 5       pm (1415)      the      number of people mak in g                 th e y      way along

Fr o m where         I was stan di ng            I could see that there was a large                      crowd of

We were       positi on ed about 20 0 - 250 yards                       from the football          gro und at

this time.            Ne a r b y       I saw several       youths stan din g around,            then

approaching           people who were ma ki ng                 their way tt^^fne ground.                 It

a p p e a r e d to me that these half a dozen you y

 the vast m a j o r i t y of the                 crowd w h i c h    I had    preivous seen gathe red at

 It was a p p ar en t          to me t t h a ^ t h e r e was       some     confus ion as to what was

 going on,          not only am on g s t            the uni fo rm ed offic ers         but amon gst      the

 Ha v i n g    fo rmed a line barring access                       into the entrance,          we were then

 told to        re group         into our serials and                I then    re joined my serial and

 stood just           inside the m ai n entrance aw ai ti ng                   further      instructions.

 I saw several              un i f o r m e d    Inspectors     standing ar ou n d        listening      intently

 As we were st anding a r o u n d                   in that area,         I saw several        su ppo rte rs

 were     coming out two or three atX^aLirne at first.                                  I noticed that most

 of them were              red in the face and were gasping                      for breath,       some of

 w h o m se at ed t h em se lv es              on the ground to get their               breath.      I saw one

 y o u t h being          carried out by about              four youths,         who    placed him on the

 ground.          He a p p e a r e d to be having             d i f f i c u l t y breathing.      However,

 other of ficers went                  to his assistance.

 By this time a st ea dy st r e a m of people were                            leaving the ground,            in

On se eing       these    people eme rg in g st ea dil y from the ground,             I as s u m e d

that the stand was            perhaps      crowded and the sheer volume of             people were

causing       people to be s q u a s h e d together          to such an extent that they

c o u l d n ’t get their br ea th and had theref ore               dec id ed to    leave of their

colleagues, nor di&k I imagine a situatia^f that I was later to realise

I spoke       to several      of the su pporters           that had sea ted th ems elv es      on the

ground,       still    gasping      for breath and         red in the face, as ki ng      them       if

they were alright,           although          none were    in need of any medical

treatment.         T he y did not m e n t i o n of any s ^ i o u s      incident    in the

               â– >/ A .    ,

        I very much appreciated your writing to me and enclosing a
        copy of your Statement in the House of Commons about a
        further public Inqury into the Hillsborough disaster.

        I appreciate the care with which you have considered this.

        It has seemed to me that there were at least two points
        where negligence could have been seriously alleged against
        public bodies.

        The first of these concerns 'the missing tapes' referred to
        in the drama documentary.  If they simply showed a brick
        wall, or something indecipharable, why were they not
        produced to prove they were not effectively operative?   If
        they were indeed showing what the film claimed they showed,
        it does seem to me to be a case about negligence.

        The other area concerns the claim in the Coroner's Court
        that death must have been instantaneous.  It is clearly
        alleged that at least one young man was still alive at
        3.30 p.m. - more recently I heard of a doctor saying that
        wanother was alive at 4 p.m.  - When the Coronor said he
        would not take evidence of anything that followed 3.15 p.m.
        Failure to send in ambulances does also seem to raise the
        possibility of negligence.

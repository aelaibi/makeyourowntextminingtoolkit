It w a s        shortly         after        "IY T q O a nVrthat. we               began        our     pa t r o l .         There       were

not     many       people           about     at       thi s      time,        but      almost         immediately                a group          of

yo ut hs a p p r o a c h e d          us a n d as k e d for                  directions              to a       pub.         We    i nf o r m e d

them      that        we     were     strangers              to     the      area and           were       unable           to    assist.

The     group         then      wandered           off       without           saying       anything              further.

As    the       day w o r e         on we     received more                    requ.ests         for       directions              to    pubs

and     all      me t      with      the s a m e       reply.           We     were       also    asked         where            the    ticket

As    the       crowds        built        up,     more        and more            people        were       asking           for

asked       by m a n y        people         for       directions              into       the    ground and                 often       we    found

that     Nottingham                 Supporters           had        got      to    the     Leppings             Ln     end a n d        the

the     opinion            that      the     majority             of    the       crowd     were       hooligans                 and    that

they      did      not       know     how     to       behave          like       human     beings.               Of    course          not

everyone          was        misbehaving               and     I noticed             one    youth          in     particular,                who

was     standing              at           the     side        of      me a n d      not s a y i n g    a w o rd .            I do      n ot       know

Leppings          Ln a n d C a t c h b a r             Ln.        He    was       then approached                    by a m o u n t e d

officer,          whose         identity           I do        not      know,        however          he    was        not       a South

The      youth          m o v e d a w ay ,        but     I did        not     see       where          he w e n t         because          I was

At    about         £.30         pM     (148'Q)      the^crowd              ha d    built          up    so m u c h         that, v i r t u a l l y

Ln    to      cl ose         the      r oad    to all          traffic,            including             PSV*s.             I walkecj/up to

the      top       of    the       road a n d        passed           the    order           on    to PC 16 98 MAR^ffii.                     I

stopped            with       PC M A R T I N        for    two        or    three        minutes             assisting            in d i r e c t i n g

traffic,            before            returning           to    my     point.

Many       of      the       crowd         that     were       now a r r i v i n g           appeared             drunk       and      some       were

even       ’l e g l e s s ’ they were                   being         supported              by    their          mates.          Many       were

still         drinking             from       cans      and     bottles            and       some       were       sitting            around

drinking            and        eating         take-away           food.

At    this         time        I broke         up    f ou r     skirmishes               between             rival         fans.       I remember

one      of     the      youths            taking       part      in a s k i r m i s h             was       a    skinhead            with       the

the      turnstiles                and      there       were      only a few                 stragglers              making           their       way

From       where         I wa s         standing          I was        unable           to    see       the       main      turnstiles                as

in t h i s       c r owd       of    supporters,                 but      they       did       not    appear           to    be     breaking             up

the    crowd.             I again           h e a r d S u pe r i nt e nde nt MAR9^-iAj*f£ orT t he                             radio            asking

why    the       gates         h a d n ’t b e e n         opened.

By    this       t ime        I could         see     him        s tanding           on    the       parapet           of    the       r i ver

to a    location mid way                        between Catchbar                      Ln       junction           and       the    g r o u n d and

I stood          near         to    the     Tyre      Depot.              I could          see       pe o p l e    scaling             the       wall

of    the    stadium and making                           thier        way      i ns i d e .         This      appeared            to       go     on

for    about          f i ve       minutes         and      no      one    tried          to    stop      them.             I could             hear

S uperintendent                    MARSh^L^Trepeating                      his       requests           for       the       gates       to       be

opened and              I could           h ea r    an      uni de nt i f i ed            of f i ce r r e p l y i n g          that         the

gates       could         not       be    opened          as     it w o u l d        be    impossible              to       ch e c k    tickets.

However,             Superintendent                 MAR^j^ACL             repeated             his    request           and       eventually

the    gates          were         opened.

Within a             f ew m i n u t e s       I heard a             ra d i o    m e s s a g e to         say      t hat       the      game

Senior       Officer,               but     I do      remember             thinking,             how      on      earth        have         so     many

"There's           some     bastard             dead     in t h e r e " .          I d i d n ’t s ay a n y t h i n g              to

Nevertheless              I decided              I'd     better        c h eck       out      what       h e ’d s a i d        and      I made

looked        unw e l l .

I c a n ’t r e m e m b e r          anyone        saying           anything,          but       it w o u l d a p p e a r          t hat       the

people        immediately around                       me     all    reached          the       s a me    decision             t h at    those

two m e n      should          be    taken         off      the     terrace          immediately.                   A    number         of    us

began       pulling         the      wire        fence        in a n      effort         to     t e ar    it    down.           The      fence

eventually           gave       way and            I was        able      to    lean       over       the      wall.          I took         hold

of    the     m a n ’s a r m a n d          with       other        officers          pulled          h im     o ver      the     wall.           I

then     supported             his     shoulders              and    carried          him       to a n a m b u l a c e          belonging

to    the     St J o h n ' s        which        had     j us t     arrived.             He     was      s t i ll       breathing            at

t his    time       and     the      only        thing        I can       remember            about       him wa s            that      he    was

stocky and wearing                     a    l i ght      coloured          shirt         and     trousers.                Although            the

man was        breathing             I formed            the       opinion         t h»C      o y q e n e q u i pm ent            would

and    other       officers           I began              to     pull        down more          of       the       terrace          fencing.

However,          our     efforts          were          thwarted             somewhat          by    supporters                on    the

terracing          who     were       desperate                  to    break        out    and       were       themselves             trying

to    rip    the     same       panel       down,             but w e r e       unfortunately                   pulling          against            us.

 PC    B E L L , myself          and       other           officers            then       managed          to get          hold      of     the

bottom       of    the     wire       panel a nd              bend      it    upwards,          allowing              us        to crawl

through        o nto      the    ter race.

Once    on     the       terrace          I lost           contact            with    PC     BELL..            Almost        immediately                 I

saw    the     body       of a       girl       laying            on    the     terrace.              I remember                thinking,

someone        really       has       died.              There         was     no    crushing             at    th is      time,          people

the    girl       from     the       terracing                and      passed        her     through/the                  fence       and      o nt o

the    tr ack.           I then made             my way               along     the       terrace          and       as    the       crowd
                                                                                                /
p art ed,      I was       confronted                by a         large        pile       of /b o d i e s .          !hey w e r e         as

d e e p as     the       wall    and       they were                  piled     up    gainst              the       wall.        There         would

be 2 5 - 3 0      b o dies ,     possibly                35      bodies        i n/t h e     pile,         they       were       so    tangled

up,    it w a s      difficult             to    tell.                They/were           all    b lue         and    it w a s        obvious

they    were       dead.                                                /

I noticed          th at    th is         pile           of      boan.es w e r e          d i r e c t l y in f r o n t          of a      crush

barrier        which       was       mangled             a.\ya    laid        flat    to     the      terracing.                 Sitting            on

top    of    the     pile       of    bodies             were         two men,        both       of       them were             alive         and

appeared          uninjured,              however             they were             unable       to m o v e          because          their

legs    were       trapped           in    the       pile.             On e    of    them       to    the       left       of    the       pile

nearest        to me       appeared             to       h av e       reddish        hair       and       he was          wearing         a    blue

denim       s hi r t .     Together             with          others          I assisted             in    pulling          him       free.          I

then    took       hold     of       one    of       the         bodies        in the        pile         by    the       arms ,      hesitated

for a       few    seconds           and    I thought,                  will        people       want          to    know       where         the

bodies       have        died    and       I immediately                      came    to     the      conclusion                that       it was

impossible           to    1eave          such       a     pile        of     bodies       in thei r p r e s e n t               position

and    I w as      s ure    they          had    to       be m o v e d .        I continued                to       pull    at       this      body,

I cannot           describe          the       body      in a n y w a y         other           than a white               male.            I

remember           that       immediately               on m y      left     wa s      a    supporter              who     took        hold          01


the     bodies          left      hand and             I saw an O ffi c e r                t ake       hold       of    the     bodies

waist        and    together             we    pulled          u ntil      we     freed          the      body         from     the     tang l

pile.         We    then       carried           the     body       to    the     open          gate      and      passed         it    to

Officers           who    were       reaching            through.            1 then             returned           to    the      pile          to

remove        another          body.           I cannot          rec a l l      the        identity           of a n y         officer

t hat    was       near       me.        I cannot            recal l      how m a n y           times        I returned            to       the

pile     and       how many          bodies            I assisted          in     remo vi ng because                     I got         what          I

can     only       describe          as       ’tun n e l      v i s i o n ’ and        became           totally

oblivious           to    everything                t ha t    was    happening              around           me.        All     I could

 see     was       what       was    immediately               in f r o n t       of       me    and      all      I wa s

concentrating                 on wa s         the      job    in h a n d a n d         that        was       removing           the

bodies        from       the      pile        o nt o    the    pitch.           I was           totally            oblivious            to

the     noise       and       c haos      that         was    about      me.

One     of    the       few    things          I do      remember          is     every          t i me      we    returned            to

the     gates       with a          body,        seeing        masses        of     outstretched                   black

u niformed arms                reaching             through         to    receive           the        body       and    t a ke    it

o nto    tMe       pitch.

The     gates       were       too       narrow         to    get    through with                  a    body.           Th e    only-

other        thing       t h at     broke        my     concentration               was         a Senior           Officer        with           a

 ,1 ou Id hai 1 er w h o            was       leaning         through        the       fence           and    shouting            just          to

spaas        the    bodies          to    awaiting            officers          and        not     to     try and          get

through        the       gate       with       them..          I cannot           rec a l l        how many             times      1

returned           to    the      pile,        but      eventually           th e      bodies           were       all     removed.

I then        remember            noticing             that    the       terraces           were        crovered           in

clothing,           shoes         and     other         personal          possessions.                    I then

looked        up    the       terrace          two      or    three       steps        and       I saw        the       only      other

Police        officer          who       I recognised               in t hat        section             of    the       terracing            and

seating        area above                and          I looked          up to        see      the     crowd       leaning           over       and

shouting         and       making            two       fingered             signs       at    us.      They were             also        spitting

on     us.    They were             shouting                "You       fucking          murdering           bastards,              y o u ’re

There        were     still         a    number             of    supporters              milling          about       on    the      terrace,

but     obviously           no      crush.                 I looked          around          and    I c o u l d n ’t see            anymore

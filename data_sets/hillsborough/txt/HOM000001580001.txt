          must have been about 20 people who asked*

          One particular group of five youths who I know                                                                    came from Port Talbot,

          as they had come to last years semi final,                                                             spoke to me and asked                                for

          tickets but I had none.                     When I asked them                                          why they had come all                                thit

          way without tickets they just said that they would get some from

          somewhere and even if they couldn't it was a day out for them.

          From then on I could see a continuous                                              passing of fans heading toward*

           the ground.

          At approximately 1450 hours I stood in the door of                                                                                                          and

           could see a continuous                 crowd of people which completely filled the

           road from           premises to the ground,                                   but I can't honestly say whether

           they were being escorted by police,                                      because there were too many of

           them.      I must admit I have never seen so many people arriving so lat­

           te a football match before*

           I continued to watch the                       crowd and could see that E                                                      people had             to

           pass horizontally across                       the heads of                         the crowd from the main gate

           area towards the river wall.

           At this       time I also saw what I would estimate to                                                               be about 200/300

           people climb over the other wall of the ground and into it, without

           going through the turnstiles.

           At this       point I saw a police officer and informed him of what I had

           seen he  then went to an officer on a motor cycle who I believe mad<

           and saw a police officer standing on the top of the grounds other

I then came out of 'the                                           and could see the crowd had not

diminished and there appeared to be even more people arriving.

Even the local, residents were saying that they were never going to

get all the people into the ground.

At this   point   I saw 2 police officers standing on top of the other

•...•all, however at this time they were pulling people up out of the

crowd -and into the ground and helping people who were obviously bein>

crushed by the sheer numbers of the crowd.

A short time later I saw 6 police officers who had been standing on

the street   corner suddenly run off towards the ground.                                                                          One of the

officers told me that they were needed urgently at the ground as

there had been an emergency.

A few minutes lat-er I saw numerous police vans and squads of police

officers go past towards the ground.                                        Just prior to this one youth

who had come from the ground sat o n _______________ wall.                                                                         I went up to

him and could see that he was crying*                                            At this time he wouldn't

speak to me.      2 other youths then came over to me and said that the

police had turned them away as there was no way that they could get

into the ground.      I then spoke to the youth who had been crying and

he told me that he had got through the turnstiles but had come back

out because he had seen people being killed in the crowd.                                                                                      He then-j

didnt say anything and just walked off along the                                                             road*                 By this time

a lot of- people were coming out of the ground and I became aware fro

what they were saying that a lot of- people were d e a d * O n e -man ask^|

if he could use my phone to call home and said that he ^ d t i a d

literally f i g h t his way out of ground*                                                                        .               ’

Dozens and dozens of people then came to me and asked if they coull

use my phone and they all said the same*                                                                              -

         were urinating up the fence of               and I was informed by some

         local   residents that some of the fans had urinated up their houses.

         In comparison to last years semi final   I would say that although thef

         were as many fans they appeared to have arrived earlier,     I dont

         think there were as many police officers at the main gate.     There

         were also far less ticket touts near to the ground.    The fans also

         appeared to be queing more orderly last year.

          Although            I am    a CID       officer          I volunteered                 to    work       the    match          in

          uniform.             I have       done       this    in    past          Semi-Finals              at    Hillsborough.                  I

         was    aware          that    I was       allocated             to       work     serial       58       with    a    sergeant           and

         9    other       officers,          two       of    which       were        known       to    me    these       being          PC    1966

         Mitton          and    PC    1914    Royle.           I did           not      know     the    Sergeant             in    charge        of

          the   serial.

         Being       aware       that       transport          was       being          provided        from       Main       Street         Police

         Station          to    Hillsborough                I went       oji      duty     at    Rotherham          at       8.30am          (0830)

         and    was       transported             to    the    ground             for     briefing          in    the    North          stand.

         After       briefing          and    a    packed          meal        the      serial        was    divided          into       pairs        in

         order       to       carry    out    the       duty       designated              this       being       the    patrolling              of

         the    Herries          Road       area       from    the       Five        Arches       Public          House       to    Moonshine

         Lane.           I was       paired       off       with    PC    Royle           and    at    approximately                11am

          (1100)         we    commenced          patrolling             the       area.         I am       aware       that       Herries

         Road       is    a    main    road       that       carries          a    variety        of    traffic          to       and    from        the

         Hillsborough                area    and       as    the    day       developed           traffic          was       constantly

         travelling             down    Herries             Road    towards             the     ground.           This       consisted           of

         cars,       vans       and    buses       and       everything              suggested          that       these          vehicles

         contained             Notts.       Forest          supporters             as     the    clubs       favours          were       being

         displayed.              Whilst       patrolling             the          area     I became          aware       that       the      Five
                                                                                                                                                    PAGE
                                                                                                                                                    R297

Arches       Public          House          was          very       busy       although              it      appeared              to    be    very

orderly.           For       our       serial             the       order       stated             that       on    commencement                    of    the

game    we       were       to    meet          at       Gate       *0"    on       Penistone                Road        in    order          to    meet

transport          for       conveying                   for    a meal.                 At    approximately                    2.45pm           (1445)

myself       and       PC    Royle          were          instructed                by       the    Serial          Sergeant              to       make

our    way       down       to    Gate           "O'      and       this       we       did. N u m e r o u s            persons           were

still       in    the       Five       Arches             Public          House          and there                were       still        fans

walking          down       Herries             Road        towards            theground.                    Some       had        clearly          had        a

drink.           Some       fans       enquired                how    far        it       w a s to       the       ground           and       when told

it    was    a    good       20       minutes             walk,       some          hailed          down          passing           Hackney          Cabs.

On    arrival          at    Gate          *0*       I could          see       that          the       general          area           was    clear          of

fans,       although             there          were       one       or    two          hanging           around         and        as    we       got    to

the    actual          gate       we       were          instructed             to       go     inside            the    ground           as       there

was    â€œsome       sort          of    bother".                 Numerous                officers             including              our       serial

entered          the    ground             and       made       our       way       along          the       side       of     the       pitch       near

the    North       stand          and       as       I    looked          into          the     pitch         I could              see    the

players          being       lead          from          the    field.              I    looked           towards             the       Leppings

Lane    end       and       near       the       area          of    gate       2       on    the       diagram          I     could          see    what

only    appeared             to       be    a    public             order       situation.                    Persons              were       on    the

pitch       and    persons             wer.e         climbing             over          the     fence         onto       the        pitch.

I looked          to    an       area       directly                behind          the       goal       and       could           see    persons

being       lifted          from       the       terrace             area       into          the       stands          above.            On       arrival

at    the    Leppings             Lane          end       I took          up    a       position             to    the        right       of       the

goal    and       in    this          area       people             were       screaming                that       they        wanted          to    get

out    because          people             were          getting          crushed.                 As     I looked             I    could          see    a

body    on       the    floor          against             the       concrete                in w h i c h         the    fence           was

embedded.              Persons             in    the       crowd          were          trying          to    hold       back           people       so

that    this       body          could          be       lifted       but       the          crowd        kept      pushing              forward.              I

went    to       the    fence          and       helped             people          over       the       fence          onto        the       pitch       and

then    officers             and       fans          started          to       rock          the    fence          backwards              and
                                                                                                                                             PAGE            3
                                                                                                                                             R297
forwards             in    order       to    treat:         it.     I did             not    see       the    fence          give       way

because          I was       instructed                by    a Sergeant                to    help       persons          out       of       the

terracing             via    gate       4 marked             on    the       diagram.                 Our    brief       was       to       get       them

onto    the          pitch       in    an    orderly          manner.                 I do       not    recall          when       this          gate

was    opened.              Persons          were       by    this       time          climbing             over       the    dividing

terrace          fence       in       order       to    get       out    through             gate       4.        I helped             people

onto    the          pitch       and    the       majority          were          sweating             and    breathing                heavily.

Some    just          fell       to    the    floor          on    the       pitch          to    recover.              The       majority

after       a    few       seconds          sat    up       after       they          had    got       their       breath.              None

that    I saw             appeared          injured.              After       a       short       while       I became             aware          that

the    fence          that       was    being          rocked       too       and       fro       had       been       broken          and       bent

back    such          that       it    allowed          persons          to       get       off       the    terracing             onto          the

pitch.           This       area       was    gradually             clearing                and       I then       became          aware          of    a

large       number          of    officers             and    fans       to       the       left       of    the       goal       in    the       area

of    gate       3    on    the       diagram          and    I then          became             aware       of    bodies          being

brought          onto       the       pitch.           Immediately                I    realised             that       these       were          dead

bodies          and    although             officers          and       fans          were       carrying          out       mouth          to

mouth       I knew          this       was    futile.              I thought                about       going          over       to    this

area    but          I could          see    that       it    was       already             an    overcrowded                area       and       I

decided          to       concentrate             on    the       area       in       front       of    me    this       being          the

broken          fence.           By    this       time       it    appeared             to       be    clearing          and       I saw          a

man    on       the    terracing             obviously             in    a    daze          with       some       minor       facial

injuries.                 I shouted          for       him    to    come          onto       the       pitch       but       he    kept

shaking          his       head.        Eventually                the    man          came       towards          me    and       I helped

him    onto          the    pitch.           He    smelled          strongly                of    intoxicants.                    As    I walked

him    on       to    the    pitch          two    officers,             one          male       and    one       female,          took          him

off    my       hands       and       lead    him       away       for       medical' t r e a tm en t.                   I    could          now

see    numerous             dead       bodies          on    the    pitch             and    fans       and       officers             were

carrying             them    away       on    advertising                hoardings.                    Everything             seemed             to

slow    down          and    all       I did       was       console          people             around       me,       tried          to    assure

people    that    friends       they were        looking    for were     all right.         Nothing

more could be done.             People were wandering around the pitch and I was

approaching them just reassuring them.                       I was then detailed to go to

the    half-way    line.        I presume         with   a view     to   stop     Liverpool    fans

going towards the Notts Forest end.                      Some of the Liverpool fans were

clearly       incensed    and     angry    and    I   had   to physically         restrain    a few

fans from going any further.

At    about    4.30 p.m.     (1630)       I was    detailed to see         that    the fans    from

the Leppings Lane end left                in an orderly manner and I together with

other    officers        walked    down     Leppings        Lane.    The    fans     left     in   an

orderly manner.

At 5-00 p.m.      (1700) returned to North Stand where I was instructed to

attend    at Claywheels         Lane.      Transported back          to Rotherham       and went

off duty at 7*00 p.m.            (1900) I think.

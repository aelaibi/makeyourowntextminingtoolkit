 1                                           Tuesday, 7th October, 1997
 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    Before we start I would like to say
 3        something about what happened yesterday; that regrettable
 4        incident.    As you know I very much regret making that
 5        remark.     It was a casual off-the-cuff remark which was not
 6        intended to be taken seriously.     I think it has been
 7        taken, not necessarily by you but by some people as being
 8        completely misunderstood and misconstrued as suggesting
 9        that I have made up my mind that the cause of the problem
10        outside the turnstiles was the late arrival of the
11        Liverpool fans, poor conduct and so on.     In fact, that is
12        completely contrary to the way that my mind is working.
13             As I explained to you when you came to see me last
14        week and as I tried to explain yesterday the question of
15        why the police lost control outside the ground was a very
16        controversial issue before Lord Justice Taylor.     He
17        resolved that issue in favour of the Liverpool fans and
18        against the police.     I see no reason whatever to review
19        that finding.
20             My present state of mind is that there is no evidence
21        which has been offered to me to suggest that that finding
22        is not correct.     Therefore, in so far as I have made up my
23        mind about any of the matters in this case it is that I do
24        not intend to review or to question that finding of Lord
25        Taylor.
26             So it is completely wrong to say that I have made up
27        my mind on that issue against the Liverpool fans, if that
28        is what people think.     The opposite is the contrary.
29             I         think you will recall that I did tell you when you
30        came last week that so far as that issue was concerned I
31        was not proposing to go into it.     I saw no purpose
32        whatever in re-opening that issue.     The evidence which has
33        been put before me for consideration as to whether or not
34        it is fresh evidence which has a bearing on my task
35        relates solely to what happened inside the ground.        It
36        relates principally first of all to the questions of the


                                       2
 1       video cameras and so on, which I know you are well aware
 2       of, that issue goes to the knowledge of the police as to
 3       the state of the the pens.       That has not got nothing to do
 4       with why the police loss control outside the ground.
 5            The other issues relate to the 3.15 cut-off point and
 6       they relate to individual parents concerns about precisely
 7       what happened to their children, how the matters      could be
 8       traced and so on.     It has got nothing to do with what
 9       happened outside the ground.
10             So,   so far as I am concerned, that is an area which
11       fortunately for me it is not necessary for me to inquire
12       into and in so far as I have made up my mind I have made
13       it up favourably to the Liverpool fans in so far as I am
14       required to do so.      I hope that is consistent with what I
15       told you last week,     I hope that it is consistant with what
16       I was trying to tell you yesterday.
17            I am bound to say that I find it a little upsetting
18       to be represented as having made up my mind in the
19       opposite direction.      But I wanted to say that to you
20       because, of course,     it was to you that I made the remark
21       and I have already apologised to you for making it, I wish
22       I had not, it meant the thing got off on the'wrong foot,
23       although, in fact, I think yesterday morning was a
24       constructive meeting, a helpful meeting.
25            Having said that can we go ahead now with what you
26       want to say to me in so far as it really adds to what was
27       put by counsel last week.     I have got all those points in
28       mind so we do not need to go over that.       You are concerned
29       particularly with the sequence of events so far as Philip
30       was concerned.
31   MRS. HAMMOND:   I would like to say, sir, Lord Justice Taylor's
32       Inquiry was a thorough inquiry and it did come out for the
33       Liverpool fans but then afterwards the inquest seemed to
34       blot out all the good findings of Taylor and left in the
35       public minds now are that there were drunken fans because
36       the Coroner spent so many days on alcohol, on the


                                      3
 1       behaviour of fans.      So I find when we go to different
 2       parts of the country, even different parts of the world
 3       peoples' perception of the Hillsborough disaster is
 4        drunken Liverpool fans arriving late.
 5              It was even on the news last night, on the radio,
 6        people were 'phoning in and I think whilst Taylor's
 7        Inquiry, as I say, came out on the side of the Liverpool
 8        fans I think the inquest has blotted that out and I think
 9        this is why your comment was taken so seriously.
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     It may be in my report to the Horae
11        Secretary I can counterbalance that perception if it is
12        so.   I am aware there was a lot of evidence given about
13        that at the inquest.     On the other hand there were no
14        findings of facts by the coroner's jury because there
15        cannot be.     The verdict which they make are very limited.
16   MRS. HAMMOND:     But after witnesses stood and said that —
17        landlords or barmen stood in the witness box and said that
18        fans had consumed enormous amounts of and then appeared at
19        News at Ten on the television saying the same thing and
20        appearing in the press as well saying the same thing.       It
21        was found to be perjury because the landlord appeared but
22        nothing was said, that wasn't counterbalanced.      It wasn't
23        reported.
24              So we found this was constantly through the inquest,
25        anything that sort of counterbalanced Taylor was printed
26        and reported in the press.
27   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     As I say, it may be that I can be
28        of some assistance to you on that because at the moment I
29        see no reason, and I hope that I shall not be presented
30        with evidence which will make me change my mind on that.
31        The police have not presented any evidence about that, so
32        far as I know they are not going to.     I think they now
33        accept, although no doubt reluctantly, that it was their
34        fault that they lost control.
35              But the real question and the real reason why they
36        have accepted liability, I use the word "accept" rather


                                       4
 1         than admit, is because of what happened inside the ground.
 2         The decision to open the gate and not to cut off the
 3         tunnel when you they ought to have appreciated that people
 4         would go down there.        That is why they admitted liability
 5         or accepted liability.        That was a clear finding again by
 6         Lord Taylor and again I cannot see any reason why I should
 7         quarrel with that.     I do not intend to.     The only question
 8         really is whether further evidence puts an even worse
 9         complexion upon what the police were up to.        I hope that
10         explains the matter to you.
11                 Can we deal with the specific problems in relation to
12         Philip?     Have you got a further statement?
13   MRS. HAMMOND:      We've just summarised what -- I see you have got
14         my letter.
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Yes, I have got your letter of the
16         22nd.     One of the things that -- there is this problem
17         about whether or not Philip was alive when he arrived at
18         hospital.     There is the evidence, there was always the
19         evidence of the police officer who went with him, is it
20         Police Constable Taylor?
21   MRS. HAMMOND:      Taylor, yes,            and the ambulance men
22                    treated him as well at the ground.
23   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         There was also, as I understand it,
24         in the summary that was read the statement that he died in
25         hospital.
26   MRS. HAMMOND:      Yes.
27   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         The only evidence to the contrary
28         was the opinion, as I understand it, of the pathologist.
29   MRS. HAMMOND:      Yes, in the opening day Dr. Wardope was asked to
30         give his best guess as to what happened to Philip.           I
31         can't understand, we can't understand why someone is asked
32         for their best guess when the Coroner had three statements
33         saying what happened to him.
34   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Were the statements not summarised?
35
36   MR.   HAMMOND:     Summarising that there were a police officer and


                                           5
 1         ambulance woman was in the ambulance with Philip and tried
 2         to give him heart massage, but not to the extent that
 3         these policemen were saying they got him back, they can
 4         feel a pulse at all that.
 5   MRS. HAMMOND:      Surely the Coroner had these statements, didn't
 6         he?
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      These are the statements on the
 8         body file?
 9   MRS. HAMMOND:      Yes.
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Have you now got the body file?.
11   MR.   HAMMOND:     Yes, but there's still some missing from it.
12   MS.   ADLINGTON:     The usual problem.   The family have been
13         assured they have now received all the documentation on
14         the body file.
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      As I think I said yesterday, can we
16         deal with that in the way that I suggested, namely, that
17         you let me know what you have got and I will look and see
18         what more there is.     I am afraid I cannot do more than
19         that.   What I would like to know is —     I appreciate that
20         you now have the evidence of Dr. Walker who talks about
21         his attempts to resuscitate Philip, which of course
22         confirms what the police officer and the ambulance lady
23         were saying. So one might say:      Well, Dr. Wardope's best
24         guess was wrong and clearly there were signs of life when
25         he came to the hospital, attempts were made to resuscitate
26         him but, unhappily, they were not successful.      I cannot
27         remember now when he was certified dead but it was around
28         about 4    o'clock.
29   MR.   HAMMOND:     Yes.
30   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Perhaps I can put it like this:
31         what exactly do you want me to do about this?      What would
32         you like me to do about it?
33   MRS. HAMMOND:      As I say, I feel, we feel that a completely
34         different picture was being portrayed to the jury as was
35         portrayed to Taylor.     They were getting a completely
36         different picture of what happened in the ground.      The way


                                        6
 1         it was portrayed is that everything happened very suddenly
 2         and no-one stood a chance, which —     and I think when the
 3         Coroner listed the people who went to hospital and went
 4         through what had happened to them it was sort of portrayed
 5         as: there was no hope anyway.
 6              Philip didn't die of traumatic asphyxia, Philip died
 7         of a lacerated lung and haemorrhage.     I feel that, this is
 8         purely my feeling, that he had to be sort of —     there was
 9         no hope and if he'd got hospital earlier —     there was just
10         this feeling that they wanted to give this impression that
11         it was all over very suddenly and nothing could be done
12         for anybody.     Hence I can't understand why Dr. Walker was
13         never identified anywhere at all and it would have been so
14         easy for —     there were 11 people who died in the casualty
15         department.     Surely, as I put here, if they'd have had 11
16         -- they had 11 polaroids of the people who died in
17         hospital.     If they'd have sat the doctors down, if they
18         knew the name of the doctors obviously, if they'd have
19         said to the doctors:     "Can you identify who you treated?"
20         Because it would have been quite easy for them, Ed Walker
21         describes the people who he treated quite detailed
22         actually and then they could have said:     "Yes, I had
23         dealing with him, him and him", and they could have, you
24         know, instead of me being told, and we weren't told he
25         went to.hospital until November, we always thought he died
26         at the ground.
27   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Is that right because the summary
28         shows that he died in hospital?
29   MR.   HAMMOND:     Yes, but that's the November after the disaster.
30
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      You did not get that until the
32         November?
33   Ms.   ADLINGTON:     What it was the mini-inquest was the April of
34         1990, in the November of 89 they received a visit from the
35         West Midlands Police who actually who gave them this
36         information.


                                        7
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Just remind we what the procedure
 2         was,    I thought at the mini-inquest there was a summary
 3         presented.     Then, I don't know whether it is Police
 4         Constable Killock but certainly did some of them, he then
 5         went through in     effect the body file and read out certain
 6         bits of it.     Then the pathologist was asked to give oral
 7         evidence.     Is this right?    That was really what happened.
 8         That is right, is it not?
 9   Ms.   ADLINGTON:      It was April 8 9 the disaster, November 89 West
10         Midlands Police     visited Mr. andMrs. Hammond.       It was at
11         that stage they     became aware that Philip had been taken to
12         hospital.     In the intervening seven months they had not
13         been informed that Philip had been taken to the hospital.
14         When they got to the mini-inquest the following April of
15         course the fact that he'd been taken to hospital appeared
16         in the summary.
17   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       That is very regrettable that you
18         were never told--
19   MRS. HAMMOND:      We'd have several visits from West Midlands
20         Police,    several visits during that period and it was never
21         referred to.      They brought his shoes back and it had a
22         hospital label and I said:          "That's a hospital label", I
23         said:     "Did he go to hospital?" and he said:        "Yes."     and
24         I said:     “Why did you never tell us?" and they said:           "You
25         didn't ask.'*     You don't ask if your son is in a gymnasium,
26         you just assume -- I wouldn't have dreamt for the world
27         that they would have brought bodies back from the hospital
28         mortuary and put them in a gymnasium on the floor.              That
29         would never have entered my head.
30                 So it was then we wanted to kno.w well, who got him to
31         hospital and it was then we got the —          we were told about
32         Police Constable               and Taylor and we wanted thank
33         them obviously far all they'd done and we'd also wanted to
34         take our other s o n | | t o         meet the policemen.
35         Obviously there was all this policemen and how bad they
36         were, we wanted!           to see that policeman had help and


                                           8
 1          policemen had done their best and we did indeed go and
 2          meet them in, was it, Snake Hill we went to.       They
 3          reinforced, they said:      "When we got there there was a
 4          doctor there they did everything for him, they tried their
 5          best and they worked on him for about 20 minutes.
 6               So that in effect sort of flung you back to stage
 7          one, you had to start coping that.       It was a different
 8          scenario than we'd been trying to cope with.       Then we went
 9          to the mini-inquest in April and then Dr. Wardope says:
10          "Oh no,   he had three electrodes on him and he must be
11          taken straight to the plaster room."       So then I thought:
12          they're lying to me, why did thy do that?       Why did they?
13          I really felt let down.       Then it transpires that they
14          didn't, that was not what had happened.
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         I think that if I may come to Dr.
16          Wardope's defence for a moment.       He was asked to give his
17          opinion on the evidence that he had.       He perhaps ought to
18          have known that Philip was one of the people that Walker
19          tried to resuscitate, but I don't think that one would —
20          it does not seem to me that he was deliberately trying to
21          deceive anybody.
22   MRS. HAMMOND:       I'm not suggesting that for a moment, sir.       I'm'
23          saying that the Coroner had three statements from people
24          who knew who were there, present with him.        He knew
25          there was the evidence there to say what had happened to
26   LORD    JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I will look the mini-inquest of him
27          and see what was saidand it may be that there is room          for
28          criticism.     I think it is unlikely that there is room for
29          saying that there ought to be a fresh inquest.
30   MRS. HAMMOND:       This all points to the same avenue that the jury
31          were being —        that an entirely different picture was being
32          painted to the jury as to what really happened.
33   LORD    JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      This is the 3.15 cut-off point you
34          are talking about?
35   MRS. HAMMOND:       Yes.
36   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          There is a good deal of —    I am not


                                            9
 1        saying that you understand it but in the letters I have
 2       read it is quite clear there has been a good deal of
 3       misunderstanding about what the Coroner actually ruled
 4        about t h a t .   He did not say that everybody was dead at
 5        3.15, he said that everybody had received their injuries
 6       by 3.15, which is plainly correct.
 7              He knew, as I think everybody else knew, that some
 8        people died later in hospital, we know, for example, that
 9        Eddie Spearitt,      I think, died the next day and Lee Nicholl
10        died 2 days later and it is obvious that some people were
11        taken to hospital who recovered because there were 87
12        people taken to hospital - I say only, far too many people
13        - and 11 died, so 76, or whatever it is, came out.
14              We do know, I think this appears from the evidence of
15        Dr. Wardrope at the inquest, that I think it was 17 of
16        them were taken to the intensive care unit of whom,        I
17        think, 9 died but at any rate those are the sort of
18        figures we are talking about.
19               So I think it must have been known that some people
20        did recover.
21   MRS. HAMMOND:     I did mention in my letter that it fills me full
22        of horror to think that policemen had the terrible task of
23        deciding,    "He's dead, try and do something with him", and
24        if the major civilian disaster had been implemented
25        earlier and indeed if the ambulance paramedics had been
26        allowed onto the pitch I am almost sure more people would
27        have survived.       As I said in my letter, it doesn't bear
28        thinking about that policemen placed garments of clothing
29        over people's faces.
30               I said that I was in charge of an intensive care unit
31        and we've been at arrest situations where three, four very
32        experienced doctors have been around the people who have
33        arrested, several of them have not been able to feel a
34        pulse and before resuscitation has been abandoned someone
35        has said,     "I've got a pulse, I've got a pulse in the
36        neck", and they have carried on successfully and that's


                                         10
 1        happened several times and I've got to say the person in
 2        the bed looks to all intents and purposes dead.       So to a
 3        lay person patients go really, really cyanosed and they
 4        look dead, for a lay person they say,    "He's dead", you
 5        wouldn't be able to feel a pulse because, as I said, the
 6        blood vessels shut down to direct blood to vital organs
 7        and you won't feel a pulse here.     So it doesn't bear
 8        thinking about and I think that fact that the major
 9        civilian disaster plan was not implemented I think had a
10        large rebound effect.
11   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I think that is right and I think
12        Lord Taylor criticised the police for not appreciating
13        sooner than they did what was happening.
14                We are actually talking about minutes here.    I think
15        I am right in saying the call for a large number of
16        ambulances was at eight minutes past three.
17   MRS. HAMMOND:     But they weren't allowed into the ground, were
18        they?
19   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     They did not come onto the pitch.
20   MRS. HAMMOND:     The paramedics didn't go onto the pitch until a
21        lot later.
22   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     There was a lot of ambulance people
23        there and indeed the some of the South Yorkshire people
24        were there.    I have read the evidence, I forget who they
25        are now, the South Yorkshire ambulance people who were
26        there on the day and there are also St. John's ambulance
27        people there on the day, they had about 30 people there.
28        I am not saying for a moment that there should not have
29        been improvements.     Lord Taylor in his final report, I
30        think, dealt quite extensively with what should and should
31        not be available at a ground and so on and so forth.
32   MRS. HAMMOND:     Again, sir, at the inquests it was portrayed
33        that the major civilian disaster plan was up and running
34        efficiently and Dr. Wardrope in an article for the BMJ
35        much later on said,    "No message was received.   Failure to
36        implement the major incident earlier meant only a few


                                       11
 1         staff had to cope with a large workload."     But in the
 2         inquest he portrayed that everything was up and running
 3         and efficient, it's clearly at odds with the article in
 4         the BMJ, clearly.
 5   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I think this is probably what I
 6         need to ask Miss Adlington, although it is a question that
 7         I asked Mr. Jones.     The problem about this is that because
 8         of the decision of t h e .Divisional Court in this case,
 9         which was confirmed by the case of Jameson, there is no
10         available verdict here of want of care or neglect.
11   MS.   ADLINGTON:    That was argued forcefully in the judicial
12         review and I think it has been reinforced although Julian
13         Knowles was going to research whether or not there had
14         been a shift in the law.
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      If that is so then obviously I
16         would expect it.     My understanding is that the Court of
17         Appeal have actually affirmed what the Divisional Court
18         said in this case.     But, of course, unless they have said
19         it is wrong, I am bound by what the Divisional Court has
20         said.      Is there anything else further that you would like
21         to deal with on this?
22   MR.   HAMMOND:     There is a few more things about the
23         investigating officers of the West Midlands police.
24   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Is this in the letter?
25   MR.   HAMMOND:     Yes, I think it is, it's Stanley Beechy of the
26         West Midlands police force was himself being investigated
27         yet he was coordinating the question of vital evidence for
28         the Hillsborough.
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I discussed this this morning with
30         somebody who made the same point.     I have asked for, as it
31         were, chapter and verse about the details of this officer.
32         Can I just say this, that police officers who are
33         subsequently convicted of perverting the course of justice
34         and matters of that sort are unfortunately a problem with
35         which we are not unfamiliar in the Court of Appeal
36         Criminal Division.     I have presided in a number of cases


                                        12
 1          where we have had to quash convictions because the police
 2          officer concerned is convicted of perverting the course of
 3          justice in relation to fixing up a particular defendant
 4          and then you find that he was also an important witness in
 5          the trial of a particular appellant.           That is obviously
 6          something which calls into question the safety of the
 7          conviction.
 8                  It does not follow that simply because a police
 9          officer is subsequently convicted of a serious offence,
10          even perverting the course of justice, that everything
11          that he has done before now is suspect.
12   MS     ADLINGTON:    The point that is being made is        that unknown
13         . to families this police officer was under investigation at
14          the time he was appointed as coroner's officer.
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          That may be so.     He was not
16          suspended at the time, was he?
17   MS     ADLINGTON:    No, sir.
18
19   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          He was convicted, was he?
20   MR.    BONE:     It says here he was acquitted after no evidence was
21          offered, so there was no trial effectively.
22   MS.    ADLINGTON:    He was the subject of a private        prosecution,
23          sir, and the plaintiff, for want of a better word,
24          actually got him committed to Birmingham Crown Court, him
25          and other members of the Serious Crime Squad of the West
26          Midlands police.     The DPP at Crown Court stage actually
27           stepped in and took over the conduct of that prosecution
28          and chose to offer no evidence.
29   MR.    BONE:     Then dropped it?
30   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          I do not think this horse is going
31          to run, if I may say so.        By all means make submissions to
32          me to the contrary but it does not look as though that
33           horse is going to run.       If you think otherwise perhaps you
34          would put some submissions to me in writing, but if no
35           evidence is offered against him —       I mean I appreciate--
36   MS.    ADLINGTON:     The point being made is that he was the


                                            13
 1         subject of a complaint to the Police Complaints Authority
 2         at the time he was appointed to Hillsborough.
 3   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I do not think that is sufficient
 4         reason for saying that his evidence is suspect.
 5   MS    ADLINGTON:     He selected the evidence for the Coroner.
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Maybe, but if he is   found not
 7         guilty I have to assume that he has been innocent
 8         throughout.     In which case not only can it not be
 9         suggested that he should not have been involved in the
10         inquiry but even if he was convicted I am not sure that
11         there would be any grounds at that stage.       So for what it
12         is worth I do not think that horse will run, if you think
13         it will please let me have a written submission about it.
14   MR.   HAMMOND:     The more evidence that emerges casts a serious
15         question mark over the conduct and integrity of Sergeant
16         Julie Appleton of the West Midlands police force.
17   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I do not think I have had any
18         actual complaint about her, have we?
19   MS    ADLINGTON:      She was involved in the Kevin   Williams case,
20         sir.
21   MR.   BONE:     She countersigned Bruder's statement.
22   MS    ADLINGTON:     She was the woman police'officer who allegedly
23         compiled Deborah Martin's statement.
24   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I have interviewed Mr. Bruder and I
25         know what he has to say about that.
26   MS    ADLINGTON:     It was Deborah Martin's statement who was the
27         female police officer who was present with Kevin Williams
28         in the gymnasium.
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       It was Sawyers who saw Bruder, was
30         it not?      I am hoping to see Deborah Martin and depending
31         on what she says I may have to see Miss Appleton.
32   MR.   HAMMOND:     She also signed Dr. Ed Walker's statement to the
33         fact that she wasn't even there.
34   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I think the position was that he
35         sent the completed statement to, I think, the police or he
36         asked somebody else, or asked somebody else to send it and


                                        14
1          it eventually ended up with police and I suppose she put
2          her signature on it when maybe she shouldn’t have done.
3    MS    ADLINGTON:    She also witnessed the statement of Roger
4          Houldsworth when Roger Houldsworth produced a plan and
5          schematics of the CCTV in the ground.
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        What is sinister about that?
 7   MS.   ADLINGTON:    The families view them as the two most crucial
 8         witnesses in all this, Dr. Walker and Roger Houldsworth.
 9         Roger Houldsworth because of the fact that he--
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         I know the significance you
11         attribute to him.        What is the significance of the fact
12         that Miss Appleton was the officer involved with those
13         witnesses?
14   MR     HAMMOND: None of that evidence was put toward the
15         inquest.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Why is that Miss Appleton's fault?
17   MR.   HAMMOND:     She seems to be on all the controversial
18         statements that we have in our possession.
19   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         So what?
20   MR.   HAMMOND:     It doesn't look too good.
21   MR.   BONE:   Are there any other reasons to suspect that Miss
22         Appleton is dishonest or bent in the sense that you think
23         there might be with Mr. Beechy?           She has not been charged
24         or prosecuted with criminal offences?
25 . MS    ADLINGTON:     No, no.     But now that these statements are
26         emerging she's also the witnessing officer of staff
27         generally at the Northern General Hospital who in these
28         statements paints this picture of efficiency at the
29         Northern General Hospital.           For example, there is a Dr.
30         Calder, who I know is referred to in Philip Steele's case,
31         who alleges that he was on duty at the hospital in the
32         day, he received a telephone call at five past, ten past
33         three from another doctor colleague who was watching the
34         TV and through that telephone call he was told to expect
35         casualties and he in fact initiated the major disaster
36         plan and there has always been some doubt as to when and


                                           15
 1         if the major disaster plan was actually implemented.
2    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Who is this witness?
 3   MS    ADLINGTON:    It's a Dr. John Calder.
4    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Is there a statement from him?
5    MS    ADLINGTON:    There is a statement but it's in another
 6         family's file, I think the family are due in in the next
 7         meeting so I can get you a copy of that statement.
 8   MR.   BONE:    Calder is saying he implemented the disaster plan?
 9   MS.   ADLINGTON:    As a result of a telephone call from another
10         doctor who was sitting at home at five past, ten past
11         three and he told Dr. Calder to expect casualties because
12         there was ambulances on the pitch, which we know is wrong
13         because it's well documented because the ambulances did
14         not arrive on the pitch until 3.13.
15                 I just find it suspicious that the police could not
16         appreciate what was happening on the ground and here we
17         had apparently a doctor sat at home who could recognise
18         what was happening.
19   MR.   BONE:    On his television set?
20   MS    ADLINGTON:     Yes.
21   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I think it depends on the question
22         o f ■what one might called mind-set, I think the trouble
23         with the police is that they had this mind-set that they
24         were dealing with public disorder until several minutes
25         had passed and Lord Taylor criticised them for that.        I
26         see no reason to disagree with that criticism.     We are
27         talking about minutes here.
28   MR.   HAMMOND:     The last one is Dr. Forrest who gave extensive
29         evidence on alcohol, he was employed by the Sheffield City
30         Council as assistant coroner.     We think there was a
31         conflict of interest in that.
32   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I am sorry, I have not quite got
33         this point.
34   MR.   HAMMOND:     Dr. Forrest he stood up for a couple of days,
35         two or three days, he was giving evidence on alcohol but
36         he was employed by Sheffield City Council as Assistant


                                        16
 1         Coroner.     We think there was a conflict of interest in
 2         that.     The way they were trying to point the jury that
 3         there were drunken fans and all that.           He was part of what
 4         we think was a cover-up.
 5   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Are you suggesting that Dr.
 6         Forrest's evidence is dishonest?
 7   MR.   HAMMOND:     No, I'm suggesting that really itshould have
 8         .been someone from outside      to —    if this evidence should
 9         have been, which we think       it shouldn't have     been given,
10         but if it would have been given why didn't they bring
11          someone in someone from outside the district, for the
12         Coroner's Assistant to give         this evidence? Why didn't
13         they bring in       someone else? Why bring him?
14   MR.   BONE:      That is the same sort of criticism that is made of
15         Popper.
16   MS.   ADLINTGON:      It's an extension of the bias.
17   MR.   HAMMOND:      It's all bias.
18   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH: I am afraid that is another horse
19         which is not really going to run because the question of
20          the Coroner's bias was considered by the Divisional Court,
21          I do not think I can go back on that.
22                 There are an enormous number of issues and concerns
23          and complaints that people have voiced to me over the last
24          two days.     I   understand them, I sympathise with many of
25          them, but, I      am afraid, you have to, I know you do,
26          realise that my terms of reference are relatively limited.
27          I may well be      tempted to go outside them in order to try
28          and establish      in some cases, if I can, what happened where
29          there is some confusion on the body files.
3d                 I have said I will do and do that I do not guarantee
31          that I shall      be successful.      I don't think that is
32          probably strictly within my terms of reference but I know
33          it is a matter which is of great concern to the families
34          and I will try and do what I can to help on that.             There
35          are a lot of other aspects, complaints about the way the
36          Coroner dealt      with the matter and so on which are really,


                                          17
     I am afraid, unfortunately, I shall not be able to deal
     with.     Still there it is.   I have taken on board all your
     complaints.     It is a question really of whether I can deal
     with them or not.
             Thank you very much for coming.   I hope you feel that
     you have be able to put the points that you want to.      If
     there is anything that occurs to you subsequently that you
     think you did not put across then please write it down.
     It is really all in that file, is it?
MRS. HAMMOND:     Yes.
LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Thank you very much.

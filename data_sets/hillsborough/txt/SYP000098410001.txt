        FROM: Detective Inspector Clever ley
                                                    DEPT: Hillsbrorough Enquiry
        TO: Chief Superintendent Wain
                                                    DATE: 13 July 1990


                    SUBJECT:    INTERIM REPORT 4
                                RESULT OF ENQUIRIES
                                REQUESTED BY HAMMOND SUDDARD

        Further to my report of 2 July 1990, the remaining task to be completed
        was preparation of the "body plan" (Task 6).

        Mr         (Plans Dept) completed the first draft plan on Monday 9 July
        1990, which you saw on that day and discussed with myself and
        Superintendent Betti.son.

        On Wednesday 11 July 1990 Mr Peter Metcalf of Hammond Suddards attended
        a meeting at Pol ice HQs, at which Superintendent Bettison, myself, and
        Mr                were present.   A seperate memorandum of that meeting
        is being submitted by Supt Bettison, but so far as the plan was
        concerned Mr Metcalf wished to consult counsel, before ordering further
        copies, and simply asked for a photograph of the draft plan for that
        purpose.     In discussion of the plan it was clear that the first
        impression did not immediately convey what Mr Metcalf was looking for.

        Following that meeting, being aware of the discussion, Mr
        decided to try another draft plan on a smaller scale (1 to 50) and he
        showed me the result on the afternoon of Thursday 12 July 1990.     The
        overall effect was much better than on the large plan, in that the dots
        became more prominent, and showed the crowding towards the front of the
        pen much better.    The marker dots are now representing an area of .4
        metre, roughly the breadth of a man's shoulders, and there can be no
        suggestion of exaggeration on our part.     I telephoned Mr Metcalf and
        informed him of the second draft that afternoon.

        At Mr Metcalf's request I went to Hammond Suddards Bradford on Friday 13
        July 1990 and showed him the second draft plan.     He was pleased with
        the result, and now wishes to use it.      He requested that sufficient
        copies be produced for service and use in the hearings.        20 copies
        should be sufficient.

        The photographs of the two draft plans have now been processed, and have
        been sent by first class post to Hammond Suddards.       It may be that
        photographs will be sufficient, without the expense and trouble of
        reproducing the copy plans individually.   I will liaise with Mr Metcalf
        on this point.

            In connection with the body plan, I have constructed a schedule as
            Instructed, based on the Individual body plans and Coroner's evidence
            (copy attached).    I have handed a copy over to Mr Metcalf for his
            consideration, and he will no doubt inform us if he requires any
            evidence about it.

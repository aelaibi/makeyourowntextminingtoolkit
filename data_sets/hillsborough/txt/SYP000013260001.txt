             Dear Sir,

             Re: Colin Mark Ashcroft,
             Hillsborough Disaster.                                                                            *                            f

                                                                                                             a J f §*,isz-SA & xff. , f k , c tsa l
             We act on behalf of the parents of Colin Ashcroft who was killed in t h e i A
             Hillsborough Disaster.                                                     ■

             Mr. and Mrs. Ashcroft are naturally distressed at losing their Son and
             they appreciate that enquiries are pending both by Lord Justice Taylor                                                               - K
             and by your own Force.   /                 "

             Our clients have expressed to us their distress at the fact that they
             were not able to identify their son Colin as being amongst the dead
             until approximately 7.p.m. on the Sunday evening. This was a most
             harrowing time for them and they repeatedly gave to the Police accurate
             descriptions of their son and the clothes he was wearing, only to be
             told that nobody of that description was amongst the dead at the mortuary.

             We should be most grateful if you would kindly look into this matter and
             let us have yQus-jcommentg.

             Yours

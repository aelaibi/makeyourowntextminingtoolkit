                    that we had to get               into the buses          because when you a r r i v e d at the

                    g round you were            free to walk         back to the City Centre.

                    After arriving at             the ground we w a l k e d to the Gate                     public           house        for a

                    drink and some food.                There was       no trouble         in the       pub it was                  like

                    C h ristmas     high spirits all around.                   The    four    of us         left          the    pub and

                    walked    to the ground             I saw several          Police      on the way directing

                    people.        There were         crowds    of    people walking         towards                the     ground        but    I

                    saw no trouble or drinking.

6o.£-               We arriv ed at the ground at about 2 , 3 0                       pm   H430)       and w hen we got to

      I     t   h   e      outer    large gates         there was a mass             of people        no orde r l y queues.

                    There was a P o l i ce ma n on a horse                  swinging about            in the           crowd this made

                    the situation worse and                pretty scarey,                 Police                    * r r       ^     |l~

                    The    four of us joi ned the              crowd and started to make                         our way towards

                    the turnstiles and were                pushed about         by the       crowd,              It was         very hot

                    and    I could see          people getting         flushed,       I had never                experienced

                    anything       like       it before.

                    As we a p p ro ac he d the turnstiles               I saw    people       climbing               over a wall            on

                    the    right    of the       turnstiles.         B ec a u s e we were having                    diffi c u l t y

o     r r           reaching       the turnstiles we decided to climb the wall.                                                     was    the

ON'/TtfTH- first             to climb up the wal 1 he h elped me up and then we helped

                    over    the wall we w a l k e d along             the    turnstile       roof and the Police                          helped

                    us down    inside          the   turnstiles and         pointed the way            into           the terrace,                   I

                    c a n ’t remember          xf the Police checked our tickets                       but          I was       holding

                    mine.

                    We followed all             the other      people       towards a tunnel            which was                straight

                    ahead.     As we ente r e d the tunnel                  I could see the            pitch,             the    players

                    were    out and       I    think   the     game had just kicked off,                            The     tunnel    was a

                    bit    crowded but we            could walk       along without          being          pushed and              I did not

             We    came out onto           the terrace and             it was    very    crowded but        no worse          than
                                                                                                         fB -rs J   3
             any semi           final    at this stage.           We made       our way    to the    right when we

             left the tunnel              and about      half way down the terrace,                  We     remained          in

             this     position for about             five minutes and             it was    becoming        tighter       and

             tighter.            My arms were       down    in front         of me and     I could not move              them,

                        cin d               were    still wit h me and            I could hear                      really

             shouting and screaming,                 I ’d never         heard him       like this    before.

             t urned my head very s l i gh tly               to the          right and saw that                     looked         in

             pain his face was distorted.                        People all ar o u n d me started to go down,

             and we were              pushed further       down the terrace             towards    the    pitch.         As    I

             was    pushed along           there were       people under my feet at                first      I tried to

             help     them but the sit u a t i o n became                so bad I was w o r r i e d about myself.

             I lost touch with my two friends                          but   I could still        hear

             screaming.               I had fallen over          by now and there was about                 two or three

             people under me,              The    people    under me were males,             at    this     point       I could

             not describe any of them,                   but they a p p e a r e d       to be dead,       their     faces

             were     blue and the eyes were                open and staring,             I saw their mouths              open

             and the tongues were                 out.

             I felt someone              on top of me and the weight                 got heavier         at first        I was

             struggling           to get up but there was                no way my       legs were       c ompletely

             trapped.            I could hear       people groaning and others                saying,         "Get them

             up."       I was very f ri gh t e n d e d and having                great diffi c u l t y      in breathing*

               I was      lying face        down.        I really thought          I was going       to die and m y

             time was up,             there was     nothing       1    could do to help myself                 A f t e r t h is

             I do not           remember anything          else until          I woke    up on the       pitch.         I was

             aged about 2 8-29 yrs brown hair going                           thin on top,        he had a beard and

m o u t h was open and he a p p e ar ed to be dead.                I was       in tears and a

Policeman      came to       comfort me.        1 a sked him if the man            1 had. been

looking at was dead,            the P ol ic e m a n went to the man checked him and

then    covered his face.           There were        bodies     lying all ar o u n d me and

others    being      carried away but the man             1 described was the only one                     I

can remember.

The    next thing      I remember        is           coming     running       up to me and

shouting,                       w hich    is my nickname,         he was       really   crying and we

hu g g e d each other.                   was   then    concerned about                    and he went

to    look for him.          After a while                came back but he          could not find

               The    next    thing a gang       of    lads    lifted me onto a bill            board          I

was telling them to leave me, but                              said,   "Stay on there."              1 was

                                                                bo                  stayed with me

and    I was   placed on the        pitch near        the Kop end.         Several      people       came

up to me and         checked    I was OK but          I did not have any treatment                  from

anyone    1 lay on the ground for a few minutes and because we were

concerned about                      we wal k e d back across            the    pitch to look         for

him.

We f ound                sat on the           pitch very near      to where       I had first         sat,

he had his head between his knees and was very upset.                               On seeing         him

we all    sat down arm         in arm     crying      our eyes out.                     was    having

trouble     breathing.         We stayed        in this   position for          five minutes and

then an a m b ulance man took us to some                  benches      in front     of the North

S ta n d which we sat         on.   Whilst we were there a Notts Forest                       fan

brought     us water     he was     really great.

We    remained    in this      position for some          time,    most    of the dead and

injured had been         cleared from the             pitch but a lot of          people were

wa ndering around upset and               crying.       I did not hear any          tannoy

announcements.

I think     it was about a quarter               to four when we decided to              leave       the

ground.       We wa l k e d along         the    pitch to the Leppings Lane                terrace     and

out    into Leppings         Lane,    we did not go back               through the tunnel.             As we

left the ground         peo pie we re grabbing               us and t ryi ng to          put us    i nto

a mbulances       but we did not want              to get     in them we just w a n t e d          to get

home.                  was    still       finding       it hard to b r e a t h .

We met up with                                  a g a i n and made our way to the             railway

station from where we made                  our way home,           I a r r i v e d home    pretty     late

about      nine   or ten oclock           (2100)    (2200).       I was still           very shoc k e d and

did not want        to talk     to anyone.              I told my mother        I w o u l d tell      her

about      it the next clay.

As a result        of the     crush my

            I did not go to a Doctor and did not have                          time      off work,         I

thought      that going       to work was          the    best thing       to do and       it w ould help

On the day of the match               I was wearing           light     blue   cotton      long sleeved

shirt,      a white T shirt underneath,                   blue   jeans and brown Dr Ma r t i n type

shoes,      no scarf    or hat,       I    am                    good build,        light     brown hair,

I did not         loose any    property          but my shirt was torn.

I did not see myself            on any          newspapers,      but    1 did see myself           on BBC       1

news    on the Monday         or Tues d a y evening after               the m a t c h    I was    in the            i

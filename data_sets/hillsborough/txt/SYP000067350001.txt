  officer      on foot     direHly        outside        the     turnstiles.            He    could not             have

  directed anyone          if he had w an te d to               because he himself was              getting

  crushed by the          crowd w hi ch e xt en d ed            back    to the mai n gates.



^ A f te r about a half an hour               in that          chaos    1 m a na g ed    to enter        thro ug h a

  turnstile       into the       ground     itself.             I did not see any s t ew ar d

  directions          either    outside     nor at the           t urnstiles        themselves,          and            handed

  my ticket       into the g a te ma n who           r et ained the         counterfoil.



  Once    that    side    of turns ti le s        there was         no o ve rc ro w di n g at all and                     1

  had time       to    recover    from the        crush outside and wait                   for my friends                  to

  get    through.         After    tWe      minutes a p p r o x i m a t e l y we were all                in by now,

  we made      our way down the            central       tunnel        w hi ch as    far as       I was

  concerned was          the only way onto             the      pitchside      terraces.              It was quite

  crowded      in the     t u n n e l V but not      crushed and we            reached        the     end and

  passed    into the       left    hand     pen,     pen four,          behiridk^the goal.

at a n FA      cup semi-final.                    The    crowd was           swaying and      people were

pushing and barging                t he ms el ve s       into    position,          h o w e v e r , it was as you

n o r m a l l y expect at a big m atch and we m a n a g e d                         to stay together,

          and myself.



I could not see           the      pitch at all and after                       some minutes we all             made

our wa y from         point       1,      indicated on the grid                   (Ex Ref          HRsf     No

down    the    terrace       to    point 2, as            i ndicated on the grid.



During     the time       it took           her    to get from           point      one to point         two and

h aving    got there,         as w X ^ s t o o d        in that        p os it io n for some m i nu te s         I

see people were climbing over the perimeter fence onto the pitch and 1

thought at that           time         that    I had to get             out of the       pen.

apparent       that    the    crowd         crush was       so bad we            could not move          either

could not move at all,                    just my h^ad and neck.                      I was     very f r ig h t e n e d

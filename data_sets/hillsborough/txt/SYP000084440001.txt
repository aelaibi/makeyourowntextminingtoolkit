F r o m 2. 3 0 p m / ( 1430)    onwards my father             I couXd see that           the   op posite

end,    the Lappings Ln stan ding area,                   was jb &earning very f u l l.              We

remarked       on the d e s c re pa nc y betw e e n the           central        pens w h i c h were

tigh t l y    packed and the side            pens,    adjacent,         w h i c h were     comparativeIy

empty.         I am a life        long supporter           of N o t t i n g h a m Forest an d have

e x p er ie nc ed    crowds at     football matc h e s          throt^yhout the          country,      and ye I

1 wa s s ur p r i s e d a t the        lack of even d i s t r j/bution w i t h i n the Lepp i n g s

Ln te r race.



After    the m at c h had started            I saw      p e o p 1 e cl im b 1 n g o n t o /C h e p i t c h at

that    end from the           central    pens and       I a s s u m e d as did many there,               that

it was       crowd disorder.             There was     little or no use o V the ground
                                                                        V     '
public addr e s s       system,        initially,     so that it was not until about

f i f t e e n minu t e s after     the match      had been s t o p p e d w hen we saw              people

being    carried on m ak es h i f t         s t retchers across            the    pitch,   that we

realised       there were        casualties.



I realised that          there were         numbers      of    people      injured and tfecyded to

try and get          onto the     pitch to see          if I could assist             in any/way.           3.

made my way to the              front and having           been at first           d i r e c t e d to the   back

of the stand by a p o liceman was a l l o w e d onto                       the    pitch/by a more

senior       officer.



I first a p p r o a c h e d     casualties      lying      near    to the        corners    of the S p i o n

X o p and N or th S t a n d      on the g r o u n d .         T here were afoout five           or si;-:

bodies       here,    all white males          ranging        in age    between about          12 years and

35 years,       beyond this         I cannot     really d e s c r i p/e them or their               clothing.
                                                                       /
I e x a m in ed and tried         to    resuscitate        these     people,       but   in my opin i o n
                                                                                                                                      PAGE
                                                                                                                                      S2870

                   they were              dead before any attempt                      on my part       to    revive       them.      From m

                   e x a mi na t io n          I s u r mised       this:-       they were         wanosed          (i.e.    blue    in the

                   face)?        had       ’ petechiae*            across     their      fac./s,      (i.e.    small       red spots       on

                   the    skin or small                  blood vessels w hi c h have                  ruptured)       a siqn of a

                   crush        injury,* were              not     breathing and did not have                      pulses.         The y were
                                =     -
                   victims           of    crush        injuries         in my opinion.

He was       tensed because               of the    fit and his         teeth were           clenched tigh t l y

a fit of this kind and after a superficial                                    e x a m i n a t i o n found no sign

F r o m my     ex a m i n a t i o n of him and his a p p e a r a n c e             I w ould say that              he had

w h ic h    is an attempt          to a s p i ra te any fluid a r o u n d           the heart?        but    this

did not       render an y fluid and a chest                     x-ray was       ordered.            The   x-ray

was    n ec es s a r y    in order       to det e r m i n e    if he was       suffering         from any

puncture       to the       lungs.



I   left this j i a n       at    this    point     in order      to see       if I could as s i s t any

other       casualties and other                senior    doctors       took over          the   resuscitation

resuscitated?             but    I do not know what             h a p p e n e d to him after?         but    I do

not    think     he w ou l d have survived.                   Everything        that       could have       been

done       for him had been done without                      improving       his   condition.

Dear Sirs,

Re:   Anthony Dennis Leigh - Hillsborough Disaster

We refer to the above matter and enclose herewith copy of our Client's Statement
relating to his treatment at the hands of the Sheffield Police.

Our Client has nothing but praise for the manner in which hewas treated by the West
Midlands Constabulary.

We would be obliged to hear from you as to whether a "view" has been formulated upon
the validity of claims for shock by relatives who witnessed the incidents upon
television.

We would also be obliged to hear from you as to whether any view has                                                                    yet been
formulated upon the submission of applications for Legal Aid.


Yours faithfully,

 I make this statement to ny Solicitor, Me Keith ^ v i n ,of Keith Levin 5 Co,

 and in relation to the treatment that X sutt#MH3.:■.«*,the hands of the South

 Yorkshire Police, and also the behaviour of .-th* Police that I witnessed, on

 Saturday 15th April 1989.


 I travelled to the match with my two frianda,J                        land                 , who
 ate brothers, and who both live at                                i Huyton, Liverpool L36.

 We caught the normal train from Liverpool to Sheffield.                  It was our intention

 to have a pleasant day out, and to spend gone tinw in Sheffield City Centre

 before going to the match.                                    ■'£■:


 ■fte train arrived in Sheffield at 10.30am, and after ve got off the train,

 problems started          irrrediately.      Me   found' that along with other Liverpool

 Supporters    we    were physically h o rd ed         like what   I can only describe        as

 cattle.      we    were     prevented     by the Police    from’ the leaving        the railway

station, although we wanted to do so.


Along with the other supporters at tha railway station, we were forced aboard

double decker buses which had been laid on/ to £*ftrry fana feem the railway

station    to the ground         itself.      I felt    that we h^d no choice whatsoever

otherthan to board those buses,               j would go,as fat,a3 to paying that had we
                                                     .;  iv.VS.   '    ‘•
not agreed to board those buses, then we would ainply have had to caught the

next train back to Liverpool.              In effect, there was'^no choice at all.


Accordingly,       we got on theae special buses and where taken to Hillsborough.

Wie return fare was £1 , and again we were given no choice, we had to pay the

fare or go     honw.


We arrived at the Hillsborough ground at about 11.00am.                       We wandered around

the Leppings Lane area, simply to kill tine.               We went into a little shop, and

bought something to eat.          I did not see any trouble whatsoever.
At           2.20pm the tnreo oi us returned.tP ^ B o r o u g h ^                                               t0 9° 1B*

police officers came over to me and they picked me up, in uhat I can only

describe as a rough Banner.    Itiey thrswf      me into some advertising hoardings

at the side of the pitch: and at the aame time they were saying words to the

effect 'get off the fucking pitch1 or 'get him off the fucking pitch1, and am

not absolutely certain which of those two versions ware used.                        However, the

inpression that I got was one ojf ag^teasion- -tcftja^cls •me by those two police

officers, and certainly they were not treating na-gentUyt                  or kindly, bearing

in mind the state that I was in.                  -V             fta


After I had been thrown into tha advartiaing board by the above two police

officers,   I could hear people in the crowd "Shouting to the police officers

not to be so rough, and that tlwre v«re probletna.


After thati I had l'ittle invo 1vement with                  jjce at Sheffield.


I would add that I have no complaints whatsoever with regard to the West

fact they treated me very kindly and with tha'i ^ v ‘courteay.

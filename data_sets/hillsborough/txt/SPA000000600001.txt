SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE AUTHORITY - 9 AUGUST 1991

REPORT OF THE CLERK AND FINANCIAL OFFICER

The Police (Discipline) (Senior Officers) Regulations 1985


1   Matter for Consideration
1.1 Members are asked to consider the investigation into complaints made against
    AlC Mr Walter Jackson by Mr Trevor Hicks arising out of the Hillsborough
    tragedy. The complaints are:
     1    That he failed to take control of the disaster.
     2     That he may have colluded with Chief Superintendent Duckenfield to
          mislead the public and Senior Police Officers in respect of the openinq
          of Gate C in Leppings Lane.
2   Background
2.1 The investigation into these complaints by Mr Lesley Sharpe, Chief Constable
    of Cumbria, (the Investigating Officer) was completed last year and at that
    time the Police Complaints Authority who supervised the investigation
    confirmed that the complaints have been thoroughly and satisfactorily
    investigated.
2.2 At the Authority’s meeting in September 1990 it was resolved to defer
    consideration of the complaints because of the advisability of dealing with
    them in unison with complaints made against other Officers but of lesser
    rank for which the Authority is not the Disciplinary Authority. These other
    complaints also arose out of the tragedy.
2.3 Subsequently at its meeting in October 1990 the Authority resolved to defer
    further consideration of the complaints until the inquests had been
    completed. The reason for this was the possibility of fresh evidence
    emerging at the inquests which might have a bearing on the complaints
    against Mr Jackson. None did emerge.
^   ! ! ? « . decisions have been taken on the complaints against the other
    Officers it is appropriate and urgent that a decision is taken on the
    complaints against Mr Jackson: Urgent because of the debilitating effect
    delay and uncertainty causes.
3   The.Authority*s Position as Disciplinary Authority
    The Authority is the Disciplinary Authority for Officers at and above the
    rank of Assistant Chief Constable. Its position in this regard is governed
    by the Police (Discipline) (Senior Officers) Regulations 1985. Under those
    regulations the Authority must consider the Investigating Officers report,
    that is a report of Mr Sharp, which is Appendix 1 and determine whether it
    appears that Mr Jackson may have committed an offence. If it does so appear
    the Authority must then consider whether disciplinary proceedings need to be
    taken. The statements and documents accompanying the investigating officers
    report and which are referred to in the report will be available at the
    meeting but have not been copied because of their volume.

 4     The Investigating Officers Report (Appendix 1)
       Coroplaint that ACC Hr Jackson failed to take control of the disaster
4.1 The Investigating officers consideration of this complaint commences at
    paragraph R32. Members will note at paragraphs R35 and R36 of the report
    that the Investigating Officer has concluded that if the Director of Public
    Prosecutions concludes that no criminal charge of Culpable Malfeasance or
    Manslaughter is appropriate then an offence of "neglect of duty" for failinq
    to take control of the disaster cannot be substantiated. The Director of
    Jackson     C U n S haS decided not to bring any criminal charges against Mr

4.2 It is also relevant for members to consider whether a charge substantially
    Innnpctc asT.neglect °f.duty" has bee*1 rejected by the Jury at the Coroners
             ^ l u i an ° P ^ on of manslaughter by neglect was left for the
               • e*!?ury~ he same issues which they considered would have to be
    considered in the offence of neglect of duty. Those issues have been
    thJcTlS?   iy the Jury  ?S "an isaccident" n°t unlawful killing. Therefore on
    this test also      complaint      not substantiated.

      guckenfield to mislead the public and Senior Police Officers in respect, nf

4.3 The disciplinary offence which has to be considered in this complaint is
    th c8™    °r preyarication and the Investigating Officers consideration of
    this commences at paragraph R37 of his report.                 ucrau.on or
4.4 Members will note atparagraph R67that the InvestigatingOfficer concludes
      J r * s insufficient evidence available to show thltthlre wls InJ
     collusion between Mr Jackson and Chief Superintendent Duckenfield.
5 Conclusion
      On the evidence of the Investigating Officers report, and there is nothina
      which has transpired since to offend this evidence, indeed quite the
      contrary as far as the first complaint is concerned given the decision of

                     00 dlscipiinary offences have been committed, no disciplinary
      proceedings are appropriate.                                        uisu^im ary

  CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING CQMPI.ATHTS




 R1     On 15 April 1989 a Football Association Cup Semi

 Final match was played between Liverpool and Nottingham

 Forest Football Clubs at the neutral Sheffield

 Wednesday ground at Hillsborough.   It is well

 documented that shortly after ’kick-off’ the match was

 abandoned due to crushing in pens 3 and A of the

 Leppings Lane/West Stand terraces, which resulted in

 the death of 95 Liverpool Supporters and injuries to

 many others.




 R2    As a result of the tragedy Hr G J DEAR, QPM,

 Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police was

 appointed to investigate the disaster and to collate

 evidence for H M Coroner and for a Judicial Inquiry

which was carried out by Lord Justice TAYLOR.     On 27

September 1989 following submission of the TAYLOR

Interim Report into the disaster to the Director of

Public Prosecutions Mr DEAR agreed to accept additional

responsibility for the criminal and disciplinary

aspects of the investigation.   On 1 April 1990, with

the retirement of Mr DEAR, these responsibilities were

transferred to Mr L SHARP, QPM, LLB, Chief Constable of

Cumbria.




R3    Because the deaths and injuries occurred at the

Leppings Lane end of Hillsborough Stadium, this report

concentrates on the Liverpool supporters and the events

which surrounded them on the day of the disaster.

                         the information in report form at the pre-match

                         briefing.

Page 20
                         circulated by Walter JACKSON, Assistant Chief Constable

                         (Operations), South Yorkshire Police, in which he

                         details recommended routes to Sheffield, parking

                        arrangements, search procedures and opening times for

                        the ground.     The letter asked supporters to arrive

                        between 1030 hours and 1400 hours to ensure they were

                        in the ground for the start of the match at 1500 hours,

                        and indicated that ticketless fans should not attend.



Document A
                        R7     The Liverpool Football Club’s programing for the

Pages 21-22             home game at Anfield on 8 April 1989 contained an

                        article in the same vein and this was repeated in media

                        broadcasts and publications, both locally and

                        nationally.
                            R8     Some 102 coaches containing Liverpool supporters

                            travelled to Sheffield on 15 April 1989.    Most of these

                           were accompanied by a Liverpool steward and either

  Statement Pages 11-17     they, or the drivers were advised prior to departure

                           about the arrangements in South Yorkshire.     Additional

                           arrangements were made by Merseyside Police.




                           R9     The largest proportion of supporters travelled in

                           private or hire cars, vans and mini-buses.     It is

                           impossible to quantify these vehicles numerically but

                           there were no significant traffic delays to cause late

                           arrival of fans in Sheffield.   This matter is

                           considered again later in this report.   A detailed

Documents 5-6
                           report from British Transport Police confirms that one

Pages 23-29
                          special train and three service trains from Liverpool

        30-53             conveyed 825 supporters to Sheffield, and other trains

                          from other areas brought the total to 1,337.




                          RIO    By comparison, 1,932 Nottingham Forest supporters

                          travelled by a combination of special and service

                          trains to attend the match.   The conclusion was that

                          the supporters were happy and good natured with few

                          signs of intoxication.



Statement Pages           Rll    There is evidence of Liverpool and other

18-21
                          supporters procuring and consuming alcohol en route to

22-24                     the game.
                          R12    Despite the entreaties for fans to arrive early

                          (previously referred to) some of the gates into

                          Hillsborough Stadium were not opened until 1130 hours
Statement Pages 25-?7
                          and some even later than that.    Fans were already in

                          Sheffield and drinking alcohol by 0845 hours.




Statement Pages
                         R13     There are many descriptions of the hehaviour of
28-31
                         .supporters in various parts of Sheff4e1ri but
32-33
                         predominantly in the area within two miles or so from
34-35
                         the ground between 0845 hours and 1500 hours.      They
36-37
                         present a picture of drinking, boisterous and rowdy
38-41
                         behaviour, some drunkeness and urinating in public and

                         secluded places.    But not all of the statements are

                         critical, some praise the behaviour of Liverpool

                         supporters.    At one location seven dustbin liners were

                         collected full of cans, bottles and other alcoholic

                        drink containers, and that was on one garage

                        forecourt.     One public house sold out of beer.




                        R14     As part of the policing arrangements on 15 April

                        1989 many of the public houses within one mile radius

                        of the stadium were closed for the sale of alcohol.

                        Those licensed premises which did open instigated

                        various controls on the door but the further away from

                        the stadium the premises are situated, the more

                        attractive they were to supporters wishing to drink.

                        The further away from the stadium the premises are

                        situated, the more likely was a late arrival at the
                      stadium.   This may have put more customer pressure on

                      other retail outlets where alcohol is sold and police

  Statement Pages
                      control is more difficult.     Most of the supermarkets

  42-43
                      and off-licenses did open and they sold a considerable
  44-48
                     amount of drink on the da y .   Public houses and
  49-53
                     off-sales describe the significant increases in

                     their takings on 15 April 1989.     The pattern of this

                     evidence is that whilst sales increased considerably,

                     in general the behaviour of the supporters was good

                     although there were incidents of very bad behaviour.




                     R15    This bad behaviour was perhaps naturally more

                     acute nearest to the stadium.     People living near to

                     any football stadium are well accustomed, some would

                     say long-suffering, to the disruption which occurs in

                     their neighbourhood when a football match takes place.

                    By reason of their experience the local residents

                    develop the ability to identify those teams whose

                    supporters cause them the most trouble.     Given the

                    dangers of bias, prejudice and stereotyping, as a

                    result some supporters are attributed with a group

                    reputation, but the local residents are in a position

                    to compare and balance the behaviour of various

                    supporters week by week, and even year by year.




                    R16    On the day in question a picture emerges of cars

                    being parked early, those roads nearest to the stadium

Statement Pages     at the Leppings Lane end (the Liverpool end) being full

54-58               of parked cars by 1100 hours.    A considerable rnnnnnt r»f
  59-64
                      alcohol was seen being carried and consumed.     Fans were
  65-70
                      seen walking towards the stadium with little or no

  71-74
                      chance of belne there for the start of th» p«mB       There

                      Is some evidence that on 15 April 1989 at the Leppings

                      Lane turnstiles the behaviour of the fans was the worst

                      ever seen.     Through the eyes of the local residents the

                     Liverpool supporters were generally more badly behaved

                     in 1989 than they were on the occasion of the

                     semi-final In 1988; the bad behaviour was influenced by

                     alcohol; and too many fans arrived late.




                     R17   But from the evidence of witnesses it is not at

                     all clear that the only cause for the fans late arrival

                     at the Leppings Lane turnstiles was drink-related.      The

                     day of the match was warm and sunny with a temperature

                     of 12 degrees Celsius or 53.6 degrees Fahrenheit.      Many

                     of the supporters attending the match were intent upon

                    enjoying a traditional pre match drink.      In some cases

                    the alcohol led to rowdy, boisterous or disorderly

                    behaviour, in others it led to a reluctance to leave

                    licensed premises until the last minute.     However,
Statement
            Zages   although traffic volume was heavy on all approach

                    routes and traffic delays w e re not a serious problem,
22-24
                    some traffic hold-ups did occur to cause late arrival
75-83
                    at the ground.     The police search operation inevitably
84-88
                    caused some delay to some supporters, for example the

                    search of one private mini-bus took twenty minutes to

                    complete, the occupants arriving at the ground at 1455
                        hours.     On balance it is likely that one cause of late

                        arrivals at the Leppings Lane turnstiles was

                        drink-related.     The build-up started at about 1420

      Document 7        hours and continued until Gate C was opened at 1452

      (Video)           hours.

      Schedule Pages

      54-56             R18      The evidence suggests that very many of the fans

                        who arrived at the ground after 1430 hours, had been

                        drinking at public houses or from containers brought

ft                      from home or bought from off-licenses and other retail

                        outlets.    But there is little evidence of arrestable

                        drunkenness and there is no evidence of wide-scale

                        prosecutable drunkenness.    There was certainly an

                        element in the crowd outside the Leppings Lane

                       turnstile who were the worse for drink but the evidence

                       suggests that element was in a minority.     That element

                       contained young people influenced by drink who were

                       pushing shoving and weaving about among the crowd

                       either through impatience or bravado and there seems

                       little doubt that those arriving at Leppings Lane at a

                       time nearest to the kick-off had drunk the most and

                       were the worst behaved.     This "late arrival element"

                       would have been most likely to be among those who

                       entered the ground through Gate C at 1452 hours and

     Document 8        made their way to the back of pens 3 and 4.     Of the

     Pages 57-63       95 who died in pens 3 and 4 it can be shown that 23

     Statement Pages   entered through Gate C after 1452 hours and of these

     89-98             some had significantly high blood/alcohol levels, but

     Document 9        to deduce more than that from the evidence available

     Page 64           would be no more than speculation.
                        R19      A not unrelated difficulty was caused by fans

                        arriving without tickets despite the all-ticket nature

                       R21      From the turnstile count print-out it is possible

                       to calculate the number of fans outside Leppings Lane

                       turnstiles just before the opening of Gate C at 1452

                       hours.    The estimate is 3,264 still waiting to enter

                       the ground.     Add to that the estimated 2,000 non-ticket

                      holders and there is a potential crowd of 5,246 still

                      to come into the stadium just before the opening of

                      Gate C.




                      R22     The calculation as to the number of ticketless

                      fans who entered the stadium at the Leppings Lane end

                      is open to dispute.     There is a considerable amount of

                      evidence which suggests that there were frequent

                      requests and negotiations for tickets during the time

                      that the crowd build up outside       Leppings Lane

                      turnstile.     The police officers    intervened on   many
  occasions in the interests of preventing obstruction

  and to detect forged tickets.   Many of the supporters

  moved on in this fashion, returned, predominantly to

  the bridge area over the River Don.   From the CCTV

  video evidence there was a large number of fans

  loitering in the area outside of Gate C making no

 attempt to enter through the turnstiles.   That may have

 been because they were waiting for the crush to clear

 before presenting their tickets at the turnstile, but

 it may have been the case that they had no tickets to

 present and were waiting the opportunity to buy a

 ticket or enter the ground ’illegally."




 R23    It has been suggested that as the kick off time

 approached, the West Terraces and the North Stand still

had many spaces in pens 1 and 2, 6 and 7 and the North

Stand seats, the Liverpool supporters accommodation.

Because the match was "all-ticket" and a "sell out"

these spaces must indicate that there were many ticket

holders still to come into the stadium and that would

account for the large crowd still outside the Leppings

Lane turnstiles.   If those spaces had been filled by

about 1420 hours it would have indicated that the large

crowd outside the turnstiles had no tickets, but these

spaces were still empty at that time.




R24    In an attempt to resolve the matter account has

been taken of the Club’s electronic monitoring system.

This shows that a total of 7,038 people passed through
              turnstiles A-G, the entrance to the West Terraces.

              However, the counting mechanism on turnstile G was

              defective. ■The Health and Safety Executive from a

              study of the CCTV film which portrays turnstiles A-G

              and Gate C, estimated that as many as 7,644 people

              entered through turnstiles A-G but that estimate is

              based upon not only a "head-count* of the video film

              but also a projection of figures from other

              turnstiles.   Again using the video film, the Health and

             Safety Executive estimated that as many as 2,480 people^

             entered the ground through exit Gate C.    The best

             estimate available from the Health and Safety Executive

             is that 10,124 people entered through turnstiles A-G

             and Gate C.    However, this estimate does not take into

             account those people with tickets for the West Terraces

             who were allowed through turnstiles 1-16, and other

             factors such as the opening of Gate A, which distort

             the figures.   Bearing in mind that 10,100 tickets were

             sold for the West Terraces, the evidence, such as it

            is, does suggest that non-ticket holders entering the

            West Terraces (the Liverpool end) could have been as

            high as 2,000 or as low as 200.    It is impossible to be

            more precise.

                        R27        The first complaint by Mr HICKS was made on 24

                       August 1989 in a formal statement to Mr Kenneth Philip

                       Douglas COOPER, Assistant Chief Constable,

                       Northamptonshire Constabulary, when he saw Mr HICKS in

                       relation to an earlier complaint against Chief

                       Superintendent David Godfrey DUCKENFIELD.       Mr COOPER

                       was appointed to investigate that complaint by

Document 11            ■j^fcter dated 25 July 1989, under the supervision of

Page 89
                       Captain E N TAYLOR from the Police Complaints Authority

Document 12            who ratified that appointment and informed Mr HICKS by

Page 90                Ag-tter dated 4 August 1989.      Details of the complaint

                       are as follows




                       a)         That you failed to take control of the disaster.
                R28     Subsequent to this interview Mr COOPER received
  Document
               IStter dated 5 September 1989 from Captain TAYLOR
  Page 91
                informing him that the enquiry would be dealt with by

               another force.     On 27 September following protracted

               negotiations, responsibility for all criminal and

               disciplinary aspects of the investigation into the

               Hillsborough disaster, including the complaints by Mr

               HICKS, were passed to Mr DEAR for enquiries by Vest

               Midlands Police.




               R29     Arising from that transfer of responsibility, Mr

               HICKS was re-interviewed on 22 November 1989 by

               Detective Superintendent TAYLOR with a view to

               clarification of the complaint against Chief

               Superintendent DUCKENFIELD.    He then made a second

              complaint against Assistant Chief Constable Mr JACKSON

              as follows:-




              b)      That he may have colluded with Chief

                      Superintendent DUCKENFIELD to mislead the public

                      and senior police officers in respect of the

                      opening of Gate C in Leppings Lane.

                   R32    That he failed to take control of the disaster,



Statement Pages    R33    This complaint is made only by Mr Htrirs and he

137-162
                   explains it by a description of the events on the day

                   as seen through his eyes, and from a consideration of

                   the evidence heard by Lord Justice TAYLOR at the Public

                   Inquiry, which leads him to conclude that Mr JACKSON

                  neglected to discharge his duties relating to the

                  staging of the semi-final at Hillsborough on 15 April

                  1989.




                  R34     The disciplinary offence which has to be

                  considered iss-




                  Neglect of Duty.




                  Being a member of a police force without good and

                  sufficient cause neglected or omitted to attend to or

                  carry out with due promptitude and diligence anything

                  which it is his duty as a member of a police force to
                      attend to or carry out, viz he failed to take control

                      of the disaster at Hillsborough stadium on 15 April

                      1989.




                     Contrary to the Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985

                     Schedule 1 Regulation 4(i) paragraph 4fa).




                     R35      The evidence to support such a disciplinary

                     charge is the same as is currently being considered by

                     the Director of Public Prosecutions in respect of Mr

                     JACKSON’S culpability for Manslaughter or Culpable

                     Malfeasance.    The offence of Manslaughter requires

                     proof of a high level of gross negligence or

                     recklessness, but the offence of Culpable Malfeasance

                     requires proof only of neglect of a duty.    Should the

                     Director decide that there is insufficient evidence to

                     prosecute for those criminal offences then the same

                    must be said in respect of the disciplinary offence of

                    Neglect of Duty.




                    R36    In that case this complaint is unsubstantiated.



                    R37    That he may have colluded with Chief

Statement i M e s   Superintendent DUCKENFIELD to mislead the nublic and

163-175
                    senior police officers in respect of the opening of

                    Gate C in Leppings Lane.



Statement Pages     R38    This complaint is made only by Mr HICKS and he

137-162             explains it by saying that he doubts whether Mr JACKSON
  was unaware that Gate C had been opened by police at

  1452 hours because he can see no reason why Chief

  Superintendent DUCKENFIELD would not have told him that

  this had occurred.




  R39    The disciplinary offence which has to be

  considered is:-




 Falsehood or Prevarication.




 Being a member of a police force knowingly colluded

 with Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD on 15 April 1989

 to make a false, misleading or inaccurate oral

 statement that Gate C at Hillsborough stadium had been

 forced open by football supporters at 1452 hours on 15

 April 1989, whereas the gate had in fact been opened on

 the instructions of Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD.




Contrary to the Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985,

Schedule 1. Regulation 4(i). paragraph 5(a).




R40     Although the evidence to support this

disciplinary charge forms a part of the evidence

submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions to

consider the culpability of Mr JACKSON for the criminal

offences of Manslaughter or Culpable Malfeasance,

should the Director decide that there is insufficient

evidence to prosecute these criminal offences, it would

still be possible to prosecute the disciplinary charge

of Falsehood or Prevarication.

                        R41     On 15 April 1989, and before, Mr JACKSON was the
  Pages 94-103
                        Assistant Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police

                        with specific responsibilities for Operations,

                        including the policing of football matches at

                        Hillsborough.   He had produced the South Yorkshire

                      R42      On that date he was on duty and “on call* in the

                      sense that he was the nominated Chief Officer for the

                      force available to deal with any matter which required

                      the personal attention of a Chief Officer.     He was in

                      plain clothes and after some routine duties to satisfy

                      himself that the plan for policing the semi-final

                      football match was progressing satisfactorily he went

                      to the Police Control Bo* at Hillsborough and briefly

                      spoke to Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD.    The time

                      was shortly after 1400 hours and the only occurrence of

                   comparison with the Nottingham Forest supporters in the

                   Spion Kop.



 Document 16       R43    Mr JACKSON took his seat in the South Stand near

 Pages 94-103      to a point over the players * tunnel and saw nothing

                   untoward until after the match had started and fans

                  were coming onto the perimeter track through the

                   perimeter fence at the front of the West Terraces.     The

                  match was still in progress and he left his seat

                  promptly and went to the Police Control Box, arriving

                  at about 1507 hours, the match having been stopped by

                  then.




                  R44     He was in the Control Box for a very short time,

Statement Pages   just long enough to enquire of Chief Superintendent

163-175           DUCKENFIELD as to what was happening.    The response was

                  inconclusive and seemed to suggest that some sort of

                  pitch invasion was occurring, so he went onto the pitch

                  to find out for himself.



Statement Pages   R45     Here he spoke to Superintendent GREENWOOD and

176-187           learned of the injuries and fatalities so he returned

                  to the Control Box to ensure that ambulances and

                  resources (Operation Support) had been sent for.



Document 25       R46    He acknowledges that at that moment he was in

Page 592          overall command of the incident and began to implement

                  the Major Incident Plan.   At that time he was aware

                  that crushing had occurred due to overcrowding but was
                    unaware that Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD had

                    approved the opening of Gate C or any other gates.




                    R47   At about 1515 hours he was present in the Police

 Statement Pages    Control Box, which was extremely busy, when Mr Graham

 188-198            KELLY and Mr Glen KIRTON of the Football Association

 199-208            came in, accompanied by Mr Graham MACKRELL. Secretary

 209-231            to Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.




                   R48    They spoke to Mr JACKSON and to Chief

                    Superintendent DUCKENFIELD and although he was engaged

Document 16        with other matters, Mr JACKSON believes that it was on

Pages 94-103       this occasion that Chief Superintendent DUCKENFTRT.n

Statement Pages    told Mr KELLY that Liverpool supporters had forced open

163-175            C gate and had flooded into the ground.




                   R49    There is no evidence at all that Chief

                   Superintendent DUCKENFIELD told any of the visitors to

                   the Control Box that police had opened Gate C, or any

                   other gates, on his express approval.




                   R50    At 1530 hours Mr JACKSON was present in the Board

                   Room when Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD explained

                   his reasons for not wanting the decision to abandon the

                   match, to be made public knowledge.   Mr JACKSON

Document 25        explains that when he entered the Boardroom he believed

Pages 615          that fans had broken down a gate and had forced entry

                   into the ground, he was not aware that Chief

                   Superintendent DUCKENFIELD had authorised the opening
                    of any exit gates; and that was still his belief when

                    he left the Boardroom.




                    R51     On return to the Police Control Box he continued

                    to implement the Major Incident Plan and at about 1545

                    hours, when the injured and dead were being safely

                    dealt with, he called his ground Commanders to him,

 Statement Pages    including Superintendent MARSHALL*    While Mr-JACKSON

 232-252           was debriefing them, the then Chief Constable, Mr Peter

                   WRIGHT, made contact by telephone, to find out what had

                    been going on.    As Mr JACKSON was speaking to Mr

Document 26        WRIGHT, Superintendent MARSHALL explained how Gate C

Pages 652-795      had been opened at his request.     The time at that

Document 25        moment was about 1615 hours although it could have been

Page 643           as early as 1600 hours, and that was the first

                   occasion, so he claims, that Mr JACKSON was aware of

                   the true circumstances surrounding the opening of Gate

                   C at 1452 hours.




                   R52      Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD has refused to

                   answer any questions about this or any other matter,

                   but the following matters of evidence are significant.




                   R53     Mr MACKRELL was on the pitch as the Liverpool

                   team came out of the playing tunnel at 1454 hours.      At

Statement Pages    about that moment he was approached by i

253-270                   , the Club Security Officer, who told him that Gate

                   C had either been opened or broken down, it is not

                   certain which, and between 300 and 400 fans had got
                      into the ground through the gate.                  had learned

                      this from the Club Control Room where there is

                      a facility for monitoring the CCTV cameras.         It is

                      clear that this reference by              was in respect of

                      the opening of Gate C at 1AA8 hours to eject a

                      non-ticket holder and about 150 fans forced their way

                      into the ground, because at about 1A50 hours Hr LOCK

 Statement Paces     gave the same account to Inspector Trevor       harvby.         gut,

 Pages 271-280       of course, that was unknown to Mr MACKRELL at that

                     time.



 .Statement Paces
                     R5/*    Mr MACKRELL went to investigate, stopping to talk
 Pages 209-231
                     to one or two people about the arrangements for the

                     game, and when he reached Gate C he found it slightly

                     open with a trickle of fans coining through it under the

                     control of a mounted officer.      By the time Mr HACKRELL

                     would have got to Gate C, he would be witnessing the

                     tail-end of the opening authorised by Chief

Statement Paces
                     Superintendent DPCKENFIEl.n at 1A52 hours.      He would not
163-175
                    know that the opening of Gate C he was witnessing was

                    not the same opening reported to him by f        ~      —   if

                            kad referred to the breaking down of a gate, and

                    that is not clear, then the seeds were sown in Hr

                    HACKRELL’S mind that Gate C had been broken down.

                          the Police Control Box at about 1515 hours and despite

                          his own quick visit to the Control Box prior to that,

                         of Liverpool supporters.     He remembers the reference to

                         a CCTV monitor which was showing live pictures of the

                        R64     The delay between receipt of the complaints and

                        the service of notices was as a result of medical

                        advice from the officer’s General Practitioner.




                        R65     When interviewed under caution on 28 June 1990 Hr

                        JACKSON maintained his assertion that he was unaware of

                        the true nature of the opening of Gate C until

                        Superintendent MARSHALL explained it to him at about

                        1615 hours.     The only puzzling issue is Mr JACKSON'S

                        failure to remonstrate with Chief Superintendent

                        DUCKENFIELD once he found out the full and accurate
  situation.   However, there is insufficient evidence

  available to show that there was any collusion between

  Hr JACKSON and Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD in

  respect of the opening of Gate C, or any other gate.

  This complaint is, therefore, unsubstantiated.

DELETED:-

“If I look back on the situation now, I can only believe that even when the Police were faced with a
tragedy o f such enormity, that it was only the professionalism o f the Force that prevented the deaths
o f further persons, the obvious consequences o f a massive pitch invasion.
The following day, I was engaged on relative reception at Forbes Road Church Hall, and
Comers(sic) Enquiries under the supervision o f Superintendent Sleath.

QUESTION 8
I have attended football matches at Hillsborough for the past six years and I have been engaged on
all duties, but in the main I have performed duties as Video Camera Operator in the Control Box,
and Serial 1 on the pitch. During my time as Camera Operator, I have been on duty at previous semi­
finals and large games and although I have not had the opportunity to view these videos, I couM
make a comparison if required to do so in respect o f crowd behaviour at Leppings Lane.

ADDENDUM
For information, I have since been back to Hillsborough Police Station Box and given advice
to Lord Justice Taylor and Mr. Deer, Chief Constable o f West Midlands Constabulary, as to the
equipment controls at that location”. (Pp. 183-184)

     bit for today.           I was        only too glad to go,               but because         I was very

     familiar with the f ootball                 g r ou n d a n d     its    duties      I went    round to the

POLICE CONSTABLE 1079




At    9.15     a.m.     Saturday      15    April      1989,    I     arrived      at   Sheffield     Wednesday

Football Club, Hillsborough to perform uniform duties in connection with the

semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham.                            I had been pre-warned that I

was    on Serial        1,    which      is a duty performed            on       the running    track of the

pitch, under the supervision of Police Sergeant Chapman (*F * Division Plain

Clothes)      and Inspector Darling.                  I had performed this duty on a number of

previous occasions and was familiar with the overall plan and general 'set

up' at Hillsborough.

Due to the large number of officers on duty that day, I got a warm drink and

took my place in the North Stand in preparation for the briefing.                                     I quickly

identified          other     members      of   my    Serial     and    Police      Sergeant     Chapman    was

checking people off.

At 9.^5 a.m. all officers were briefed by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield
                   0
and a number of other senior officers, followed by an Intelligence briefing

by Detective Sergeant Charlesworth.                     After the briefing we were all supplied

with a light packed meal and instructed that all officers should be on their

points by no later than 11.15 a.m. a point that was emphasised.

At    11.00 a.m.       I took up position on the pitch midway between the player's

tunnel and the          E     Stand and Spion Kop.             I don't recall the exact time but I

remember thinking that the spectators were entering early and I took this as

a good       sign    that     the   turnstiles        were     open    early,      rather    than   the   often

hurried hunt up of turnstile operators                         to open up and get people off the

streets.         I    remained      in     this      position    doing       a    general    patrol    between

player s tunnel and             'E' Stand.           During that time I saw several VIP guests

arrive     and       talked    generally        with    the     cameraman/sports            personalities/TV

people.
                                                                                                                   C   22.0
                                                        -2-

Between     1.20 p.m.      and approximately 1.45 p.m.                  I had a cooked meal in the

gymnasium behind the North Stand.

At   1.45   p.m.      approximately,             I went      back    out onto   thepitch      and    I was

immediately     aware       that   there was           already a good number           of people       in the

ground and the day's work had begun.

At   2.00   p.m.      a    Steward       pointed       out    to me    a group of      3 or    4 Liverpool

supporters that were seated in the                        front of the South Stand.            I knew that

with it being a capacity crowd that                      there was no chance of transferring them

into another part of the                ground so I decided             to speak      to them and found

that they were         from Northern Ireland and seemed decent                       lads. I advised them

to take off their Liverpool scarves and                         told them very firmly that should

Liverpool     score,       not    for    them     to      jump up cheering      as    this    would        cause

problems and I would have to eject them.                       I continued walking up and down my

beat and as such striking up several short conversations with people on the

first   few   rows.        This    was       a   policy      that   Chief    Superintendent         Mole    had

encouraged     that    I    think       he    rightly     believed     set    the    atmosphere      on what

should have been an enjoyable pleasure activity for the fans.                                   I remember

asking one young man who told me he was from London what he had paid for his

ticket, he said £50.00 and I believed him, although I said something to him

like,   "You must         be mad".           I quickly       spotted a good number of Liverpool

supporters in the South Stand and I tried to get round them all, advising

them about cheering.             They all seemed to understand, but it was at the back

of my mind that this could cause problems, but I knew that cross transfer

was impossible.

At 2.30 p.m.       I remember        looking at my watch to see how the numbers were

going, I was surprised to see both the Kop and South Stand apparently full,

but Liverpool accommodation only half full.                         The centre pen on Leppings Lane

was three quarters full (plus) but lots of room in the stands and wings.

Just after 2.30 p.m. I noticed that the upper level of the elevated terrace

(NW) was getting quite full and they had started with the pushing wave.                                       I
thought   how   stupid      they    were    and how easily     it   was   for   someone      to get

seriously hurt.        It's a problem that we have with all the big clubs that

visit us, but fortunately a problem we have managed to overcome with our own

supporters.        It started when the new Kop was opened and at that time I was

employed on Video Camera duties in the Police Control.                    We spent a long time

trying to identify          the culprits that were starting the wave, and we dealt

with   it by putting        several    officers at      the back,   which resulted          in many

ejections and arrests.          We seemed to have cracked that problem within a few

home games and the same went for obscene chanting.                  We seemed to be lucky as

far as racist chants go, even though we have had black players, but we have

always had a policy of 'firm but fair'.

Just after that time (still just after 2.30 p.m.) I remember thinking that

the    Liverpool    train    must    be    late   or   something,   because     of    the   lack of

numbers in the Liverpool end.              I walked down to Police Constable Holmes, who

I saw had a radio.          He said       that there had been loads of bother outside the

ground, I think he said that              they had wrecked a pub somewhere.

By this time the supporters were baiting one another from one end to the
                    O
other and the atmosphere wasn't good, some people seemed particularly bitter

when chanting.        I said to quite a few,           "Do that again and you're out."            I

considered taking one out as an example to see if it would settle them down,

but every time I had strong               words with one, his mates would plead with me

that they would look after him.               I had to speak very firmly         to    some Notts

lads in the South Stand, the noise was so great now that I was having to

shout at the top of my voice.                They were using obscene chants and baiting

the Liverpool fans.          Some were starting to put their legs over the wall as

if to get to the Liverpool             end and I thought that if these identify the

Liverpool supporters         in this       stand there will be some big problems.              The

atmosphere was getting tense              in all areas now and I thought that the game

had better get started soon or we will have a problem.                    It was then it went

through my mind       that there       should be some pre-match entertainment on the
 pitch.       All these people encapsulated here and nothing for them to do.                        I

 was surprised that the big advertising people didn’t lay something on, but I

 thought      that the pitch quality was more important to the game.                     I wasn't

 sure, but I feel as I always have that if you allow the crowd in early you

 need to entertain them.

 At 3.00 p.m. sometime about kick off time (it could have been just before) I

 saw Liverpool fans walking on the running track behind West Stand goal and

 across      to the North Stand seating.             They were jumping over the wall, but

 they then started to come back.               I immediately thought that there was going

 to be a pitch invasion.              I hadn't a radio so I couldn't monitor what was

 going off.         I saw more of them behind the goal but there was quite a few

 Police Officers       there, no one seemed to be hurrying with anything, I just

 couldn't work       out what       was    going   off.   I remember      feeling    quite   angry,

 thinking, "What the bloody hell is going off, get them arrested or get them

 back in the terraces".             I thought shall I go up and see what’s the matter,

 but by this time the crowd behind me had seen the fans invading the pitch.

The Notts fans were seething and all I could hear was, "We'll never get back

 into fucking Europe",            "Those cunts again, fucking Heysel again."            The Notts

fans   were    shouting     to me     directly     now:   "Stop   the   bastards."     They were

pointing to the goal.         None of us, including the fans, had any idea what was

going off.      I thought if I move from here these fans will be across the wall

and then we have got the Birmingham situation all over again, but I think

that this one has got the potential to be a lot worse.                      I knew I was only

one man, but I seemed to be holding them back, I was pleading with the fans

to sit down and calm down.                Somewhere in the middle of this I saw a senior

officer run onto the pitch and stop the match.                    I thought it will take ages

to get this lot sorted out.                I remember feeling the most frightened I have

ever felt in my Police Service.               I envisaged several thousand people coming

out   onto    the   pitch   and    there    being one almighty massive        public disorder

situation which would clearly lead to the loss of life.                      I thought it was
                                                        -   5   -




only     a    matter    of    time     before    they       were        coming   over    the    wall.    A     few

Liverpool supporters ran down my side of the running track baiting my stand.

I went between them and persuaded them to turn back, it was going against

the grain not to have arrested them but I thought if I do, my stand will be

over.        I probably used foul language in my attempt to turn them back.                                    It

seems    petty     now   but     I   have    this   thought             of curbing      my   language   when    I

remember seeing a sound boom from one of the T.V. cameras.

A Sergeant and Police Constable walked past me from the Leppings Lane end

and I asked,        "What's going off up at the top end?"                            One of them said, "I

don't know but there's loads of bobbies up there."                                 I wish now that I had

relied on my instincts and gone and looked for myself.                                   I have this awful

feeling that I may have been able to have helped.                                I have this feeling that

I am one of the officers that the press have mentioned 'standing about doing

nothing'.

I remember seeing            the players        looking             confused and hanging around on the

pitch.        One of the linesmen or the referee round them up and steered them

into    the tunnel.          I remember         one of them examining some scratches on his

arm,     I    thought    that    one    of      the supporters must               have       attacked   him.    I

reflected what animals we were dealing with.

At   3.05 p.m./3.10 p.m.             approximately,                 I saw several fans coming over the

Leppings Lane end fences and start to walk across the pitch, one or two make

a run.        I can't understand why the Police Constables aren't stopping them

moving       forward.    My     first    idea of    the problem             (gross understatement) was

when' an ambulance rushes onto                  the pitch and pulls              up behind the goal.            I

then see people climbing onto                   the top of it, which              was only confirming my

view of the animals we were dealing with.                              Shortly after that I saw someone

being carried on one of the advertising boards across to the ramp near to

the 0 gate.        Several bobbies were now coming onto the pitch and in a very

orderly file walking along the track of the North Stand.

Still my thoughts are focused intently on a massive pitch invasion and have
we enough officers          to deal with it.          Several officers are now coming onto

the pitch, but they are all going up to the far end.                         I think they want more

even    spreading.         Some    fans     rush    down    towards    me     shouting,       "Murdering

bastards, you've          killed my fucking brother."               I say something like, "What

are you talking about." and I am told then that there must be a dozen people

dead.     Someone shouts          to clear the running track for the ambulances.                      The

photographers have dumped all their gear on the track and I start to pick it

up to make way for the ambulance, but the first one drives straight across

the pitch, so I just throw the rest to the side, thinking how stupid I was

thinking about these blokes' equipment when it now looked as if life really

had been lost.

Several groups were now coming forward towards the Notts fans, baiting them,

shouting at Police Officers,               "Murdering Bastards,         Murdering Bastards".            I

pleaded with them to turn back, most’ did, but I have never seen such anger

on such a large scale before.               I tried to appeal to the Notts fans, telling

them that the situation was very serious, people had lost their lives.                                All

I can remember is people shouting back,                    "The bastards deserve to die, good

fucking riddance."          One Liverpool supporter ran right up to the goal (Spion

Kop end), he had no shirt on, a supporters scarf around his wrist, I think

he had a flat cap on.             My crowd were shouting to me directly, "Get him, get

him.      You'd   better    fucking get him before we do."                   I was glad no Police

Officer    ran    onto     the    pitch    and   chased    him,     that's    just    what    the crowd

wanted.      When    he    was    caught    there    was   a massive        cheer    from    the   crowd.

Liverpool     supporters         were     now    rushing    round     the    ground,        pulling   off

advertising boards and this was really winding the crowd up.                                 I tried to

explain, I thought it would calm them down.                       I again heard something like,

"Another fucking Heysel, them cunts."

The Notts supporters saw the Liverpool supporters swing on the goal cross

bar, it looked as if they were trying to smash it.                          Then they saw the nets

being taken down.          We all, including me, thought that they were being stolen
but it seemed so unimportant now, but the Notts supporters were insensed.                                      I

heard, "They all ought to fucking die".                           Many shout,      "We'll never get back

in Europe".         What       time will         the    game   start?".        I couldn't believe           that

people were asking such pathetic questions.

Some Police Officers started to form a cordon across the pitch, it was very

thin at first,        a bit one sided.                  I joined       it on the left flank but more

officers     joined       it   and     it      started    to   look     like   the    real   thing.     Chief

Inspector Price           appeared        from somewhere on my left and he got the cordon

shaped up, looking something like,                       and we started        to move forwad sweeping

the Liverpool supporters back to their own half, who were by then intent on

causing serious bother with the Notts supporters.                                 We were careful not to

link up just         in    case      we    had    to defend       ourselves       against    the supporters

rushing at us.         The Liverpool supporters (some of them) I could see were in

shock   and   had     lost      all       control,      they were       baiting      the   crowd and didn't

appreciate the overwhelming numbers that could descend upon them.                                      A group

of Police officers moved up into South Stand to remove some Notts supporters

who were      shouting         abuse      at    Liverpool      fans.     All    that I could smell was

alcohol,      people       were      wet       and     sweating    heavily      clearly      a   lot   of    the

supporters were drunk and intent on violence.                             A lot of the ones in shock

were sitting on the floor, they looked harmless and we left them.                                       People

were rushing about with buckets of water, giving people a drink from paper

cups.

By this time I had got close to the goal and I could see the size of the

problem, bodies were laid about everywhere but someone seemed to be helping

everyone, Doctors, Police Constables or ambulance with each.                                     I could hear

the Public      Address         System but           it was    impossible      to hear what was coming

over,   the noise was immense.                    Our cordon broke up as an announcement went

over    to   clear    the      ground,         I can't be sure          I heard      this or someone just

passed it along.

Chief Inspector Price sent two or three Police Constables to find drinking
water     for   the    Police     Officers.      I       remember   him    saying   these    Police

Constables      are    in shock    as well,    they       are   going   to need water soon and

plenty of it.         How right he was.

I can't remember the scene at the fence too well at all, even though I was

there for some time.            All I can remember is people were vindictive                 to the

Police.     People started to leave the ground                  slowly, their heads halfturned

back like ghouls wanting to have that last look.                        My thoughts weren't very

charitable      towards    them.     I was taking the opportunity to snatch a drink

myself now as I looked around to see if I could help anywhere.                       I spotted my

own Inspector         from the Training Department,             Inspector Purdy.      He had lost

his cap, he looked dishevelled, he was tired out, I could see that.                         I asked

him how he was, as he did me.

I heard the radio shouting for officers to clear Leppings Lane, there was

fighting outside.           Inspector Purdy      quickly got         three   serials together,     I

don't think that the officers belonged to that serial, they just formed in

to help.        They were       instructed    to move      the Liverpool      fans back out into

Halifax Road.          I stayed with Inspector Purdy trying to cear the fans out of

the back of Leppings Lane terracing.

They were bitter and very angry towards us.                      I remember one saying to us,

 "I'm a Liverpool PC, you want to learn about crowd control."                         I didn't say

anything to him I just tried            to avoid him,       I putit down      to shock.     Although

I did think what idiot would            go and stand in that lot           on a day off,    he can't

be right in the first place.

We met      one Police Constable,         tall, slim        bloke   with     a black moustache    (I

don't know him).          He was openly crying,            really distraught, all he would say

was,    "Why wouldn't they move back?"               A     Doctor came up to us and said this

man was in shock, he shouldn’t be left                      alone, can't someone stop with him.

The Doctor was in a similar state himself, buthe was still managing to                           keep

 going.     A Police Officer joined the distraught Police Constable and we saw

 them walk back in the direction of the gymnasium.                        I was in something of a
                                                                                                           < 2 2 . 2

daze myself by this time and I made my way back to the gymnasium.

I heard radio messages to the effect that there was fighting in Hillsborough

Park but many units responded and no further assistance was ordered.                                 I went

back to the North Stand to re-group,                    as we anticipated being used for many

other duties that day.

I can    recall      sitting   around       for   quite             some   time   in the North Stand and

eventually      being    briefed,       I    think             by     Chief    Inspector    Beal.     Chief

Superintendent Mole came across the pitch towards us and I think I heard him

say to get these men off home,                they have done their bit for today.                     I was

only    too   glad    to go,    but   because      I was very                 familiar with the football

ground and its duties I went round to the gymnasium to see if I could help,

but    things   looked       very   organised          and          considering     the   enormity   of   the

situation I considered it looked a very professional set up.                                I retired from

duty at approximately 6.45 p.m.

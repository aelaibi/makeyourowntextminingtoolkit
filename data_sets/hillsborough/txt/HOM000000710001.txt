I saw my fr i e n d                                       there.         This w o u l d have been about a

minute     after 3 o'cl o c k               (1501      hrs).       The game       had just ki c k e d off,


                                                                                         v>V>- •
I   saw people             climbing       over      the   barriers         from the West S t a n d onto            the
                                                                                         c ' . ’
pitch.       The F o r e s t         fans      near us were          saying      t h e r e ’s people d ead and %

I said     I ’m s u r p r i s e d t h e r e ’s not            people      dead outside.



I could see           people         lying      on the        pitch who were         o b v i o u s l y dead and        I,s
                                                                                                                         V-a

                                                                                                                               ■

ma n who     he'd          carried from          the Wes t       s tand to a space on the                 pitch near

the N o r t h Stand,              but   the m a n die d a n d the ma n help i n g                 just    fell   over

and   put his         head        in his       hands.



I saw a b o u t      a dozen people               dead.



                                                          k
t hem    but w h e n       the    gates      in the     barrier were           opened all         of the fans

fro m the West             s t a n d wer e    going onto          the    pitch a n d a       lot of the drunk

one?     were       just    causing more            p r o blems    and ta k i n g     up space       so that the

ambulances           couldn't       get      t h r o u g h a n d the P o l i c e and F irst Aiders

couldn't        see who          to help.



I saw a couple              of L i v e r p o o l    fans     run from the West              s tand to the S p i o n

Kop where           the Notts       Forest         fans w e r e a n d they were             k n e eling    on the

pitch      in front         of them,         with    their      arms o p e n as       if e n t i c i n g   the

Nottingham Forest                fans.



This     was    before        the P o l i c e wer e        lined across          the pitch and             I think     it

was     beca u s e    of this       prob l e m that         the P o l i c e w ere      put    there.



Kenny Dalglish              the P l a y e r m a n a g e r     of L i v e r p o o l   went    into the D i r e c t o r s

box a n d said over              the m i c r o p h o n e     "This      is K e n n y Dalglish",            and

everyone        on the        pitch just s t o p p e d and              looked at him and he said                   can

yo u ass i s t       the P o l i c e a n d a m b u l a n c e m e n       in a n y w a y possible.



I think        he    could have         done mor e an d a s k e d the fans to                   clear      the   pitch

if they w e r e n ’t injured.                  I stayed         in the S o u t h s t a n d until           a bout     five

o ’clock       <1700 hrs),          when      it was       a n n o u n c e d over    the    loud spea ker        that

the m a t c h was          cancelled.



When     I came       out of      the     back of the          south stand on my own,                 I had to go

out     towards       P e n i s t o n e Rd   because        the P o l i c e had       closed L e p p i n g s Ln

off.      I then w a l k e d        back      round to w here           the   car had been par ked               in

Middlewood Rd              but   it w a s n ’t t here         so I kept w a l k i n g       to the traffic

When     I was            walking          back      I say some                 fans          fighting                 in the                   park and     I

s a i d to two             fans         I passed who w ere a bit upset,                                             "I        c a n ’t u n d e r s t a n d

p e o p l e 1'*      T h e y just              looked at me and went                                  to the           car they were

relieved because another                                two     t h e y ’d bee n w i t h at                            the m a t c h were at                     the

         took me            back to his                 house        the n to              pick my               car up.



I c o u l d n ’t believe what                        had h a p p e n e d               it was            so bad.



I w o u l d say that                    the P o l i c e       opening                 gate        VC* was              the             right       thing     to do

because           it did ease a p r o b l e m that                              could have got e v e n more                                         out of

han d    than        it was.              Also m y s e l f and the P o l i c e m a n                                   closing                  the m a i n gate

s e e m e d to h elp beca u s e                    it let           people move.



I went       to the same m a t c h                      in 1988 and                    I w o u l d say there wer e about                                       the

same amount                of P o l i c e        there.



Th e r e wer e about                    the same a m o u n t            of            people there                    last yea r                  too.      I ’m

s u r p r i s e d this          didn't          h a p p e n then.                     I '.Mas in the same s tand                                   last year.



The     p r o b l e m this year wa s n ' t                     helped                 by the L i v e r p o o l                     fans          being so

d r u n k a n d leav i n g               it so late            to enter the ground.



I think           the m a t c h s h o u l d            have         been       post           poned for                  half and hour to get

              I would      say    that    the P o l i c e      a c t e d very fa i r l y outside       the ground w here

              I helped*          T h e y were    being a b u s e d and spat          on an d they were            just

              trying      to   help..     I c a n ’t comment          on how they a c t e d       in the gr o u n d

              because      I w a s n ’t involved,           but    the   incident was        so h o r r i f i c   I d o n ’t

              think     people        could accept       w hat was       happening      or knew wha t         to do for

              the best.



              I would      be w i l l i n g   to a t t e n d    the Judic i a l    E n q u i r y to give e v i d e n c e       if

Police Inspector



Ecclesfield Police Station



At 9-00 a.m. on Saturday, 15 April 1 9 8 9 , I paraded for duty at Ecclesfield

Police Station for duties in connection with the F.A. Cup Semi-Final between

Liverpool and Nottingham Forest to be played at Hillsborough.

At 9.30 a.m. the same day I arrived at Hillsborough.       I was in charge of

sub-sector 5, North Stand, serials 11 and 12.       I made contact with the

Sergeants in charge of these serials and issued them with their serial orders

and papers regarding intelligence matters.    Both Sergeants reported-their

serials up to strength.

At 10.00 a.m. a main briefing was    given to all officers in the North Stand by

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield.     Further briefings were given by

Superintendent Murray, Detective Sergeant Charlesworth and Inspector

Sewell.

At 10.30 a.m. I briefed my serial Sergeants and they informed me of the

deployment of their officers in relation to their serial duties.       Chief

Inspector Creaser was my sector commander and Superintendent Greenwood

was the ground commander.

At 11.15 a.m. in the North Stand I briefed    approximately two dozen stewards

who would be on duty in the North    Stand on the emergency evacuation

procedure, their responsibility in relation to tickets and seating and the

exit of supporters at the end of the game.    I also told them to notify the

nearest Policeman should they encounter any problems.       Approximately six of

the stewards said this was their first time as stewards.       The Chief Steward,
whose name I can't recall, then gave themanother briefing whereupon I        left

to carry out other duties.

During the time between 11.30 a.m. and 2.40 p.m. I initially visited the

officers on the inside of the turnstiles and then back and through both

levels of the North Stand.     It was a circular route.

Between 2.00 p.m. and 2.40 p.m. I was on that circular route checking both

levels of the North Stand back towards the turnstiles at Leppings Lane-         Some

Liverpool supporters whom I saw had been drinking, the majority were well

behaved.     They were not drunk but had had some alcohol and smelled strongly

of it.     It was not until later that events and people turned sour.   These

people entered the ground via turnstiles at Leppings Lane and entered the

North Stand.

At about 2.40 p.m. I joined officers under my command and were engaged on

duties at the rear of turnstiles 1 - 8 at theLeppings Lane end which gives

access to the North Stand.     I had heard over the radio of some problems at

the Leppings Lane end involving crushing, so I decided to go and see what was

happening.     I could see through the turnstiles a very, very large crowd

massed from the turnstiles back across the road completely covering that

area.    People at the front, before they could get through the turnstiles,

were being pushed and crushed against each other, against the wall between

the turnstiles and against gate 'A', a concertina gate.     As I saw this the

officers on duty there told me of the problem and that it had been going on

for some time.     As people entered through the turnstiles into the ground they

approached me, nearly everyone shouting abuse about the situation outside and

saying that if something isn't done then people will be crushed and killed

outside.     I told these people I was aware of the problem and tried to re­

assure them.     Some replied with abusive remarks such as, 'YOU BASTARDS

COULDN'T POLICE A PISS UP' and 'YOU CUNTS WILL KILL SOMEONE OUT THERE'.         Some
of the younger males had been drinking, some worse for drink were using

obscene language towards me and other oficers such as 'BASTARD BISSIES' and

'BLACK GETS'. I warned several about their conduct and language.    They were

dragged away by other youths and disappeared into the crowd.    Nofur theft

action was taken against them, it would have caused more problemns than it

would have solved.

As the Liverpool supporters were entering I saw that some of the women and
              UM.ItC
children were        faced, visibly shaking and crying. Police Officers who

were on turnstile duty outside (F2 'D' Group officers, Police Constables 43,

602, 3027) had to climb over the turnstiles to avoid being crushed

themselves.   These officers were also visibly shaken/shocked, white faced and

they said the situation outside was unbearable and people were being crushed.

I saw people climbing over the wall onto the roof of the turnstiles gaining

access to the rear of the West Stand/Leppings Lane terracing.     I could hear

only part radio messages about the situation and about a gate to be opened.

I heard gates 'A' and 'C' mentioned.    When the radio was free I radioed into

the control room telling them what the situation was like as I saw it and

asked for clarification if any gates should be opened.     The reply was broken

and interrupted.     I again asked for clarification and the reply was no gates

to be opened.   The situation continued and two to three minutes later it

appeared to be getting worse and gate 'A' was being pushed against from

outside and visibly bowing under the pressure.     I heard over the radio

instructions for the gate, including gate ’A ’, to be opened.    Officers at

gate 'A' opened it and a Police cordon was placed at the side of the gate to

the fencing to funnel people into the ground towards the North Stand.        No one

was allowed to enter or attempt to enter the area to the rear of the West

Stand/Leppings Lane terrace.     This influx of people lasted two to three

minutes and pressure outside was relieved.     As the people entered some were
abusive, blaming the Police for the problems outside (swearing and cursing).

Tickets as far as I 'm aware were not taken or people checked for

tickets.     As the situation became calm I left the area and returned to the

North Stand.

Shortly after kick off I entered the North Stand and saw a number of people

and Police Officers on the track and field behind the goal ajid in front of

the West Stand/Leppings Lane terrace.     I made my way down and as I did I

could see people climbing over the perimeter fence to go onto the pitch.        At

first I thought fighting had broken out but as I arrived behind the goal by

the centre pen, I could see there was no fight but people trying to escape

the crush.     Others were scrambling over the side fences to the side pens and

others climbing and being lifted into the West Stand by people already in the

stand.     The emergency gate was open and people were escaping, being pulled

through the gate by Police Officers.     I could see people on the ground inside

the centre pen by the emergency gate being trampled on by people trying to

escape.     Some people were alive but trapped by their legs under other people.

Police Officers were pulling people through the gate and helping others over

the fence.     I could see people crushed against the fence, they were

blue/purple in colour, others were screaming for help.     People to the rear of

the pen wouldn't or couldn't move back, despite numerous shouts and arm

waving requests to move back and out through the tunnel.     I saw it was

necessary to gain access to the pen to help people and organise things, so I

and a small group of officers managed to gain access to the pen.

I could see, once inside the pen, the bodies of a large number of people

piled on top of each other, one of the bodies was a child aged about 10 years

and no bigger than my own son.     Their faces were blue-ish/purple in colour

with legs and arms twisted, tucked under them and other bodies.     They were

obviously dead.     I continued to shout at people in the pen to move back and
out through the tunnel and waved my arms to this effect.        They didn't move.

Some of them shouted abuse, I heard someone shout, 'MURDERING BASTARDS', spat

and some coins and a gobstopper (sweet) hit me as we tried to help.          People

in the West Stand and side pens also shouted abuse, spat and threw some

objects.   The throwing of objects and coins didn't'last'long-, a few seconds,

but the abuse and spitting continued from the West Stand and pens.        Remarks

like 'FUCKING BISSIES' were used.       There were a number of people in the pen

on the ground who were alive and I directed and assisted officers to get them

out through the emergency gate onto the pitch.        They were passed to officers

on the track.      As more and more officers gained access to the pen people were

eventually moved back and out through the tunnel.         Bodies were removed out

onto the track       to waiting officers.   I assisted in removal of the bodies from

the pen.     I    do not know the identity of the officers who received the bodies.

There were such a large number of bodies I don't know the exact number I

assisted/directed in moving.       I could see a crush barrier had given way and

was bent almost to the ground on the left hand side of it as you look from

the track.       When all the bodies had been removed, the pen with people still

inside was preserved on Superintendent Greenwood's instructions and left as

it was for the time being.       A short time later two Scenes of Crime Officers

in civilian clothes entered the pen and started to take photographs.          The

small group       of people still in the pen made hostile approaches to them and

they had toquickly leave the pen, assisted        by Uniform officers.

I saw people, including Policemen and Policewomen, in various stages of

shock, they were walking about in a daze, others crying and one even shouting

at other Police Officers for no apparent reason.        They were all directed to

the Police Room for treatment.       Some, including some Police Officers,

refused.     I then stood by at the Leppings Lane end, then stood by in the

North Stand.       I located my serial Sergeants and they eventually reported the
position of their serials.   One officer from serial 11, Police Constable

had been taken to hospital with concussion.   They were then stood down.

After a short briefing by Chief Superintendent Mole, I stood down, going off

duty at Ecclesfield Police Station at 8.00 p.m.

I have been policing football matches since I joined the Police Service as a

Police Constable in 1971, at Hillsborough and outside the ground as a Police

Constable and Police Sergeant and now as an Inspector.     I am thoroughly

conversant and experienced at working football matches at Hillsborough.

Radio communication was not good.    I found messages fading or broken.    Maybe

it was my radio, I don't know.    I didn't get chance to change it.   When I was

in the pen searching for injured people amongst the large number of bodies, I

was obviously feeling down, but when we found someone alive I felt elated and

everyone worked as quickly as possible to get them out to first aiders.      This

elation lasted only a few seconds and then I was down again until I found

someone else alive.   A few people were found alive but there were more dead

than alive.

There were a small number of Liverpool supporters, mainly young males, who

had been drinking alcohol and were worse for drink who were abusive and

offensive.    Liverpool, like all football clubs, have a small group of idiots

who drink and cause problems and did so on the day.    The majority of

Liverpool supporters are decent, football loving people.

Afterwards I felt angry because we were being spat on and abused as we tried

to help people.

occurred.

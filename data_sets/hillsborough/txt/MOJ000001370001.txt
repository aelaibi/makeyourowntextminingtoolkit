    The language of section 4 (2) is, if anything, slightly easier than that of section

     We have already given our reasons for the view on which we now act that
section 4 (2) of the Criminal Appeal A ct 1968 enables us to pass such sentence as
 we think proper and as is authorised by law for the offence of handling by
 receiving, the conviction for theft having been quashed, with of course the
 necessary consequence that the sentence of five years passed upon that conviction
has gone away.                                                                                                                   BEFORE

 rejects the sentence of five years for theft, the appellant was sentenced to a
 total of three years for the other offences. We have now to consider what is the
 appropriate total when there is added to those offences the offence of handling

 the most serious of the offences outstanding and it would be our view that the

 appropriate sentence should be three years on the receiving charge to run
 concurrently with the other terms of imprisonment passed in respect of the other
 offences.                                                                                Manslaughter—Causation— Unlawful A ct— Injecting o f Morphine—Morphine

  think not. We appreciate that this appellant may well have a sense of injustice              or a major cause. The consent of the victim is no defence to the charge, and
   that Paice who, after all, did abscond his bail, should have got away as lightly            becomes relevant only if the jury have to consider whether the defendant
  as he did while he is being sentenced with a degree of severity for his offences.            acted with recklessness or gross negligence.
  Nevertheless we think that these offences were serious and the appellant played                Section 23 of the Offences against the Person Act, provides: “ Whosoever
  an important part in the handling and disposing of the stolen property and that it           shall unlawfully and maliciously administer or cause to be administered to or
   would be wrong to interfere. The sentence which, upon a consideration of the                taken by any other person any poison or other destructive or noxious thing,
   offences and the appellant himself, we think appropriate is one of three years.             so as thereby to endanger the life of that person . . . shall be guilty of felony.”
      Therefore we impose the sentence of three years upon the receiving charge                   Heroin is a “ noxious thing ” for the purposes of the above section, and

          At 8.00 a.m. on Saturday 15th April 1989,                                     I paraded on

          duty in unifor m in Cl CID Office, at the instruction of

          At 8.20 a.m. that date in the conference room I liaised with

          Sergeant Cloke,                 Serial Sergeant and discovered that we

          were under the Command of Inspector Meek.

          At 9.30 a.m.,                that date I arrived at Hillsborough, awaiting

          parade.

          At 10.00 a.m.,                Briefing took place by Chief Superintendent

          Duckenfield,                Superintendent and DS C h a r l e s w o r t h .

        Halifax Road in company with PC 2056 Lister.                     No fans were

        visible at this time.

        At 11.05 a.m.       I arrived at the top of Halifax Road and saw

        that a Mini bus was parked at the top of the road and it was

        our intention to park all Liverpool coaches and Mini buses

        behind this vehicle backing up towards the ground.

        Obviously those arriving first would be furthest from the

        ground but had more time to walk the mile or so to the ground,

        At 11.40 a.m. private vehicles arrived and parked in the side

        streets. They appeared to be mainly families and respectable

        looking people in good class cars who were asking directions

        to the ground and how long it would take to walk.

        The odd one or two asked where local public houses were

        but not many.         Most people had flasks etc., and were advised

        about cans and banners not being allowed in the ground.

        There was a steady arrival of fans in private vehicles,

        mostly Liverpool supporters until 11.15 R.m. when the odd

        Liverpool coach arrived.

        PC Baker and PC Marsh           (Cl Police women) were deputed to take

        all the registered numbers of arriving coaches.

        As the coaches were arriving, all full at this time, an

        officer, myself included boarded each coach and advised all

        on board not to take cans and banners into the ground. They

        were advised about directions to the ground.

        At 2.00 p.m. that date I was joined by Inspector Meek, DC

         282 Davis, DC Pearson and others and coaches began arriving

         quite often.        All arrivals at this time were still full

              We were asked again on several occasions if public houses

              were open, we told them most were and gave them directions.

              Advice was also given about entry being refused to the ground

              without tickets.

              At 2.30 p.m. coaches were arriving now one after the other

               almost but were still being directed and briefed by Police

               before being allowed to empty.                                                                           It was apparent that the

               mood of the bus occupants was more excited but this was

               probably due to the kick off being only 30 minutes away.

                Several occupants of these buses were drinking beer/lager

                from cans                                 as they walked down the s t r e e t . Some of the                                           crowd

               were also                                  from private vehicles.                                               At this time the odd   bus

               was arriving empty and PC Lister and myself walked down

                towards Wadsley Bridge Railway Station in order to prevent

                buses unloading prior to being parked,                                                                             checked and briefed.

                At 2.40 p.m. as we were walking round the corner we could see

                right down Halifax Road past the Railway Station and we                                                                                       !

                 saw several coaches unloading just above the train station

                 about a quarter of a mile away from us.                                                                             There didn't appear

                 to be any Police Officers at that point of the route and several;

                 others stopped near us that we waved on up the road.

                 A large amount of the crowd were walking past us now

                  and appeared very excited and some were obviously under the

                  influence of drink, shouting and chanting.                                                                             Some were carrying

                  cans of beer/lager.                                                          I saw that there were a large amount of

                  discarded empty cans in gardens and on walls especially near

                  the Undertakers and outside the Gate Public House.

                  At 2.50 p.m.                                     I walked with PC Lister and othej-o£ficers

 intending to go to Claywheels Lane on standby duties.                           As

 we walked onto Claywheels Lane I saw DS Tissington,                           and DI

 Charles and other officers.                 This would be close to kick

 off time, as there appeared to be few fans about.

 DI Charles received information via his personal radio and

 we thought there was fighting in the ground.

 At 2.55 p.m.,         we were ordered to line up ready for quickly

 getting to the ground.

 All these serials went round onto Leppings Lane and lines up

 awaiting instructions.              At this time we could see Police

 Officers and horses section up near the entrance to the

 ground.      I could not see any supporters in the area of the

  entrance to Leppings Lane stand at this time.

  En-route to the match I was at the side of PC Williamson

  (Cl Warrants Officer) who had his own radio turned onto the

  Police channel.         I heard someone request the start to be delayed

  otherwise there would be a catastrophe.                            I did not hear any

  reply and then an instruction was given to open the gates.

  This conversation was heard en-route to Leppings Lane some

  5 minutes before we were lined up on Leppings Lane outside

  the shops .

  At 3.10 p.m. we were ordered into Leppings Lane end.

  As we went into the ground I saw about 30 or 40 uniformed

  officers stood around near to the large blue doors which

  were open.       We ran through them and went towards the tunnel that

  led into the Leppings Lane end. As I approached I could see

  a large amount of people spewing out of the entrance.                            They

  were shouting abuse and the tunnel was full o f people most

           of whom appeared to be coming out of the ground.

           Most of the Officers I saw at this time I recognised as

            'C' Division personnel.

           It became apparent that there wasn't any fighting and

           there was a crowd           problem at the front of the standing area

           near to the concrete wall and fence.                    I could see a number

           of officers      climbing the fence and shouting at the crowd to

           back off but the crowd were just stood chanting and swearing

           and were unwilling to moi/e voluntarily.                   I physically removed

           several men from the standing area and pushed them towards

           the tunnel with instructions to get out.                    Other Officers were

           doing the same but few people were leaving of their own

           volilsion.

           At 3.20 p.m. that date I could see that people were climbing

           over the fence in order to escape the crushing caused by people

           at the back.        Supporters in the cantelever stand were spitting

            on us and shouting abuse - "Murdering Bastards" etc.                        Tension

           was at a peak and the hostility towards Police Officers

            was something I had not experienced on this scale or intensity

            before.

            At 3.25 p.m. the crowd had thinned out enough for us to get

            through to the front and I saw a pile of people.                       I grabbed

            one man and with the assistance of another officer who I do

            not remember I pulled him from the heap and towards the tunnel

            exit.     It appeared that all the                 people in the pile      (approx

            40 or 50)were very seriously injured and at the very best

            unconscious.       Many were purple in the face as was this man.

 He was limp and not moving.                                         We were assisted in the tunnel

 by another Officer who I can't remember and we carried him

 through the crowd most of whom were leaving the Leppings

 Lane end.

 As we carried the man a number of fans shouted abuse at

 us and when we reached the end of the tunnel                                                I could see that

 all the fans that had left the terracing were still in the

 ground milling around.                                       A lot were hysterical running about.

 We placed this man who I now know                                                 to be Martin Kenneth Wild

 approximately 30 years of

  Stockport on the floor.                                      He was purple around the mouth

 and his face was ashen.                                       I gave him mouth to: mouth resuscitation

 and another officer gave him heart massage.                                                 I could not see

  any visible injuries and could not feel a pulse in his wrist

  or neck.                            I honestly felt that this man had been dead for some

  time but we kept trying for at least two minutes.

 We were hampered at times by fans                                               screaming abuse at us

  but nevertheless we kept trying.                                               I could see other people

  being carried out and it was apparent that further assistance

  was needed in the ground.                                       I covered Wild with my anorak and

  returned to the terraces.                                       I cannot recollect who the other

  officer was who assisted me.

  The tunnel was still very busy a lot of people were just

   stood against the walls of the tunnel and they were told to

   get out and make room for people being carried o u t .                                            I went

   back into the terracing which was still very full and I could

   see that there were a large number of Police Officers now

   in the front of the terracing near to the f e n c e t j i e y                                         were

   still having great difficulty in keeping fans back from the

   bodies still on the floor at the front.                             I pushed through until

    I got to the people on the floor and again I grabbed a man

   and pulled him from the pile assisted by another officer.

   At no time had I seen any civilian giving assistance

   to the injured.

   We struggled with this man and I now know him to be

   Kester Roger Marcus Ball born 2.7.72. of

                                                   Hereford.             I cannot remember

    the officers but two more came to our assistance and we

    carried him through the fans who were still in the tunnel

    and placed him at the side of Wild.                        As I approached I could

    see people stood around Wild and one lifting up my anorak

    that was covering his face.                  I asked him if he knew him

    but he didn't.        I asked them all to move back to give us

    room to work and I knelt over Ball.                        He was purple around

    the face, his face was ashen

                                               and began mouth to mouth

    resuscitation. Another officer began heart massage.                                        I don't

    know who he was.           I think most Cl Officers had gone onto the

    pitch area.       I did see DC 282 Davis and remember seeing

    him carrying someone with another officer*.                                 I cannot remember

    seeing any serious obvious injury to Ball.

    I thought Ball was dead but we kept trying for two or three

    minutes.

    I hadn't seen any Senior Officer until this time, when I

    saw an Inspector or Chief Inspector who I didn't know I told

    him there were 4 0 or 50 people piled up that lga&ed like they

         dead.

         He didn't reply and walked off towards the large blue doors

         on the ground perimeter.

         Several people came up looking at Ball and Wild but I left

         my coat covering Wild's face.

          I stayed with both men and a woman who said she was a Nurse

         came up and asked if she could do anything.                            I told her I

         thought they were both dead and she felt both men for a pulse

         and said they both appeared dead.

         An officer came up and I saw DC 282 Davis and I was instructed

         to move the bodies to an area outside the main part of the

          ground at the side of the River area that runs at the back

          of the Leppings Lane stand.                  The area was still full of

          supporters shouting and swearing and obviously very upset

          and hysterical.         It was difficult to tell if they were

          under the influence of intoxicants or just hysterical with

          the events that they had witnessed prior to our arrival at the

          ground.

          I requested other officers to assist in removing both men and

          they were both carried in turn the 40 or 50 yards to an area

          outside the main gates that had been opened.                            I took m y anorak

          with Wild and placed it again over his upper body.                             Both men

          were placed together and as other bodies arrived at this

          location Constables            were deputed to form a line between

          the bodies and supporters leaving the ground.                            It was

          at this time that            I saw a press man with a green                 'Press'

          jacket attempt to take pictures of the bodies and he

          was punched and kicked by Liverpool                          supporters r^Jie^ ran off

         towards Leppings Lane.

         At 4.10 pm., that date someone came with blankets they appeared

         the type used by ambulance and I covered up Ball and Wild.

         I think it was about this time that DI Webster appeared on

         the scene with other officers.                     I can remember seeing DC

         Braden,     PC Chang, and DAve Kelly.                    DI Webster took control

         and was in possession of plastic bags, exhibit labels

         strings etc.

         At 4.25 p.m. we removed all articles from both deceased,

         labelled them and placed them in plastic bags.                              There was

         nothing that would enable identification of either man.

         All possessions were placed in plastic bags and sealed.

         I cannot remember if it was before or after that DC Braden

         was deputed to deal with Ball but a Dr. arrived at the scene

         Dr. Mon*aghan this was at 4.20 p.m.                           He was equipped and

         started to examine the bodies which I think numbered 11

         at this time.

         AT 4.35 p.m., Death was certified on Wild and Ball by a

         Doctor from the Hallamshire and what details that could be

         were placed on Gen 18, tattooes,                     full descriptions and

         clothing etc.

         At 4.45 p.m. ambulances had now been arriving in convoys

         and a Doctor from Liverpool who I have since seen on numerous

          occasions on T.V. was on the scene.                              I left both bodies

          and briefly assisted with casualties.

          The Doctor was very good, examining people and placing them

          in priority for ambulances.

        Continuation of statement of          JOHN ROBERT LAWRENCE

         At 5.05 p.m. all the injured had now been transported to

         hospital and we began removing the bodies by ambulance from

         the Leppings Lane end.                  I went with two other uniformed

         officers who I didn't know and their respective bodies.

          I left DC Braden at the scene.                          I remember being stuck

          in traffic for some considerable time outside the entrance

          of the Police Room and gymnasium.

          Eventually we were let in and ambulance staff carried the

          bodies into the gymnasium.                     At this time it was approximately

          5.10 p.m.

          The sight in the gym was horrific dozens of bodies laid

          out.     I was given a card to place around the bodies ankle.

          Name, Collar No., Division etc. and given a number 77.                                   This

          was the first opportunity I had had to count the cash from the

          man and I did so in the presence of a Police woman who was

          handling Casualty Bureau forms.                           £10.29 pence.       This was

          again placed in the bag and re-sealed.

          I saw at this time PC Chang who came into the mortuary

          with the body of the man Kester B a l l .                            The body had been

          identified to him by DC Braden who had gone on an enquiry

          with DI Webster.

          Detective Chief Superintendent Addis appeared to be in

          charge and on two occasions addressed us all en block relating

          the route the investigation would take.

          Mr Addis addressed all those dealing woth bodies.                                It was

          explained that each body would be photographed facially

          and a gallery of photographs exhibited for friends and

          relatives to peruse.               If a Photo identification was made

   the officer and body would be brought through for formal

   identification with a member of CID who would take a CJA

   The officer would remain with the body and be transported

   by ambulance to the M edico Legal                        Centre.   No property

   was to be returned only to relatives.

   Disclaimers for clothes only from r e l a t i v e s .

   The force Welfare Officer,              Penny Grimshaw arrived and

   spoke with everyone.

   At 10.25 p.m. number 7 7 and my name and number were shouted

   and I went and saw the body of Wild which had

   been laid on an ambulance stretcher by other officers.

   At 10.30 p.m.,          I went to the viewing area where I saw two men

   one of whom was John Murray 25 years of

                  | Stockport.      He officially identified the body

    and supplied certain details to me which I endorsed on my

    partly completed GEN /18. The details were very brief as

    he was only a friend and he remained there with a CID

    officer to provide a statement.

    I then accompanied the body, plus 2 others and the officer

    dealing by ambulance to the Medico Legal Centre,                        Sheffield.

    At 11.00 p.m.,        I arrived there and saw DS Newton                 , and

    other officers one who I knew as being called Gordon who I

    gave the property bag to.                I identified the body to them

    and filled in a Form and also gave full details to females in

    the interview/door control room.                        The body was stripped by

    the staff and after providing statements the GEN 18 was left

    with them and I returned to the Gym at Hillsborough.

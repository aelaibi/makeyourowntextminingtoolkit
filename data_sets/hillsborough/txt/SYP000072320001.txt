the     turnstiles.

Together        with       other       people           who      h^jfd c l i m b e d        over      the     fence,          I started

helping        people          out    of    the       pens/and            helped          someone          known       as

ou t    of    the    crowd,          I only          knew      he w o r k s       at                          at N o r t o n .         Some     of

these        people       were       distressed               and     short       of      breath        one    had a          cut      eye.

After        I had       climbed       over          the      fence       a Policeman                came     up f r o m         the     gate

that     led    onto       the       pitch and             asked       us     not      to      go    onto     the      pitch,          up as

t he    gangway          filled       up w i t h        people,           they       had       to go       onto     the       pitch.




We     eventually          made       our       way     onto        the     pitch         as    there       was     no      on e    f 1 se     to

help     clirnb o v e r         the    fence.           As     we     got     onto        the       p i t c h _______ sa>»                      up

in the        West       stand and          my       brother          came       over       to me,         I covereo             up two        men

who     were    obviously             d e ad,        and      suggested           to a P o l i c e m a n          titfat we         could

do w i t h     an a m b u l a n c e        to    remove          s o me     of    the       bodies.         After        that       the

emergency           services          started           to a r r i v e        and      things         started          to     be    done,

but     there       seemed       to    be       no    organisation.                  People          seemed       to     be      doing

everything           they       could       but       there         seemed        to      be    no    one     in o v e r a l l

control.        I eventually                climbed            into       the N o r t h         Stand,        together             with

                                and    we       made       our      way     out      of     the      ground.        On      the w a y        out

of     the    ground       we    met       an    off       duty       doctor         who       had heard about                   the

tradgedy        on       the    radio       and       come       to    help       but       most      of    the     injured            had

already        gone       to    hospital.

From     the    t i me     I got       onto          the      terracing           until         I got       over       the       side

fencing        all       I could       think          about         was     s el f     preservation,                1 don't            wish     to

apportion           blame       to a n y o n e        i t ’s j u s t        different               circumstances                that

caused        it,    from       the    gate          opening          the     lack        of    direction           on      to     the

terracing           to    the    side       fences            stopping           people         spilling          out       sidewards

onto     the    terracing             I think           the      supporters               could       have     been         kept       better

informed.

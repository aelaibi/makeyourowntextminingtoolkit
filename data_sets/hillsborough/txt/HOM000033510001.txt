       Dear Sir or Madam,

                            With reference to your letter of the 27th February, I have no
       objection to the contents of my letter to Lord Justice Stuart - Smith being made
       available for your inclusion in the copies for the library, providing that details of my
       home address are deleted before inclusion.

                                                        Yours sincerely




                                                        P.Wells

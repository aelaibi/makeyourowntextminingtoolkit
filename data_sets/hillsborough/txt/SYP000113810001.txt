Consideration                 was       given       to     other           methods             of       deployment,             but       on,

balance          it     was       felt       that       this       was      the       most          appropriate                separation.

In    connection              with       both       t he      semi-final'                 in    198'/ a n d          1988,          this     policy

             that    all       officers          involved          in       the    operation          other       than      those

             I    retired       from    duty          at    approximately                6    a.m.    and    resumed           duty       at    8 a.m.

             that    same       day    at    Police          Headquarters.

             I wish       to    place       on    record          my    considerable             appreciation               of      the    efforts

             of    all    individuals             involved             in    this       matter,       and    in    particular              th e

             efforts       of    the    officers             involved             in    dealing       with       the     traumatic             events

             of    dealing       with       identification                   of    families          and    deceased           persons,            the

               In       brief,          because                 of    the    nature         of        the       terraces,                it    was     often

 Whilst       I    cannot       account          for    individual           initiative           on      the    part       of

 officers          manning       those          barriers       I     can   say      that    it    was      not     my      policy

 to   filter        supporters             by    utilising           barriers        across       the      footpath.

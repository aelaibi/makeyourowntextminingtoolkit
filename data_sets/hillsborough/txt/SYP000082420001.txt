             to the         turnstile.           There         were    only ahouJr           3 people           in front of me        in

             the      queue       to get     into the           grauhn and /           had no        problem in entering.                   I

             was      not    searched as           I ente re d arm t m i s s u r pr i se d                     me.   I handed my

             ticket         stub over and e nt er ed the ground.

             I f ound the stairs                 leading         to the stands and was                     stopped       by a stew ar d

             who      checked my ticket.                  He     ripped off a corner and                        I was    then s hown my

             seat      by a steward.               My seat was about               14     rows       back and           the goals     were

             s li g h t l y to my right.                 This was at about                2 .15          pm.

             Everything            at this       stage         seemed    normal        and    I saw            no disturbances.            In

             fact      I saw no trouble                or d runkeness           all     day.

             1 was      sitting        on my own as                            had gone       to stand           in the L e p pi n gs

            Lane area.              E v er yt h in g     seajrned normal          until       just after             kick    off w he n

             people         began to climb ov/r                  the front        fence.            At    first      I just    thought

             t hat     t his was t he           c r o w d / o r ga n is i ng    itself       properly but as                time   went

             on more and more                    op lt    b egan to climb the                 fence.            I then thought            that

             I w a s n ’t sure what was                  hap pe ni ng as         I could not              properly see         b elow and

           , I h a d n ’t a good view,                 I d i d n ’t see any       crush or surges as            I. could

               only      see    the    front    fence.

               W he n    people       started    lying     down on the         pitch,       a^ter    the   teams    had g o m

               off,      I knew that       som et hi ng     serious must          havs^happened.             I remember

               seeing         some    police and fans          pulling at        thaf perimeter        fence    to break           it

               down      but    it was    sometime       before       they m a n a g e d    to do so.

               Although         1 was a long way off,                i \ was^d ifficult        to see what         was    going

               on,      but    it seemed to me          that    no o n e ’really knew what was               going       on,

               took      a long time for an a m bu la nc e               to get    there      to help.       I did not

              assist          with anyone who was           dea^or        injured.

               I left the ground at approKi&rntejty 4.23                          pm f ollowing        the a n no u nc e m e n t

              and went          straight       back    to the       coach /    I got       there at about       4.35      pm.

              A fter a time,            I r ea lised     that Caryf and Nick were missing.                      This was

              be cause                         had    read out / h e      list    of   people       on the   coach.       We

               left      the area at about 5. 5 0              pm.

               I w ou ld       like   to add that we were              told by a p ol iceman that              there were

              lot of          people there with ou t           tickets.       We were        told to keep our            own

              tickets          safe as    people w o ul d try to sn at ch them.

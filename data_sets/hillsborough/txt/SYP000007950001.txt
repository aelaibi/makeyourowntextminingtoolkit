up by the Police             but they were              then ejected             thro u g h the        exit    gate,          1

presume       they were        helped over             to     prevent        them    being      injured as        they

were    ejected          immediately.           I saw the gate                 open numerous           times    to     eject

fans    or    let Police        pass       through          both ways and            on one         occasion    1 saw a

Chief       Inspector       come     out of the gate o b v i o u s l y to                     check the       crowd he

(1455 hrs ) I was at this               time    incapable       of making a v o l u n t a r y m o v e m e n t

I c o u l d n ’t move my arms and was             literally head to head w i t h               people

round me      I found     it dif f i c u l t    to breath and felt as th o u g h             it was

getting      too hot     I was about a yard away from my mate

this    time and he said          “Move    to the       left"    he went a couple           of yards          but

then      said to me no      chance and so we m o v e d out              to the     right    I b egan to

move and he was          fo l l o w i n g me at a distance w h e n there was anot h e r

surge,      I assume     it was    be cause      the    game was/star^Cing

pushed about          10 yards    forwards       by the    surge.        I was     pushed about 5

yrds      forwards     but also    to the       right    I kept my eye on him to see                    he's

OK and      I saw him go down out              of sight    but he       came back      up a gain

seconds      later,     1 got    pushed further          forwards       a g a i n at this    point and             I

lost    sight    of             I was    by now    pinned against             a barrier     from the

floor     of the terrace         still    facing       forwards       I was    pinned ac r o s s    my hips.

I m a n a g e d to push off and get space                but    in doing       so I turned       right

round and my back was             pinned against          the    barrier.        At this     time       the

crowd     pushed forward a g a i n and my feet                 left    the floor and        I s t a r t e d to

rise    over the barrier          and    I was    held    lying       backwards     by my    legs

against      the barrier        I felt myself          going    over    backwards     but a chap          in

front      pushed back and        I was    straightened          up.



I was      in agony w here my          legs were       being    crushed against         the barrier            I

s c r e a m e d for help a couple more            of the       crowd    pushed and      pulled my         legs

free and      I went     over    the    top of the bar and             ended up upright          on the

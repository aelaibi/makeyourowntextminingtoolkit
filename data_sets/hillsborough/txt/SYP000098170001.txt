                  FINAL SUBMISSION TO THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY ON

                                           \



                  BEHALF OF THE SOUTH, YORKSHIRE COUNTY FIRE SERVICE



                                       RESUME



 The submission on behalf of the Fire Service is as might have been expected

  from the position that was adopted by their Counsel, Mr Muller QC.      The

  submission is in two parts, concerning the involvement of the Fire Service

  on the day of the disaster and secondly their involvement as a member of the

  Safety at Sports Ground Working Party.




  1.   Much of the first part of this submission is taken up with defending

        their delay in dealing with the Police request.    In so doing criticisms

        are levelled at the nature of the Police message - this is nothing new

        as such criticisms were levelled during the first phase of the Inquiry.




        It is suggested that Chief Superintendent Duckenfield was aware of the

       need for the Fire Brigade by 1504 (we know that the Fire Brigade was

        called at 1513), however such a suggestion relies upon an idiosyncratic

        interpretation of Mr Duckenfield1s evidence to the Inquiry.     He did say

        that it was apparent that people were having difficulty getting out of

        the pens at 1504 but it does not automatically follow that he

       appreciated the need for specialist equipment at that time.




       The submission criticises the lack of a Police Reception Committee -

       another familiar theme.
The submission discusses the Fire Brigades involvement in determining

capacities and its involvement in the introduction of perimeter and

radial fences.   The only aspect of this part of the submission which

concerns the South Yorkshire Police is the Fire Brigades repeated claim

that they understood that radial gates were to be in "manned" at all

times by a Police Officer.   This understanding arose, it seems, from

their interpretation of the phrase "gates to be under Police control"

which was written into the General Safety Certificate.   It has been

tie Police case, throughout the inquiry, that "Police control" means

having the means and authority to lock the gates in an opened or closed

position.




Referring particularly to paragraph I on page 19 of the submission -

the prospect of a single Police Officer on the terraces monitoring

these gates (which seems to be envisaged by the submission at this

point) is not, on any Police account^ a viable proposition.

          SUBMISSION ON PART ONE OF THE


              HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY



                   ON BEHALF OF



       SOUTH YORKSHIRE COUNTY FIRE SERVICE


                      AND


            CIVIL DEFENCE AUTHORITY




                                          r
         THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE FIRE SERVICE ON
            15TH APRIL, 1985, AT HILLSBOROUGH




It is not suggested in the light of the evidence                                       tendered

at     the     Inquiry          that        the        earlier summoning of the Fire

Service would have resulted in the saving of lives or                                          the

prevention           of     injuries.                Nevertheless      it is regrettable

that     notwithstanding                   the        obvious       need         for     cutting

equipment,           once       it     became           apparent      that        persons were

trapped behind the perimeter fence in pens                                   3     and    4,    no

rsquest        for        the    Fire        Service          to attend was made until

15.13.45.        Every appliance carries cutting equipment which                                     Hornsby
                                                                                                     20.73.F
could        have          speedily              removed        the   perimeter           fence.

Emergency tenders also carry heavier duty portable cutting

equipment        which          could,           if     necessary, have been used to                 20.75•C

remove the radial fences.



Chief Superintendent Duckinfield accepted that by 15.04 it                                           Duckinf ield
                                                                                                     8 .107.E-P
was     apparent to him that people were trying to get out of

the pens and that               they        were           having   difficulty           getting

through        the    gates.          Although he accepted that an obvious

solution would be ,to cut some of the fence down, he stated

that     the     thought         did        not        immediately pass through his

mind.     It is noted however that at 15.07                              a    request         from   S.A.I.
                                                                                                     P. 11
ground control for a fleet of ambulances was made.



Calling the Fire.Service

Following       a     request for bolt cutters made at about 15.12

by radio from the area                     of        the    perimeter 'fence             to    the

ground       control            box         at        Hillsborough,          Sgt.      Goddard,      Goddard

immediately telephoned the                           police     garage       at     Claywheels
                         1             -         -
      Lane     asking    for     cutting      equipment.       They     replied that

      they     had   none      available      and    Sgt.     Goddard      therefore        Goddard
                                                                                            18.97.P-H
      signalled to PC Bichard who was also in the control box to

      radio Police       Control       at   Snig      Hill to     call     the    Fire

      Service.



(b)   PC Bichard passed the following message on the VHF channel                            S.A.l
                                                                                            P.16

             Service urgently required Leppinqs Lane end."




      A   police     operator, PC Jones,in the incident room at Snig
                                                                                           Waugh
      Hill Force      Control       acknowledged       the     message    with     the     31.113.G

      words:



                                                                                           S.A.l
             "Roger Fire Brigade urgent up to Leppings Lane Roger”                         P . 16



(c)   This    request    was       overheard by      Chief Inspector Edmundson             Ed m u n d s o n 's
                                                                                           additional
      and he went       to   the     adjacent       operations     room    to     give     statement

      instructions to one of the operators.



(d)   Meanwhile,        in   the     operations       room Julie       Webster,    a
                                                                                           W e b s t e r 1s
      temporary control         room     assistant,      was    dealing     with       a   statement

      telephone      call    from     Fire Control Operator Davies at the

      South Yorkshire        Fire      Service      central     control    room    in

      Wellington      Street reporting a house fire in Gatty Road in



                                      - 2 -
           which it was thought people were trapped and                   lives     might

           therefore be at risk.



     (e) Chief Inspector Edmundson interrupted Hiss Webster's call
                                                                                            Edmundson 1s
           telling      her     to   tell   the     Fire    Service      that     cutting   additional
                                                                                            statement
           equipment was wanted at Hillsborough.



     (f) The conversation between Hiss Webster and Hiss                     Davies     is

           recorded     in     the   transcript of the Fire Service tape and

           the part relating to Hillsborough took                 from    15.13.45     to

           15.14.58, a total of 1 minute 13 seconds.



3.         Comments

     (a)   It    is   to be noted that although the message passed by PC

           Bichard to Force Control complied with the requirements of

           the    emergency procedure in that the precise location that

           the Fire Service were to attend and the type of                      equipment

           required     were    specified,       Hiss Webster who spoke to Hiss

           Davies made no mention of Leppings Lane or                 the    need     for

           hydraulic     cutting       equipment.    This    procedure       had     been

           agreed upon at       a    meeting     between    the    three     emergency      Core
                                                                                            478
           services on the 9th August, 1988.



     (b)   Inspector     Sewell      accepted     that the necessity to provide

           such information to the Fire Service was obvious and                      that   Sewell
                                                                                            31.32.A-F
           the Fire Service was entitled            to expect such details from

           the police.       By contrast, such       detailed      information       was

           provided     by    police    force     control    at    Snig Hill to the         Clarke
                                                                                            24.75.E-F
           Ambulance Service.

    (c)   Hiss Davies whose call had been interrupted, had                                to    make

          sure that she had satisfactorily dealt with the Gatty Road

          fire whilst at the same                    time    trying     to    deal    with       the

          police request for assistance at Hillsborough.



    (d)   She     needed       to      know the address of Hillsborough Football

          Ground to- make             sure     the     appliances      were        sent    to    the   Davies
                                                                                                       20.40.C-D
          correct     place and as quickly as possible from the nearest

          fire stations.              She was, in our          submission,          entitled      to

          expect     that           police      force       control would know the place

          where     the        Fire     Service        were    required       as     they       were

          presumably already in attendance. If more detail as to the

          location could in fact have been provided                           it     could      have

          caused     an unnecessary delay,if she had mobilised the Fire

          Service to the district of Hillsborough. This                              would      have

          been     the appropriate alternative procedure in the absence

          of such information.



    (e)   She asked for the             road     three        times    whilst        typing      the

          information           into     her     computer       and     the    first        enquiry

          produced        an     answer       unrelated        to     the    question.           The

          address,        Penistone          Road,     was     finally       provided by Hiss

          Davies' supervisor, Mrs Hoody.



    (f)   If the police at Snig Hill had relayed                        the    message          from

          ground     control          that     the     Fire     Service       was required at          Davies
                                                                                                       20.46.B-C
          Leppings Lane, that information would have been typed into

          the    computer        by     Miss     Davies        and produced an immediate

          'special risk' response.




                                               - 4 -
     (g)   Hiss Davies needed to know the nature of the                               incident      at

           which     the        Fire        Service was required to attend so that a

           decision could be made as                    to    what     type     and    number       of

           statement that ,there had been a                      major      accident        was    not

           helpful        and     it        is unfortunate that PC Bichard's request

           for hydraulic cutting equipment which would have indicated

           the     need     for        emergency        tenders was not relayed to Hiss

 THE      INVOLVEMENT         OF THE FIRE SERVICE AS A MEMBER OF THE

The Fire Service as a member of the Officer Working                                 Party

and     later the Safety of Sports Ground Advisory Group gave

advice to the local authority.



Until 7th September, 1987, the Fire Service was designated

the     primary        authority      for   means       of     escape        and    fire    Core 27

precautions.           Thereafter       the      Fire        Service         area     of

responsibility          was    defined      as    fire        precautions,          fire

alarms, means of escape, emergency                  lighting           and     stadium

capacity.         It    was    recognised        however that the areas of                  Core 418

potential overlap of responsibility was                        quite     extensive.

Thus,     for example, when the removal of barrier 144 in pen

It was appropriate for the                Fire       Service      to     give    their

advice     on    means       of    egress       in    an    emergency       with the

following considerations in mind:



(a) The holding capacity of the pens would not                            exceed      54

    persons per 10 square metres



    Paragraph         15.3    of    the 1976 Green Guide, states that                       1986 Green Guide
                                                                                            Paragraph 220
   the number of people that can be                        safely       accommodated

    in    a     terrace      is    either the holding capacity or the

   capacity of the exit system.                      The Fire      Service       makes      Seaman
                                                                                            22.149•C-150A

   which are likely to occur.                    The west terrace and stand

   being concrete structures were regarded                          as     having      a

   very       low     fire    risk.        The       maximum holding capacity

   namely 54 persons per 10 square                      metres      permitted         by

   the     Green        Guide,     when     applied to the total area of
pens 3        and     4    would       produce       speeds     of    evacuation

through their respective exit systems which were below

six minutes and as such                  well      within     what     the     Fire

Service        regarded          as    the    safe     limit.        The holding

capacity to be determined by the                      Building        Surveyor's

Department           on    the     basis      of the construction of the

pens including the state and                      position      of    the     crush

barriers        was       likely       to be less than the maximum and

would        therefore       produce         an    even    more       favourable

evacuation time.



The     Club        and/or the police             would be able to control

the numbers of spectators entering the pens.



A plan for separate turnstiles for different                            sections

of the terrace was considered privately by Dr Eastwood                                Eastwood

and the Club          in 1981. At a Working Party                    meeting     on

18th    April,        1985,       a revival           of such      a scheme was       Core 211

approved but          was later abandoned by the                Club     because

of     the     expenditure            involved.       On    25th July, 1985,          Core 263

            admission       to      the    pens      on the terrace.          This scheme
                                                                                                Seaman

                                                                                                23.62.I>-63.B
            even brought to the attention of the Working Party.



     (c) Such        capacity        would       provide     for reasonable ease of

            movement.



            Even with the maximum holding                   capacity     permitted         by

            the    Green        Guide,     the     density     of spectator packing

            would permit ease of movement through the pen                            and   it

            is most unlikely that a serious crushing problem v?ould

            occur.        The     Fire     Service     video      and         photographs

            demonstrate             the      maximum        density       of         packing

            contemplated by the Green Guide.



4.   The gates in the perimeter fence and in the radial fences

     in the west terrafce.



     These were never intended by the Fire Service to cater for

     the     numbers      which      were admitted to pens '3 and 4 on 15th

     April, 1989.         When the perimeter gate to pen 3 was opened,

     many     persons       weire    already lying across the mouth of the

     gate and it is, in our submission, highly                       unlikely,          even

     if     the    gate     had     been     1.1 metres wide, that evacuation

     could have been conducted at such a rate as to                            save     life

     or           prevent            serious            injury.               That         is

                                             - 9 -
not to say that the gates would not have been adequate for

the    kind of emergency which could reasonably be envisaged

if the appropriate holding capacity had been adhered to.



Perimeter Fence Gates



(a) Paragraph 18.3 of the 1976 Green Guide                             requires        that
                                                                                                1986 Green Guide
      access to playing pitches must be made as difficult as                                    Paragraph 209


      possible in normal circumstances whilst providing                                 the

      police      with       proper           access to the terraces for crowd

      control and enabling the pitch to be used in the event

      of     a     serious           emergency.           Paragraph         7.9.1     which

      requires that such fences be provided with                              gates     for

      use    in    an emergency does not stipulate the frequency

      or minimum width of such gates.



(b) Paragraph 215 of the 1986 Green                           Guide    provides        that

      perimeter         gates        should       have        a minimum width of 1.1

      metres subject            to       paragraph        6    which    accepts       that

      deviation         from       individual        guidelines         are    possible

      without necessarily detracting from the overall safety

      of    the    ground          and        paragraph 8 which states that it

      should be borne in mind that, when using the Guide                                 to

      assess        whether              existing         circumstances         provide

      adequately for the safety of spectators, the criterion

      to    be    aimed       for        is    that of a reasonable degree of

      safety.

.   •'       clearance        width    of     0.77m was installed prior to the

             application for a Safety Certificate.



         (d) None of the perimeter gates in the west                         terrace           were
                                                                                                      Seaman's statement

                                                                                                      2 .12(iv)(c) and (d)
             the time in which the terrace or                    the     pens          could     be

             evacuated        in the event of an emergency which required

             total evacuation.             The gates were intended for use                       in

             the     event of local emergency to permit the evacuation

             of a relatively small            number       of     spectators             and     to

             allow access by the police'.

             of escape. On this particular terrace, evacuation                                 was

            to      the    rear,     and    the     placing of exit signs on the

            perimeter fence           gates    would       be     likely          to    attract

            spectators        away     from the preferred route and lead to

            an exacerbation of any existing crushing problems.

            was     well aware of the need for such gates and able to

            the police at the time that too                     many   spectators        had

            been allowed to escape rather than too few.



         (h) It    is     a        requirement of paragraph 7.9.2 of the Green                  (1986 Green Guide)
                                                                                                Paragraph 215
            Guide 1976 that perimeter gates should be                        controlled,

             so    that        immediate         access     to the pitch or perimeter

            track can be ensured in the event of an emergency.                            It

            follows           in     our   submission that if they are to be an

            effective safety measure:



            (i)         There must be an awareness by those controlling

                        the        packing       of the pens of the possibility of

                        crushing among the spectators.



            (ii)        There must be constant vigilance to ensure that

                        any difficulty or problem               within      the   pen     is

                        noted.



           (iii)        Prompt action must be taken to open the gate or

                        gates        if    the        need arises. In relation to the
                                                                                                Core 140
                        1981 incident, the Chief                Constable     said     that

                       his     only        criticism of his senior officers was

                       for not opening the gates earlier.



            (i) However:



                (i)    Prior to the game on the 15th April, 1989 Chief                               Duckinfield

                       Superintendent             Duckinfield          had    concluded, in

                       the light of the discussions and information he

    spectators         entering    pens     3    and 4 exceeded even the

    maximum holding capacity i.e. 54 persons per 10 square

    metres and steps had immediately been taken to prevent

    further spectators from entering the                  centre    pens        by

    closing      the tunnel and the radial gates, any crushing

    problem that arose could have been safely resolved                          by

    evacuating an appropriate number of spectators through

    the perimeter fence gates.              These would have permitted

    evacuation at a rate of at least 60 persons per minute

    per pen (attributing to each gate only one unit width,

    namely 0.55 metres.)

Radial Fence Gates



(a) The primary and preferred exit route from pens 3 and 4

   was the central tunnel            under       the   west     stand.         The   Health & Safety
                                                                                     Executive Report
   Health        and    Safety     Executive       have   calculated           the   paragraph 6.3

   maximum permitted holding capacities of-.pens 3                       and     4

   under        Paragraph        15.4(a)    of     the .1976     Guide         and
    Paragraph 222(a) of the                1986    edition      as     1,015       and

    1,036        respectively. Taking a            flow rate of 60 persons                1976 Green Guide 16.2

    widths        at   the tunnel for pen 3 provide                  an exit time

    of 5 minutes 38 seconds for 1015 spectators and the                              3

    unit     widths      at    the tunnel for pen 4 provide an exit

    time of 5 minutes 45 seconds for 1,036 spectators.



(b) In compliance with paragraph 6.13 of                    the      1976        Green

    Guide an alternative exit route was provided, although

    its possible use in an emergency was regarded                           by     the

    Fire     Service      as    extremely         remote.      The alternative

    routes were through the radial gates each of which are

    of     two    unit    widths.          Thus pen 3 could be evacuated

   through the gate into pens 1 and 2                     in   8     minutes        27

    seconds and pen 4 could be evacuated through the gates

    into pens 6 and 7 in 8             minutes       38     seconds. . It           is

    submitted          that     if    an     announcement       was        made    to

   evacuate the whole of              the    west    terrace,         spectators         Seaman 23.59-G-60B

   would naturally move towards the exits round the south                                Calvert 30.47-C

   and north ends of the west                stand       creating      a     vacuum

   into     which      the     spectators         from    pens 3 and 4 could

   readily be absorbed.

   50    of the 1986 Green Guide states that, a smooth, free

    achieved by controlling the crowd flow at the entrance

    to the      exit          route.     The   provision        of    a     wider     or

    additional gate in the radial fence would be likely to

    hinder the free              flow     through    the    alternative             exit

    route      via     the north and south ends of the west stand

    in that spectators would be entering                        the       outer    pens

    from the centre pens at a greater rate than they would

    be leaving them.



(d) It would have been                 undesirable   to    mark           the    radial    Eastwood

    gates or exit routes since that would                       in an emergency

    be likely to deflect spectators from the preferred and

    speedier        exit route even when the tunnel was open and

    available. Furthermore, the gates served not merely as                                 Seaman
                                                                                           23.4.C-E

    safe distribution of the spectators to take place.



(e) When the radial fences were approved                    by        the       Officer

    the   rear       of         the terrace- should        be        under      police

    control.         It         was clearly      understood          by    the     Fire

                                                                                           Seanan's statenen

   police      to    decide           how many officers were deployed to

   carry out that function.



(f) Paragraph 7.9.2 of the 1976 Green Guide required                               that

   access      points          through a pitch perimeter fence should

   be "controlled so that immediate access to                             the     pitch

   can    be    ensured          in     the event of an emergency".                 The
    condition       imposed            in    relation           to    the radial fence

   gates should have been read in this context.



(g) According to Superintendent Stuart, the requirement of                                      Stuart
                                                                                                31.108.D-H
   the     Working       Party          that          the     radial gates should be

   under police control was interpreted by the police                                      as

   a     conditional          control            in     the     sense that the gates

   would only       be    manned             when           segregation    was       taking
                          %
   place.      There          is       no    evidence          that     this       was ever

   discussed or given approval by the Working Party.



(h) In our submission, in order to control the numbers                                     in

   pens 3 and 4 it was essential to man the radial gates.                                       Evans

   If further entry into pens 3 and 4 was to be prevented                                       26.26.B-E

   by    closing     the central tunnel, it would be necessary

   to prevent or at least control                            movement     through         the

   radial     gates.      A police officer or officers stationed

   at the back of the terrace could have                              supervised          the

   packing     of    pens          3    and       4, directed spectators, and

   notified police control when the                            pens     were       reaching

   officer     would      be        immediately               available       to    direct

   spectators to the presence of the gate and                                 assist       in

   "swamped”     providing              the       maximum          possible        holding

   capacity      envisaged                  by    the        Green    Guide     was       not

   exceeded.
■A




     (i) It    appears that on 15th April,                    1989       spectators          did

         not    leave     pens        3       and 4    by way of the radial gates

         after serious difficulties had arisen within the pens.

         The    Fire     Service          anticipated that were the gates in                       Seaman
                                                                                                   22.151.D-E
         the radial fences to be                    used    for     this      purpose,        an

         announcement          on     the      public       address        system to that

         effect would be made.                 If     there       had    been     a    police

         officer on duty at the gate he would have been able to

        make spectators aware of the existence                           of     the        gates

         and    assist        in    keeping          the    gangway clear.            Had the

         number of spectators in each pen                      been      kept      even       to

        their     maximum          possible holding capacities, permitted

        by the Guide, relatively                     free    movement         towards        and

        through the radial gates would have been possible.



     (j) However,       the     apparent         failure of spectators to make
                                                                                                   Sykes

                                IN' SUMMARY



There       is no justifiable criticism that can be made of the

Fire Service as to the manner in which they                               responded         to

the     call     for     assistance            at 15.13.45.         The request came

from South Yorkshire Police                    Headquarters         Force           Control.

The     Fire     Service        in    the       interests      of     a    prompt          and

appropriate response were entitled to proceed on the basis

that     the     police       would       be      able    to   provide details of

precisely where their appliances were to                            attend          and    the

precise        purpose        for    which        they    were required.              On the

basis of the information that had been                         passed          to     Police

Force Control, all such information was in fact available.



In    any    event,      even        if any criticism can justifiably be

made against the Fire Service on this score,                              in    view        of

the    times     involved,           it   had       no causal       connection with

deaths and injuries sustained in the disaster.



In so far as there was any delay in the                           updating          of     the
                          *
Safety Certificate, that was neither caused by, nor was it

the responsibility of the Fire Service.



As regards the pens on the west terrace, and in particular

the    perimeter       fence         gates        and    radial     gates, the Fire

Service, in giving             advice        to    the    Working         Party,          were
entitled      to     proceed      on the basis that the Club and           the

police would control the numbers in, and the safe                      packing

of,     the   pens.        Even    if the numbers in the pens were as

high as the maximum possible holding capacity permitted by

the     Green Guide, it is submitted that the perimeter fence

gates and     the     radial       gates    would     have   performed     the

functions      for    which       they   were intended.       The perimeter

fence gates would have permitted the                  safe   evacuation     of

sufficient     numbers to resolve any local crushing problems

that could reasonably have been anticipated as                   likely    to

occur    in   those        circumstances.      The     radial gates, with

appropriate        directions,      would    have     provided     a      safe

alternative        means     of   escape from the centre pens if for

some reason, which was regarded as                  highly   unlikely,    the

tunnel was to become blocked.

              equipment,       once       it   became          apparent       that       persons were

              trapped behind the periaeter fence is pens                             3     and     4,    no

              request        for    the    Fire     Service           to attend was made until

              15.13.45.        Every appliance carries cutting equipment which                                 Hornsby
                                                                                                               20.73.F
              could       have       speedily           removed         the    perimeter           fence.

              Emergency tenders also carry heavier duty portable cutting

              equipment        which      could,        if     necessary, have been used to                    20.75-C

              remove the radial fences.



        (b)   Chief Superintendent DucJcinfield accepted that by 15.04 it                                      Duckinfield

              was     apparent to him that people were trying to get out of

              the pens and that            they     were           having     difficulty- getting

              through        the    gates.       Although he accepted that an obvious

              solution would be to cut some of the fence down, he stated

              that     the    thought        did    not        iumediately pass through his

              mind.       It is noted however that at 15.07                      a   request            from   S.A.i.

        (a)    It    is   to be noted that although the message passed by PC

                radial     gates.       A police officer or officers stationed

             (i) It    appears that ©a 15th April,                     1989      spectator*          did

                 announcement           oa    tie      public       address        system to that

                 effect would be made.                 If     tJs*r«   had       been     a    police

                 officer on duty at the gate he would have been able to

                 make spectators aware of the existence                          of     the        gates

                 and     assist        in    keeping         the    gangway clear.            Had the

                 number of spectators in each, pen                     been      kept     even       to

                 their     maximum          possible holding capacities, permitted

                 by tie Guide, relatively                    free    movement       towards         and

                 through the radial gates would have been possible.

                   STATEMENT OF




THE SOUTH YORKSHIRE FIRE AND CIVIL DEFENCE AUTHORITY




                ("THE FIRE SERVICE")
                                THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY



STATEMENT OF:    ALAN KEITH SEAMAN



OCCUPATION:      ASSISTANT CHIEF FIRE OFFICER




My name is Alan Keith Seaman.         I am employed by the South Yorkshire             County

Fire   Service   in     the   rank   of   Assistant   Chief    Fire Officer.      My major

reference is that of Fire Prevention/Safety, which amongst a great deal                    of

other matters, encompasses Safety at Sports Grounds.



I   have   been employed within the Fire Service for 23 years and I have been

involved with fire safety matters since April, 1973.



I have held my present post since February, 1987.             Prior   to   that    I    held

several    specialist    Fire    Safety posts at both Divisional and Headquarters

levels within the Fire Service.



I am a member of the Institution of Fire Engineers.
                              SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975



1.    The involvement of the Fire Service in the implementation of the Safety

      of Sports Ground Act, 1975



1.1   The Safety of Sports Ground Act (SSGA) was passed in 1975 following the

      publication        in    1972 of the Report of the Inquiry into Crowd Safety at

      Sports Grounds which               was     prepared    by   Lord   Wheatley            following       the

      serious    accident           at    Ibrox     Park    Football     Ground        in        1971, when 66

      spectators were killed on a stairway.



      The Home Office issued Guidance to Local Authorities under cover of

      Home Officer Circular 150/1975.                                                                              Ex 1




1.2   The Safety of Sports Ground Act gave the Secretary of                             State        power    to

      require     through       designation orders that safety certificates be issued

      to sports stadia with accommodation for more                       than     1 0 , 0 00       spectators.

      The     intention       was        for the Act to come into force gradually through a

      phased programme of designation orders so as not to place an                                   immediate

      financial burden on the smaller and less well off clubs.



1.3   The     first   order was made in August 1976 and applied to first division

      football clubs and             certain       international       grounds.        The       Home   Office

      issued     guidance       to       local     authorities     under       cover        of    Home Office

      Circular 130/76. Sheffield Wednesday's ground was designated in                                   August     Ex 2

      1978,     although       the club was not in the first division, because of it a

      quasi, international use.                Second   division       clubs    were        designated        in

      August     1979.        Third       and fourth division clubs and rugby league clubs

      were designated in August 1985, following the                       Bradford          City      Football

      Club fire.



                                            - 1 -
1.4   In 1976, the Home Office produced a voluntary code called the "Guide to

      Safety at Sports Grounds                 (Football)",         commonly        known           as    the    Green       Ex

      Guide.       This      gave     guidance       on     measures for improving the safety of

      spectators at sports grounds and extended the                           recommendations                   of   the

      Wheatley      Report.          The    County Council later contacted the Home Office

      regarding the application of the Green Guide and had been informed that

      basically       any     new     work       or -construction had to be of a                         standard not

      lower than that set out in the Green Guide but that maximum flexibility

      had to be maintained in the case of existing structures.



1.5   The    former South Yorkshire County Council, as the enforcing authority,

      delegated its powers and duties under the Safety of Sports                                          Ground     Act

      to     the   Fire       Service       Committee.       On 8 th January, 1976, the Committee

      decided that          their      functions          should    be    exercised            through          Officer

      Working      Parties       for       the     four     borough       council areas, consisting of

      representatives of the                police,       the      Fire    Service            and    the       building

      inspectors of the borough councils, with co-ordination being undertaken

      by David Vaughan who was the responsible officer of the                                       Department        of

      Administration.            He     also       took the chair and produced the minutes for

      all working party meetings.



1.6   In order to avoid duplication and                     division         of     resources,             a    primary

      authority        was     chosen       for     the     carrying         out        of     inspections,          re­

      inspections, and          making           final    technical       recommendations                  using     the

      headings        given     in    the      contents summary of the Green Guide with some

      additions.       The primary authority responsible was required                                    to    consult

      the     other authorities concerned before finalising any recommendations.

      It will be seen from the schedule that the Fire Service were designated                                              Ex 4

      the     primary       authority        for    means of escape and fire precautions.                             By

      virtue of their general experience as a                         fire        and        emergency         service,

      they     were     able    to      give       advice       on this subject.               However, the Fire

                                             - 2 -
Service did not attend and have not                                         attended            football               matches               as     a

matter of course.



It was the practice for all disciplines to report to the Administration

Department and thereafter for a joint meeting of                                                     the          Officer              Working

Party        to        be      held       after           which        the        agreed           recommendations                      of all

disciplines were                      amalgamated                into       a     report           by      the         Administration

Department               and        sent to the club(s).                         Copies of all correspondence and

the minutes of meetings were sent to each member and                                                             all        arrangements

for meetings                   were made by the Administration Department.

With the abolition of the South Yorkshire County Council                                                                 on 1st April,

1986 enforcement in South Yorkshire was to pass                                                     to the four

Metropolitan                    District Councils,                      Rotherham,             Barnsley,                Doncaster and

Sheffield.               The Local Government Act, 1985 amended Section 3 (3) of the

Safety          of Sports Ground Act so that in future in metropolitan counties

the local authority,                        in       this         case          Sheffield           Metropolitan                   District

Council           was           required to               send a copy of any application for a safety

certificate for a stadium to the chief officer of police and                                                                      the         fire

authority              and      to      consult            them         about the terms and conditions to be

included in the certificate.                                 The Officer Working Party was replaced by

the       Safety               of       Sports             Ground               Advisory            Group              comprising                  of

representatives from                        police,              Fire       Service,            the        building               surveyors
    division           and   the    Health    & Consumer Services Department of the local

    authority.           The Home Office issued guidance          on      the     new     arrangements

    under cover of Home Office Circular 7/1986.                                                            Ex 5



1.10 On     18th       February,      1986, a memorandum from the Chief Fire Officer was                   Ex 6

     circulated to all five Fire Service                divisions      detailing          the   changes

     that were to take place under the Local Government Act 1985 and the way

     the administrative arrangements of the Safety                     of    Sports       Grounds   Act

     1975, would be affected.



     It stressed the importance of establishing and maintaining good liaison

     between divisions and District Councils who would                       be    responsible       for

     administering the Act.



1.11 A letter dated 24th February, 1986, was received from Sheffield City                                  Ex 7

     Council indicating that as the Council were to take over responsibility

     as the Licensing Authority under the                Safety      of     Sports      Grounds     Act,

     1975,        it    would      be of assistance to the Council and other Authorities

     for an informal meeting to be held to discuss both existing and                              future

     arrangements for administering the Act.



1.12 On the 5th March, 1986 Mr D Vaughan                arranged a joint meeting, for the

     24th     March,         1986 with the officers of the District Councils who would                     Ex 8

     be taking over responsibility for Safety of Sports Grounds Act                             matters

     which     was       attended by officers from the police and Fire Service.                     The

     purpose of the meeting was to hand over the County Council's files                              and

     have     a    general         discussion   on Safety of Sports Grounds matters.                The

     Fire Service said that they hoped the South                  Yorkshire         County      Council

     General       Safety       Certificate     would   be   adopted        by    all the districts

     because this would help             them     standardise   on     one       rather    than     four

     different sets of conditions.

                                          - 4 -
    1.13 In Sheffield the Administration and Legal Department became the

         responsible      department and Mr David Bovmes was the responsible officer

         within the department.            In a letter dated 5th June, 1986, they attached                     Ex 9

         a   copy   of    a report which had been placed before the General Purposes

         panel on 6th May, 1986 together with a copy of the                    panel's     resolution

         in relation to that report.



         With   reference       to the Safety Certificate Conditions, the report noted

         that these were standardised throughout south Yorkshire and both police

         and    Fire     Service     had indicated that they wished this to continue for

o        reasons of administrative simplicity.                   It then went on    to     state    that

         the    conditions      gave       some   cause    for    concern as they appeared to be

         inadequate or inappropriate in some areas.



         It was proposed to re-draft the Certificate Conditions after which                           the

         Sheffield       Wednesday     certificate        would    be   replaced.        The Sheffield

         United certificate could then be issued with the new conditions                           before

         the    start     of   the     1986/87      season. In the covering letter, Mr Bownes                Ex 9

         indicated that the re-drafting              of   the     certificate      conditions      would

         shortly be completed and the comments of the Fire Service would then be

         sought.



         'ji’he Panel was asked for authority for the present administrative system

         to be continued for the time being.



    1.14 A meeting took place on 10th March, 1987 to deal with the future

         administration        of    the    Council's certification function.             The general       Ex 10

         feeling of the meeting was that the roles of                   each   authority     involved

         should be defined perhaps along the lines of the South Yorkshire County

         Council system.        This was described in a letter dated,               14th May, 1987,

                                            - 5 -
    from     Mr D Bownes, which enclosed a draft division of responsibilities.

    The letter asked for comments on the proposals                         that,   inter       alia     the   Ex 11

    following       should   be    Fire     Service responsibilities fire precautions,

    fire alarms, means of escape, emergency lighting, stadium capacity.                                 It

    was    also     proposed      there    should     in    future        be   only one inspection

    annually.



1.15 In a letter dated 7th July, 1987 the Fire Service:-                                                      Ex 12



     (a)   expressed the       view       that    division     of        responsibilities        between

           authorities         should      remain    along     the        lines    of    the    schedule
                                                                                                              Ex 4
           previously adopted and referred to in Para 1.6



     (b)     accepted the proposal of one inspection annually.



1.16 At a meeting of the Advisory Group on 16th July, 1987,                             the    definition
                                                                                                              Ex 13
     of    roles    was   discussed.         DO     Grimshaw    said        that    when determining

     capacity figures each discipline would have                     to     put    forward       figures.

     Those     of   the   Fire     Service       would     only be based on means of escape.

     Following those remarks, it was agreed that:



     (1)     Roles should be broadly defined and responsibilities taken                            on    by

             the    appropriate of the three "lead authorities" i.e. Police, Fire

             and Building Surveyors subject to agreement where overlap occurs.



           All contact with the            grounds    should        be    through       the    licensing

             authority.



             Environmental Health would take a "general safety role" and not be

             a "lead" authority.



                                        - 6 -
     (2)   The annual inspection was to be a              joint full     inspection       to       be

           carried out near the end of each season.



           D.P.   ("during     performance")        inspections      were    to be done on an

           individual basis.        Prior arrangements were to be            made      with    the

           Police,   but     not    the     Glub.    The Licensing Authority were to be

           informed when an inspection had taken place.



     (3)   The meeting was informed that legally the group                  was   an    advisory

           authority.    Only the council would          be the ultimate decision making

           authority.



     (4)   Individual authorities were to correspond with the sports                     grounds

           through     the    licensing authority who would subsequently circulate

           copies of all letters to each "lead" authority.


                                                                                               9



           Meetings of       the   group    would   be     held at     irregular       intervals

           depending     on need and would be called by any member of the group.

           Individual authorities          did not need to attend specific meetings if

           they had no "interest".

fi
           Agendas were to be issued prior to each meeting.




                                    - 7 -
        1.17 On     3rd   August,      1987,   a    draft   report         which    had been prepared for

             submission to the general purposes panel of the City Council                          was   sent    Ex 14

             to     the   Fire   Service.          In   that report, under the heading of "future

             administration of council certification function', it                       was      recommended

             that     the     "Safety    of    Sports Grounds Advisory Group" would serve as a

             forum for discussion between officers               and        would    form   the     basis   of

             written        detailed    advice to the council.             It was also recommended that

             the roles of the various officers should be                     defined    along      the   lines

             discussed        at the meeting of the 16th        J u ly ,    1987 and the point was made

             that there were extensive areas of potential overlap.

2.    History: 1978-1986

2.1   The South Yorkshire               County     Council         received        an       application         for    a

      General    Safety       Certificate             in    September,           1978.        The     club engaged

      Eastwood and Partners, a Sheffield based firm of                                  consulting        engineers

      as their consultants.



2.2   In    November     1978, the draft General Safety Certificate which had been

      prepared by the County Council following consultation with the                                         Officer

      Working     Parties         was     submitted         to     the    Fire         Service      Committee for

      approval to be used throughout the county.



2.3   On 2nd January, 1979, the Chief Fire Officer sent a memorandum                                         to   the

      Chief     Executive         of     South     Yorkshire         County           Council suggesting that              Ex 15

      officers of the working                 party        undertake      a      comprehensive          survey        of

      Sheffield     Wednesday            Football          Club    in unison rather than separately.

      The Chief Fire Officer suggested that a copy                               of     the    report      of     each

      department       be     provided to              each other department involved to enable

      problems to be discussed so                      that an       acceptable             approach      might       be

      determined       and    consolidated             into a        single       report       which should be

      forwarded to the club.                  The memorandum made several other                       observations

      regarding the standards necessary.



2.4   (i)   On 17th January, 1979                 the South Yorkshire County Council received
                                                                                                                           Ex 16
              a report prepared by Eastwood and Partners on ground                                    capacity        of

            Sheffield        Wednesday           Football         Club,     in    connection          with      their

             application          for     a    General       Safety       Certificate.              The      report:

             indicated       that       the     Green       Guide     had been used as the basir. for

            their      calculations,             although as         with        probably       all       existing

            grounds,         it        would      not        be      possible          to     satisfy     all     the



                                              - 9 -
   recommendations in the guide and reasonable                    compromise      would      be

   needed.



ii) Paragraph (b) of the report dealt with the west terrace (including

   the lower level at the north west corner but excluding                         the      north

   west         corner     reinforced concrete terrace).          The report considered

       that despite the fact that the full area of the west terrace could

       accommodate about 8 , 0 0 0 spectators, due to the lack of gangways an

       allowance should be made for circulation space in order that                         good

       packing could be achieved.           It further suggested that an allowance

       of 1 0 % be made for this purpose, resulting in a suggested capacity

       for the west terrace of 7,200.



       Crush     barriers were to be designed to match the capacity of 7,200

       spectators and additional barriers and                appropriate       strengthening

       of existing barriers would be provided for where necessary.



       Reference     is     also     made   to   the    evacuation     time     for the west

       terrace, this being about six minutes based on the                     exits     already

       available     and     also to the fact that some spectators would be 25m

       from an exit although movement along the terrace would be easy and

       quick.      The     existing     exits    were   through      the tunnel and round

       either side of the west stand.




iii)        A meeting of the Officer             Working     Party   was   held       on    12th
                                                                                                   Ex 17
               February,     1979,    the   purpose     of   which    was to discuss the

            report prepared by Eastwood and Partners and to consider                        the

            views which should be put to the club.



                                   - 10 -
      With           regard      to the west terrace, it was considered that due

      to the lack of depth of the terrace, the offer to reduce                                             the

      apectator             limit       to     7,200    and with a discharge time of 6.6

      minutes it would have been                       unreasonable         to     insist           on     the

      provision             of      gangways or additional exits.                  There was total

      movement laterally                     throughout     the    terrace         and        the        three

      entrance/exits                  from    the terrace were well situated.                       At the

      time, the worst disaster/emergency contemplated                                    was        one     of

       fire.           As     the     west      stand     provided a minimum of fire risk

       (because it was constructed in concrete) it was accepted that

       these routes would be available and adequate in an emergency.

       The existing gates in the perimeter fence were discounted for

       means          of    escape       purposes.          At that time the gates in the

       perimeter            fence       were     considered       to   be        there         for         the

       convenience               of   the      police     for     crowd control purposes and

       suitable as a means of egress for a relatively                                small           number

       of spectators in the event of a localised incident.



       It was noted that, subject to existing crush barriers passing

       the tests, they would require special attention                                   in    view        of

      the apparent sharp edges and corrosion.




On 2nd April, 1979, a meeting was held between the Officer Working

Party and the club to discuss the views                           of   the       Officer        Working

Party in respect of the report submitted by Eastwood and Partners.



A*              as          west terrace was concerned, it was agreed that the

club'B proposal for additional barriers and reductions in capacity

to   7, 2 0 0        without      the    need     for     additional        gangways should be

(v)   A meeting of the Officer Working Party and the Sheffield Wednesday

      Football Club was held on i8 th April, 1979 during which                                                        the    club

      accepted               that       the     stepping arrangement on the north west corner

      exit should be rebuilt.                            The matters concerning the crush barriers

      were         to        be     reconsidered              after          it    was seen which of the crush

      barriers failed on testing.



(vi) On 1st May, 1979, the City of Sheffield Building                                                   Surveyors            wrote

      to      South           Yorkshire             County Council and summarised in the letter,

      their own requirements in relation to matters discussed at                                                            recent

      meetings.                   The     Building            Surveyor indicated that, subject to the

      downward slope of exit steps at the north west corner                                                        exit      being

      corrected and the capacity being restricted to that agreed between

      the police and the                       club,          that      department             considered             the     west

      terrace to be acceptable.



(vii)On 16th May, 1979, the South Yorkshire County Fire Service wrote

      to South Yorkshire City Council, enclosing plans numbered 1610/12,

      1610/11, 1610/9A, 1610/8A, 1610/7A,                                         1610/6A,         1610/4A,           1610/2XA,

      1610/1XA and a recommendation of work schedule to be undertaken.



      With         regard to exit routes from the west and north west terraces,

      these were considered to be satisfactory.



      The provision of exit signs was required in the work schedule, the

      siting            of        which       was      indicated             on     the       plans.         There          was no
            requirement for such signs on the west terrace                    exits.        This   was

            because    they were the ones used for normal entrance and exit from

            what was an open terrace.             Further, none       were    required       for   the

            perimeter     fence     gates.        These were not       normal exit routes.          To

            have   exit     signs    for     these    gates    could     cause        problems     and

            confusion.



            The    schedule also detailed that adequate roads should be provided

            to ensure that speedy and             direct    access     could     be    obtained     by

            emergency     vehicles      to all exterior parts of the stadium and that

            it had to be ensured           that    parked     vehicles       would    not    obstruct

             The     Fire     Services'      plans     were     sent     to South Yorkshire County

             Council for duplication and for                   attachment          to     the    certificate.

             Party would have to review the situation due to the pending FA Cup

             semi-final between Arsenal and                Liverpool          on        12th    April,     1980.

          acknowledged         receipt     of     the     letter from South Yorkshire County

          Council referred to at 2.6(iv) above.                 An explanation        as     to    the

          lack     of training of stewards was given stating that this would be

          undertaken on completion of the fire alarm                    system    which     was      in

          hand.       All     other     matters     in    the letter of the 31st March were

          passed to Dr Eastwood for his professional advice.


t   (vi) On the 4th and 8 th April, 1980, Eastwood & Partners wrote to South
                                                                                                          Ex 33

          of exit signs and fire warning system and dealing with all matters

          referred to by the Building Surveyor.



    (vii)A meeting of the Officer Working Party and Sheffield Wednesday

          Football Club was held on 10th April, 1980 to discuss the areas of                              Ex 34

          concern recently communicated to the club and in view                      of     the     FA

          Cup Semi-final to be held on 12th April, 1980.                   The points covered

          by the letters from Eastwood and Partners on 4th                     and   8 th    April,

                                      - 15 -
           were     discussed       and as far as training of the safety stewards was

           concerned it was agreed that there was little point until the fire

           warning        system    had       been    completely        installed.         It    was noted

           however that the           Fire      Service    had        given     instruction        to    some

           stewards.



2.7   On   the 3rd September, 1980 South Yorkshire County Council wrote to the

      Chief Constable outlining the concern of the                       Chief     Executive        of       the
                                                                                                                   Ex 35
      police policy of locking away supporters inside grounds until such time

      as home supporters had cleared the area and suggesting that instead                                     of

      being      allowed to approach locked gates at the end of a match, the away

      supporters should be held back in a relatively safe place, such                                   as    on

      the terrace.



      Concern     was     also     expressed         at modifications being made at Sheffield

      Wednesday Football Club at the                 request     of     the     police,     without          the

      knowledge of the Officer Working Party.



2.8   On   the     16th    January,       1981,      Eastwood     and        Partners     wrote to South

      Yorkshire     County       Fire     Service      confirming        that      the      fire         alarm     Ex 36

      installation        and    modifications         to the public address system had been

      completed during July 1980.

                                                                                                                   Ex 37
      Club was held on 7th April, 1981 the purpose of which was to review the

      ground due to the pending FA cup semi-final to be held on                             11th    April,

      1981. Consultations between South Yorkshire County Fire Service and the

      police had resulted in            the     production       of     an    "Emergency        Evacuation

      Procedure".       The club undertook to circulate copies of the procedure to
                                                                                                                   Ex 38

       A copy of        the    procedure          is   produced      dated       12th         May, 1981.      The

       procedure        detailed      the     signal      to     be adopted to inform stewards and

       police that an emergency had arisen and the actions to be                                  followed     on

       hearing further announcements over the public address system.



2.10   A meeting of the Officer Working Party and Sheffield Wednesday Football

       Club   was       held    on    8 th    June,      1981.       It    was        noted    that following        Ex ^

       experiences        at    the    FA     Cup      Semi-Final         in     April,       the club       were

       considering        revised arrangements on the terracing in front of the west

       stand and that the Officer Working Party would be consulted whenthese

       had substance.



2.11   (i)          On     2nd September, 1981, Eastwood and Partners wrote to South
                                                                                                                     Ex 40
                    Yorkshire County Council detailing                         the      club's     proposal     to

                        instal two radial fences on the west terrace in such a manner

                    that the terrace would be divided                          into     approximately        three

                    equal areas, each served by its own entrance.                                The aim was to

                    achieve more control over supporters, a                             visiting     team     with

                    only       a     few supporters being allocated one section, with the

                    other two sections retained by the home supporters.



                    Larger         contingents           of    visiting           supporters         could     be

                    accommodated             in    two    or   all    three           areas as their numbers

                    dictated.         A 1.15 metre gate was proposed at the rear of each

                    fence.



       (ii)         A     meeting      of     the      Officer    Working         Party was held on 11th

                    September, 1981, to consider the proposed erection of                                  radial    Ex 41

                    barriers on the west terrace for crowd control purposes.




                                             - 17 -
        Whilst      there were reservations due to problems with opposing

        fans mixing at the rear of the west stand,                   the    police        felt

        that     they could cope with any problems of this nature and as

        they felt that increased control on the terrace should result

        from      the       proposals,    the     Officer   Working        Party    saw     no

        objections to their implementation.



        The adequacy and positioning of the gates to be installed                           at

        the rear of the radial barriers was discussed, as was the use

        of the existing gates in the pitch perimeter fence.                         It    was

        agreed       that      Messrs Eastwood and Partners be notified of the

        Officer Working Party's decision which was subject to:-



        a)     further calculations required by the Building                   Authority

               being satisfactory



        b)     the adequacy of headroom in the vicinity of the proposed

               gates at the rear of the terrace                and



        c)     the new gates at the rear            of   the    terrace      also    being

               under police control.



               It     was clearly understood by the representatives of the

               Fire Service that these gates would be constantly manned

               and      they    would    not     have approved the proposal if the

               situation was to be otherwise. Again, at this time,                        the

               perimeter         fence   gates    were never contemplated for use

               for mass evacuation on to the pitch.



(iii)   On 14th September, 1981, South Yorkshire County Council wrote

        to Eastwood & Partners welcoming the increased control on the
                                                                                                 Ex 42

        Officer Working Party                  and     the     conditions        referred     to     in

        2 .1 1 (ii)      above     that        the approval of the scheme was subject

        to.



(iv)    On 14th December, 1981, Eastwood and                          Partners    wrote to       South

        Yorkshire         County        Council        declaring that work on the radial

        fences was substantially complete.                           Whilst this had not           been   Ex 43

        previously            brought     to     the attention o£ the Officer Working

        Party,        there had been three first team home games since                             the

        fences had been erected and the police had inspected the work

        and were satisfied with the new arrangements.



(v)     On the 23rd            December,        1981,        the      Chief    Executive      (South

        Yorkshire County Council) sent a memorandum to the Chief Fire
                                                                                                          Ex 44

        were satisfactory.



(vi)    On    the      8 th    January,         1982    the        Chief      Fire Officer sent a

        memorandum to the Chief                 Executive            (South    Yorkshire      County      Ex 45

        Council)         dated     8 th January, 1982 confirming that the radial

        fences were considered to be satisfactory.



(vii)   On the 20th January, 1982, South Yorkshire County Council

        wrote to Eastwood and Partners                       commenting on the fact that
                                                                                                          Ex 46
        the matches played at the stadium since the                              installation       of

        the   barriers confirmed that they appeared to be working well

        and   satisfactorily             effected        the       segregation         of   opposing

        groups      of    fans.         It     was     noted       however,      that the entire



                                - 19 -
         section of the terrace had yet to be given to                         one       group   of

         fans.



         There    was        also    comment from the police that existing crush

         barriers       extended          up   to    and       completely    through          radial

         barriers       at     a    height      of 4'6 " or so, thus enabling fans to

         easily climb over the radial barrier into adjacent pens.



(viii)   On 26th January, 1982 Eastwood                    &    Partners     wrote       to   South
                                                                                                       Ex 47
         Yorkshire       County Council replying to the police observations

         with regard to crush barriers being up                       to     and    through      the

         radial barriers.



         Mr    Eastwood        observed        that if the crush barriers were to be

         removed up to a distance of 1.2m from                       the     radial      barriers,

         there       would     be     a    consequent          loss of calculated spectator

         capacity which is undesirable from the club's point of                                view.

         However,       from        the    point of view of safety, a strip of that

         width without a single crush barrier would be a major hazard.

         Wednesday       Football          Club     was    held on 4th February, 1982 in

         order to       discuss          the   apparent         difference     of     opinion     on

         certain      aspects        of the radial barriers on the west terrace,

         these being the observations of the                       police     in    relation      to

         crush barriers passing adjacent to the new radial barriers.



         It    was    agreed        that,      on   balance, it was preferable from a

         safety point of view to prevent crowd surge by                            the    existing

         barriers       being       extended up to and/or through the new radial

              barriers than to completely prevent                            persons     being        able     to

              climb from one pen to another.



2.12   (i)    A      meeting           of    the        Officer       Working   Party     and        Sheffield

              Wednesday Football Club was held on 23rd                             January,          1985,     in   Ex 49

              order to carry out the winter inspection of the stadium.



              The      club recalled the practice followed in consultation with

              the police of separating home and visiting supporters at                                        the

              rear         of    the        west        stand    at    certain matches (such as with

              Liverpool) by                 erecting        of    temporary      barriers.           This     had

              worked            well    but        in     all    other normal occasions it was the

              policy of the police to aim for                           exclusive       use    by     visiting

                  supporters           of the west stand and terrace. On those occasions

              when the number of visiting                         supporters      was     small       and     the

              weather            was        inclement, it was considered desirable to allow

              home supporters access to a sheltered area.



                  It was agreed that the club would                       consider       at    some        future

              date,         a     scheme       for       permanent       barriers at the rear of the

                  stand.



       (ii)   On the 9th April, 1985, Eastwood and Partners wrote                                    to     South

              Yorkshire            County          Council,       enclosing      sketch       plan        6705/2,
                                                                                                                    Ex 50
              stating that the club was anxious to segregate                                  the    visiting

              team's            supporters         as     they     entered      the ground and also to

              enable the police to control their exit at the end of a game.

              The      scheme          involved          the     construction     of two new banks of

              turnstiles and various runs of fencing                            and     new     gates.         It

              provided           for        separate       turnstiles for the three sections of

              the west terrace that then existed.

                                            - 21 -
A meeting of the Officer                    Working       Party      was   held    on        18th

             1985    to discuss the proposals for segregation at the

LeppingB Lane end.



The police were            already           familiar      with      the   proposals          and

indicated       that       they       had        instigated         them because of their

desire to allow greater flexibility in the use of the terrace

and    stand by both home and away supporters, allowing them to

vary the neutral area between opposing fans as                              circumstances

dictated       and        to    achieve such arrangements for ingress that

would allow turnstiles to be dedicated to specific areas.



At the meeting, the police suggested                           the     provision        of    two

further radial fences, one dividing the existing central area

in half and running from the tunnel                            entrance    to     the        pitch

side     security          fence       with       gates    to permit entry to either

section as appropriate, the other dividing the existing north

end    of the terrace in half and running from the front to the

back of the terrace.



In addition, the two new pens created by the provision of the

radial       fences were to be provided with additional exit gates

through the pitch perimeter fence, the new                              radial     fence       at

the    north        end    of        the     terrace      to    have two gates and the

existing radial fence to the north side of the tunnel to have

a second gate.



The    provision          of    the second gate in each of the two radial

fences to the north of the tunnel was to allow police                                   access

to     all      parts           of         the   terrace       to    control      any    crowd

Items     (b)       and (c) above were specifically put to the police

as they, along with the club, were responsible                                     for    ensuring

that     emergency           evacuation            procedures       were           adequate         and

controlled and had               experience          with     the      club         of    ensuring

correct       crowd       density        packing.          The assurance was given by

the police that all the gates included in the                                  proposals            for

the terrace part of the scheme would be manned by them at all

times during games in order that evacuation procedures                                            could

be initiated should this become necessary.                               As far as correct

density       packing        was     concerned,            the    police           stated          that

arrangements           that      they     had with the club were satisfactory

and they felt that the provision of smaller sections                                          on    the

terraces would make overall control of the terrace easier.




In     the        light   of     these assurances, the Fire Service saw no

objections in principle to the proposals subject                                     to       a    more

detailed investigation of the means of escape aspects.



It      was         agreed       that    R        Grimshaw       (Fire        Service)            should

investigate as a                matter       of     urgency      the     means           of       escape

aspects           of      the      proposals         and     subject          to     satisfactory

clearance of these matters, the outline                             proposals             submitted

would        be     agreed       as now amended by the suggestions of South

Yorkshire Police and, to                     the     submission          of        the    necessary

detailed          plans      and     calculations           under      both the Safety of

Sports Grounds Act and Building Regulations.




                          - 24 -
(iv)   (a)   On examination of the plan             by    the    Fire     Service,         the
                                                                                                 Ex 50
             width    of    the     exit    gates    to    allow for the number of

             spectators that it was anticipated would                    use    them       was

             calculated        and it was decided that the gates would have

             to be supervised by either the police or club officials.

             With     regard      to the terracing arrangements, it was felt

             that the proposal for the new radial fence at the tunnel

             position      had     little    effect on the existing situation.

             The capacities, travel distances and                 exit     arrangements

              from the two new central pens did not change.                      In fact a

              new gate through the pitch perimeter                fence        was    to    be

             provided.         The new radial fence at the north end of the

              terrace      did    actually     slightly     increase       the        travel

              distance to the normal route of exit i.e. the way across

              the terrace otherwise there was no change.



       (b)   It was not thought necessary to              sign    any     exit       routes

              because:



              (i)    the   principle        ingress/egress       route would be that

                     already familiar to users, and

              (ii) radial fence gates would be manned by police or

                     stewards on the spot.



       (c)   The gates through the perimeter fence were considered to

             .be    necessary,      this    being reflected by the request for

             two additional gates in the newly created pens.                         The use

             of     the gates was under the direct control of the police

             and was to allow their access into                 the     terrace       should

             any     disturbance arise and to relieve any local build up

             of pressure at the front of the pens or allow any person

      (d)   It     was never considered that the gates in the perimeter

            fence would be used for the                        evacuation of each                 section

            because           (i)     the    risk        of     fire    in the west stand and

            terrace was low and (ii)                      it    was     considered             that        the

            height           and     strength       of        walls    and     gates outside the

            Leppings Lane end. were such that the                              risk        of     a    door

             being       forced        or    the      walls       scaled       and        fans thereby

             entering in large numbers was remote.                             At        no     time       was

             there any suggestion to the contrary.



             If       any          situation        arose         that       necessitated              total

             evacuation of the central pens this would in                                     the      first

             instance be by way of the normal route on to the terrace

             i.e. the tunnel.               Should the tunnel                be     obstructed             for

             any      reason,         the    gates        in the radial fences                   would be

             used as directed by the police with                             the         assistance         of

             the public address system.




(v)   On    the 30th April, 1985, South Yorkshire County Fire Service

      wrote to South Yorkshire County Council                                indicating that               the   Ex 52

      new      crowd          control       arrangements              were     considered             to    be

      satisfactory providing                   that      certain        gates        had      widths        as

      indicated         on     the      plan     attached to the letter and that the

      gates would be supervised by either police or club officials.

             for crowd           control        arrangements              were    generally           acceptable

             consideration be given to the requirement for the second gate

             in the two radial fences since if they were meant for use                                              in

             an    emergency it would mean having a steward in attendance on

             each     occasion,               the     expense        of    which      would         hardly          be

             justified.

             gates      were        included           primarily at the request of the police

             who had indicated that they                        were       prepared        to      concede        the

             request         for      the       two     additional gates subject to all other

On      1st       August,        1985,        Eastwood and Partners wrote to South

Yorkshire County Council acknowledging the                                          comments       of      the

Officer           Working Party meeting of 29th July, 1985 Dr Eastwood

asked for further clarification of the location of a proposed

extra security gate, claiming that an existing gate in the 2 m

wide gap could be used by police and would still be available

for      use for spectators in emergency as there were gates into

the 2 m gap from the terrace which would be under the                                               control

of      the       police.        With respect to the provision of stewarding

for all the new gates, (item                              (j),      of     the       minutes        of     the

29th July,             1985).         Dr Eastwood commented that this would no

doubt be taken care of by the club.



A    meeting          of     the     Officer              Working        Party        and        Sheffield

Wednesday            Football Club was held on 7th August 1985 to carry

out the "summer" inspection and in                                  particular          to       view      the

Leppings Lane end improvements.                                  The matter for clarification

dealt with in the letter at (xiii) above was investigated and

it      was       noted      that there was an existing gate in the new 2 m

wide gap for use by the police.                                  Again    it        was stated           that

these            gates     would         still          be       available          for the        use       of

spectators in an emergency as the gates at                                          the top        of      the

terrace           under      the control of police would enable spectators
                 to be directed down the 2 m wide gap, although it                                    was     agreed

                 that steps or a longer gate would be required.



                 Also     at this meeting, the club agreed to provide a new pitch

                 perimeter fence gate at the Spion Kop end                               (as      discussed         at

                 the meeting of the 29th                  July, 1985 - see 2.12(xii) above).

                 There     were already four existing pitch perimeter fence gates

                 at the Spion Kop end.                 Unlike the gates in the fence                        at     the

                 Leppings       Lane end, it was contemplated that these gates (and

                 other exits) would be used in the event of the whole                                       terrace

_                having        to be evacuated, and these gates were included in the

    3.    History:          Afterlocal government re-organisation



    3.1 At      a    meeting             at       the    Hillsborough ground in the summer of 1986 (not

          minuted) attended by the police, the local authority (Mr                                  Bownes),      the

          Building          Surveyor, the Fire Service (Mr Grimshaw) and Dr Eastwood, the

          police asked that consideration be given to the removal of the southern

          half       of     the        crush       barrier immediately in front of the tunnel by the

          Officer Working Party.                        The matter was discussed and approval given                to

          the removal of all but the northern third of that barrier.



    3.2   A     Home       Office Circular (75/1986) was sent to the Fire Service on 29th                                Ex 66

           October, 1986 enclosing a copy of the re-issued Green Guide.




    3.3    A letter dated 3rd November, 1986, was received from Sheffield City
                                                                                                                         Ex 67
           Council asking for Fire Service Comments in writing as to the condition

           of       thestadium          under            the    1975   Act.        It asked for any outstanding

           matters requiring attention to be detailed.



    3.4    An inspection of the                    Hillsborough        ground      was   carried    out     on    17th

           particular             it    was       recommended      that       a    satisfactory security device

          arrangements were only acceptable subject to exits being stewarded                                                         and

          received by the Fire Service for their comments.



          The     letter          referred            to        the     fact    that the police, Fire Service and

          Building Surveyor had been asked to comment on                                         the        condition        of      the

          stadium having regard to the provisions of the 1975 Act.                                                 At that time,

          no comments had been received from the Building Surveyor and the police

          had     indicated            that       they           were     quite       satisfied with the stadium and

          indicated that the degree of co-operation that they received                                                  was       very

          satisfactory.

      The    letter       then     pointed      out    that   the Fire Service had a number of

      comments to make and these were to be                   attached        in    the    form        of     the

      letter    of    18th       February.        It did not however include further points

      that had been discussed at the Officer Working Party                           meeting          held     on

      10th March.



      Following       a    telephone      conversation with Mr David Bownes to point out

      this omission, a copy of the                letter,     annotated        with       the    additional

      points was returned to him .



3.8   Prior    to the Leeds/Coventry FA cup semi-final on the 12th April, 1987,
                                                                                                                     Ex 71

      police at the Hillsborough ground.



3.9   On     22nd    April, 1987, an amended copy of the letter previously seen in

      draft was       sent       by   Sheffield        City   Council     to       Sheffield          Wednesday

      Football       Club.       On    this occasion the further points discussed at the                             Ex 72

3.10 On 7th July, 1987, a letter was sent to                        Sheffield      City     Council           (see

      1.13     above).        The      letter    concluded       by    requesting         that        Sheffield

      enclosing       the new draft certificate conditions.                     The conditions were a

      first draft only and in basic                   form,   not     tailored      to     the        needs    of

      individual           stadia.       Also         enclosed      was   a     first      draft        of    the

         surveyor       the     Health      &     Consumer         Services        Department      and       the

         Administrative          & Legal Department of the local authority.                     Dr Eastwood

         attended on behalf of the club.                  All matters contained in the letter of

         18th     February,         1987,       were   discussed         with Dr Eastwood who tended to

         agree with most of the points.



    3.13 On 13th August, 1987, a reply to Sheffield                         City    Council's      letter     of

                 preventing         overcrowding by ensuring crowd limits in various parts

                 of the ground were complied with, It was "difficult to imagine how

                 this     task      could       be controlled by stewards" and that "the matter

                 should be considered further".



          (b)    in relation to condition 1 0 (i) which dealt with stewards complying

                 with     instructions           given    in     emergency       by the police "reference

          received by the Fire Service.                  The letter referred to the revised Guide                     Ex 76


          to     Safety    at    Sports Grounds and drew the club's attention to the new

            possible.



3.15 By    letter        dated       23rd October 1987, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

     replied to the letter of 21st October, 1987.                           A copy     of    their        letter

    was     received        by       the Fire Service on 26th October, 1987.                      This letter        Ex 77

♦
    3.17 A     letter     from    Sheffield            City    Council dated 8 th February, 1988, was

         received.       The letter enclosed copies of a letter dated                          3rd   February,
                                                                                                                     Ex 79
         1988,     received       from Eastwood and Partners that had been sent in reply
                                                                                                                     Ex 80
         to the Fire Service             letter         of    18th   February,     1987.        David      Bownes

         expressed       concern        at    the       apparent     criticism     of    the     Fire Service

         contained in the letter from Eastwood and Partners and                            suggested         that

         the Fire Service respond directly to them.



         The     letter     from    Eastwood            and    Partners    dealt with the Fire Service

         letter item by item and in general most of the matters had already been

         dealt     with     or were agreed upon although there were still some matters

I        that required attention, some of them to be dealt with when                                 the     south

         stand     was refurbished in 1991.                   The concluding paragraph of the letter

         indicated that the club was concerned that with each new member of                                    the

         Fire         Service      to        the       Officer   Working    Party,      new     or     different

         recommendations were being put                       forward   which    in     some    cases       openly

         contradicted the recommendations offered by                        predecessors.



    3.18 On     29th     March,     1988,          a    letter was sent to Eastwood and Partners in

         reply to their           criticism of the Fire Service.                                                     Ex 81



\
    3.19 By letter dated 29th March, 1988, the police informed the Fire                                    Service

         of     the     parking     and       travelling arrangements made for the FA Cup semi

         final on 9th April, 1988.                                                                                   Ex 82




    3.20 At the 1988 semi final, two fire officers carried out an inspection                                    of

            stressed       that        it   was     essential    that     the    Fire Service received an

            comments made in the Fire Service's letter to                        Sheffield     City    Council

            dated        13th    August,      1987.      The letter listed four points for further

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975



NOTE BY THE HOKS OFFICE




BACKGROUND

1.     The purpose of the Act is to implement the main recommendations
contained in the Report of the Inquiry into Crowd Safety at Sports Grounds
(Cmnd 4952: 1972). This report was prepared by Lord 'Wheatley who undertook
his inquiry, at the then Government's request, following the tragedy at
Ibrox Park football ground in January 1971 when 60 people died and over
140 were injured.

WHEATLEY REPORT
2.   Lord Wheatley had no doubt that present controls over safety at
football grounds were inadequate. He found that the existing voluntaiy
system of certification of grounds introduced by the Football Association
some years ago laid down no requirements as to the competence of persons
who carry out the annual inspections of grounds and there were no guidelines
to assist those persons in their assessment of safety standards. Moreover,
a review of the statutory provisions relevant to the safety of spectators
at football grounds convinced Lord Wheatley that the law also fell short of
providing proper and effective control over football grounds as a whole.
The building regulations, for example, provide for the basic structural
safety of new buildings within a football ground but the;7, do not apply to
existing buildings, except where alterations are to be carried out, nor
do they apply to a ground as a whole. In any case, most football grounds
were built before national building regulations were introduced.

3.   Lord Wheatley concluded that only a specially devised statutory scheme
could ensure comprehensive controls at football grounds in the interests
of safety. He recommended'a statutory licensing control administered by
the "top tier" of local authorities. He proposed that these controls should
be introduced by stages, the larger or more important grounds, broadly
speaking, being dealt with first. Lord Wheatley also recommended that there
should be a right of appeal for the clubs concerned against any decision
of the licensing .authority, //hat is quite clear throughout the report is
Lord Wheatley's awareness of the need to reconcile the paramount aim of
ensuring the safety of spectators with what would be reasonable and
practicable for the clubs.

4 . Lord ivheatiey also provided, as a technical appendix to his report,
guidelines to cafety standards at football grounds designed to assist the
local authorities in their task of enforcement.

CONSULTATIONS Q'S. THE REPORT

5.   When the Report was published, those bodies mainly concerned, including
the local authority associations and the football authorities, were
consulted about Lord Wheatley's proposals.. The football authorities made
it clear that they were apprehensive at the financial implications for the
m

    clubs, but there was general agreement with the proposals themselves.
    Detailed consultations were held on the guidelines contained in the
    technical appendix to the Report and these, duly amended, were finally
    published by the Home Departments in November 1973 as a special booklet,
    "Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds".

    GUIDE TO SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUi'IDS

    6.   The Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds has no statutory force. Its
    primary purpose is to set out principles or guidelines which the local
    authorities will no doubt wish to keep in mind in enforcing the Act.
    The Guide therefore deals with matters such as the provision of adequate
    entrances and exits, means of escape, the slope of terracing, the
    strength and siting of crush barriers, the construction of staircases,
    and measures to ensure the safe movement of spectators both under normal
    and emergency conditions. The Guide is not a set of requirements to
    be rigidly applied, regardless of individual circumstances. As
    Lord Wheatley recognised, it is important to maintain the maximum
    flexibility in any system of control so as to take account of the
    differing circumstances at individual grounds: factors such as age,
    size and mode of construction differ widely from ground to ground.

    7.   V/hile the basic principles set out in the Guide are relevant to
    all sports stadia, modifications may well be necessary where sports
    other than football are involved. The3 e will be discussed with the
    appropriate authorities at the time. A copy of the Guide is attached.

    THE GSIiSRAL APPROACH TO THE ACT

    8.   Lord ".vheat ley recommended that the introduction cf any system cf
    control should be phased so that the more important grounds, regularly
    attracting the larger attendances, should be dealt with first. It is
    intended, accordingly, that only those grounds consistent with
    Lord Wheatley's category 1 should be dealt with first, that is to say,
    the international grounds, the English First and Second Division and
    the Scottish Premier Division Clubs, about 60 in all. But the full
    system of control under the Act will not apply to Lord Wheatley's
    category 4 , namely, grounds with accommodation for fewer than 10,000
    spectators. The intention is that safety at these grounds should be
    secured largely by voluntary action on the part of the club concerned in
    consultation with the local authority.

    9.   The main instrument of control under the Act is the safety
    certificate issued by the local authority. A safety certificate will
    be needed in respect of every stadium which is the subject of a
    designation order made by the Secretary of State. The certificate will
    enable the local authority to impose such terms and conditions as are
    necessary to ensure a reasonable standard of safety at the ground in
    question having regard to the circumstances.

    10. The Act has been designed with football stadia chiefly in view.
    But other stadia, if necessary, can be brought within the system of
    local authority control as well as places such as racecourses where
    large numbers cf spectators may be crowded together in stands. Nothing
    will be done, however, without full and prior consultation with those
    concerned.



                                       2
JU3STANCS OP THE ACT

11 .  The first 5 sections establish the main system of control under
the Act, that is to say, the safety certificate, issued by the local
authority, which will be required for every sports stadium designated
for that purpose by order of the Secretary of State.

12. Section 1 empowers the Secretary of State by order to designate
any sports stadium having accommodation for more than 10,COO spectators
as requiring a safety certificate. A safety certificate is issued by
the local authority for the area in which the stadium is situated, that
is to say, the county council in England and '.vales and the appropriate
regional authority in Scotland. Safety certificates are to be of two
kinds, general and special.     A general safety certificate will be the
main continuing fora of control and will be issued for an indefinite
period in respect of a specified activity or activities regularly
taking place at the stadium. A special safety certificate may be issued
at the discretion of the local authority for a special event or other
circumstances not covered by the general safety certificate. Such an
event might be an evangelistic rally which might call for special
arrangements if, for example, seating were provided for the congregation
on the playing area. A special safety certificate can be issued only ir.
rcscect of a sports stadium for which a general safety certificate is alrea-
"ijo 1 %h*e contents of safety certificates are dealt with in section 2 .
The local authority is empowered to include in the certificate such
terms and conditions as are necessary to secure, at the stadium in
question, a reasonable degree of safety. Without prejudice to this
general power, the section requires certificates to contain terms and
conditions relating to major matters such as entrances and exits, means
 of escape in an emergency, the number, strength and situation of crush
 barriers, and the maximum number of spectators who may be admitted to
the stadium or any part of it. To remove any possibility of doubt,
sub-section (j) makes it clear that a certificate may include a
condition relating to the keeping of records relating to attendance and
the maintenance of safety.

14.   In imposing conditions, local authorities will doubtless follow
the principles set out in the Guide to Safety at Jports Grounds, although
as already explained, this document has no statutory force. It is
envisaged that there will be a good deal of consultation between the
local authority and the club, as well as the building authority, the
police and tr.e fire service, in the process of drawing up the certificate
conditions. ?or example, if a ground is rarely filled to capacity,
the local --.uthority is free in such a case to base its requirements on
actual lev*!- of attendance over a given period rather than maximum
capacity. On the rare occasions a capacity crowd was expected, the
procedure of th« special safety certificate could be invoked so that
more than the normal permitted number cf spectators might be admitted
subject to    -.•ciai additional safeguards such as more attendants,
admission by -.i;l:ot only and so on. Again, if a stand were found to be
structurally - v - k , the local authority might restrict admission to it
until it had ceer: strengthened. 3ut the club would have the choice
whether to have the necessary remedial -works carried out, so that the
restriction could be removed, or to accept the restriction indefinitely.

15.   The earlier Bill, which was introduced in 1973, limited the terms
and conditions imposed under a safety certificate to what '.‘as necessary
to secure a reasonable degree of safety for members of the public.



                                 3
There v.-as some difficulty over this ter:.i because it might have excluded,
for example, members of supporters' clubs. This particular problem
has been met by the definition of "spectator" in section 17, that is
to say, any person occupying accommodation provided for spectators.
On the othar hand, it seems right that all the people present on the
occasion of a match or other activity for which a ground has a
certificate should be taken into account for the purposes of the
safety certificate, for example, people using a squash court or other
facilities at the ground. Accordingly, the general power of the
local authority under section 2 (l) to include in a safety certificate
such teims or conditions as are necessary omits any reference to
people and speaks only of securing "reasonable safety at the stadium",
(although the tern "safety", as defined in section 17, does not include
danger arising from participation in a sport). Certain provisions
must, however, be specifically linked with spectators (who are, after
all, the people the Act is mainly designed to protect and xrtio will be
greatly in the majority). Thus section 2(2) requires the certificate
to state the maximum number of spectators who may be admitted, and it
is a serious offence, under section 12 (1 ) { a ) or (c) for spectators to
be admitted to a designated stadium v/here no safety certificate is in
operation.

1o.   Section 3 sets out the broad procedure to befollowed when a
local authority receives an application for a safety certificate. It
requires then z c determine whether an applicant is, in their opinion,
a qualified person, that is to say, a person likely to be in a
position to prevent contravention cf the terms and conditions imposed
in the certificate. If so, they are then under a duty to issue a
general safety certificate to him. In this respect, the general safety
          t;   -L i/   u   l i i   c   i c   a   ^   i i C ' i i       j   . ^ j u   6 u   ~


Pire Precautions Act 1971. The latter is issued only after necessary
safety works have been completed. The .safety certificate under this
Act will be. issued almost from the cutset and will be an instrument
of continuing control. The issue of a special safety certificate,
however, is left to the discretion cf the local authority, as already
explained, because cnly they can judge whether it is appropriate to
issue it for the special occasion in cuc-stion.

17.   The local authority are       requiredto send a copy of any
application for a certificate       to the police and to the building
authority, and must consult them abcut the ten: and conditions to oe
included ir. the certificate. The need for such consultation is self-
evident:    there must be close co-ordination of the interests of the
different authorities directly concerned with different aspects of
safety at football grounds.

18.   Section 4 provides for the amendment, replacement, transfer,
surrender and cancellation of safety certificates. It is of primary
importance that a local authority should have power to amend a safety
certificate where it appears appropriate for them to do so, for example,
if they find in the course of a routine inspection that a part of a
ground has become so dangerous as to demand an immediate restriction on
its use or some other necessary safeguard. Again, they must have
power to relax a requirement where, for example, certain improvements
have been carried out to make this possible.

19.   Section 5 provides for appeals by interested parties against
decisions or requirements of the local authority in connection with
safety certificates. Appeals will lie to the Secretary of State. In
this respect, there is a departure from Lord Wheatley's proposal that


                                                                   4
appeals should be heard by a specially constituted tribunal. But apart
from the need to avoid creating more special tribunals than necessary,
most appeals are likely to be on technical matters and it therefore
seems appropriate for appeals in this case to be made to a Minister.
But the Secretary of State will have power to set uu a formal iEquiiy
along the lir.es recommended by Lord Wheatley, should the need arise.

20.   Section 6 (2 ) empowers the Secretary of State to cake regulations
relating to the safety of spectators at sports grounds. 'This is in
the nature of a reserve power which could be used, for example, to
give backing to requirements of the local authorities which in the
light of experience had been shown always to be essential. This
section also empowers the Secretary of State to males regulations for
various other purposes connected with the Act.

21 o  Section 7 provides for acme supplementary matters or. determination:
and appeals, Sub-sections (1 ) and (2j provide for the deemed with­
drawal cf an application for, or the surrender of, a safety certificate
when a local authority determines that a person is not, cr has ceased
to be, qualified to hold it. The section also provides for the
suspension of a condition in a certificate pending determination of an
appeal against the inclusion of that condition, although a court, on
the application of the local authority, may order that such a condition
remain in force pending the determination of the appeal.

22.   The holier of a general safety certificate is required by
section 8 to notify the local authority of any proposed alteration or
extension of a stadium. The purpose of the clause is to guard against
any alterations being made, without the Iccal authority's knowledge,
which might affect, the safety of spectators*

23.   Section 9 provides for the harmonisation of the Act with other
legislation which may affect sports stadia..

24.    Section 1C is an important emergency power. Should a magistrates1
court, on the application of a local authority, consider that the risk
to spectators at any sports ground is sc great that their admission
should be prohibited or restricted until remedial action has been
taken, the court may make an order accordingly. This power applies
to any sports ground whether or rot it is required to have a safety
certificate. In practice, it is not expccted that the power will
often ne-jd tc be exercised. In the case of a small football staaium,
for exacplv, not subject to the designation order procedure,
consultation:: between the local authority and the club concerned are
expected to sc-cure the prevision of a reasonable standard of safety on
a voluntary fci-sis.

25. Section 1i confers rights of entry and inspection on persons
acoointed by the local authority and others involved in the task cf
ensuring crowd safety at sports grounds. Section 12 deals with offences
and penalties.

26.   Section 1j deals mainly with civil liability. Its purpose is to
make clear that while nothing in the Act itself confers a rigjit cf
action in respect cf a contravention of regulations or of conditions
in a safety certificate, the existing rights of a spectator injured
at a football stadium to bring an action for negligence against tr.e
occupiers is entirely unaffected by anything in the Act.



                            5
27.   The Secretary of State is empowered by section 15 to extend to
classes cf sports grounds other than sports stadia such provisions of the
Act as are not already expressed to apply to then. For example, it
enables the Secretary of State by order to extend the safety"certificate
procedure to such places as race-courses. Cnly a class of sports ground
may be the subject of an extension order under this clause: an individual
sports ground (other than a stadium) cannot be designated until section 1
of the Act has been applied.by an order under section 15 tc the class cf
sports ground to which it belongs.

28.   Section 16 applies the Act, subject to necessary modifications,
to the Crown. Section 17 deals with interpretation.

29.   Section 18 provides that orders and regulations except commencement
orders, made under the Act are subject to the negative resolution
procedure. It also imposes a duty on the Secretary of State, before making
any orders or regulations, except commencement orders or orders relating
to the Isles of Scilly, to consult with such persons as appear to him
requisite.

 FIRST BCSIGHATION OlfflSR AND ACCOMPANYING REGULATIONS

 1. 'The intention was expressed in Bores Office Circular No, 150/1975 of issuing, in
 due course, further guidance on the procedure to be followed when a ground- is designated
 undor the Safety of Spox'ts Grounds Act 1975 ess requiring a safety certificate.’ As
 will be seen from the enclosed copy, an order has now been made (SI 1976 Ko. 1264)
 des.1 gnating under the Act. with effect from 1 January 1977, the international association
 end rugby union football grounds and those of the clubs in the first division of tfcs
 football league.                 -

  2. It is an offence under section 12(1) of the Act to admit spectators to a designated
  stadium after the date on which the designation order relating to it cor.cs into
  operation, unless-an application for a general safety certificate has been m d c and not
  subsequently withdrawn or dee:ned to have been withdrawn. In consequence, therefore,
  of this order, the .local authorities for the areas in wliich the grounds are situated
, *y expect to receive by the date of operation applications for the grant of general
W . c e r t i f i c a t e s under the Act, which will thereupon fall to be dealt with in
'•lA vrdance vith the Act and the regulations, also enclosed made under section 6(1) of
 H e Act (SI 1976 No. 1203).

 3* Guidance as to the procedure to bs followed, in conformity with the regulations,
 in dealing with' applications for general safety certificates is set out in the aunex
 to this circular*

     l‘t is not proposed at this stage to issue guidance as to the procedure to bs'
 followed in connection with the grant of special safety certificates, since* uuder
 section 3(2) of the Act, such certificates are not required until general safety
 certificates are in operation.' Further guidance for this purpose t/i-U accordingly be
 doJerred until nearer the date when n need for special safety certificates n z y aris»*
 Tnere is, however, one lac cor regarding the issue of such certificates which may hove
 a bearing on the date of the introduction of a general safety certificate and to i.v.ich
 regard suould accordingly be paid. Once a general safety certificate has been issuod,
 a person visaing to conduct an activity calling for the issue of a special safety
 certificate wast. ccnsply v i t h all tho requirements relating to such certificates laid
 dowr in the regulations. Vfnere, therefore, such -an -event has already becsn ■arranged,
 local* authorities ray wish to consider, where appropriate, the desirability of not
 issuing n general certificate -until: after tho event has talien place*-

 J>t The- regulations provide specific time limits for'the determination, of ap»li<:n>.io;jr.i
 for sp'fi-.’l safety certificates* but' this is not the case ae regards general s-uvl.y
■certificates," Although local authorities and the clubs o.-hl other organisations o;.rral;rv

      and consultations involved in determining suitable terms and conditions will,
 uiy cases, still extend ever several weeks, so that it will not be practicable,
cially should appellate proceeding arias, to bring certificates into effect
ificantly in advance of the end of the 197b/7? season. In these circumstances,
where a club or stadium' company wishes to talee advantage of the close season to
y c«t structural work wliich will have tho effcct of significantly altering the
    and conditions which would otherwise have applied, local authorities may feel that,

Section 6(1) (b) of the Act enables the Secretary of State to make regulations
 uri.sS.ns local, authorities to dotcrr.dne the fees which may be charged in respect of
; ,,;*>.fcions for safety certificates* In the discharge of this power, regulation 1 **

    i-e work actually « id reasonably done.. As regards the issue of a general safety
    \cato it is hoped that, by affording stadium authorities an opportunity to co-operate
      full, by eg preparing plans, checking crush barriers, etc, local authorities shoula,
      n:>rr.’nl course, not find it necessary to charge fees representing wore than 17

  Ag regards the scope of a general safety certificate, section 2 (5 ) of the Act
  dfc-s that different terras and conditions pay be included for diiferent activities,
  u^h, therefore, a etadiun ttay bo in regular1 use only as a football ground, in
    where it is also uced from time to tiro to stage other events it would be desir-
    end in twny cases obviate the need for special safety certificates, if the terms
   -nditSons appropriate to those events were.to be included in the general certxf-
   * It is suggested that any such events for which it is considered desirable to
  de might' conveniently be divided isto 2 classes?

  (9      thouo sufficiently einilar in character to the main purpose of the
          stadium for the noric&l ter;iis imu. conditions to be equally applicable,

   (2 )   Those* of a fundamentally different character, eg boxing matches, pop
          concerts, etc which nay .involve.all or part of the playing area being
          given ovor tc spectator accomodation and for which separate terns end
          condition;* will have to ba deviood. It ic not, of course, necessary to
          provide fcr these contingencies in cases whore no clear need is foreseen
          by the stadium authorities*

    Sucre aay also be eirouaatcnceo in which the tanas and conditions applicable to
   *or’r.;»l activity of the stadium >:ray be found to be inappropriate, eg when a special
       such as a -cuo tie or a "local Derby", is expected to attract sigaiJTicimtly more
    the usual attendance.      In the case especially of cup-replays these, special ovonss
  •rise with only a few days' notice, within which it would not be possible to _ .
   mtodate the whole of the statutory procedure appropriate to the grant of a special
 •tv certifi'-sPtfs. In order to ovcrcoma this difficulty, it would seeza desiraDle foi
  J o m authorities and stadiisa authorities tc seek to v/ork out in advance the
 - t < W c •?on- to the normal terms'and conditions which might bo appropriate to such
 ‘J o n s , e<? the admission of increased numbers to certain areas on the condition
    extra stswardo and police are employed, that notice is given to tne local
   ,rifcy, and so on, and to provide for their incorporation in the general safety
 -ificato.

     Oreo a general safety certificate lias been issued, subject to the determination of
    mental, 'the tevras and -conditions can be varied ouly by formal amendment of the
    ■ficate, which may be at the initiative either of the holder of the certificate or
     & local authority (see section M 2 ) of tho Act) and will presumably reflect
    -o k ia circumstances occurring since the grant of the original certificate. It
  '"thus bs to the mutual benefit of local authorities and clubs/stadiuci authorities
   a close liaison to be maintained after the in sue of the certificate and certainly
 .lo eny further works of c-v.foty measures are boing carried out. It is likoly to bo
  the sta'i.ii;5a ofte-rators* finonical interest to get the safety certificate araeneed ac
     as possible* alter ucrk J’-'° <02en ccruplctod, and they should accordin.c_y ensure tjat
e* local authority is Kept informed of progress, for .its part the local authority
  \ no doubt wish to co-operate by arranging matters so that, following completion
  tiift work, the certificate can be emendod without delay*.




                                          2
 O        After a certificate? has been granted, an application may be made for the transfer
 of tli-' certificate to another person. Similarly, while u local authority is consicorins
 an cr.p3 -:cation for a certificate and before tho certificate hao boon granted, it may bo
 aol'cd to substitute sone psreon other than the original applicant as the person to v/nou
 th® certificate' should ba granted. Shese are, however, likely to bo rare occurrences
 in tha cac* of general' mfet y certificates, whero an application will n o n m U y be ntuc.a
 on behalf of a club or a ctatliua organisation by an authorised official of tho c..db
 or representative of tho organisation. However, if it does happen, tho local authority
 will be rcauired in both canos to determine vhether tha substituted nominee is a
 Qualified parson. Thareaftcr, in tho firet cace, tha procedure laid down in «.ho
 regulations relating to giving notice of, and tha reasons for, the determination will
 a p p l y toother with arty necessary appeals procedure.   I n t h e second case, thexe is no
 reaeon why the local authority should not treat the application in all rcspects as a
 new application in th© terss of the original one and process it froa the point it had
 already reached.                                                            .
   10. In addition to the right of appeal by an applicant for a general safety certificate
   against the determination that he ia not a qualified person (eee paragraph^ above)
( 'ir lc h   of course, applies also in the case of a proposed transfer of a certificate, the
                              right of appeal to any -interested party" (which t«rm includes
          holder of tha safety certificate) against the inclusion 01 anythin in ox ti^
 ’■ni'-aion of any'-'in'" frosi a safety cortificat. or against a refusal to omond or l-Gplaco
                      c a t L t L r^ulationa provide that, in the case of a tfmorol safety
   certificate*, notice of any such appeal shall be giv.n within 23 days following reccipv
   of a notice of the local authority's decision, or, in the case of persons wno aro no,
   notified, the publication by the local authority of its decision in a newspaper
  circulating in the locality.

  11.    Tn this connection, Kegulation 7 requires a local authority, on isouing or amending
  a safety certificate or refusing to do so, to give notice to certain specxiioci
  ••in'-er4 tcd p-rtiee" and also to advertise their action in the press, Iv is regrettec.
  that it"has been necessary to incur the trouble and expense of advertising, but, s2.noj
  «VH-ion *5(5) of tho Act is not specific in the definition which it proviceo of
                              no other        could be found of ensuring that all persons wno r ^ h *

THE GUIDE TO SAH3TY AT SPORTS CROUNDS

ambmdmekts     TO h i e GUIDE
The Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds was published in 1973 and is based on the

^aclinical Appendix to Lord Wheatley* b Report of the Inquiry into Ground Safety

at Sports Grounds.           Since its publication, its use on a voluntary basis has

brought to notice the need for some amendments to be made to the guidelines

when applied to football grounds.


2.     During consideration of the Safety of Sports Grounds Bill, Ministers mentioned

that if the p r o v i s i o n s of the Act were applied to sports grounds other than

football grounds, separate guides would be compiled for the.different classes of

 sports grounds.          The existing Guide will accordingly be revised and re-printed

 as the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (Football). ' The amendments which will

 be made for this purpose are, in the meantime, attached as an appendix to this

 note.

' 3.   These amendments include a new chapter covering the recommendations of the

 Minister for Sport's Working Party on Crowd Behaviour which-was established m

 1974 to look.into means of combating hooliganism at football grounds.                         Matters

 of crowd control inevitably have a bearing on safety at sports grounds and it

' has accordingly been thought right to incorporate the Working Party’s

 recommendations for the general convenience of clubs and other stadium authorities,


  4 . The main amendments in the attached list are as follo.js.

       a.     E x i t s - f r o m each area of s p e c t a t o r ’accommodation should enable the

              spectators to. leave that area in 8 minutes or less.              .


       b.     Every spectator on the terrace should be within 12 metres Ox a

              gangway or exit.

         c.   Railings and fences dividing sections of the ground should be of

              the same strength as handiails.

         d.   Depending Qn the condition of the individual stand, the time

               specified for the evacuation may lie between the prescribed

              maximum ^**d minimum.
      e.    A ‘recommended distance from terrace to touchline is now given

            only for a terrace gradient of 30            or more.

      f.    The recommended flowrate from all sections of the ground has

            been increased to 60 persons per minute per unit of exit

            width except in the case of stands (where it remains at 4 0 ).

      g.    R e c o m m e n d e d strengths are given for handrails in various

            situations.


      h.     R e c o m m e n d a t i o n s of the Working Party o n Crowd Behaviour.



 5.    It is again emphasised that the recommendations made in the Guide to Safety

 at Sports Grounds are essentially‘guidelines and ^ l d i b e ^ p p l i e d ^ e x i s t i n g *

Irootbal 1 Aground is with the’ necessary^de^e^f-flexibility to\take account ,of ^ h e

Bgrtnmmftnfl.’itlnna of the Working Party on Crowd Behaviour

Crowd movement on terraces should be severely limited in
order to give the Police the fullest opportunity for crowd
control • Less problcias occur where the terraces are
divided as f^r as possible into sections by the use of-
railings or barriers, both radial and lateral* Ideally,
each section should be self-contained and should be
serviced by its own entrance/exits, refreshment facilities
and toilets, (see para. 7*7*)

"Home" and visiting supporters should be segregated. It
should not be possible for spectators to transfer from one
end of the ground to the other.

Access to playing pitches must be made as difficult as
possible in normal circumstances while,- at the same time,
providing "the Police with proper access to the terraces for
the purposes of crowd control j-nd enabling the pitch to be
used in the event of serious emergency * One alternative
to fencing is the construction around the pitch of a wall
with a smooth surface which should be not less than 4
in height on the terrace side. This boundary wall should
have gates or access points to the pitch which could be
manned by the Police or stewards. A walkway between the
boundary wall and the terraces, which would be solely
occupied by Police, First Aid and official club personnel,
has buon found to be effective as regards safety and
security. In order to achieve this, it wight be necessary
to remove one or two rows of terracing and to protect the
walkway from the terrace by a continuous line of barriers,
so designed as to discourage access to the walkway except
at authorised points. Tho access points from terrace to
walkway should be reasonably near the access points fron
walkway to the pitch, (see para 7*10). Y/herc a walkway
system is in use, sliding gates may be installed at the
access points from the walkway to the .pitch, ie where there
can be no crowd pressure against them, (see para 6 .14*2
regarding use of sliding gaies elsewhere). A barrier to
the pitch is unnecessary where seating extends to the level
of the playing area.

Clubs should carefully consider their arrangements for the
sale of alcohol. In any case all refreshments should be
served in plastic containers.

Home clubs should consider, in conjunction vrith the Police,
each of the matches and determine which should be all-ticket,
and the allocation of tickets to the visiting club. So far
as the terraces are concerned, any allocation should have
regard to the manner in which the terraces are divided so
that policing rrrangements can be effective.

The heme club should, as a general rule, make it their
policy not to issue tickets for announced all-ticket matches
to away supporters on the day of the game. However, the
local Police will be best able to assess the situation one
their advice should be followed, but it is important where-
cver possible to discourage 'supporters from travelling to
all-ticket matches without tickets.

HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR NO 7/1986

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975:             LOCAL GOVERNMENT ACT 1985

Introduction

1.  HOC 54/85 and 5/1986 were copied to Chief Executives of
Metropolitan District Councils and London Boroughs in view of the
forthcoming transfer to them of responsibility in the Metropolitan
counties and Greater London for the administration of the Safety of
Sports Grounds Act 1975 (SSGA).         The purpose of this circular is to
advise successor authorities of the changes to the SSGA brought
about by the Local Government Act 1985 (LGA) and to give guidance
on discharging these responsibilities.         It is not intended to affect
any internal or locally agreed arrangements which may be in train to
ensure that all those who have^an interest in securing safety at
sports grounds are fully c o n s u l t e d .

SSGA 1975

2.  The SSGA gave effect to the main recommendations contained in
the Report of the Inquiry into Crowd Safety at Sports Grounds which
was prepared by Lord Wheatley following the serious accident at
Ibrox Park Football Ground in 1971.

3.      The main provisions of the Act are:

        a.  A power, exercisable by the Secretary of State, to
        designate sports stadia with a capacity for more than
        10,000 spectators. Once designated, a stadium will require
        a safety certificate from the local authority.

        b.  An obligation on the local authority to issue such
        certificates.
         c.  A discretion for the local authority to set terms
         and conditions under the certificate with the object
         of securing a reasonable degree of safety for spectators.
         Safety certificates are of 2 kinds - firstly, the general
         safety certificate (the main form of control) and,
         secondly, the special safety certificate (for occasions
         or activities not covered by the general certificate).

         d.  A right of appeal to the Secretary of State, in
         relation to the issue of safety certificates and their
         contents, the procedure for which is set out in
         regulations made under s.6(1) of the Act.

         e.  Rights of various interested bodies (police, building
         authorities or, in the Metropolitan county areas after
         "abolition", fire authorities) to consultation, access to
         grounds and information and to the appeals procedure.

         f.  An emergency procedure for   restricting the admission
         of spectators to a wider range   of sports grounds than
         those to which the designation   provisions apply, if the
         risk to spectators is seen (by   the courts) as justifying
         this.

         g.  Powers of entry and inspection to sports grounds;
         and prescribed penalties for offences under the Act.

A sports ground is, broadly speaking, any place where sports or
other competitive activities take place in the open air and where
accommodation has been provided for spectators.  A sports stadium is
a sports ground where accommodation for spectators wholly o7
substantially surrounds the area used for the activities taking
place therein.

LGA   1985

4.  The combined effect of s . 1 6 and Schedule 8 paragraph 7 of the
LGA is to transfer to Metropolitan District Councils and London
Boroughs the functions, duties and powers as the local authority
responsible for ad ministering the SSGA in place of the Metropolitan
County Councils and Greater Londo-n Council.    A summary check list of
these responsibilities is contained at Annex A for ease of reference.

5.  Paragraph 7(3) of -Schedule 8 of the LGA redefines "local
authority" in England and Wales for the purposes of the SSGA as
meaning:

        a.  in Greater London, the London Borough Council or
        the Common Council of the City of London;

        b.  in England, in the Metropolitan counties,   the
        district council;

        c . in England outside Greater London and the
        Metropolitan counties, or in Wales, the county council

6 . In order to avoid any anomaly or duplication arising out of the
Metropolitan District Councils' and London Boroughs' responsibilities
„  "Building Authority", paragraph 7(2) of Schedule 8 of the LGA
redefines, for the purposes of the SSGA, "building authority" m
England and Wales as meaning:

        a.   in England,   outside Greater      London, and the
        Metropolitan   counties,   or   in   Wales,   the   district
        council.

mi _ pFfect of this, together with amendments to Sections 3(3), ]K 7 )
   j       5 (5 ) io(4) and 11 of the SSGA resulting from paragraph 7(1)
     Schedule 8 ’of the LGA, is that in Metropolitan counties and
Greater London, where the "building authority" and "local authority"
are synonymous, the local authority is not required to refer safety
certificate applications to the bu ild in g authority or consult it
about the terms and conditions of a certificate.     Similarly the
building authority in these areas does not have the status o
"interested party" and has no need of the right to authorise entry
and inspection of a sports ground because these powers are vested m
it as the local authority.

7    An additional change brought about by paragraph 7(1) affects the
role and status of the Fire Authority in Greater London and the
Metropolitan counties.   The converse of paragraph 6 applies in
respect of the Fire Authority which, from 1 April 1986, has the status
of ’’interested party" in Metropolitan counties and Greater London.
In the^e areas the local authority is required to refer safety
certificate applications to the Fire Authority and consult it about
the terms and conditions of a safety certificate; and the Fire
Authority will have the right to authorise entry and inspection oi__
a sports ground.   The reason for these changes is that the newly
constituted fire authorities will not (as in the past) be the same
as the local authority.

Transitional   Arrangements

8.     Under article 2 of the Local Government Reorganisation (Transitional
 Provisions) Order 1985 (SI 1985 No 1781), London Borough Councils and
 Met rop ol ita n District Councils will acquire certain anticipatory powers,
 including powers in respect of safety certificates for sports grounds.
 The provisions of SI 1985/1781 were explained in DOE circular LGA(L)
 (DOE) 1 3 / L G A (M C )(D O E )1 6 of 26 November 1985. The Secretary of State
 takes the view that Metropolitan County Councils and the GLC are not
empowered to issue new safety certificates or amend existing safety
certificates to take effect on or after 1 April 1986: SI 1985/1781
therefore allows successor authorities to consider, before 1 April,
applications for certificates to come into effect on or after 1 April.
Successor authorities will therefore wish to ensure that they are kept
informed of the progress of safety certificate applications or amend­
ments to existing certificates now under consideration by the Metro­
politan County Councils or GLC. Much of this information will au t o ­
matic all y have come to successor authorities in their present role as
bu il din g authorities but they may nonetheless wish to establish
early contact with the current 'certificating' authority to ensure a
smooth transfer of responsibility from 1 April 1986 without impairing
the safety cover afforded by the certification process. In this
context successor authorities will no doubt wish to bear in mind
that applications for special safety certificates for events on or
after 1 April 1986 may require advance consideration if a certificate
is to be issued in time. Similarly, successor authorities will doubtless
w ish to be acquainted with any other action or initiatives currently
in hand by the present certificating authority in respect of sports
grounds in their area.
    Guidance    to the SSGA procedures

    9.  A copy of the SSGA and the Regulations (Statutory Instrument
    1263 1976) are enclosed with this circular.     A detailed description
    of the Act and its provisions is contained at Annex B.    The Re g u ­
    lations set out the procedures and time limits associated with
    safety certi fi cat e applications and appeals.  These same regulations
    also empower local authorities to determine fees in respect of
    appli cat io ns for the issue or amendment of safety certificates. A
    guide to the procedure for the issue of a general safety certificate
    is at Annex C.     Similarly, the procedure for the issue of a special
    safety certifi ca te is at Annex D.

    10.  The fo llowing points are highlighted as being of particular
    potential interest to local authorities:

          a.    Procedure under s . 10.   Paragraph 21 of Annex B refers.
          A u tho rit ie s may wish to note that this procedure can be
          applied to all sports grounds wi thin the meaning of the Act,
          not just to stadia.       It is hoped that authorities will not
          feel inhibited from invoking the procedure, as necessary,
^        where they perceive       the risks to be such that urgent action
          is required to provide reasonable safety for spectators.

         b.     The Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (Football) (The
         Green Guide).           Attention is drawn to paragraphs 5 and 6 of
         Annex B and paragraph 3 of Annex C.            Authorities will no
         doubt bear in mind the contents of paragraph 4 of HOC 54/1985
         dea li ng with action on the Interim Report of the Inquiry
         contains additional recommendations on the content and
         st r u c t u r i n g of the Green Guide v/hich will be revised as soon
         as possible.           In the meantime the existing guide, a copy of
         which is enclosed, may be used until such time as the revised
         version is available.

    Inquiry    into   Crowd Safety and   Control at Sports Grounds

  11.   The Final Report of Mr Justice Popplewell's Committee of Inquiry
 into Crowd Safety and Control at Sports Grounds was published on
 J 6 January 1986 (Command 9710).   A separate Home Office circular,
^Pu mb er 5/1986, was sent to local authorities - including Metropolitan
 District Councils and London Borough Councils - on 20 January 1986,
 giving details of the Government's response to the safety r e c o m m e n d ­
 ations contained in the Report, and next steps.

    Other

    12.      A list of designated stadia for England and Wales is attached at
    Annex E.         Management of those stadia in Metropolitan counties and
    Greater London have been informed of the change in responsibility for
    ad m i n i st ra tio n of the SSGA and have been advised to copy applications
    for special safety certificates or amendments to existing general
    certificates to successor authorities (see Annex F).

    13. T h i s circular is copied to Chief Executives of County Councils,
     Secretaries of the successor authority coordinating committees, and
     to Chief Fire Officers for information.    Paragraph 10 is of
     particular relevance.

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

Background

Wheatley Report

1    The terms of the Inquiry extended to sports grounds generally but because the

immediate concern at the time related to soccer grounds, its Report concentrated

on crowd safety in such grounds, and included Rugby Union and Rugby League grounds.

Lord Wheatley had no doubt,    that the then existing controls over safety at
football grounds were inadequate.    He found that the voluntary system of certifi­

cation of grounds introduced by the Football Association some years previously laid

down no requirements as to the competence of persons who carried out the annual

inspections of grounds and there were no guidelines to assist those persons in

their assessment of safety standards.     Moreover, a review of the statutory provisions

relevant to the safety of spectators at football grounds convinced Lord Wheatley

that the law also fell short of providing proper and effective control over

football grounds as a whole.     The building regulations,   for example, provide for

the basic structural safety of new buildings within a football ground but they do
                                                                  not apply to existing

buildings,   except where alterations are to be carried out, nor do they apply to a

ground as a whole.    In any case, most football grounds were built before nationax

building regulations were introduced.


2.   Lord Wheatley concluded that only a specially devised statutory scheme could

ensure comprehensive controls at football grounds in the interests of safety and he

recommended a statutory licensing system.     He proposed that these controls should

be introduced by stages,   the larger or more important grounds,    broadly speaking,

being dealt with first.    Lord Wheatley also recommended that there should be a

right of appeal for the clubs concerned against any decision of the licensing

authority.   The Report showed Lord Wheatley's awareness of the need to reconcile

the paramount aim of ensuring the safety of spectators with what would be reasonable

and practicable for the clubs.


3.   Lord Wheatley also provided, as a technical appendix to his report, guidelines

to safety standards at football grounds designed to assist the local authorities

in their task of enforcement.
    "ultations on the Report

     When the Report was published, those bodies mainly concerned, including the
    al authority associations and the football authorities, were consulted about
    j Wheatley's proposals.    The football authorities made it clear that they were
    rehensive at the financial implications for the clubs, but there was general
    eement with the proposals themselves.    Detailed consultations were held on the
:delines contained in the technical appendix to the Report and these, duly
    nded, were finally published by the Home Departments in November 1973 as a
    cial booklet, "Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds".    It was revised in 1975
    the light of practical experience of its application and specifically targeted
    football grounds -


    de to Safety at Sports Grounds (Football)

      The Guide to   Safety at Sports Grounds has no statutory force.   Its primary
    pose is to set   out principles or guidelines which the local authorities will
    doubt wish to keep in mind in enforcing the Act.    The Guide therefore deals
    h matters such   as the provision of adequate entrances and exits, means of
    ape, the slope of terracing, the strength and siting of crush barriers, the
istruction of staircases, and measures to ensure the safe movement of spectators
    h under normal and emergency conditions.    The Guide is not a set of requirements
    be rigidly applied, regardless of individual circumstances.    As Lord Wheatley
    ognised, it is important to maintain the maximum flexibility in any system of
    trol so as to take account of the differing circumstances at individual grounds:
    tors such as age, size and mode of construction differ widely from ground to
    und.

#     While the basic principles set out in the Guide are relevant to all sports
    eia, modifications may well be necessary where sports other than football are
    olved.


    eral Approach to the Act

      The main instrument of control under the Act is the safety certificate issued by

     local authority.    A safety certificate is needed in respect of every stadium

    ~h is the subject of a designation order, made by the Secretary of State.       The

    tificate enables the local authority to impose such terms and conditions as

    necessary to ensure a reasonable standard of safety at the stadium in question.




                                      ii
8.    The approach to designation was based on a phased programme so that the more
important grounds regularly attracting the largest attendances were dealt with
first.     The international stadia at which soccer and Rugby Union were played plus
stadia used by soccer clubs in Division 1 of the Football League were designated
in 1976.     This was followed in 1979 by designation of stadia of clubs in
Division 2 of the League and thereafter on promotion of a club to Division 2.
Following the    fire    at Bradford City FC in May 1985 all the remaining stadia
liable to designation used by clubs in Divisions 3 and. 4 of the Football League,
and qualifying stadia of clubs in Division 1 and 2 of the Rugby League were
designated.


Substance of the Act

9.    The first 5 sections establish the main system of control underthe Act,       that
is to say, the safety certificate, issued by the local authority for      the   areain
which the stadium is situated, which is required for every sports stadium desig­
nated for that purpose by order of the Secretary of State.


10.   Section 1 empowers the Secretary of State by order to designate     any   sports
stadium having accommodation for more than 10,000 spectators as requiring a
safety certificate.     Safety certificates are of two kinds, general and special.
A general safety certificate is the main continuing form of control ar.d is issued
for an indefinite period in respect of a specified activity or activities
regularly taking place at the stadium.     A special safety certificate may be issued
at the discretion of the local authority for a special event or other circumstances
not covered by the general safety certificate.     Such an event might be an evangel­
istic rally which might call for special arrangements if, for example, seating were
provided for the congregation on the playing area.     A special safety certificate
can be issued only in respect of a sports stadium for which a general safety
certificate is already ir> force.


11.   The contents of safety certificates are dealt with in section 2 .   The local
authority is empowered to include in the certificate such terms and conditions as
are necessary to secure, at the stadium in question, a reasonable degree of safety.
Without prejudice to this general power, the section requires certificates to contain
terms and conditions relating to major matters such as entrances and exits, means of
escape in emergency, the number, strength and situation of crush barriers, and the
maximum number of spectators who may be admitted to the stadium or any part of it.
To remove any possibility of doubt, sub-section (3) makes it clear that a certificate
may include a condition relating to the keeping of records relating to attendance and
the maintenance of safety.
12.   An earlier Bill, introduced in 1973, limited the terms and conditions
imposed under a safety certificate to what was necessary to secure a reasonable
degree for'feembers of the public." There was some difficulty over this term
because it might have excluded, for example, members of supporters' clubs.        This
particular problem was by the definition of "spectator" in section 17, that is,
any person occupying accommodation provided for spectators.     On the other hand,
it seemed    right that all the peole present on the occasion of a match or other
activity for which a ground has a certificate should be taken into account for the
purpose of the safety certificate, for example, people using a squash court or
other facilities at the ground.     Accordingly, the general power of the local
authority under section 2(1) to include in a safety certificate such terms or
conditions as are necessary omits any reference to people and speaks only of
securing "reasonable safety at the stadium", (although the terms "safety", as
defined in section 17, does not include danger arising from participation in a
sp^t).      Certain provisions must, however, be specifically linked with spectators
(who are, after all, the people the Act is mainly designed to protect and who will
be greatly in the majority).     Thus section 2(2) requires the certificate to state
the maximum number of spectators who may be admitted.




13.   Section 3 sets out the broad procedure to be followed when"a~local authority
 sceives an application for a safety certificate.     It requires them to determine
whether an applicant is, in their opinion, a qualified person, ie a person likely
to be in a position to prevent contravention of the terms and conditions imposed
in the certificate.     If so, they are then under a duty to issue a general safety
certificate to him.     In this respect, the general safety certificate is different
fr^^the fire certificate issued under the Fire Precautions Act 1971:      the latter
..s issued only after necessary safety works have been completed, whilst the
 afety certificate under this Act can be issued almost from the outset, and is an
 nstrument of continuing control.     The issue of a special safety certificate,
 owever, is left to the discretion of the local authority, as already explained,
oecause only they can judge whether it is appropriate to issue it for the special
occasion in question.


14.   In Metropolitan Counties and Greater London (from 1 April 1986) the local
authority is required to send a copy of any application for a certificate to the
police and the Fire Authority, and must consult them about the terms and conditions
to be included in the certificate.      Elsewhere a copy must be sent to, and

consultation take place with,     the police and the Building Authority.      The need

for such consultation is self-evident:      there must be close co-ordination of the

interests of the different authorities directly concerned with different aspects

of safety at football grounds.                    '


15.   Section 4 provides for the amendment, replacement,        transfer, surrender and

cancellation of safety certificates.      It is of primary importance that a local

authority should have power to amend a safety certificate where it appears

appropriate for them to do so,     for example,   if they find in the course of a

routine inspection that a part of a ground has become so dangerous as to demand an

immediate restriction on its use or some other necessary safeguard.          Again,   they

must have power to relax a requirement where,         for example, certain improvements

have been carried out to make this possible.



16.   Section 5 provides for appeals by interested parties against decisions or

requirements of the local authority in connection with safety certificates.           Appeals

lie to the Secretary of State, who has power to set up a formal inquiry.



17.   Section 6(2) empowers the Secretary of State to make regulations relating to

the safety of spectators at sports grounds.       This is in the nature of a reserve

power which could be used,   for example,   to give backing to requirements of the

local authorities which in the light of experience had been shown to be essential.

This section also empowers the Secretary of State to make regulations for various

other purposes connected with the Act.      To date no regulations have been made

under this sub-section.



18.   Section 7 provides for some supplementary matters on determinations and

appeals. Sub-sections   (1) and   (2) provide for the deemed withdrawal of an applica­

tion for, or the surrender of, a safety certificate when a local authority

determines that a person is not, or has ceased to be, qualified to hold it.           The

section also provides for the suspension of a condition in a certificate pending

determination of an appeal against the inclusion of that condition, although a

court,   on the application of the local authority, may order that such a condition

remain in force pending the determination of the appeal.
29.          holder of a general safety certificate is required by section 8 to

notify the local authority of any proposed alteration or extension of a stadium.

The purpose of the clause is to guard against any alterations being made, without

the local a u t h o r i t y ’s knowledge,        which might affect the safety of spectators.



20.    S ec ti on 9 provides for the harmonisation of the Act with other legislation

which m a y affect sports stadia.


21.    Se c t i o n 10 is an important power which authorities should not feel inhibited

from us i n g where the danger to spectators are such that use of the ground, or part

of it,    should be prohibited or restricted.                 Should a magistrates' court, on the

applic at io n of a local authority,              consider that the risk to spectators at any

sports ground is so great that their admission should be prohibited or restricted

until remedial action has been taken,                   the court may make an order accordingly.

This power a pplies to any sports stadium or ground, whether or not it is designated

a l B ^ e q u i r i n g a safety c e rt if ic ate .   Where a general or special safety certificate

is in force,       local authorities may prefer to remedy an unsatisfactory situation

by a m e n d i n g the certificate,        in cases where there is sufficient time to do so.

In r e spe ct of sports grounds and the smaller stadia,                 consultations between the

local a u t hor it y and the club would usually be expected to secure, on a voluntary

basis,    a reasonable standard of safety; however, where management appears to be

u n w i l l i n g to undertake the necessary measures or is slow to act on advice,            this

ad ditional power can be used.


22.    S ec tion 11 confers rights of entry and inspection on persons appointed by the

local a u t h or it y and others involved in the task of ensuring crowd safety at sports

grounds.       Section 12 deals with offences and penalties.



23.    S ec tion 13 deals mainly with civil liability.                 Its purpose is to make clear

that while nothing in the Act itself confers a right of action in respect of a

contravention of regulations or of conditions in a safety certificate,                    the existing

rights of a spectator injured at a football stadium to bring an action for negli­

gence against the occupiers is entirely unaffected by anything in the Act.



24.    The Secretary of State is empowered by section 15 to extend to classes of

sports grounds other than sports stadia such provisions of the Act as are not

al r e a d y expressed to apply to them.              For example,   it enables the Secretary of

State by order to extend the safety certificate procedure to such places as
rac e - c o u r s e s .   Only a class of sports ground may be the subject of an extension

order under this clause:             an individual sports ground (other than a stadium)

cannot be designated until section 1 of the Act has been applied by an order

under section 15 to the class of sports ground to             which itbelongs. To date,

the powers under this section have not been used.


25.     Section 16 applies the Act, subject to necessary modifications, to the

Crown.       Section 17 deals with interpretation.


26.     Section 18 provides that orders and regulations, except commencement orders,

made under the Act are subject to the negative resolution procedure.               It also

imposes a duty on the Secretary of State,            before making any orders or regulations,

except commencement orders or orders relating to the Isles of Scilly,              to consult

with such persons as appear to him requisite.

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

PROCEDURE REGARDING APPLICATIONS FOR GENERAL SAFETY CERTIFICATES         ;


1.   The Safety of Sports Grounds Regulations 1976 provide that any application

for a safety certificate shall be made in the form contained in the Schedule to

the Regulations or a form to the like effect.        An application should be accompanied

by detailed information as to the structure., capacity, etc of the stadium, includ­

ing plans of the stadium, certificates relating to the testing of crush barriers

and evidence of the applicant's status.       It is, however, open to a local authority,

under section 3(4) of the Act, to require, by notice in writing, such further

information of this kind as it may consider necessary to enable it to determine

the terms and conditions to be included in the certificate.



2.   On" receipt of an application for a general safety certificate, the local

authority must first determine whether the applicant is a qualified person, ie a

person likely to be in a position to prevent contravention of the terms and con­

ditions to be imposed in the certificate.        If it considers him to be such a person

the authority is then under a duty to issue a general safety certificate to him.

In the case o f a general safety certificate, where considerations of time are not

paramount,   the regulations impose no specific time limit for such a determination.

In any e v e n t , it s^^tns prirn?. f^.cie unlikely thsit An application for a general

safety certificate would be made by an unqualified person.          There is, however, a

right of appeal against a determination by a local authority that an applicant is

not a qualified person (see paragraph 10).


3.   In Metropolitan counties and Greater London (from 1 April 1986) the local

authority is required, by section 3(3 X of .the Act, to send a copy of any appli­

cation for a safety certificate (general or special)        to the appropriate Chief

Officer of Police and the fire authority, and must consult them about the terras

and conditions to be included in the certificate.        Elsewhere in England and Wales

the local authority must send a copy to and consult with the Chief Officer of

Police and the building authority.      In framing such conditions, local authorities

will no doubt wish to keep in mind the principles or guide lines set out in the

Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds.      In this connection local authorities are

reminded that,   this non-statutory document is not a set of requirements to be

rigidly applied regardless of individual circumstances.         The maximum flexibility

should be maintained to take account of the different circumstances of individual

grounds deriving from differences in such matters as age, size and mode of con­

struction.   In this regard,   it should also be noted that the Act provides that the
 terms and conditions should be such as "necessary or expedient to secure reason­

 able safety" and it would be unreasonable,           even if it were practicable,      to seek

 the absolute saf ety of everyone attending the sports stadium.



 i).     It is envisaged that there will be a good deal of consultation between the

 local authority and the stadium representatives in the process of drawing up the

 certificate conditions.          In this way, if evidence is advanced that a ground is

 rarely filled to capacity,         the local authority may consider it proper to base its

 requirements on actual levels of attendance over a given period rather than on

 m aximum capacity.        On the rare occasions on which a capacity crowd could be

 expected, separate provision might be made for this contingency on the lines

 indicated in paragraph 7 below.          Again,   if a stand were found to be structurally

 weak,     the local authority might,     in consultation with the stadium representatives,

 offer the choice of having any necessary remedial works carried out or of restrict­

ing    admission to the stand until it had been strengthened.
           t


 5-      As will be apparent from the foregoing paragraphs,        the form and content of a

 s afe t y certificate     is likely to vary according to the circumstances of the indivi­

 dual case.        Accordingly,   a standard form of certificate would not be appropriate.

 It must however contain full details of the terms and conditions imposed including,

 in particular,       the matters referred to in sect i o n 2(2) of_the Act and have annexed

 to it a plan of the stadium by reference to w h i c h the terms and conditions will be

framed.         The certificate when first issued may contain restrictive conditions which

can then be relaxed or deleted by amendment o f the certificate.            The local

authority may find it convenient to list,           in a covering letter to the certificate,

such modifications as will be subsequently permitted,            eg in the form of a state-

^ ^ n t of the increased spectator capacities        to b e allowed for the separate sections

of the ground when the various stages of any future .works programme

agreed with the stadium authorities are c o m p l e t e d .    This arrangement,   by

excluding from the certificate itself proposec conditions which would
apply only to future works, should serve to o b v i a t e confusion.       At the same time,

however,        care must be taken not to exclude frc-r the certificate any restriction

g ermane to current conditions,        since section 5'3)   of the Act provides for an

interested party to appeal to the Secretary of State against the inclusion of
any t h i n g   in, or the omission of anything fro~.     a safety certificate, and these

rights must not be prejudiced in any way in ccrtsequence of the form of the

certificate.
    m

        6.      As regards the scope of a general safety certificate, section 2(5) of the

        Act provides that different terms and conditions may be included for different

        activities.          Although,   therefore, a stadium may be in regular use only as a foot­

        ball ground,         in cases where it'is also used from time to time to stage other

        events it would be desirable, and in many cases obviate the need for special

        safety certificates, if the terms and conditions appropriate to those events were

        to be included in the general certificate^            It is suggested that any such events

        for which it is considered desirable to provide might conveniently be divided into

        2 c l a s s e s :-


                1.      those sufficiently similar in character to the main purpose of the

                stadium for the normal terms and conditions to be equally applicable;



^               2.      those of a fundamentally different character, eg boxing matches, pop

                concerts,     etc which may involve all or part of the playing area being given

                over to      spectator accommodation and for which separate terms and conditions

                will have to be devised.        It is not, of course, necessary to provide for

                these contingencies in cases where no clear need is foreseen by the stadium

                authorities.



        7.      There may also be circumstances in which the terms and conditions applicable

        to the normal activity of the stadium may be found to be inappropriate, eg when a

        special event, such as a cup tie or a "local Derby", is expected vo attract signi­

        ficantly more than the usual attendance.           In the case especially of cup re plays

        these special events may arise with only a few days' notice, within which it would

        not be possible to accommodate the whole of the statutory procedure appropriate to

        the' grant of a special safety certificate.          In order to overcome this difficulty,

        it would seem desirable for the local authorities and stadium authorities to seek

        to work out in advance the modifications to the normal terms and conditions which

        might be appropriate’ to such o c c a s i o n s , eg the admission of increased numbers to

        certain areas on the condition that extra stewards and police are employed,            that

        notice is given to the local authority, and so on, and to provide for their

        incorporation in the general safety certificate.



        8.     Once a general safety certificate has been issued, subject to the determina­

        tion of any appeal,        the terms and conditions can be varied only by formal amend­

        ment of the certificate, which may be at the initiative either of the holder of

        the certificate or of the local authority (see section 4(2) of the Act) and will

        presumably reflect changes in circumstances occurring since the grant of the



                                                 iii
 original certificate.        It will thus be to the mutual benefit of local authorities

 and clubs/stadium authorities for a close liaison to be maintained after the

 issue of the certificate and certainly while any further works of safety measures

 are being carried out.        It is likely to be in the stadium o p e r a t o r s ’ financial

 interest to get the safety certificate amended as soon as possible after work

 has been completed,    and they should accordingly ensure that the local authority

 is kept informed of progress.         For        its part the local authority will no doubt

 wish to co-operate by arranging matters so that, following completion of the

 work,    the certificate can be amended without delay.



 9.      After a certificate has been granted, an application may be made for the

 transfer of the certificate to another person.               Similarly, while a local

 authority is considering an application for a certificate and before the certifi­

 cate has beeji granted,      it may be asked to substitute some person other than the

^^riginal applicant as the person to whom the certificate should be granted.                These

 are, however,    likely to be rare occurrences in the case of general safety certifi­

 cates, where an application will normally be made on behalf of a club or a stadium

 organisation by an authorised official of the club or representative of the

 organisation.     However,   if it does happen,        the local authority will be required in

 both cases to determine whether the substituted nominee is a qualified person.

 Thereafter, in the first case, the procedure laid down in the regulations to

 giving notice of, and the reasons for, the determination will apply together with

 any necessary appeals procedure.         In the second case,      there is no reason why the

 local authority should not treat the application in all respects as a new applica­

 tion in the terms of the original one and process it from the point it had already

 reached.

•10.
          .
       In addition to the right of appeal by an applicant for a general safety

certificate against the determination that he is not a qualified person (see

paragraph 2 above), which, of course, applies also in the case of a proposed

transfer of a certificate,       the Act provides a further right of appeal to any

"interested p a r t y ” (which term includes the holder of the safety certificate)

against the inclusion of anything in or the omission of anything from a safety

certificate or against a refusal to amend or replace a safety certificate.                 The

regulations provide that, in the case of a general safety certificate, notice of

any such appeal shall be given within 28 days following receipt of a notice of

the local authority's decision, or, in the case of persons who are not notified,

the publication by the local authority of its decision in a newspaper circulating

in the locality.



                                             iv
11.   In this connection, Regulation 7 requires a local authority, on issuing or
amending a safety certificate or refusing to do so, to give notice to certain
specified "interested parties" and also to advertise their action in the press.

It is regretted that it has been necessary to incur the trouble and expense of

advertising,   but, since Section 5(5) of the Act is not specific in the definition

which it provides of "interested party", no other means could be found of ensuring

that all persons who might validly claim to be "interested parties" within the

meaning of the Act should be able to acquaint themselves with the local authority's

decision,   and failure to bring the decision to their notice could result in a

denial of their    rights of appeal or of a          hearing by the Secretary of State.   For

the same reason    a similar obligation has          been imposed on an appellant   (by

Regulation 8(7)) to advertise his intention to appeal, and a person wishing to

appear before a person    appointed by the Secretary of State under Section 5(4) of

the Act is required to    give notice within 28 days of such advertisement.



12.   Any appellant is required (by Regulation 8(5)) to give the local authority

notice of appeal, accompanied by the relevant documents appertaining to the

appeal.     It will then be for the local authority,    in accordance with Regulation

8(9), to inform the Secretary of State in writing within 28 days whether it

wishes to oppose the appeal.     With any such notice, the local authority is

required to submit its reasons and any relevant supporting documents and to state

whether it wishes a hearing under Section 5       of the Act.    (The procedure govern­

ing the conduct    of all such hearings is set out in Regulation 10.)



13.   It is also   open to the Secretary of State,    if he considers it necessary, to

order a public inquiry    under Section 5(6) of   the Act in relation to any appeal.

In such a case, the procedure to be followed      is laid down in Regulation 12.

14.   It would be helpful if local authorities could continue the existing

practice of copying to the Home Office newly issued or amended safety certificates.
                                                                           ANNEX D




SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

PROCEDURE REGARDING APPLICATIONS FOR SPECIAL SAFETY CERTIFICATES


1.   The regulations provide that any application for a safety certificate shall
be made in the form contained in the Schedule to the Regulations or a form to the
like effect.     Part II of the form and its frontispiece should be completed in the
case of applications for special safety certificates.     In any case where an
application for a special safety certificate is not made by the holder of the
general safety certificate, it should be accompanied by evidence of the appli­
cant's status.     Details of any planned changes to the normal standing and seating
arrangements for spectators should be provided, together with such further
information in support of the application as is considered necessary to enable
the local authority to discharge its functions under the Act.     However, it is
open to a local authority, under section 3(4) of the Act, to require, by notice
in writing, any further information of this kind which they may think it
necessary to have to enable them to determine the terms and conditions to be

included in the special safety certificate.


2.   A major difference in the grant of general and special safety certificates
is that, once the local authority has determined that an applicant is a quali­
fied person, the issue of a general safety certificate becomes mandatory,
whereas the issue of a special safety certificate remains at its discretion.
But an applicant has a right of appeal to the Secretary of State against a

refusal (see following paragraphs for details).


3.   An application for a special safety certificate should normally be made at
least 3 months before the date of the proposed event, but a local authority has
discretion to permit an application within a lesser period if it is satisfied

that the procedures (including appeals procedures) required under the Act and
Regulations can, in the particular case, be carried out within that lesser period,

eg when the applicant is known to be a qualified person.     On receipt of an
application for' a special safety certificate, the local authority must first
determine whether the applicant is a qualified person, ie a person likely to be
in a position to prevent contravention of the terms and conditions to be imposed
in the certificate.     The local authority is required by regulation 5 to make
this determination within 14 days of receiving the application.     There is a
right of appeal against a determination by a local authority that an applicant
is not a qualified person (see paragraph 9), and, under regulation 5, the
applicant must be furnished with the reasons for such a determination.
  4.    It next requires to be considered whether the application should be refused

  on grounds other than that the applicant is not a qualified person.               This

  decision must,     in accordance with regulation 6, be made within 28 days of the

  receipt of the application,         not only in cases where the local authority has

  determined that the applicant is a qualified person but also in those where

  it has d e t ermined that he is not and an appeal has been lodged and remains to

  be considered.      There is also a right of appeal against a refusal on grounds

  other than a determination that the applicant is not a qualified person              (see

  paragraph 9).      In the event of such a refusal, therefore, the local authority is

  again required,     under regulation 6, to give the applicant the reasons for its

  decision.


  5.    When the first 2 stages have been completed, should it have been decided

^ ^ h a t a special safety certificate should be issued, the local authority in

  metrop olitan counties and Greater London (from 1 April 1986) is required,                by

  section 3(3) of the Act, to send a copy of the application to the Chief Officer

  of Police and to the fire authority and to consult them about the terms and

  conditions to be included in the certificate.             Elsewhere in England and Wales

  the local authority must send a copy to, and consult with, the Chief Officer of

  Police and the building authority.            The special safety certificate must,       in

  accordance with regulation 6(2),          then be issued not less than 28 days before

  the   proposed event is due to take place.


  6.    The form and content of a special safety certificate is likely to vary

  according to the circumstances of each individual case and a standard form of

^ c e r t i f i c a t e would not be appropriate.   (In suitable cases, however,   regard may

 T>e had to the guide lines set out in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds

  (Football) on the basis indicated in paragraph 3 of the paper relating to the

  "Procedure Regarding Applications for General Safety Certificates".)              Any

  special safety certificate must, however,           contain full details of the terms

 and conditions imposed,        including in particular the matters referred to in

 section 2(2) of the Act, and as required by section 2(4) should be framed where

 appropriate by reference to the plan attached to the general safety cartificate.



 7.     Once a special safety certificate has been issued, s u b j e c t to the      de t e r ­

 mination of any appeal, the terms and conditions can be varied only               by formal

 amendment of the certificate.           This may be on the application of the holder of

 the certificate or at the discretion of the local authority             (see section 4(2)

 of the Act).      This seems an unlikely eventuality in the case of a special safety
certificate,           otherwise than in the exceptional case where the certificate has

been issued well in advance of the event to which it relates.                 Any such amend­

ment must, however, be publicised as in paragraph              10 below.


8.       Considerations of time render the transfer of a special safety certificate

to another person an equally unlikely contingency.              Any possible difficulties

in this connection are likely to be obviated, however, if the holder of the

general safety certificate applies for the special certificate.                  Nevertheless,

should an application for transfer be made,              the local authority must decide

within 14 days if the proposed transferee is a qualified person and, if it

decides to the contrary,           the procedure laid down in the regulations relating

to g i ving notice of, and the reasons for, the determination will apply, as will

the appropriate appeals procedure,           should the need arise.        In the case of an

application for transfer before a special safety certificate has actually been

issued,       there is no reason why the local authority should not treat the applica­

tion in all respects as a new application in the terms of the original and pro­

cess it from the point already reached.


9.       Reference has already been made to the rights of appeal against a deter­
mination that the applicant is not a qualified person (paragraph 3) and against
the refusal of an application on other grounds (paragraph 4).                  In addition the
Act provides (in section 5(3))a right of appeal to any "interested party
against the inclusion of anything in or the omission of anything from a safety
certificate or against a refusal to amend or replace a safety certificate.
The regulations provide that,           in the case of a special safety certificate, notice

of any such appeal shall be given within 7 days following receipt of a notice

of the local authority's decision,           or,   in the case of persons who are not

notified,         the publication by the local authority of the decision in a newspaper

circulating in the locality.


10.      As in the case of a general safety certificate, regulation 7 requires a

local authority, on issuing or amending a safety certificate or refusing so

to amend it, to give notice to certain specified "interested parties" and also

to advertise its action in the press.              A similar obligation falls on an appellant

(under regulation 8(7)) to advertise his intention to appeal, and a person wish­

ing to appear before a person appointed by the Secretary of State under section

5(4) of the Act is required to give notice within 7 days of such advertisement.

(The reasons underlying these requirements are set out in paragraph 11 of the

paper relating to tne           ’Procedure Regarding Applications for General Safety

C e r t i f i c a t e s '.)



                                                   iii
    ♦
    11.   Any appellant is required       (by regulation 8(5)) to give the local authority

    notice of a p p e a l ,   accompanied by the relevant documents appertaining to the

    appeal.    It will then be for the local authority, in accordance with regulation

    8(9), to inform the Secretary of State in writing within 7 days whether it             ■

    wishes to oppose the appeal.         With any such notice,   the local authority is

    required to submit its reasons and any relevant supporting documents and to

    state whether it wishes a hearing under section 5(4) of the Act.           (The pro­

    cedure governing the conduct of all such hearings is set out in regulation 10.)



    12.   It is also open to the Secretary of State,       if he considers it necessary,

    to order a public inquiry under section 5(6) of the Act in relation to any

    appeal.    In such a case,     the procedure to be followed is laid down in
    regulation 12.

    13-   It would be helpful if local authorities could continue the existing

    practice of copying to the Home Office any special safety certificates issued.

    Dear Sir

    SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975: LOCAL GOVERNMENT REORGANISATION

    1   The purpose of this letter is to inform you of the effects on the Safety of                     _
    Sports Grounds Act 1975 (SSGA) of Local Government reorganisation in the Metropolitan
    counties and Greater London brought about by the Local Government Act 1985.

    2   With effect from 1 April 1986 responsibility for administering the SSGA 1975 will,
    in the Metropolitan counties and Greater London, transfer to the appropriate
    Metropolitan District Council (MDC) or London Borough (the "successor authorities)
    They will be responsible for, among other things, the issue o f and amendments to safety
    certificates.      A consequential effect of Local Government reorganisation is that the
    current certificating authorities in the Metropolitan counties and Greater London are
    not in the m e a n t i m e empowered to issue or amend safety c e r t i f i c a t e s for any period
                                      t j n - n .inflc              f ''catss or amendments will rail to oe
                     s u c c e s s o r authorities!    « 5 s ' b e f o r e i n the interests of applicants
    in these areas to ensure that applications for special safety certificates or amendment;
    to existing certificates, which are to come into effect on or after 1 April 1986 a
    copied to the a p p r o p r i a ^ successor authority who should be kept informed of development:
    and progress so as to be in a position to assume responsibility for the case in question
    with the minimum of delay and inconvenience.

                                                                            Yours faithfully

 The abolition of *..h: .^atropolitan Coi;r.;;: r.nd Greater London Councils on
 31nt Harch, 1936, has necessitated some changes to the Safety of Sports
 C-^curidit Act 1975 (SOCA); theso have been    achieved by conns of the Local
 Government Act 1935 (LGA).

 from 1st April, l’ -jZC the role and statu3     of the Fire      o^ity in South
 Yorkshire under        5;SGA v/ill be changed, as the Fire Authority will no
 longer be the Local Authority.       It is therefore necessary to jive the Fire
 Authority the status of an "interested party", and thus require the Local
 Authorities (District     Councils) to .consul” on matters involving the   Act.
 The Fire Au thority vf.ll also be able to authorise entry and inspection of
 a sports ground in its own right.

 It will be inportant to establish and maintain good liaison batween Divisions
 and whichever debartnent 1 b iaade responsible for the Act in -each of tha
 Local Authorities (District Councils).

          Grounds Act matters from 1st April, 1986, together w i t h representatives

          The Panel is probably aware that the Stadium is Council owned but is currently

          leased to the O w l e r t o n Sports Stadium Limited.                 This Lease will expire on 1st


          November, 1987.

          Safety C e r t i f i c a t e   S ta n dard C o n d itio n s

          it the moment the Safety Conditions attached to Safety Certificates are

          sta n d a rd ised    throughout South Yorkshire and both the Police and the Fire Service

          have indicated that they would wish this situation to continue for reasons of

      ....administrative simplicity.                    The Conditions do, however, give some cause for

 ''"concern, as they appear to be inadequate or inappropriate in some areas.                              The

■grafting                of these Conditions is of particular importance as it is a serious

          criminal offence to contravene any of them punishable by the Statutory Maximum

          Fine (Currently £2,000) or 2 years imprisonment or both.


           It is proposed to re-draft the Certificate conditions, where appropriate, and to

           submit them to the Panel for a p p r o v a l .                The Sheffield Wednesday Certificate

      '    would then be replaced in accordance with Section 4 .(1) (h) of the Act.                       The

           Sheffield United Certificate                    could    then be issued with the new conditions before

           the start of the 1986/87'season.                        The re-drafted conditions would, of course, be

' - -submitted to the Fire Service, the Police and Building Surveyor for comment;

'p o t h e r authoritiesin South Yorkshire could also be involved' in this process.

            E x i s t i n g A d m i n i s t r a t i v e A rrangem ents

            Tne County Council system for administering the Act is based on 2 main

            components - (a) bi-annual inspections of the Stadium; and (b) meetings of an

            officer working party.                 The bi-annual inspections consist of representatives

            from all the interested authorities and involve thorough inspections of the

            Stadia and the identifying of any defects.                       These defects are at the time of the

          ' visit brought to the attention of the certificate holder and its technical

            representative if one is present.                        Depending on the nature of the faults found

             (if any) steps are then agreed between the Authority and the Certificate Holder
 3.
 to rectify them'or so arrange matters that no risk to the public occurs.                          The

 Working Party consists of representatives from the Police, Fire Service,

 Building Surveyors and the County Council - it considers in detail various

  matters (such as the Spion Kop development at Sheffield Wednesday Football

  Ground) and also any outstanding items from the bi-annual inspections.                       The

  Working Party is effectively a coordinating body which attempts to ensure that

  a balanced and consistent approach is maintained to current issues at the Sports

  Grounds.      Any recommendations it makes are subject to approval by this Panel.

 V The Health and Safety Executive

 * R e c o m m e n d a t i o n 9 o f t h e Jopplw.ll Committee's Interim R e p o r t read as follow

• i h e r e should be urgent consultation between the Health and Safety Executive and

  the Fire Authorities and Local Authorities as to how best to co-ordinate and

 • c o m m u n i c a t e their i n s p e c t i o n s and reports'.   Bearing this in mind the local

   office of the Health and Safety Executive was invited to participate in the

   administrative system for safety at sports grounds.                       This invitation was

   declined.       The Executive will apparently take no direct part in the

   Certification system.

   In view of this problem the Home Office was contacted and the position

 - explained; it appears that negotiations are under way between                        the Home Office

f e n d the ESE about Popplewell's recommendation but as yet there has been no

   useful outcome.
   In these circumstances, the Council could keep the Health and Safety Executive

   informed of all developments in Sheffield and to invite their                        comments onthem.

   It would then be the responsibility of the Executive to decide whether                          or not to


   respond.

   Fees
      The basis on which fees may be charged is set out in Regulation 14 of the Safety

      of Sports Grounds Regulations 1976 which states “14.                    A local authority may

      determine the fees to be charged in respect of applications for the issue or
4.
                e    certificates but such fees shall not in a particular case
ame ndment of safety <-=
exceed an amount commensurate with the work actually and reasonably done."                    The

South Yorkshire County Council did .not fix any fees under the Regulation

apparently as a matter of policy and the Panel is therefore asked to decide

which of the following options to adopt:- (a) state as a matter o f .policy that

no fees will be' charged in respect of Safety of Sports Crounds legislation or

                    •                                    t-n fix fees and to ask for a report back on the co
(b) decide in principle to tix rees

to the Council.

 Conclusion

 The Panel is asked to:-
           Kote the broad outlines of the administrative system organised by the

           County Council and authorise its continuation for the time being;

 (b)       Note the position of the Health and Safety Executive and request the Head

           of Administration and Legal Department to keep the Executive informed of

           all matters relating to sports ground safety;

     (c)   Request the Head of Administration and Legal Department to draft nev

           safety certificate conditions in consultation with the appropriate

           authorities approval by the Council;

     (d)   Either resolve that no fees will be charged under the legislation or

A           reqlles[ th« Head of A d m i n i s t r a t i o n and Legal Department to report on the

            Council’s costs in this respect.

       On ground inspections, D Bownes referred to the recent Lords decision that grounds
       should be inspected annually, he anticipated that this would mean a much more      _
       thorough examination than the present_system of bi-annual inspections, and tna. this
       would be backed up by inspections during games.
       Th«s was agreed by all present, but reservations about the suggestion that during
       aame inspections be carried out by the whole working party were expressea by the
       Fire Service. It was agreed however that one such ’during game’ inspection woula be
        set up and the outcome monitored.

    at the meeting on 10th Marc                                 y       iate. j feel that one major inspection

Perhaps "during performance" inspections could be arranged so that each
Authority carries out such inspections independently with a degree of central
c o - o r d i n a t i o n to prevent two inspections taking place simultaneously. As the
first step towards the development of a programme of inspections it mi^ht be
appropriate for me to arrange a joint inspection involving representatives from
all the authorities in order to provide an insight into problems which may be
encountered.

Moving on to the "working party" structure I think it is clear from the meeting
of 10th March that some clarification of its status is required.    It is
reasonably clear from the County Council's records that the working party as
such was actually a decision making body presumably acting under delegated
powers.    However, the normal City Council practice is that the principal powers
remain with a Committee or Sub—Committee (in this case the General Purposes
Panel) with routine matters being delegated to a Chief Officer (in this case
myself). I would therefore propose to ask the Panel to accept the working party
ji’s a forum for discussion.

f)take a view that the Lead Authority will be able to use the Working Party as
a useful forum for discussion prior to drawing up that Authorities formal view
to be s u b m i t t e d to the Certificating Authority. I propose that when an
Authority feels that a meeting would be appropriate contact should be made with
my Chief Licensing Officer, Mr. Bownes, who vill^ then make arrangements for the
meeting 'to take"’place. 'Ah -agenda will be "prepares and circulated prior to the_
meeting and at the conclusion of the meeting Mr. Bownes will prepare a list
showing the subjects discussed and the action to be taken by each Lead
Authority.        This list will be circulated as well.

Would you please consider the points I have raised and let me have your comments
on them in due course; it will be necessary for me to formulate a report to the
General Purposes Panel on the administration of the Certification system.

Yours faithfully,




Head of Department

                          and make the club more responsible.

Dear Sir,

< ?afetv o f S p o r t s G ro u n d s A c t         1975
SL„re A d m in istra tio n of th e                  C o u n c il's C e r t i f i c a t i n g      F u n c tio n

Following a meeting on Tuesday 10th March I have given some further thought to
the above subject*
                      „ . co,   the meeting but I think that the general feeling was
t h « S e nr o u T o f each Authority involved in the system should be defined
perhaps J o n g the lines adopted by the South Yorkshire County Council.

           V        -in nrincipal to roles being defined in this way but I should
I have no o je     _      i aares(j that particular Authorities adopt particular
make it clear that if_         °a dut to consuit with other interestedparties
roles then they will be u      intevestm ^ j see it the Authority which carries

Moving onto the ,uestionof - s e c t i o n s of stadia,
 at the meeting on 10th March.                          My                             j feel that one major inspection

 system at each stadium whilst it is in operation.
                                                                                                                  Cont•••

all1"the authorities       in order to provide an insight into problems which m y      be
encountered.

Moving on to the "working party" structure I think it is d e a r from the meeting
nf S h March that some clarification of its status is required.     It is
reasonably clear from the County Council’s records that the working party as
reasonaDiy cxea              making body presumably acting under delegated
T o te ™ £ « £    the normal C i t y ^ C o u n J l practice is that the principal fK.wers
   ain'with a Committee or Sub-Committee (in this case the General Purposes
remain with a Commxtte o              delegated to a Chief Officer (in this case
“        S   '   5 : 0uld therefore propose to ask the Panel to accept the working party
as a forum for discussion.

I take a view that the Lead Authority will be able to use the Working Party as
I u ^ f u l forum for discussion prior to drawing up that Authorities formal view
to be submitted to the Certificating Authority.      I propose that wnen an
to be suDmicc             meoMn?r would be appropriate contact should be made with .

meeting and at the conclusion of the meeting Mr. Bownes will PrePare a list
showing the subjects discussed and the action to be taken by each L
Authority.  This list will be circulated as well.

Mr. Bea/nes-opened the meeting and stated that the discussions would be divided
into four areas:-

1.   Definition of Rolls
2.   Inspections
3.   Status of Group
H.   Admin. Machinery of the Group


1.   It was agreed that rolls should be broadly defined and responsibilities
     taken on by the appropriate of the three "lead authorities” i.e. Police,
     Fire and Building Surveyors subject to agreement where overlap occurs.

     A1 contact with the grounds should be through the licensing authority.

     to be made with the Police, but not the Club. The Licensing Authority
     to be informed when an inspection has taken place.

3.   The meeting was informed that legally the group is essentially an advisory
     authority - only the council can be the ultimate decision making authority.

4.   Individual authorities to correspond to the sports grounds through the
     licensing authority who will subsequently circulate copies of all letters
     to each "lead" authority.

     Meetings of the group will be held at irregular intervals depending
     on need and can be called by any member of the group.       Individual
     authorities need not attend specific meetings if they have no "interest".

     Agendas will be issued prior to each meeting.

REPORT OF THE HEAD OF ADMINISTRATION AND LEGAL DEPARTMENT TO THE GENERAL
PURPOSES PANEL

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975 - THE CURRENT SITUATION AND PROPOSALS FOR THE
FUTURE ADMINISTRATION" OF THE COUNCIL'SCERTIFICATION FUNCTION

Introduction

The Panel will recall that on 1st April 1986 the City Council inherited from the
South Yorkshire County Council the role of certificating Authority under the
1975 Act.    The Act itself is basically aimed at ensuring adeauate standards of
safety at   designated stadia; there are three of these in Sheffield at the moment
- Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, Sheffield United Football Club, and the
Qwlerton Sports Stadium. A detailed report on the Act and its application in
Sheffield was submitted to the Panel on 6th May 1986.

The Current Situation

The Panel at its meeting in   M ay   1<?86 identified several main areas for further
investigation.

yix'stlv   was accepted at tne time that the broad outlines oi the
administrative system organised by the County Council should be concxnued to.
the time being.  This system has now been reviewed and the proposed
reorganisation is detailed later in this repor.-.

The Panel also asked that the Health and Safety Executive be kept inferred or­
al1 ma'-c^rs relating to snorts ground safety and that the Association or
Metropolitan Authorities also be asked about the KSI's involvement.    As far a?
keeping the KSE informed of safety developments at tns stadia tne Executive sis-ns
it fairlv plain that they would not make any comments. Tns pract^r^-"?
therefore discontinued.   The involvement of the AMA in the HSc.         f.as beer.
sonewhat forestalled by action at central Government level to review the T-S- s
relationship with local authorities; this review was announcsc ir. tne
Government's reply to the Popplewell Report but no results or tr.at_review nsvs
yet been received.   Fortunately, however, the Council's Director or hsalci: anc
Consumer Services has permitted his Officer's to provide p r o f e s s i o n ' £ M
safetv input into the decision making process ir. relation to ssrety c:    ^
sports grounds.   The problem is, therefore, at least temporarily rasclvec.

The Panel also mads reference to consultation on the sarery c: sports grcunc:?
policy with the other District Councils in Soui-r1 Yor:<sr.ire. I r.:o   .     .
attemots at arranging consultation meetings hav= besr. unsuccessful t~ cate.     it
is proposed to try again to organise sone consultations ir. ^the fairlv near
future, perhaps when the Certification system has settled do*.»Si ir. each ar=a.

The drafting of new safety certificate conditions in consultation      tP-e
Council's advisers has been progressing steadily.and new draft conditions are
currentlv under consideration by those advisers.  It is honed that the new
conditions will be submitted to the Panel at its meeting in October fcr r m a l
approval.

As to the question of charging fees under the 1975 legislation, it shoulc^he
be made clear that such fees are only payable on the grant or a Certiricate.
It is anticipated that if the Panel approves the new Certificate conditions a
Certificate will then bs issued to Sheffield United and at that time it is
proposed to deal with the question of fees.
Future A d a l M o r a t i o n of the Council's Certificating Function

Following a thorough review of the legislation it has become clear that_a
detailed administrative system needs to be established in conr.ccwion v*wii the
          rprtificating function. Discussions on this matter have been underway
for so-e time with the Police, the Fire Service, the Council's Building
Surveyor and the Director of Health and Consumer Services on the establishment
of such a system.

Accepting that the Council as the Certificating Authority will act on the basis
of advice from experts (such as the Fire Service) the Question arises as to how
that advice may be best formulated. In the past, the County Council organised
an Officer Working Party which was apparently used as a forum for discussion
between Officers prior to the final formulation of advice to the Council. That
particular working party also appeared to have some decision making powers.

As i t i s e s s e n t i a l that meetings take place due t o the potential overlap of
retirements in manv areas, all the Authorities and Officers have no w agreed
that it would be appropriate to establish a revised form of the working party to
perform a similar function for the City Council. It is recommended that the
"Safe'v of Sports Grounds Advisory Group (which would consist o,
representatives from the Police, the Fire Service, the Building Surveyor's
Division and the Department of Health and Consumer Services), would function as
a forum*for d i s c u s s i o n between Officers; its most regular use would probably be
the dis'cussion of itens o f advice to the Council before they are
fo— ui“ ed bv the appropriate Authority. Meetings or tne Group would beh s l c ^
the^reauect of one or -.ore Authorities and on receipt of s recuest the Head o:
Administration and Legal Department would arrange a meeting and despatches list
'e~Tt.e’-S~ to be discussed. At the conclusion of the meeting a further list o i:
it-’M would b* prepared and the details of action agreed to be taker, by each
Authority would be noted. It is then anticipated that detailed written acvics
to"the Council w o u l d be forthcoming and be acted upon as appropriate.

Tn add1''"ion the Head of Administration and Legal Department will keeo conies of
all relevant correspondence which will be available to all participants in tne
Group.
rrd-- the cld County Council administrative structure the dif reran: Authorities
rep'-ese-t<*d in their workins party had fairly clearly deiined rcles witr.m wrucr.
t0 o p, rati. Although it can be seen that there is some merit ir. this idea tne
areas~of potential overlap of responsibility are cuite extensivein w ^ i n s : wirr
spo-ts s’-ounds. However it appears that tne various Autnontie?      ar.c      =
wish for some definition of roles and the following have beer, agreed:-

                                                      Area of Fesponsibility
Authority
                                             All natters relating to the structure o;
The Building Surveyor
                                             stadia including crash barriers, walls,
                                             etc.

South Yorkshire County Fire Service          Fire precautions, fire alarms, means of
                                             escape, emergency lighting, stadium
                                             capacity.

                                             Stadium policing, evacuation procedures,
South Yorkshire Police
                                             access of emergency vehicles and
                                             emergency planning.
                                        -   3 -

It is anticipated that the Health and Consumer Services Department would have an
input on (a) aspects of general safety; (b) the general safety management of
stadia- (c) various special items -such as first aid requirements. It will be
appreciated that these areas of responsibility are not exhaustive but it is
anticipated that any areas of doubt will be dealt with by discussions at
advisory group meetings.

Inspections

Moving on to a matter of more general policy it has been suggested that one
large scale inspection per stadium should be carried out by the Group backed up
by I series of inspections which will take place actually during football
matches.  This proposal is in line with both the Popplewell Report and with
licensing practice in other areas.

Delegations

There is also a further question to be dealt with at this stage and that relates
to the dav to dav decision making required for the running of the Certification
SysteL     At the moment decision making power, rest with the Panel but this i a
hi-hlv impractical arrangement vhich needs to be reviewed urgently. 1- . M ~ s
that 'as an interim measure all routine matters could be delegated to cead o.
^ministration and Legal Department with other natters r e naming at the
U « « t i « o f the Panel. It is proposed that when the Certificate or C o i t i o n s
are in force then the delegation will be much more closely ce.ine-.     _ _
Unfortunately this is not possible at the moment with the current Cer.i-icate o.
Conditions.

Recommendations

The panel is recommended tc:-

(a)    Note the current situation;

(b)    Aoorove the revised administrative system detailed in this reoort^ inducing
       the"establishment of the "Safety of Sports Grounds Aevisory Group .

 (c)   Delegate to the Head of Administrator! and Legal Deoartmsnt _authori=y cc

        Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975




        I thank you for your lettar dated 22nd December, 1978, and the cooy
        letter of the Euiloing Surveyor of the Sheffield f'letropclitan
        District Council.

        It would seem essential that the officers of the County Council anc
/ -r
\       Metropolitan District Council involved in the production or the
        ceneral safety certificate raauirad by the Sheffield Wednesday
        Football Club under the above Act, undertake a comprehensive survey
        of the ground.  I fael sura that it would be beneficial to the Club
        •?f initially, sach department acted in unison in this respect
        rather than separately and I would make the necessary aTiar.gciii«nuo
        with my_officers for this to be achieved.   ______         v,

        I t c o p y of the report of each department'should-be’provided to sach
        involved department to enable problems to be discussed so that an
        accepted approach might be determined and consolidated into a sincia
        report which should be forwarded to the Club.

        This recart, together with that of Dr. Eastwood, would form ths
        basis of a further meeting with officials of the Club as differences
        cf opinion, if eny, would have been identified.

        It is my opinion that the necessary comprehensive survey^could not
        be undertaken satisfactorily without plan drawings.  In this raspect
        I rsfer to paragraph 1.3 of the ‘green code1:

       ” "The problem of croud safety at football grounds is complex and
         cannot be solved simply by ensuring that each component of a ground,
         such as stairs, passages or seciigns of terracing, id satisrac-cry
         in itself. The inter-relation cf components is essential:   they
         should be compatible and combine to form a balancad unit".

        Following the receipt of drawings I suggast that Officers msec to
        acres on identification procedures.  In order that each dscartment
        is able to identify parts of the ground in a uniform manner, I
        uculd prefer to have stands and terraces c l3 a r ly identified, exit
        routes, passages, gangways, gateways, doors, etc., numbered in a
        consecutive manner—and stairways lettered.

        Officers of the County Council and Metropolitan District Council
        have visited the ground and I believa th.it ^furthsr visits should
        be part of ths‘comprehensive survey.  Findings from visits other


                                                              Cant'd.
than the survey referred to will be limited and if we involve
ourselves in consultation with .the Club following the submission
of Dr. Eastwood1s report with limited information this could
prove unfortunate in the long term.

As previously mentioned I prefer to await the provision of the
plan drawings which have already been requested and if any
action can be taksn to expedite this matter it would be
appreciated.

but 8 m inutes could only be achieved by installing a new exit of 3 m etre overall width.

s t ill to be carried out, but w as not expected to be a major item .

P a r a . 6 - The Club accepted that the concrete required attention and that the scoreboard
stru ctu re should be looked a t. It * a s AGREED that the question of the h-aight of some

te stin g .                                                                       •

P a r a . 7 - The Club s tr e s s e d that their proposals for the im provem ent of the means of

 P a r a . 1 - D r. Eastwood, the Building Surveyors and the F ire Service had reached
 a g reem en t on a sch em e which could be recom m ended to the Club. This would
 involve the rem oval of 10 s e a ts from each of the 9 gangways and 4 se a ts from in
 front o f each of the 9 upper e x its . The r e su lt would mean a lo ss of 126 se a ts
 com pared to the 225 in the original proposals. The Club AGREED to give
 con sid eration to the p roposal.

 P a r a . 2 - The word at the end o f the fir st line should have been ’T ea’ and not ’T eam ’.

8    .    P o lice and F ir s t Aid F a c ilitie s

P a r a s . 1 & 2 - The P o lice s tr e s s e d that it was essen tial that there was no gap in
the provision of P olice F a c ilities when the temporary structure was replaced by
the perm anent structure. With this in mind, they were happy for the safety aspects
to receive first priority and to wait for the 19S0 close season for the w o r k to be
carried out. It was understood that Dr.           had not yet completed his investigations
Into the first-aid and medical facilities.


9*       A n y other Topics                                         -

Club were to complete their plans, both from a financial and practical point of view.

The Club w e r e to m a k e application for financial assistance under the Football
Association's G r o u n d I mpr ove ment Scheme, and had to have over 50, 000 crowd
capacity If the a i m of attracting international matches was to be achieved. The latest
proposals, if implemented, appeared to give a capacity of s o m e 50,750.                ^

So that they could be noted and returned for agreement, the Working Party asked for
2 copies of all plans (as revised) to be supplied by Dr. Eastwood, especially to the
Fire Service and the Building Surveyor.

M r . M c G e e requested that he be advised if it appeared that any undue delay was
occurring as the Club wished to ensure that the certification procedure proceeded without
delay.              .                                                         * .

2.       The use of a double pole switch connecting the em ergency lighting
         sy ste m to som e e ssen tia l lighting circu it e . g . bar lights is strongly
         recom m ended thereby ensuring that the em ergency lighting is always
         switched on.
F ire Warning- System

The suitability and type of sy ste m to be decided when further discu ssion s have
taken p la ce.

F ire E xtinguishers

F ire fighting hand appliances are to be in sta lled w here indicated by a triangle
on the attached plan. The colour of the triangle determ ines the type of
appliance required. (P lease s e e attached legend). It may be that equipment
is already provided in the building, and the plan shows the final complement
of appliances.

Two gallon w ater extinguishers to be wall mounted so that the handle is
approxim ately one m etre from floor le v e l. The 51b. dry powder extinguishers
and glass fibre blanket to be w all mounted, the extinguishers being mounted at
approxim ately light sw itch le v e l.

General F ire Precautions

         c la s s 'O 'su rface spread of flam e.

2.      Provide Isolating valves on the pipeline leading to the gas cookers at
         the point adjacent to the e sc a p e route from the counter area.

3   .   • Quantities of w aste paper w e re d isco v ered under the seating in the .
          stand. T his should be rem oved and placed in a satisfactory storage
          a r ea .

Training of Safety Stewards and Staff

To ensure that the Safety Stewards and Staff are conversant with the safety
precautions they w ill be expected to adm inister, a meeting should be arranged
with the F ir e S ervice, suitable to all p a r tie s.

N otices - E xit Signs
                             /
1.      T h ese signs to have suitable siz e d white lettering on a green background,

         The position of the exit signs are indicated on the plans by a green
         rectangle containing the le tte r 'E '.

2.      If the proposed rew iring of the em ergen cy lighting sy ste m is adopted
         as d isc u sse d by Mr. Clough and D ivision al Officer Jones then, with the
         reduced lighting output, it may be n e c e s s a r y to provide a number of
         illum inated exit boxes.
Emergency Procedure

Em ergency procedure notices should be placed at strategic points throughout
the ground.

A c c e ss for E m ergency V ehicles    .    -

1.       Adequate roads should be provided to ensure that speedy and direct
         a c c e s s can be obtained by em ergency veh icles to all exterior parts of
          the stadium .

2.       E nsure that parked veh icles w ill not obstruct emergency vehicles on
          th ese a c c e s s road s.

Public A ddress System

The existing public address sy stem to be upgraded, with the P olice having an
o v er-rid e fa c ility from th eir P o lice Room.

P o lice F a c ilitie s

A suitable perm anent P o lic e Room (with fa c ilitie s as shown on the sketch plan
marked AA ) to be provided in the 1980 c lo se sea so n .

 F ir s t Aid F a c ilitie s

 (i)      Structure

           The existin g fa c ilitie s are considered to be below an acceptable standard
           and it is suggested the Club con sid er providing a more permanent
           structure which is not lik ely to require up-grading for a very long tim e .
           The internal finish, particularly of the Treatm ent area, should be of an
           im pervious nature so that it can be e a sily cleaned and rendered fairly
           s te r ile and require no decoration. This can be achieved by the u se of
           tile s or form ica type finish e tc. 7 : .

 (ii)     Waiting A rea

           The W a it in g A rea could be arranged within corridor space to m in im ise
           the co st, where sitting c a se s could wait fo r attention on ch a irs.

 (iii)     T reatm ent A rea

            The Treatm ent A rea should be sufficient to accommodate two or three
            patients at any one tim e, and consideration should be given to the needs
            for privacy within the treatment area, bearing in mind that the three
            patients may w ell be lying on couches.
(iv)      Lighting

          Good lighting is esse n tia l and strip lighting would be sa tisfa c to ry .   The
          provision of a power point would a lso be a basic requirem ent.

(v)       Water

          A supply of hot and cold w ater is essen tial; the cold w ater suitable
          fo r drinking. A hand basin and a la rg e B elfast type sink should also
          be provided. The Club might con sid er whether it would be cheaper in
          the long run to provide sta in le s s s te e l basins which are not subject to
          chipping.

(vi)       T o ilet Requirements

           The Club should provide at le a s t one m ale and one fem ale toilet, for
           the use of the public, and should con sid er whether they should provide
         - an additional to ilet for the u se of the staff.

(vii)     Storage

          Storage fa c ilitie s are required for s ix stretch ers, and for two s e ts of
          w heels for str etc h e r s, blankets and other bed linen. T his storage should
          be lock ab le.                                           '

(viii)     Equipment

          The following is a minimum l i s t to provide a basic s e r v ic e :-

          Treatm ent couches with lift up ends, two or three in number depending
          on space available and /or number of cubicles, if the accom modation is
          cubicled.

          Six Stretchers.
          Two s e ts of stretch er w h e e ls .
           20 B lankets.
          Six P illo w s .
          One Minute-Man R esu scita to r.

(ix)     . Telephone F a c ilitie s

          A telephone facility would appear to be basic in 1979. This could be
          achieved by an extension from the main switch, or by sharing with
          p o lic e .




                                          6.
(x)    Car Parking

       The Club might also consider what facilities could be extended to the
       St. John’s personnel for the parking of staff cars. •

               f rom the mai n gate to the South Stand in which parking would not be allowea.
               It was also agreed that the hydrant outside the South Stand would have to be

                 P o l i c e ' F a c i l i t e s and R. First Aid Facilities

             . As agreed, a suitable permanent Police R o o m would be provided in the 1S3G
                 closed season.              .

                 The Club explained that it would be preferable from a building point of view
                 for boththe police and first aid facilities to be in the same overall building
                 although physically separated. The police representatives reserved their
                 position bn this point, pending the outcome of detailed discussions with the
                 Club.

                 The question of parking for both police and St. John's personnel purposes
                 would also need to be looked at in detail.


    S.           Ground Capacity

                 Provided the outstanding points were satisfactorily resolved, it was
                 that the crowd capacity would be as shown, i.e. a total of 5C*,174.

    Dear Sir,

    Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975

    Following approval by the Couniy Council and clarification of certain
    structural aspects of the South Stand construction, I am now able to forrnnll;/
    issue the attached General Safety Certificate in respect of the Hillsborough
    Stadium.
&
    As previously mentioned to you, the fee payable has yet to be determined by
    the County Council and I will, of course, contact you further on this point
    as scon as possible.

     I would particularly draw your attention to the following paragraphs of
     Schedule 2 of the Certificate:-

     8(1)        -     t±a existing First Aid facilities are accepted on an interim h
                       only pending the erection of purpose-built facilities in the i&BO
                       close season;

     12(1) - the arrangements for Emergency Lighting in the South Stand (as set-
              out in the letter from Messrs. Eastwood & Partners to the South
              Yorkshire County Fire Service dated 12th December, 1S79) are
              regarded as acceptable only for the duration of the existing
              battery life;

    : 14         - the existing Police facilities are accepted on an interim basis only
                    pending the erection of purpose-built facilities in the 1930 close
                    season;

     30          - use of -the Stadium in excessively high wind conditions
                                          and
                 - use of the Stadium in excessively high snowfall conditions.

     Perhaps you would also.treat this letter as the formal notice of issue requir -d
     by Paragraph 7 of the Safety of Sports Grounds Regulations 1976.

             Dear Mr. Mallett,

             SAFETY' OF SPORTS GROUNDS' ACT 1975-              ' * C :." ' "                   .■

             Further to your letter of the 31st March, my Chairman
             is away for another three or four weeks; so you -will
             appreciate that I cannot give you Board decisions or
             opinions. My personal reaction is surprise, as under
             the above act work has been going on continuously since
             it was started last summer and at no time do I feel
             that the Club have lagged behind in its actions to do
             everything that has been promised to be done.

             To take Item 4 of your letter ~ this is very much in
             the progress, and we axe in the hands of the contractors.

             As regards the training of safety stewards, this was being
             left until the warning system was installed. However, on
             receipt of your letter I did contact Mr. Vaughan and.
             suggested that if'he would like to contact the County .
             Fire Service j all mix stewards would be at the ground
             for oiir m3.tea on Easter Monday, and that might be an
             opportunity to deal with this particular item. The
             officers of the Fire Service had intimated to me     .
             previously that any time would 'be suitable to them.

             /ill your, oth^r items tmclerc )?ara<j:<:aplis V. & 3 v/±‘l.l be-:
             dealt with, and in fact a copy of your letter I have
             sent to Dr. Eastwood for his professional advice..

              the B u i l d i n g C ontrol d e p a r t m e n t for comment.          They
              i n s p e c t e d d u r i n g construction and after the wor k was
              completed.          I a m n o t amused b y the fact that the
              h e a d r o o m is n o w b e i n g queried.      In any case this is
              a m a t t e r for the fire officer, n o t the Building Control
              department.            W i t h r e g a r d to t h e sharp edges I suggest
... ♦         w e leave t h e m a t t e r until the inspection in June/July
               as t h e seas o n is n o w a l most over, and there is n o
              time to agree f u r t h e r w o r k and have it carried out before

        (v)   The p e r i m e t e r fencing at the n o r t h - e a s t corner of the
               Spion K o p has b e e n a p p r a i s e d f o r condition a n d s t r e n g t h .
              B e a r i n g in m i n d the likely p ressures at that location,
               the tests w h i c h w e carried out wh e r e possible, and that
              we are de a l i n g with. an e x i sting ground, the fence is
               s a t i s f a c t o r y in m y opinion.


   ^    (vi) W e will look at the step obstruction, but again unless
              this is something which is obviously dangerous (in
              which case I would have expected the matter to be raised
              last December) suggest that discussion be left until the
              June/July.inspection.


        (vii) The m e s h fencing u n d e r the N o r t h stand was discussed
              wit h Hr.              Iof the fire service and he, like me, was
              s a t i s f i e d that there is no h a z a r d which justifies the
              m a k i n g of changes.

 y o u do n o t say w h i c h exit signs have n o t been sited in

natters which apparently were still outstanding.

\ letter of reply dated 3rd April had b e e n received f rom the Club, as well as letters catea
:th and Sth April from the Club's Consultants, Messrs.. Eastwood and Partners, giving
.".’iils of the present position.

           Training of Safety Stewards

           The Club had felt there was little point in pursuing the training of the
           Stewards until the fire warning system had been completely installed, but with
           a-reement the County Fire Service had instructed some stewards yesterday. •
           A°schedule specifying the duties and responsibilities was handed to the Club s
           representatives,


ii)        Exit Signs

           The Club's representatives felt that the exit signs generally had been sited where
           required and were of adequate size and/or illuminated.'

           It was agreed that there were a number which could be more advantageously sited
           and/or illuminated, and s ome which might be more effective with larger.lettering

Messrs. Eastwood and Partners.

Emergency Lighting in. the South Stand

A s was evident complete re-wiring of the South Stand with -eparate circuits had _ ■ ■.
already commenced, and the County Fire Service undertook to let MSssrs. Eastwood
and Partners kno w their detailed requirements.


Fire Warning System

The Fire Warning System had been-installed, except for the trickle charger^and
battery equipment. These items had been subject to delivery problems, but the
system should be complete by the end of the month.

It was agreed that as'regards the F.A. Cup Semi-Final, the Police Communications
base^ which would be at the ground would also be used for Fire Service purposes if
 necessary.

           nf Fire Resisting F r a m e s

 TV,            of the fire resisting doo.r-ftames against .the supporting;walls had generally
 beeacaH-ied out,' but there « i « a small n u m b e r which were now .showing, signs of .         .

 been used.

 Wired Glass

 The Club pointed out that to the best of their knowledge wired glass had been used
^ h e r e v e r r e q u i r e d by the County Fire Service.

 The County Fire Service and the Police were generally satisfied that the small panes
 nf ri^ss in the upper‘half of the wooden partitions within the South Stand would no
 normal c i r c u m s t a n c e s be regarded as a fire and/or safety hazard. n e Club agreed in
 the lor-er term to consider the fitting of wired glass and, m the short term, to
 consider fitting wooden battons as an interim measure.

  Sharp Edges to Steelwork on South-West Stand

 Whilst there were a number of sharp corners on the supports, these were at a height
  of at least seven feet.      However, the Club undertook to round them off.


  Perim eter Fencing on the Spion Kop

  thp   Club nointed out'that this had been tested where feasible and the results forwarded
  *     t h e " t o - t i v e in January.      A copy had been passed to the Building Authority on

  30th January.                                     .   *
•Pns.sihle Step Obstruction cm Upper Exit Area on Spion Ko£

Whilst it was agreed that the erection of the barriers at the Upper Exit Area had left
        a c c e n t area of approximately one foot wide by four foot long a a lower level
t h - the remainder of-the exit, it was felt that its position coupled wita the crowd
flow at that point meant that it did not unduly create an hazard. However, Jie Club
undertook to give attention to it in the longer term.

M es h Fencing under N orth Stand   ^                   _

m view of the normal crowd flow rates on the public side of the m e s h fencing and the
L t ^at there l ^ o public access to its rear, it was felt that the timber framea
m e s h fencing under the North Stand providing security to storage areas was acceplajU

-Bearing in m i n d -th e V . A . * -Cup-Semi-Final w h i c h was to take place ot: Saturday,-
 11th April   1981, it was felt it w o u l d b e desirable for the Wor.-u.ng Party uO
 visit the ground,.especially as'a small number'of matters had arisen since the
 last visit on 10th February,             1981.

 2.     ** Inspection'of Ground

 (a)    ' South Stand                                                                                       ?

 The previous consents relating to the roof structure and the exterior windows in
 the L a d i e s ’ Toilets b e l o w the stand w e r e still applicable.

 The I P G    cylinders had been' removed from beneath the Stand, and tne batteries
 ^ y U g c h e e a e r g e n c y pow er s u p p ly f o r t h e p o l i c e a d d r e s s had b een e n c lo s e d «
 a satisfactory fire resisting metal case.                   Whilst the provision of an a u u o m ^ c
 battery charger would be a longer term solution, in the short term arrangements
 had been m ad e for the batteries' to be charged before each game and for the puo-ic
 address s y s t em to be'checked relying only'on the emergency battery supply. The
 indicator for the batteries condition was presently in the Public Address Bo.c.
 It was suggested that it would be less likely to be overlooked u the indicator .
 was sited°adjacent to the n ew metal case for the batteries.

 (b)        West 'Stand

 As previously agreed, the Club would round off the steel supports to the nev
 emergency exit (nearest to the South Stand) as soon as a grinder was next present
 at the ground.

 The cracked’brickwork a t ’the rear of ths stand which'required pointing, the
 apparent distress on the Concrete pillar supporting the steps at ^the. rear■ o the
 stand  the bracks in the concrete at the' top'bo both sets 'of stairs, as veil as
 the currently s l i g h t corrosion-in the ba s e plate of the outer steel
 (nearest to the South Stand) had all been' included m the maintenance progra— e
 and woul d be undertaken shortly.-
 (c)      North'West Terrace

The rr-ckin" of the concreting    had been attended toby injecting material from
the top.  The results had b e e n satisfactory, except in two small areas wnere
water seepage had obviously taken place and which would receive further

.(d)      North'Stand

The expansion cracks whic h had appeared in the wall of the North Stand R a r e s t        ■
to the'Spion Kop) had been included in the maintenance schedule and would be
 attended to shortly.

 (e)      Soion Kop

 The i n fillin°- of the step adjacent to the handrail on       the left of the original
 exit at"the'top of the Kop wo u ld be given attention in       the close season.

 Whilst the br i c k built chip shop at -the bo t t o m of the n e w exit from the Kop had
 been erected, it was not yet in use.' It was noted that the siting of the
 chip shop had resulted in a possible danger to spectators m            that a gap in^-o   ^
 whi c h spectators could be pushed,-or p o s s i b l y stumble because or the camber,haa
 been created.    As regards the F:A. Cup Semi-Final,


— IT WAS AGREED         -   •      -     ...

 that   a temporary barrier o f ■scaffolding tubes should be erected between the  end
    the n ew Kop exit outer barriers and theconcrete pillar      of the lowest of tne
 Koo original exit steps.   In the longer term, the existing barriers woule neec
 extend1’n^ to fill the gap and ideally, the area between the bottom or the new jCc ?
 exit staircase and the original Kop exit steps should be levellea o n .

                                EMERGENCY EVACUATION PROCEDOES



 The following notes of guidance are prepared and issued to assist all
 official stewards and others in a position of responsibility at the
 E i H s b o r o u g h Stadium on the action to be taken and-procedures to be followed
 ir the event of the possibility of evacuation of the stadium during the
 playing of a game when spectators are present. The notes are not intended to .
 be a conrorehensive list of all the action necessary, but are for personal
 issue to’ each steward and for retention b y the steward for immediate ref­
 erence all the time hs/she is on duty at the stadium.

   It is appreciated that the reasons evacuation may become necessary are many
   and varied, but the most obvious are fires o r •information that explosive/
      endiary devices have been placed somewhere within the stadium/ground.
        information may be received or discovered either by members of the s^aff
* "at the stadium, or b y telephone to the stadium- police, local or national
  newspapers.                                         _

  MANAGEMENT OF THE CLUB.  (The senior police officer on duty will be in a
  position to kdviae as to whether the ‘bomb call' is likely to be genuine or
  not).
                                                                                                      i
  Whenever such information becomes known, a message will be relayed to the
  police officer on duty in the "P. A. Commentary Box" at the ground, who, on
  instructions from the- senior police officer, and irrespective of whether
  the match is in progress or not, will cause the record 1TEHEE BLIND MICE to
     played over the loudspeaker sys «.em.

  The playing of that record will indicate, to everyone present at the ground, ;? *
  other than spectators, that a possible, emergency situation exists.

y-jS.        As'part of the regular pre-match brief-of referees and linesmen and
             both teams, this information should be passed to them so that the
             game officials are also aware of the possibility of an interruption m
             play and the significance of the playing of the record.

  On hearing that record all club stewards will make their way to their des­
  ignated duty points on gangways/gates/exits, etc. Those on exit^ga.es will
  ooen the gates and remain at that point. During this period senior
  officials will consider the nature of the emergency alleged and will decide
  to evacuate all/oart of the stadium.- Once that decision has been taken, but
  not until, the senior police officer on duty will cause a spoken message to
  be relayed over the :,P. A. System" which will have the effect of:-

             Stopping the game and removing players from the field of play;
   (1)
             Informing the s^cctators/officials of the precise nature of the
   (2)
             emergency and its location if known, and requesting all or specified
             sections of the public to leave their seats and make their way out of
             the ground by the nearest normal exit route unless specifically directed
              to do otherwise by means of the     A. System".         y

     IT IS STRESSED THAT NO EVACUATION WILL TAKE PLACE EXCEPT HT EXTRES1E
     EMERGENCY AND ALTHOUGH TEE PREPARATORY EARNING RECORD 'THREE BLIND MICE'
     MAY BE PLAYED, THERE IS EVERY POSSIBILITY TEAT INITIAL ENQUIRIES WILL
     ESTABLISH TEE PERPETRATION OF A HOAX, ETC., AND IN THAT CASE, HISTEAD OF
     A SPOKEN MESSAGE TO EVACUATE, TEE FACT THAT THE E2IERGENCY HAS PASSED
     WILL BE INDICATED BY THE PLAYING OF THE RECORD - 'TEDDY BEARS PICNIC*.
     ON HEARING THIS 'ALL CLEAR' STEWARDS ON EXIT GATES AND GANGWAYS WILL
     REMAIN ON ST A N D -5Y AT THAT POINT FOR FIVE MINUTES BEFORE CLOSING THE GATES
     AND RESUMING THEIR NORMAL DUTY POSITIONS.

     In the event of any steward/club official discovering a fira or receiving
     information that an emergency situation exists within the ground, he will
     irascdiataly -

      (i) Notify the Club Secretary by telephone;

     (ii)    Infora a ny police officer.

j‘
 ":-flfci)    Ea nust also, on discovering a fire, activate the fira alarm system
              by means of a 'Break Glass* call point.

      The activation of the call point will not immediately sound any form of

      then deploy manpower to investigate the cause.

     In the event of discovery of fire by a steward, he should take additional
     action in accordance with the following points;—

     (A)      Sound the a l a m by breaking the nearest break glass call point;

     (B)     Tackle the fire with the appropriate extinguisher if safe         to do so;

     (C)     Close doors within the immediate vicinity of the fire;

       )
   #         At no time mention the words 'Firs' or 'Bon*'.
             don't panic, neither will the crowd?_

  ______Purpose of Meeting

 The visit was the second in the- twice-yearly programme of visits by Officer
 H o r W n " Parties to all five League Football Clubs in South Yorkshire, as
 rceniioned at the r»eetins on 10th February, 1981 and o r i g m a U y

• visit*on 7ch April had been a special cue in-view, of •the- Stadius being ta*
  venue on 11th April for a F.A. Cup Semi-Final match.

 2.      Inspection of       Stadium

 The representatives        made a joint inspection of   the   Stadium.


 (a)     South Stand

 The progress of the monitoring of the apparent deflection in^the steel
 crusses°raferred to at the meeting on 10th February was queried but, m
 the absence of Dr. W. Eastwood, no specific answer could be given.

 It was noted that the monitoring device to-be sited adjacent to the new
 natal case for the batteries supplying the emergency power supply to. ti.e
 public address system (referred to at the meeting on 7th April) had ye. uo
 be provided.                 -

 (b)     West Stand

 Th» cracked brickwork at the rear of the stand, as well as the
 distress on the concrete pillars, supporting the steps at the rear of tne             _
 stand and the cracks in the concrete at the top of both sets o, stairs,
 had been made good.

 As previously agreed, as soon as a grinder was next present at the Stadium
 the Club would round off the steel supports to tne new emergency e.,it
  (nearest   to the South Stand).

 Following experiences at the F.A. Cup Semi-Final match, the Club were
 considering revised arrangements on the terracing m front of the Stand.
 An assurance was given that the Officer Working Party would be consulted
 when these had substance.


                                           -1-
^   (c)     North-West Terrace

    The two small areas where water seepage had continued to take place after
    treatment had n ow b e en satisfactorily treated.

    Ic was also noted* that the tie bars through the upper level concrete
    area to the rear had b e en -protectively wrapped.

    (d)     North Stand

    The expansion cracks in the wall of the North Stand (nearest to the Spion
    Kop) had be e n made good.

    (a)     Spion Kop

    The infilling of the step adjacent to the handrail on the left of the
    original exit at the top of the Kop had not been done to date but would                 ^
    be attended to shortly.

    Tha temporary ba r rier o f 'scaffolding tubes erected between the end of th*e
    new Kop*exit outer barriers and the concrete pillar of the lowest or the
    Kop original exit steps (adjacent to the n e w brick built chip s h o p ) prior
    co ch e F A  Cud Semi-Final match remained.     However, the Club intended to
    extend the existing barriers to fill the gap on a permanent basis and to
    leva"" off the area between the botto m of the new Kop exit staircase and the
    original Kop exit steps prior to the commencement of the forthcoming season.




    It was n ot e d : -

    (H      that the steel girders with mesh'on top adjoining the wall at tha
    rear Q f the B u t c h e r ’s Shop on Penistone Road required attention b e c a u s e ^ ;
    corrosion, and (ii) that the top of the brick built wall becweea the Spion
    Kop and the South Stand required pointing.

         ' Two oth-r matters w er e also riised by the Officer Working Party relating
           to the Police and First A id Facilities and the siting of certain of uue
          Lottery Ticket B o x e s . t

           (a)    P n l ir.e and First Aid F acilities

                  Tt was recalled that the /existing 'unsatisfactory police and first '
                  aid facilities under the!Nor£h 'Stand had been accepted on an interim
                  bisis on the'unders taiiding *that’ the Club would provide purpose b u n t
                  replacement facilities in the 1980 close season.

                   Tt is appreciated that discussions on the detailed requirements are^
                    M i  -nntimiins but it is f&lt that the Club should be asked to give
                   a firm indication w h e n the new. police and first'aid facilities are to .
                   be provided.

     Further to your communication dated 31st       December,   1981,   the   following
     observations are made for your attention.

     1.      The proposed erection of pairs of gates at the bottom of the 2
             staircases at the rear of the west stand is acceptable with the
             provision that they are maintained in the open position on match days.

     2.      It is confirmed that the radial fences are found to be satisfactory.

     Yours faithfully

 it will make it easier for a n yone who so wishes to climb
 over.            N e v e r t h e le s s we b e l i e v e it is n ot unreasonable to
 leave the cr u s h barriers as t h e y are.                                         If    all barriers

 would. mean             a 2 .4 m wide gap w h i c h is n o t protected b y barriers.

    refer to dang e r ou s pieces of rails p r o t r u d i n g from the

    the word         ’dangerous'      is a little exagg e r a t e d and they
    do not of course p r o trude into* a g a n g w a y as there is no
    gangway at this position.
   A              W i t h r e g a r d to the security gates around the North

    the gate v/idth is at all c r i t i c a l —          The remaining clear
    v/idth is 3.30 0 m m wh i c h is equivalent to a six unit exit.
    Thus the t h e o r e t i c a l numb e r of people who can get out in
    e i g h t mi n u t e s u s i n g the gre e n book figure of 60 people
    per minute per exit w i d t h is 5,760 s h ared between the two
    routes.           The stand c a p a c i t y is of course 10,000 and in
    practice        more     than h alf the number tend to use the lower
    exits since m ost spectators are r e l u c t a n t to walk uphill
    to the upper set of exit stairways.                   The picture is that
    fewer than 5,000 people will be t r y i n g to get out of
    exits which can accommodate 5,760 in eight itiinut.es.

 The purpose of the meeting was to discussvthe apparent difference of opinior
 on certain aspects of the radial barriers installed on the West Terrace
 and the security gates at the top of the North stand rasps, as wall as to
 carry out the usual w i n t e r inspection or the Stadium.

 2.     Ground Inspection


 A.     West Terrace

  Whilst the whole Terrace had yet to be used, the matches played since the
  s e c t i o n of the radial barriers indicated that generally they worked well and
■4Ptisfactorily effected tha segregation o f j s p p o s m g groups of fans.

 However  the police pointed out that in peaces the existing crush barriers
 had been extended up to and, in soee cases, completely through the new
 radial barriers, which had the effect of making it relatively easy for anyone
 who wished to do so to climb from one pen to another. Also, in the pen
 nearest to the South Stand, a small length of existing crush barrier had been
 left unsupported.

 IT WAS AGREED -

 (i)   That on balance, it was preferable from a safety point of view to
 prevent crowd surge by the existing barriers being extended up to and/or
 through the new radial barriers than to completely prevent persons being
 able to climb from one pen to another, subject to review at the end of tne
 current season.

 (ii)  That the unsupported small length of existing crush barrier would
 be cut off.

IT WAS AGREED         that this could be regarded as satisfactory.


C.    North Stand

The Fire Service felt that the manner in w h i c h the security gates had been
installed at the top of the ramps unduly restricted the exit width available.

The Club's C o n s u l t a n t s and the Fire Service disagreed on the interpretation
of o*ra»raph 16 of tha "Green Guide", and consequently cn the tigure to be
anolied°in the calculation for assessing w h e t h e r the exit width lost at the top
of* the rasps b y the m e t h o d of security gate installation was critical or not.

IT W\S AGREED   that, as    the point might w e l l have been ecvered in the
initial consideration of    the Club's application for a General Safety
Certificate,-the point wou l d  not be pursued at the moment.

      NOTE - A search of         the file subsequently revealed that,      as
             suspected, the point had b e e n considered at a
             m e e t i n g of the Officer W o r k i n g Par ty on 12.2.79,
             the relevant part of the Note of tha. meeting T r e a d i n g : -

        • •           "the"construction and wid t h of the rasps being
                       such that they could quite.properly be
                       regarded as elevate* roadways".


D.     Soion Kop

-It was noted that the infilling of the step     adjacent to the handrail on
 tha        of  the original exit at the top of tha Kop had taken place: that
 the boundary fence at the to? of the Kop had b een reinforced, and that tne
 e*'istir* barriers h a d been permanently extended ar.c tne area at the foot
 of the n e w Kop exit (adjacent to the brick built refreshment point)
levelled off as agreed.

fencing and sheeting above the boundary w all on the right hand side of

1.       Purpose of Meeting

% i e purpose of the m e e t i n g was to carry out the "winter" inspection of the
 Stadium in accordance with the p o l i c y of twice yearly visits to Football
League Grounds in South Y o r k shire­

A.       South Stand

The alterations and extensions to the understand area of the Stand (which
had been completed since the "summer" inspection) were shown to the Officer
Working Party.

 IT WAS AGREED -

 (i)   That any further areas of spalled concrete on the vertical columns at
 the rear of the Stand would continue to be monitored and receive attention
 by the Club as a matter of m a i n t e n a n c e -

®ii)   That the unsecured wire to the illuminated "Exit" sign in the Mat ch
 Day Sponsors Lounge would receive attention by the Club-

 (iii) That the remaining bridge between the Stand and the Club at the rear
 of the Stand (now used solely as a means of escape from the Kitchen area)
 should be infilled w i t h m e s h from a safety point of view to accord strictly
with the appropriate Regulations.

 (iv)  That the two emergency lights in the Club not operative at the time
 of the inspection would receive urgent attention by the Club.

 B.        West Stand and Terrace

 The Club recalled the practice followed in consultation with the South
 Yorkshire Police o£ separating home and visiting supporters at the rear
 of the Stand at certain matches (such as w i t h Liverpool) by erecting
 temporary barriers.  This worked well but on all other normal occasions it
 was the policy of the Police to aim for exclusive use by visiting supporters
 of the West Stand and Terrace.  On those occasions when the number of
 visiting supporters was small and the weather was inclement, it was
 obviously desirable to allow home supporters access to a sheltered area.
IT M S       AGREED -

(i)   That the Club would consider at some future date a scheme for
permanent barriers at the rear of the Stand, subject to any proposals
being submitted for prior approval by the Officer Working Party in the
usual way.

(ii)  That the cracked brickwork (adjacent to the concrete vertical cclr.mn
at the rear of the Stand adjacent to the North-West Terrace) should continue
to be monitored.

(iii) ihat the apparent rusting of the steel columns at the rear of the
Stand should receive appropriate treatment b y the Club.  ..       .

South Stand, and that the damaged corrugated me tal sheeting between the
Spion Kop and the South Stand had been replaced.             .

carried out by the Club in the near future (weather conditions permitting).

1.       Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to consider the letter dated 9th April
S   plan f r o m Messrs. Eastwood & Partners relating to the proposals of
the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club to construct two new banks <>£
turnstiles and various runs of fencing and new^gates m o r d e r to achieve
segregation of visiting supporters at the Leppings Lane end of the
Hillsborough Stadium.

The Police representatives pointed out that the proposals had been
orompted in the main by comments they had made to the Club. At one
time* both the West Stand and Terrace had been regarded as exclusively
for the use of visiting supporters, but recent patterns of attendances
at the Stadium made it necessary to allow for some element oi use y
 home supporters as well.

         Further to the joint meeting on 18 April 1985, to discuss the proposals for
         new crowd control arrangements, the means of escape implications have now
         been considered. The scheme would appear to be satisfactory providing that
         certain gates have the minisum widths (in metres) as indicated on the enclosed
         plan. It is understood that these gates will be supervised by either the police
         or club officials.

        tehould you require any further information, please do not hesitate to Contact
         this Department.                         "

    Dear Sirs,

    Safety of Snorts Grounds Act, 1975
    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic

       recuested b v vour letter dated 16th July, I have written a confirmatory
    letter to the Club regarding the steel sheeting and non-slip surface of
    the timber- deck to the South Stand upper seated area (copy attached for
^   your information).

    I understand that applications for building regulation/planning approval

      West Stand, Leppings Lane, and (ii) erection of roof and enclosure to the
    Spion Kop Terrace.

    The Officer Working Party considered and gave approval in principle to the
    rea~ of the West Stand re-organisation proposals in Kay but, other than
    brief mentions by the Club or yourselves at routine nestings of the
    possibility of the Spion Kop being enclosed, no outline plans or details
    of such proposals have been considered to date.

                 vious occasions, I am assuming that you will submit the necessary
                 olans soecifications and calculations for Safety of Sports Grounds

      1.     Purpose of Meeting

      The purpose of the meeting was to consider the letter dated
'^    and    111
               from Messrs. Eastwood & Partners relating to the proposals of
■ • • S e Sheffield Wednesday Football Club to construct two new banks of
      turnstiles and various runs of fencing and n e w gates m order to achieve
      segregation of visiting supporters at the Leppings Lane end of the
      Hillsborough Stadium.

  •   2 ,-   ’Consideration   of-   Proposals   ...... v          *-

      ThP  Police r e p r e s e n t a t i v e s pointed out that the proposals had been
              j • tu e m a in by comments they had made to the Club.              At one
       time’ both the West Stand and Terrace had been regarded as exclusively
       for the use of visiting supporters, but recent patterns of attendances
       at the Stadium made it necessary to allow for some element ot use ,
      home supporters as well.

       The proposals no» outlined b y the Club we re generally acceptable to the
      Police representatives, subject to.

              additional gates being provided between the turnstile numbered 16
       (a)
              and the wall of the inner access road;

              the central area of the Terrace (indicated as the neutral area or
       (b)
              visiting suoporters' terrace) being divided m half by a new
              c e n t r a l radial f e n c e 'running from the tunnel entrance to the
              pitchside security fence w i t h gates erected so as to permit entry
              to be diverted to either half as appropriate (the proposed new
              secondary radial fence adjacent to the existing f e n c e _ indicated
              on the plan to be a b a ndoned);

       (c)    the right hand area of the Terrace (indicated as home supporters*
               terrace) also to be divided in half by a new central ^radial fence
               running from back to front with two gates (the existing ra ia
               fence dividing the present two Terrace areas - neutral area and
               home supporters - to have a second gate installed,

              the existing pitch perimeter fence to have additional exit gates
              installed - one in the neutral area and one in the home supporters
               area

                                                       1.
                 *4 T P Service saw no objection in principle to the proposals,

                                                                                :s? .: -

   For the attention of Mr.                                  D. V a u g h a n


   Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                          Safety of Sports 'Ground 'Act '1975
                       Sheffield We d n e s d a y 'Football Club 'PLC
                    Thank yo u for you r letter of 2 May giving the comments
   of the Officer Working P a r t y on the proposals which we sent
   to you on 9 April.
                    In the interim p e r i o d several of the points wh i ch you
> - ^ ^ i s e d had already been i n c or p or a te d in our latest scheme
  w h i c h has yet to be c o n s id e re d by the Club Board.                                                     However I
   would '.ask that further c o n s i d e r a t i o n should be given to the
   request in p ar a g r a p h                    (c) of y o u r letter for a second gate to
  be installed in the radial b a r r i e r and for the new radial
  barrier w h i c h you have asked for to have two gates.-                                                             If these
   gates are m e a n t for use in emerg e nc y it would mean havin g                                                                  a
   steward in attendance on e ach occasion, the expense of which
  w o u ld hardly be .justified.                                      It is our view that in the event of
   emergency,spectators can be evacu a te d quickly enough by the
   gates on to the p i tc h and by the norm a l exit gates at the rear.
  We will of course be p r e p a r e d to discuss the matter w i t h the
  Fire Officer's staff should you so wish.

                                                                                            Yours sincerely,_________

1 ______Purpose of Mast i n g                                 *              ~   *

The purpose of che m e eting was to consider che detailed plans submitted by the
letter dated 25th July f ro m Messrs. Eastwood and Partners of arrangements
for the segregation of visiting spectators at the Leppings Lane End of the
Hillsborough Stadium of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.       It was
^ c a l l e d that consideration cf outline proposals had taken place by the
Officer Working Party on 18th April, 1985.       Whilst formal application had been
made for Building Regulation approval and some of the w o r k had actually
commenced, Messrs. E a s twood and Partners h a d apologised by 'phone that
submission of the detailed proposals for Safety of Sports Grounds Act
approval had apparently been overlooked due to pressure of w o r k and staff
holidays.       The plans also included details of repairs to certain crush
                                       ”   '•*                                       .•••   •- •••




2. '      Consideration of Proposals

The 14 detailed- plans .submitted were'each considered and discussed individually

I T WAS A G R E E D t h a t , subject to the 'following points 'and to the submission of
the necessary detailed calculations to the Building "'Authority, the proposals
for segregating visiting supporters at the Leppings Lane End of the
Hillsborough Stadium were generally acceptable:-

 (a)    Plan No. 6705/6 - for both security access and emergency egress purposes
 a pitch perimeter fence gate to be provided;

 (b)    Plan No. 6705 / 8A - the n e w handrail by Turnstile 23 to be either
 shortened or re-aligned'so as to maintain the exit width between the outer
 (river) w a ll and T u m s t i l e 23, and the exit width between Turnstile 16 and
 the new handrail not to b e less than the width of the roller shutter gate
betw e en Turnstiles      16 and 17;

 (c)    Plan No. 6 7 0 5 /9A - the single block thickness of the interal walls
       the cubicles) is not considered to be substantial enough, and a
 substantial stud partition (timber or steel - suitably faced) is felt to
 be required;

 (d)      Plan   No. 6705/10A - same comments as for plan     9A;

 (e)      Plan   No. 67 0 5 / 1 1 A - no objection in principle, but details of exact
 location required;

 (f)      Plan   No. 6705/12 - no objection in principle,      but no barrier height
 indicated;                                                         .    .

            Plan No. 6705/14A - so long as increased thickness is achieved by steep
       ijes as indicated on the plan and not by "stepped” arrangements to give
    T oothold, che proposals are s a t i s factory but the possible need to take
    measures on top of the v ai l to discourage persons from a t t e m p t s to eliob
    over'will have to be bo r ne in mind;

    <h)    Plan No. 6 70 5 /16A - in v ie w of experiences lasc year, the
    corner of the Spion Kop (by the crush barriers n u m b e r e d ^ , 8 and 22) to
    either h a ve a Pitch P e r imeter Fence Gate or radxal barrier(s) to overcome
    possible lateral crushing haz a r d w he n large crowds are present;

    (i)    Plan Nc. 6705/17 - for both-security access and emergency egress
    purposes, a Pitch Perimeter Pence Gate to be provided;

    - m     St°wardin« of N e w Gates - as mentioned* in-my letter of 2nd May,: 1985.
     it is essential that all the new gates are fully supervised b y Stewards,
    who must be fit, able and properly trained.

The purpose of "the m*«e*ns ’v s V W c s r r y out-the J'sumier’-'-rinspectri^ of the
Stadium w i t h particular reference to the Leppings Lane end improvements and
the met a l sheeting of the upper seated area of the South Stand.

2.    Ground I n s p e ct i o n.

A.    Leppings Lane End

The p r o g r e s s ’of the works to segregate' visiting supporters behind and on the
West Terrace and Stand were inspected w i th particular reference to the
points raised at the Officer Working P a r t y ’s meeting held on 29th July,
(forwarded to Messrs. Eastwood and Partners by the Chief Executive s letter
of 30th July) and Messrs.           Eastwood & Partners reply of 1st August.

Messrs. Eastwood & Partners had confirmed that all the^calculations^which
were likely to be required had now been sent to the Building Authority for
checking and comment.                ✓

On the inspection, the Building Authority pointed out what they considered
to be the poor standard of workmanship in the construction of the n e w
dividing wall which was being built behind the Stand. The position of the
Police Personnel access gate and the stepping of the face of the wall by
45° chamfers so as not to form footholds were acceptable.

The foundations of the n e w handrail by Turnstile 23 had actually been
aligned so as to m a i n t a i n the exit width between the outer (river) wall
and the Turnstile (unlike the indication on the plan submitted) .

As regards the single block thickness of the internal walls of the cubicles
in the new male and female toilet facilities at the rear of the stand,
Messrs. Eastwood and Partners considered that the inside of a toilet cubicle
was not a v e r y vulnerable area, and pointed out that the walls were braced
by both the outer walls and the door frames. • The Building Authority noted
the assurances given b y Dr. Eastwood, but expressed concern that the
      d i a l i n g walls in the n e w toilet facilities evidently did not have any .
      foundations, apparently having been built straight onto the existing
      concrete slabs.       It w a s noted that there were some 9 inch thick bri ck walls
      in the M a l e Toilets, it being considered that any hooliganism or vandalism
      would be m o r e likely to occur there than in the Female Toilets.

      The Club pointed out that *.he n e w toilet facilities would not be completely
      fi n ished b y the first m a t c h of the season (on 17th August) but that
      t e mporary facilities wo u l d be available and that no building m at e r ia l would
      be left on site.

      The p o si t i o n of the n e w refreshment area under the m os t westerly staircase
      up to the North-West corner terrace was noted.          This again had b e e n built
      straight onto the existing concrete slabs.

      O n the Terrace itself, it was noted that there was an existing gate in the
     In e w 2 m. wide gap formed b y the new radial fence for use by the Police.
      This g a te would still be available for the use of spectators in an
      e m ergency as the gates at the top of the Terrace under the control of the
      P o li c e would enable spectators to be directed d o w n the 2 m. vide^gap.
      However, it was agreed that steps or a longer gate would be required.        It
      was also agreed that a n e w gate would be required from the n e w South
              al Terrace Pen.

      As regards the up pe r seated stand area, Messrs. Eastwood and^Partners had
               fcv          *1*2   2-.vi         t»3*sns..                             ----
     . bo t h - th e Stand and-vat-the A c c e s s .lava.l----

~j    I T WAS AGREED:-

'I     (a)   that the condition of the internal walls in the new m a l e and female
•      toilet facilities at the rear of the Stand should be monitored;

       (b)   that the existing gate in the pitch perimeter fence should either be
       extended or have Steps to provide easier access from the new 2 m. v i c e gap
       formed by the n e w radial fence;

       (c)      that a n e w gate in the pitch perimeter fence should be provided from
       the n e w South Central Terrace Pen;

            )   that the     advertising hoardings       at the front of the upper seated stand
      i     ea should b e    securely fixed to the concrete wall;

      (e)       that the spalling of the concrete of the wall at the front of the
      u p p e r seated stand area should receive attention as a matter of maintenance;

       (f)   that the corrosion of the steel columns at the rear of the Stand
       should rece i ve attention on a main t e na n c e basis.

       B.       South Stand

      M e ssrs. Eastwood & Partners reported that the condition of the upper
      concrete outer p o rt i o n of the exterior wall of the Stand had been
      investigated and was considered to be satisfactory.

       I t was noted that the met a l sheeting of the w o o de n upper portion of the
       Stand had b e e n largely completed, and the spraying of the non-slip
       surface was to commence v e r y shortly    (and certainly be completed b y the
       start of the s e a s o n ) .
IT WAS AGREED that the metal sheeting of the wooden upper portion^of the
Stand should largely overcome the flammability problems innerent m such
timber structures, and the Club stated that they would e n s u r e_that the
woo d e n intermediate steps were securely replaced upon completion of the
 laying of the m e t a l sheeting.

 C.     Spion Kop

Messrs          E a etwood & Partners recalled that outline details of the Club s
proposal to cover the Spion Kop had been sent for the information of tne
Officer Working Par t y b y letter dated-22nd July.           As part of -that scheme,
the bridge portion of the Kop would be removed.              Its present condition
r e m a i n e d ” acceptable w i t h continuing maintenance.


 In v i ew of experiences last season, the Club were requested to provide an
 additional gate in the pitch perimeter fence in the front corner nearest
 to the South Stand to overcome the lateral crushing hazard which coula
 occur when large crowds were present.

  IT WAS AGHEED that the Club would provide a n e w gate in the pitch perimeter
I fence in the front corner nearest to the South Stand with a stepped
  arrangement to assist access and egress.

 D.     North Stand

                                               L « e a c e ^ y 3 ^ f r e ^ 5 . « i . <c r Z ' Z t e z c J -
' (iVfront of' the Lad'iein 'Changin| facilities in the Sports Hall) were
 inspected.

 IT WAS AGREED that so long as light combustibles (such as paint) were not
 stored in this area, its use continued to be acceptable cn a temporary
 basis.

          C losed   C ir c u it   .-.Television Facilities

 The advantages for general crowd control and security (both in and outside
 the Stadium) wh i c h would be given by the recently installed Closes. Circuit
 Television System were explained to the Officer W o r k m S Party.


^ IT WAS AGREED:-

  (a)     that a 2^ kg. C O 2 Fire Extinguisher should be installed in both the
  Police Control Box and'the" Disc Jockey Box;

  (b)     that loose external wires on the outside of the Boxes should be made
  secure.

  (opened on Monday) for the enlarged, roofed Spion Kop. -He still considered
 that any such proposals w o u l d involve the loss o f .up tovl,000..of the extra
 5 000 spectator places w h ic h . w o u l d be p ro vided by the enlarged Spion Kop.
 Other areas o f the S t a d i u m had'also b e en considered and investigated, but                                ^
 none could provide as large a flat, -easily accessible area-as that in front of
 the No r th Stand, w h i c h h ad b e e n successfully used.for so.long without any major _
 problems.               Up to 8 0 -disabled persons, plus attendants, used the area.. The only
 maj o r d r awback he s a v was'.that w h e n there'was a strong southerly wind, rain
 could be b l o w n onto the disabled, despite the cantilever roof of the Nor t h
 Stand extending v i r t u a ll y to the pitch.                               F<?r this reason, the Club w er e willing
 to roof an area f r o m approximately \'the letter "0" on the results board to the

(and the Police representatives in particular) .still 'expressed s o b p 'cor.-nrr. .
to wh e ther m a ki n g semi-permanent facilities, for the disabled in.front of the
North Stand was the appropriate and^correct thing to do.

The Building Au t h o r i t y confirmed'that, after'further investigations, it was
considered that the'disabled facilities requirements of the Building
Regulations 1985 did n o t appear to'strictly-apply to the roofing of the
enlarged Spion Kop. -                                . • . ' • ' .
IT W C AGREED chat, in the first instance, Dr. Eastwood would prepare sketch
plans'”of che suggesced roofed disabled facilities in front of the North Stand

C.         Ground Inspection
          "(I)   W e st Terrace and Stand

The Police representatives confirmed that the revised segregation arrangements
to the rear of the Stand worked well on by far the majority of occasions.

Dr. Eastwood p o i n te d out that the segregation rail in the upper seated area'/
of*the stand could b e mo ve d within-certain limits if the Police considered
that this w o u l d achieve a useful purpose.

IT WAS A G R E E D :-

(a)   that the additional advertisement hoardings, at the front of the upper
seated stand ar e a (nearest to the North-West Terrace) should also be securely
 fixed to concrete wall;                                                           *

|(b)   that further-areas-of spalled concrete at. the front of the upper
 seated stand area should r e c e i v e d -“attention as matters of maintenance.

           (iii) N o r t h Stand

 The area for the suggested covered disabled facilities was inspected.

As p r e v i o u s l y - m e ntioned by-Dr. Eastwood', the possibility of providing an
increased w i d t h access to the pitch area (between the Norrh Stand and the
Spion Kop) for possible use by emergency vehicles, as well as for maintenance
by the Club was discussed. -The facility could be incorporated into the
enlarged Spion Kop proposals relatively easily.

kit WAS AGRE E D that, whilst the County Fire Service felt that such a facility
*was not essential for their purposes, its-could be useful for use by emergency
 vehicles in certain situations and generally should be supported.     _

 HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR NO 75/1996

 SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS                              : REVISED EDITION OF THE GUIDE TO SAFETY AT
                                                         SPORTS GROUNDS

  Introduction

  1.   This circular introduces the revised edition of the Guiae to Safety a- S p o r t s ^
  Grounds” (the "Green Guide") a copy of which is enclosed for all recipients.

  2.    As stated in paragraph 9 of Home Office circular 5 / 1?36 the revised edition   ^
  0 f the G-een Guide has been drawn up primarily in the light of both the Interim anc
  Final Reports of the Popplevell Inquiry, although where practicable additions have
  been made to take account of comments from elsewhere.     The Guide remains^a vo-un^ary
  code ar.d is intended to   be applied flexibly to take account of the individual
  circumstances and needs    of particular g r o u n d s .

  Content and M a i n Changes of the Guide

  3    Although the format and structure of the new Guide have been changed in an
  attempt to facilitate reading, this r a i s e d edition continues to rely heavily on .he
  technical material of the previous Guide, the substantive advice of whicn was _
  acknowledged b v the P o ^ l e w e l l Inquiry to have stood up well to d e t a i l e ^ scrutiny.
  The new Guide is therefore         still orientated towards 'football-tvpe stacia ou.,
  unlike its predecessor,        it is made clear that it also applies to sports grounds usee
  for other sports.

  4.   The main changes in the new Guide are that greater emphasis .is^placed throughour
  the latest edition on management responsibility to which a^nev. chapter is              -
  (Chapter 2) and there is a further additional chapter on s a w a r d i n g (Chc-.^e     1. •

 Dear Sir.                               .              ...                                                                  ...

  S a f e t y ' o f Sports Grounds Act 1975 - Sheffield United Football C l u b ‘and
  Sheffield Wednesday Football Club_______________________________________ _

  I am writing to ask for your comments in writing as to the conditi-m of the
  above two stadia under the 1975 Act from the Fire Service point of view-

  What I would like from you is written confirmation that as far as the Fire
  Authority is concerned both-stadia meet your requirements under the 1975
  legislation.

  If it should be that there are outstanding matters which require attention
  please detail these in your response; I think it would be helpful to all parties
  if any defects outstanding were fully detailed so that action could be taken to
  remedy them.

  Please be advised that I am aware of the south stand roof problem at Sheffield
  Wednesday and as you know I am taking steps to ascertain the Club's position on
  that problem.

  I hope you will be able to let me have your reply to this letter in the near
  future.

  Yours faithfully,




  Head of Department

    The Secretary,
    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC,
   Hillsborough,
    SHEFFIELD.
    S6 1SW

   Dear Sir,

    Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 - Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

   In November 1986 I asked both the Police and Fire Service to comment on the
   condition of your stadium having regard to the provisions of the 1975 Act.  I
   have also asked the Building Surveyor to make similar comments but I have not
    received them as yet.

    The Police have indicated that they are quite satisfied with the stadium and
    have indicated that the degree of co-operation which they receive is very
    satisfactory.

    The Fire Service have, however, made a number of comments and I attach for your
    information a copy of their letter to me of 18th February.  I think the letter
    is largely self-explanatory but I would particularly like to refer to the
    comments which are made in respect of final exit gates.  As you can see from the
    litter the Fire Service are cencaraad about tb? sliding           h-pva- 4n4icp.red
    that as and when they reach the end of their useful life they must be replaced
    with outward opening doors.  The Fire Service have also produced a drawing (a
    copy of which I enclose) to show a better arrangement for securing the sliding
    gates against forced entry from the outside during the course of the game.     The
    Fire Service feel that this hook type arrangement will be more easily used in

    Dear Sir,

    Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 - Sheffield Wednesday F oot ball Club

  In November 1986 I asked both the Police and Fire Service to c o g e n t on the
  condition of your stadium having regard to the provisions of the 1975 Act.      I
1 have also asked the Building Surveyor to make similar comments but I have not
    received them as yet.

    The Police have indicated that they are quite satisfied with the stadium and
    have indicated that the degree of co-operation which they receive is ve y
    satisfactory.

     The Fire Service have, however, made a number of comments and I attach for your
     informational copy of their letter to me o£ 18th February.                I think the letter
    . is largely s e l f - S p l a n a t o r y but I would particularly Ilk. t    o    ^    rom t„ a

     comments, which “ e_made                          S S
                                            ti;r;;j of their useful life they must be replaced
     with outward opening doors.  The Fire Service have also Produced a drawing <
     coov of which I enclose) to show a better arrangement for securing the
     sates against forced entry from the outside during the course of the game.   T -
     Fire Service feel that this hook type arrangement will be more easily used
     the event of an emergency than the current locks, about which they are very
|    concerned.                                        _

  Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 - Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

  In November 1986 I asked both the Police and Fire Service to comment on the
  condition of your stadium having regard to the provisions of the 1975 Act. I
  have also asked the Building Surveyor to make similar comments but I have not
  received them as yet.

  The Police have indicated that as at 6th January, 1987 they are quite satisfied
  with the stadium and have indicated that the degree of co-operation which they
 ‘receive is very satisfactory.
}
i The Fire Service have, however, made a number of comments and I attach for your
V information a copy of their letter to me of 18th February. Some points in the
  letter have now been further clarified as follows:-

  (a) The timber buildings referred to should (if still required) be re-sited away
  from the walkways.

  (b) As far as the locked doors in the south stand are concerned they will be
  dealt with by the Fire Service under the Fire Certificate.

  (c) Gates must be unlocked and stewarded at all times, during matches: if this
  cannot be arranged, panic fastenings would probably be insisted upon.

  I think the rest of the letter is largely self-explanatory but I would
  particularly like to refer to the comments which are made in respect of final
  exit gates. As you can see from the letter the Fire Service are concerned about
  the sliding gates and have indicated that as and when they reach the end of
  their useful life they must be replaced with outward opening doors. The Fire
  Service have also produced a drawing (a copy of which I .enclose) to show a
  better arrangement for securing the sliding gates against forced entry from the
  outside during the course of the game. The Fire Service feel that this hook
  type arrangement will be more easily used in the event of an emergency than the

Dear Sirs,

In reply to your latter dated 1'ith Hey, 1937 regarding the "Future Administration
of the Council'£ Certificating Function” under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act
1975, please find below the observations of this Department.

1.       With res-ect tc the schedule detailing a proposed division of responsibilities
         between 'authorities it is felt that this should renain along the lines of
         the doeuncnt issued by the previous certificating authority i.e. South Yorkshire
         County Council, a copy of which is attached. As this document has stood the
         test of tine with few pro’
                                  olons, it is rcconn-ended that a meeting of all author­
         ities concerned bo called as seen as possible in crder tc ciscuss tne division
         of responsibilities it lays down.

         Whatever the* outcome one area where there- may be a need for onphasis is a
         reference to the fact that all authorities should be nore awars of other author­
         ities responsibilities and that when considering any proposals all aspects
)        of~ til* green guide should be. taken .J.n':o account in order that full consul­
         tation can take place with other interested authorities.

2.       The prooosal for one annual inspection by the working group m conjunction
         with ’individual inspections b.y authorities as and when considered necessary
         is agreed with although it is envisaged thst because of manpower resource
         limitations the degree of central co-ordination referred to nay cause problems.

         The Fire Authority would. wish to carry out such inspections subject to the
         limitations referred tc above and under varying conditions at the ground.
         Obviously any adverse comments on crowd safety would be forwarded to your
         Department.    As tc the annual inspection, a good time would be at the end
         or towards the end of a season in order that any necessary work can be followed
         up before- the corr.onconer.t of a new season.

    3.   Whilst the situation regarding the status of working group is fully appreciated,
         this authority feels that the recognition of the group as a decision making
         bodv by the City Council is imperative if it is to regain effective. As under
         the*County Council however, the terns of reference of the group \*ould be within
         the conditi6ns of certification laid down by the City Council, anything beyond
         these terns being referred back via your Department for a Connittee decision.

                                                                             Cont• •••

 Metropolitan District




 4.   The oroccdure outlined for calling additional meetings of the working group
      is agreed w i t h although it is considered essential that full mir.ute3 of all
      meetings are oroduced and. circulated and in particular should maka - direct
      reference to outstanding matters from previous meetings in order that these
      are not ’l e s t ’ in the minutes.


 In addition tc the a b o v e ' matters it would be appreciated‘if both Sheffield United
 and Sheffield Wednesday Football Clubs were contacted in order to discuss the
 outstanding features dealt with in correspondence between 'C' Division Headquarters
 and your Dep’ir’
                craent dated S^h December, 1936 in respect of Sheifield United and
 18th February, 19^7 in respect of Sheffield Wednesday.

 If there are any queries on the above m a t t e r s , please do not hesitate to contact
 the Officer concerned.

. Yours faithfully,

For the attention of D. 0. Grimshaw


Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975
Future Administration of the Council’s Certificating Function

Following a meeting on Tuesday 10th March I have given some further thought to
the above subject.
Many points were raised at the meeting but I think that the general feeling was
that the roles of each Authority involved m the system should be defined
perhaps along the lines adopted by the South Yorkshire County Council.

I have no objection in principal to roles being defined in this way but I should
make it clear that i f it is agreed that particular Authorities a d o p t particular
roles then they will be under a duty to consult with other interested part s
whlre t h e r e is an overlap of interest.^ As I see it the Authority which carries
out a particular role will have the responsibility of advising the Council as
C e r t i f i c a t i n g Authority on all matters falling within t h a t Lead Authority role.

I have drawn up a draft Schedule which attempts to define Lead Authority roles.
I should point out that the draft is intended to be open for discussion and I
would therefore welcome your comments on it. Would you please also let me know
if there are any other matters which should be included m the Schedule.

Moving onto the question of inspections of stadia, this point was also f u s s e d
at thS
     e meeting on 10th March. My view is that the existing system of bi annual
limited inspections is no longer appropriate; I feel that one major    «spectxoa
per year should be carried out on each   stadium which should include  allthe
Leas and installations within the scope of the legislation. _ To back up this
inspection there should be a number of "during performance inspections by
Officers. I think that there is general agreement m relation to d^ n°
performance" inspections as they would highlight the performance of    thesafety
system at each stadium whilst it is in operation.


                                                                                              734690 - Mr. Bownes
                                For telephone enquiries on this matter please ring.................................... (ST° Code 0742)
                                                          Telex 54243 (Administration & Legal)
Perhaps "during performance" inspections could be arranged so that each
Authority carries out such inspections independently with a degree of central
co-ordination to prevent two inspections taking place simultaneously. As the
first step towards the development of a programme of inspections it might be
appropriate for me to arrange a joint inspection involving representatives from
all the authorities in order to provide an insight into problems which may be
encountered.

Moving on to the "working party" structure I think it is clear from the meeting
0f 10th March that some clarification of its status is required. It is
reasonably clear from the County Council's records that the working party as
such was actually a decision making body presumably acting under delegated
powers. However, the normal City Council practice is that the principal powers
remain with a Committee or S u b - C o m m i t t e e (in this case the General Purposes
Panel) with routine matters being delegated to a Chief Officer (in this case
myself). I would therefore propose to ask the Panel to accept the working party
as a forum for discussion.

I take a view that the Lead Authority will be able to use the Working Party as
a useful forum for discussion prior to drawing up that Authorities formal view
to be submitted to the Certificating Authority. I propose that when an
Authority feels that a meeting would be appropriate contact should be made with
my Chief Licensing Officer, Mr. Bownes, who will then make arrangements for the
meeting to take place. An agenda will be prepared and circulated prior to the
meeting and at the conclusion of the meeting Mr. Bownes will prepare a list
showing the subjects discussed and the action to be taken by each Lead
Author!’ey. This list will be circulated as well.

Would you please consider the points I have raised and let me have your comments
on them in due course; it will be necessary for me to formulate a report to the
General Purposes Panel on the administration of the Certification system.

Yours faithfully,




Head of Department

    Dear Sir,

    Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 -
    Draft revised Safety Certificate Conditions

    I enclose for your attention a copy of the new draft Certificate conditions ^
    which I have prepared. Please bear in mind that these conditions are a firsu
    draft only and are in a basic form (i.e. they have not as yet been tailored to
    the needs of individual stadia). I also enclose a first draft of the
    interpretation section of the Certificate which will help when reading the new
     conditions.

     I would welcome your comments on the conditions, preferably in writing. If you
     feel that it would be helpful to discuss the conditions at a meeting then please
     contact Mr. Bownes on the telephone number given below who will make the
     appropriate arrangements.          ^

For the attention of Mr. D. M. Bov/nes


Dear Sirs,

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975 -
DRAFT REVISED SAFETY CERTIFICATE CONDITIONS

In reply to your letter dated 7th July re the above, please find below
the observations of this Department

Section $(a) An additional item agreed with Barnsley and Doncaster Councils
             in respect of their standard conditions is that the age
             range of stewards should be 18 - 6 5 .

Section 10(a) Whilst specified in the green guide, it is difficult to
              imagine how this task can be controlled by stewards. This
              matter should be considered further.

Section 10(i) Reference should beonade to the opening and securing open
              of exits on the intiation of any emergency procedure or
              at the end of a game and to assisting and directing spectators
              out of the exits.

Section 18    Add . . . "The emergency power supply should operate independ­
              ently of the      main power supply       and come intoautomatic
              operation on the failure of the latter and be capable of
              maintaining the necessary power output for a minimum period
              of three hours.

Section 23    Reference to "compressed gas or liquid" should be amended
              to . . . "flammable liquid or compressed gas (except fire
              extinguishing apparatus)".

Section 24    Add after "whatsoever"     "whether combustible or not".

Section 28    The old SYCC certificate required that the Police had knowledge^
               of the whereabouts of the doctor.

 Section 29    Again the old SYCC certificate required that members of
               the press, T.V. and radio were identifiable.
Section 35(d) This requires that the electrical installation be examined
              and a report submitted to the Council every 12 months.
              The same requirement should al30 apply to emergency lighting,
              and fire warning (including P.A.) systems.

Section 35(f) Sub paragraph (iii) requires emergency lighting to be tested
              at least 24 hours prior to an activity. It would be preferable
              that the original requirement of testing 3 hours before
              an activity be maintained.

Two additional items for consideration are:-

 (i)   That acompetent electrician employed     or retained by the Holder
       shall be present during a specified activity.

(ii) The Holder shall provide and maintain within the stadium to the
      satisfaction of the Council the access routes for emergency vehicles
      shown on the plans.

SCHEDULE - Interpretation

Whereas the old SYCC Certificate required certain matters (e.g. fire alarms,
extinguishers etc.) and the maintenance of these to be to the satisfaction
of the Chief Fire Officer, the proposed Certificate now requires these
to be to satisfaction of the City Council.

This Department does not foresee this causing any problems subject to
copies of the required annual certificates of test being forwarded to
us for examination.

If there are any queries on the above matters, please contact Divisional
Officer Grinshaw.

Also enclosed for your information is a list of sports grounds and indccr
snorts premises within Sheffield and known to this Department.

Yours faithfully,




 Chief Fire Officer £^,<3

    Dear Sir,

       Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds - 1986 Edition

       I refer to the revised Guide which was recently published by K-M. Government
       following the Poppelwell Report. I would like to draw your attention to t e new
       Guide and particularly to Chapter 2 entitled "Management ResponsiDility .

       This Chapter sets out in detail the sort of matters which ground management _
       should be responsible for and I regard it as essential that the management or
       designated stadia should be entirely familiar with it and follow its guidance.

       Would you please, therefore, confirm in writing:-

       (a) that you have obtained and iittend to retain on the premises a c o p y of the
            Guide;

       (b) that your Company and its Officers are familiar with the Guide and intend
           to perfonfl the management duties outlined in Chapter 2 oi the Guiae; the
           Company should also take immediate steps to appoint a Safety Ofricer as
           defined in Chapter 2 and confirmation of that appointment should be sent to
           the Council as soon as possible.

       Yours faithfully,

    1.1     The timber ticket hut adjacent to the refreshment bar on the main

            of the new steel supported barrier directly adjacent to it.                       B.S.

    1.3     A timber hut at ground level, under the BO? structure should be

     1.7' At scaa positions within the new development there is a
          difference in height between a terraced area and radial gangway
          of over 600mm. As such these areas require to be protected by a
          suitably constructed pedestrian guardrail.                                           HCS

     1.8     Some areas of the front terracing were found to be in need of
             minor repairs. It was agreed, however, that this defect would be
             adequately controlled by means of "ongoing” maintenance.                          HCS

     1.9     The defective rendering to the final exit gate wall requires to

     2.1     A broker, glass panel in the Vest gable end should be replaced.                   5.S.

     2.2     The step between seats 12 and 13 on row 43 is loose and should be
                                                                                               B.S.
             correctly bedded down.

      2.3    It is important to ensure that the groundman's s t o r e beneath this
             stand is* noc used for the scorage of potentially inflammable
             fertilisers or weedkillers.

      3.0     West Stand

      3.1     Signs over the front parapet wall at the upper level are to be
              permanently secured at the following positions.
                                                                                                B.S.
              a) between seats 1 and 14
              b) between seats 20 and 28
              c) between seats 136 and 150.
         Binding wire ties are not considered to be satisfactory for this
         purpose.

         Additionally the sign brackets adjacent to seats 62 and 72 are to
         be correctly bent, (or,otherwise suitably checked) and secured.

3.2      Rain water drainage holes through the upper level slab should
         have a gauze inserted so as to inhibit the dropping of missiles
                                                                                                      B.S.
         onto the crowd below.

3.3       It is felt that discussion should take place regarding the
          suitability of the gate fastening device at the base of the
          emergency exit stairway on the south end of this stand.  The
          fastening consisting of a patent lockable barrel bolt which
          cannot easily be unfastened in the direction of travel, and is
          impossible to be unfastened from the other side.                                            B.S


4.0        Miscellaneous Points

4.1       At a number of points within the stadium various pieces of
         'abandoned builders' waste were readily available for use as
          projectiles by the crowd. Such material should be collected and
                                                                                                      HCS

 Dear Sir,

 Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 —
 .Sheffield Wednesday: Foot Id? 11 Club r>lc.


 I enclose for your attention two copies of a letter which
 I have received from Messrs Eastwood & Partners dated the
 3rd February, 1988. I think the majority of the loiter is
 straight forward hut I am concerned about the last para­
 graph on sheet seven of the letter. In view of the appa­
 rent critisism of the Fire Service contained in that para­
 graph, you may think it appropriate to respond directly to
 Messrs Eastwood & Partners. Perhaps you would let me have
 a copy of your letter in due course.

 I look forward to hearing from you on the remainder of
  istvood’s letter in the fairly near future.
fr
 Yours faithfully,




 E e a d of Department

     d)     The intention of the mesh was not to prevent,

     as a cuard preventing spectators damaging and
     possibly loosening the rear sheeting.

           The welding is perf orm in g well and it seems
      that anv additional vertical support is

     West Stand

      a)   Do we u n d e r s t a n d correctly that the
      reference to    'timber framed and clad units'          is to
      the bar fittings at first floor level?              If so, then
      those fittings were part of the original construction
      for which B u i lding Regulations Approval has been
      granted.     T h e r e has not been any previous comment


      or other stands.       W e do not consider that the/
      present a hazard.

          (ii)           We see the principle behind the creation
      of fire compartments.         That is sensible.       Sealing
      off the windows is not difficult but the provision
      of ducting to the south wall'is,         and   furthermore
      very expensive.       A major exercise such as providing
      ducting would by necessity have to wait until the
      redeveloDment of the South stand in 1 9 9 1 .

           (iii)            W e agree that stored materials should be
      removed from stairways and exit routes..                  There is a
      particular problem o u t s i d e the kitchen area, at
      ground floor level,           b u t 'the caterers have been asked
      to clear that p a r t i c u l a r area well before the public
      are admitted on m a t c h days.
      b)       (i)       It was agreed in 19 79 that the fans
      ventilating the lounges at first floor level should
      be fitted w i t h i n tumescent grilles with smoke
      controlled shutters.             Th o s e grilles and shutters
      were fitted although w e see that two recently




     •'those lounges has a l r ea dy been agreed with the Fire
      Service, the Club are n o t prepared tc have ducting
      installed, although the n e w fans should perhaps be
      fitted with intumescent grilles and smoke controlled
      s h ut t e r s .
             (ii)            a   close inspection cf the gas supply p i p e ­
      work in the five bars revealed that four bars r.ave
      valves fitted tc the feed pipe or tc the appliance
      when there is only one appliance in the bar.                       Tr.s
      pipework in the bar n e a r e s t tc the Spier. So? has
      Ij o c -j replaced recently bu'c w i-hout a va_.ve.
                         However,   there is a master valve,        a:
      ground floor level,            w h i c h isolates the gas s u p p l y
       to the whole of the fi rs t floor.              That valve was
       installed at the r e q ues t cf the Fire Service in

       1930.
           (iii)            We confirm that all the timber facing onto

      but this does not reduce the effect of ^le
      intumescent paint underneath.
             (iv)          We cannot understand this comment because
      the paint -store was constructed in its present
      position on the advice of the Fire Officer.              A
      special        'non-sparking'   light fitting was even
      installed on his recommendation.           It is not contem­
      plated to mov e the store again after spending money
      to bui l d the store in its present position.
               (v)    We do not consider that the two laminate
      covered toilet kiosks present a hazard.             As for the
      wooden cuDboards,        they have been on the rirst iloor

              (vi)     We' agree th'at the holes round the cables
       should be plugged with an appropriate fxre resisting
      material.
             (vii)     As far as we are aware all doors leading
      onto the first floor and ground floor circulation
       areas were crovided with 25mm rebates and the doers
       made up tc a nominal one hour standard.            Ths.'_
      was done in 1979-80.               _
            (viii)     We agree that the spaces above toilet
       accommodates       sho.ulc. net be used ior storage b'j_
       believe that the Club have now removed the stored
       materials.

       c)      We believe that clinfcing over the existing low
       wall does not present any difficulty in the event
       of an emergency.        Spectators will go over the wall
       whether there are gates or not.          We do not .consider
       that the installation of gates is necessary.

        Gates
                The comments about the gates are nousd.


         The Club have expressed to us their increasing c on ­
  cer n that with the introduction of each new member of the
  Fire Service to the Officer Working Party new o_
  different recommendations are put forward by that officer,
  wh i c h in some cases openly contradict the recommendations
  offered b y his p r e d e c e s s o r s .   Whereas we agree that   manv
.^^of the observations and recommendations are of a
  subjective nature the Club cannot be expected to continue
  spending money on matters which are purely a matter or
  personal opinion.           Some consistency in the comments


  appreciated.

 of M r ’D Bownss re your reply-to "oux letter dated.18 F e b r u a r y 1987.

 Your comments regarding the various items as listed are receiving our attention.
 However, your comments on sheet 7 stating that each, new member of the Fire Service
 to the to the Officer Working Party puts forward different recommendations have
 been throughly investigated and our observations are as follows.

 Station O f f i c e r ___________ |has attended meetings of the Officer Working Party since
 November 1985 and for two year prior to this Station Offir.ar JJ.lcock v»as tire •••
 responsible Officer.

  The only time when another Officer m a y have been involved was when Station Officer
 I          |was absent for 13 weeks at the Fire Service College during late 1986.

  tation Officer I                       ]has also been involved in Liquor Licensing Act work as we
m s Fife Precaution Act work at the grounds
 It would appear therefore that the clubs remarks are a little exagerated, and every
 endevour is made b y this Authority for continuity of fire precaution standards.



 Yours Faithfully

        cleaning.

        fan that breeches the fire resisting wall. At the time of the inspection it
        could not be determined whether it is fitted with an automatic heater detector

     Dear Sir,

         Safety of Sports Grounds - Draft Revised Safety Certificate Conditions

         I refer to your letter of 13th August 1987 (your reference FP19/2/4-.RG/EB) in
         connection with Safety Certificate Conditions.

         I now enclose for your attention a copy of the final revised Safety Certificate
         Conditions which as far as possible Incorporate the comments made in your
         letter You will appreciate that the wording of certain of your comments has
         had to*be amended slightly but I hope that the objective has none the less been
         achieved.

         There are four points which require some further consideration:-

                (a)       You say in your letter that an age range should be specified in
                          connection with stewards. I think however that the wording of
                          Condition 11 should be satisfactory without stipulating an age range.
                          No final decision has yet been taken on this issue and you may like to
                          consider it further;
"I
                (b)       police knowledge of the whereabouts of a doctor - I believe this is
                          adequately covered In Condition 7;

                (c) Identifiability of press T.V. and radio personnel - I am not sure of
                     the justification for such a Condition and wonder If you have any
                     further comments on it;

                (d) the attendance of competent electrician - again I wonder what the
                     justification for this Condition would be.

         Would you please let me have your comments on the new Conditions m                       due course.

     A
         Yours faithfully,

INTRODUCTION
                                                                •<*
This note has "been prepared by the Sheffield City Council in^order to inform
Certificate Holders as to the general background of the Safety^ Certificate
Conditions. ‘The Council in dealing with Safety Certificates".takes advice from
the Chief Fire Officer, the Chief Constable, the Director of'.health and Consumer
Services and the- Council's Building Surveyor. These Officergs£and the Council
itself is concerned to see as far as possible that the spectators at any
                                                           *   *
specified activities are reasonably safe.

'GUIDANCE                   .

Where advice is given to the holder by any of the four Officers mentioned it
should be acted upon in accordance with the time constraints'given in t h e !
advice. The holder is reminded that failure to take steps to ensure the
reasonable safety of spectators could give rise to a prosecution.

 :he Chief Constable and his Officers have a particularly important role in
 relation to "public order" situations the correct handling of which should
 reduce any risk to spectator safety.

 The Chief Constable must therefore be provided with appropriate facilities at
 the stadium for control, crowd surveillance, detention and administrative
 purposes. These facilities are essential if public order is to be maintained
 and the risk to spectators minimised.

 The Chief Constable must also be informed at the earliest possible moment of the
 proposed'date and content of all specified activities so-that appropriate
 planning can take place.

 In addition there must he consultation and agreement between the holder and the
 Chief Constable well in advance of specified activities about the proposed
 methods of admission and the segregation of spectators. Consultation must also
 take place if advance information is such that public order difficulties may
 arise. As a result of this consultation it is possible that the Chief Constable
 may require, for reasons of preserving^public order, that the specified activity
 is "all ticket” or the specified activity should not be played at all at the
 Stadium or the day and the time of the specified activity should be changed.

 The Chief Constable should also be able to use whatever means are appropriate to
 exercise control over spectators for reasons of safety and as part of this
 control he and his Officers should be allowed full access to all areas of
 Stadium.

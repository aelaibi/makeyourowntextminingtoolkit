HISTORY

H il lsborough         has    been      the    setting        of   major       sporting

events        for     many    years        and    has     staged         Semi      Finals

during        that    time.        During        the    past    15     years      it has

been     the    venue        for    Semi      Finals     on     eight       occasions,

the events being as follows:



        1974         Burnley -v- Newcastle

        1975         Birmingham -v- Fulham

        1976          Derby -v- Manchester United

        1980          Arsenal -v- Liverpool

        1981         Tottenham -v- Wolverhampton Wanderers

        198 7        Leeds -v- Coventry

        1988         Liverpool -v- Nottingham                   Forest

        1989         Liverpool -v- Nottingham                   Forest



The     gaps    between        1976     and      1980,     and       1981    and    1987

were     as     a     result       of    the      location          of      the    Clubs

scheduled to play the Semi Finals.                             In particular the

clubs    were       not    based    in close           proximity       to Sheffield

and, consequently,                the   Semi      Finals        were      located     in

more    convenient' areas of               the    country.           So far as the

second    gap is concerned,                additional problems involved

complaints          from     local      residents         who      had    previously

suffered        the       brunt    of    the      effects       of       large     scale

football        matches,           which       clearly         disturbed           their

tranquility of life.
PLANNING - GENERAL

As     with    all      major        events      being       policed      in    the     South

to     the    Divisional            Commander          under whose         jurisdiction

the event takes place.                       The Assistant Chief Constable

 (Operations)                 has         an overall             responsibility             and

oversees       the planning of these events.                              So far as the

Semi Finals are concerned,                        these have all been staged

included in the Appendices.                                                                       Appendix

As   can     be      seen     above    the    1988    Semi' Final         staged    at

Hillsborough                involved         Liverpool        and        Nottingham
Forest.              Coincidentally,                    the        1989       scheduled            Semi

Final      in vol v e d        the        sames       clubs.         In v i e w        of    this    it

was      pos sib le            to     draw        on        the    ex per ien ces            of     the

previous        year       and to make particular refere nce to the

O pe rat i o n a l    Or der         prepared          for the          event      in       1988    and   Appendix 42

The     1988         In tel ligence               stated          that      when        Liverpool

played         at     Tottenham,                 the        Stadium         was        filled        to

capacity,           2000       Li verpool         fans were locked out and ran

riot      outs ide         the        ground,           stealing           from        shops        and

causing         publ ic              annoyance.                    To     this        end,         the

formu lat ion             of        Serials            included           officers            giving

special        attention             to     shopping areas,                to counter              such

eventualities.                  This       contingency was                 repeate d          in the

1989     Order.



The    planning           of        the    1988        Semi       Final     had       been        under

the d i r e c t i o n of the then Divisional Commander,                                           Chief   Statement 2

S up eri nte nde nt            Mole.           The     officer          had      also       been     in

command        of    the        Division          the        previous           year    when        the

1987    matc h       i n v olv ing Coventry and Leeds City was held

at    H i l lsb oro ugh         and       he    too had           arranged       the        planning

for    that     event.               The       continuity            of    command           was     of

benefit        in    pl an n i n g        both        the     events       in    question          and

in p a r tic ula r         the       Deputy       at        'F'   Division        in        1988 was

S u p eri nte nde nt       Marshall,              who       was    still        the    Deputy       in

'F'    Div ision          in    1989.           Both        officers        took       an     active

part      in        the        1988            Semi         Final,        in      that         Chief

S up eri nte nde nt            Mole       was     in        overall        command           of    the

o peration          and    Superintendent                    Marshall           was     a    Sector       Statement 4

 of    the operation. It                s h oul d be pointed out                       that      in    the

 last      3       years       the     o per ati on       has      been        divided           into       3

 sectors           under        the     command         of    a    Superintendent,                    that

 being         (i)       the    Ground        Sector,         (ii)       the       L eppings          Lane

 of the Stadium.



 In plann ing             terms        it    is   important             to liaise w i t h all

It    is       a    fact       that     on      9 August           1988,          S u p e r i nte nde nt

Murray,            'Fl'    Sub       Div isi ona l       Commander,               had      a meeting              Statement 7

with       the      Deputy        Chief      Ambulance             Officer,           Mr    Hopkins,

Assist ant           Chief           Ambulance           Officer             (Operations)              Mr

Jones,         cf    the       South        Yorkshire         Ambulance               Service         and

Assist ant           D iv i s i o n a l      Officer,             Mr    Rowlands,             of      the

South       Yorkshire                Fire    Service.              The       purpose          of      the

meeting            was    to     re-establish                further         liaison          in      the

event      of       a maj or          di sas ter     occurring               at     the    Sheffield

Wednesday            Football          Club       Ground.              The    report        of     this

m e e t i n g is i ncl ude d in the attached Appendices.                                                        Appendix   44
Because        of     the        manner            in which          Semi     Finals         are

determined,          there       is often little time to plan these

operations.                   The           usual        .time         period           being

a pp rox ima tel y      3 - 4          weeks.           In     view    of     this      it    is

essential that early action is taken to determine the

m an pow er     level        required              to police         the     Stadium         and

this is one of the first priorities in planning.



Follow ing       consultation               with     all       interested         parties,

the     examination           of       available          intelligence             and       the

drawing        together           of    experience              of    policing          other

similar        events       the       manpower          level for      policing              the

1988     Semi       Final     inside           and outside             the    ground was

de termined and set at 928 officers.



The event took place with little or no difficulty and

was    generally        described             as    a     successful          operation.

In     the    course        of     a    de-brief          certain           aspects      were

identified which may                   have a bearing on future events

and     these        were        noted.            The         de-brief       notes          are

included        in    the    Appendices.                  In    particular,          though

not recorded in' the de-brief,                          it was highlighted that

some    resources       were          under    employed in and around the

ground,       particularly             in     peripheral             areas.       Much       of

this    was    as a result of the general                            change in policy

for    policing        Semi           Finals       in     that       during          normal

matches         officers         are     used       for      more     than        one    role

and      are         moved       to    different          locations           during      the

various       phases    of       the match.               In    the        case    of    Semi

Finals it was decided all officers would be allocated

a    specific        task     and       would       remain           with     that       task
 throughout           the       operation,             the      intention             being      to

 ensure that the police had the control of all aspects

 both     inside         and     outside           the    ground          throughout            the

 operation          in     an    effort         to     thwart       those       individuals

 intent on causing disorder or attempting to enter the

 ground without               tickets.            This policy was found to be

 sound       in that       it prevented anticipated roaming gangs

 of    disappointed              supporters            causing        disorder          during

 the     match.               However,          as     stated,           the     levels          of

 officers        available                was        found      to        be     excessive,

p a r ti cul arl y       at      the        Liverpool         end        of     the    Stadium

where        this        type        of     activity          was        expected          as      a

 consequence             of     their        reputation             and        considerable

 following of supporters.                         Additionally,               the number of

CID     officers          outside           the      ground     was       found       to     have

been     excessive.              The        other      areas     raised         in     the      de­

brief were attended to and are aicussed at paragraphs

4.53,    4.84    to        4.88.

S EG REG ATI ON - STRATEGY AND REASONS

It     should    be      pointed          out     at     this    stage         that    due      to

the geographical layout of the ground,                                   Liverpool were

allocated        less         tickets       that Nottingham and                   therefore

the      fear        of'        greater           numbers           of        disappointed

spectators           was         anticipated              with           the      Liverpool

supporters.


To    amplify,       the        main      arterial        roads          (A61    and    A616)

and the exits from the Ml motorway                              (junctions 36,               35A

and    35)    for     traffic          travelling            from     the       north,       all

feed    the     north         side     of    the       ground.           Similarly,          the

main arterial roads                  (A616 and A57) and the motorway
exits    (29,    30,    31 and 34)             for traffic travelling from

the     south,    all       feed        the    south       side        of    the        ground.

The     natural       arrival        routes          of    supporters              therefore

lend themselves to a Middlewood Road and Halifax Road

approach to the ground from Livepool and Herries Road

or Penistone Road approach from Nottingham.



The     area      within          the        ground        having           the         largest

capacities        are       the     Spion       Kop       (21000)           and    the     West

Stand    and     Terraces          (14565).           The    former          is     accessed

via    Penistone        Road       North       turnstiles          and       South        Stand

car park       turnstiles           and the latter via Leppings Lane

turnstiles.



With    natural       approach routes                 in mind,          the       Spion     Kop

lends    itself        to    Nottingham          Forest       supporters                whilst

the     West      Stand           and        Terraces        to        the         Liverpool

supporters.


Giving        priority         to        segregation,              the        fact        that

Nottingham Forest supporters will utilize South Stand

car    park    turnstiles,              it    logically       follows             that    they

should also        occupy         the        South    Stand       as    turnstiles          to

that area are also in that location.



The    North     Stand      is      accessed         via    turnstiles              both    in

Leppings      Lane and Penistone                 Road North,                therefore       by

closing       those     in        Penistone          Road     North,              the    stand

could    be     used     by       Liverpool          supporters              and    optimum

segregation maintained.
This division of the ground resulted in the combined

capacities        for the two segregated areas being:

LIVERP OOL

West Stand                                                             4465

Leppings Lane Terraces                                            10100

North Stand                                                            9705



                                                                      24270

South Stand                                                           8834



                                                                  29834



Additionally           this      decision        is       in    accord        with   the

recommendations            of    the    PopplewellReport, Appendix                   '£'   Appendix

-     'Working group on the Green G u i d e 1, recommendation

57.      Here   comment          is    made    of     the      need    for    opposing

fans     to   have     a    clear       differentiation                with    spatial

separation        and       physical           containment             of     opposing

groups.



These     areas    were         therefore       allocated         on     this    basis

and    any    alteration         would        have       resulted       in    opposing

fans     crossing       each      other        therefore         increasing          the

likelihood        of    disorder         and        in    addition           excessive
disruption to             the        residents      of Sheffield and traffic

chaos       both        befo re         and     after       the        event.          The

segregation            p la n    attracted       some      criticism          fr.om both

Liverpool         s upp orters          and Liverpool Football                 Club,       in

that,       of    necessity,            it    meant      that    Liverpool           had    a

smaller a ll o c a t i o n            of the tickets.            Nevertheless,             as

stated earlier,             the event went off without difficulty,

it was c o n s ide red a successful operation.

PLANNING 1989 S EMI FINAL

On     20   March       1989,         the    South       Yorkshire       Police       were

again app roached                with a view to the Semi Final                       being

staged at         the     Hillsborough           Ground on            15 April       1989,

coincidentally             with        the    same       teams    being       involved.

Bearing       in mind           the    previous      years experience,               Chief

Superintendent Mole,                   'F 1 Divisional Commander,                agreed

that    the      event      could       be staged on the               same    basis       as

the    previous          year.          The    same      segregation           plan    was

intended and this                brought a protest, via the Football

Association, from                Liverpool       Football        Club.         The    same

arguments         as     the         previous       year    pertained          and     the

Football Association were "advised that the game could

be    staged,       but         on    the    same     terms      as    the     previous

year.       After       consideration            the      Football       Association

decided          that       they        would         stage       the        event         at

Hillsborough under these conditions.

It should be            em phasized here that the final decision

to    stage       the      Semi        Final        at    Sheffield           Wednesday

Football Club rests with the Football Association.
25    Following              notification                 of    the     game, poli ce               pl ann ing

      commenced              and        an    initial           meeting       of       all     in ter est ed     Statement 2
      p a r ti es       took        place          at    Hammerton          Road       Police        Station

      on    Wednesday              22 M a r c h         1989.         The meet ing was               chaired

      by    Chief        Superintendent                       Mole    but    he    was       accompanied

      by the th e n S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Duckenfield, who was to be

      promoted           on       Monday          27 March           1989    and       assume        command

      of     'F'     Division.                    Also        present       at     the       meeting       was

      Superintendent                         Marshall,               Superintendent                  Murray,

      Superintendent                    Chapman          and     Superintendent                Greenwood,

      who    wer e       identified                as    the     Sector C o m m a n d e r s          for the

     match         on    the           15    April       1989.         The       Sector        Commanders

     were       se lec ted              by    Chief           Superintendent              Mole       due    to

      their      e x p e r ien ce            in    policing          football          m a t c hes    and in

     particular                    the ir          previous            involvement                  at     the

     E i l l s b c r c u g h Stadium.                   All the officers con c e r n e d had

     been      involved                 in    the       1988     Semi       Final.            In     general

     they      were          given          the    same        command       positions             with    the

     exception                     of             Superintendent                   Mar shall               and

     S up eri nre nee nt                Greenwood,             whose    roles          were     reversed.

     In     198S Superintendent                          Marshall       had been              the     Ground

     (.orjicr.csr            ana        Sup erintendent               Greenwood           had       been    in

     comm and           of        the       Leppings           Lane     end       of     the       Stadium.

     Mr     G r ee nwo od               had       a      wide        ranging           ex perience          of

     policing                at        H ill sb o r o u g h          having        been         a        Chief

     In s p e c t o r        at     that          Sub     Division.              However,            he    had

     since      taken             up     command          at    Woodseats          Police           Station

     a nd   his         knowledge             of        the    Leppings .Lane                end     of    the
ground      and    recent          experiences           was     less       than          that    of

Superintendent                Marshall.                    In        view            of        this

Superintendent            M ars h a l l       undertook to take                  command of

the     Liverpool         Sector          and      Mr      Greenwood            the        ground

because       of his      c on t i n u e d knowledge of that aspect of

the Stadium.            In ad di t i o n to the Sector Commanders

each    Superintendent              was       allocated 2 Chief                  Inspectors

as    Sub   Sector Commanders.                     Again these             officers were

specially         selected          for       their      knowledge              of    policing

football         and     in    particular            their        knowledge               of     the

Hillsborough            Stadium.              At     the      meeting           discussions

once     again      took       pl ace     concerning             the       allocation             of

areas       to    supporters            but    for      the     reasons          previously

explained         it    was    agreed         that      the      allocations               should

be as the previous year.                        In dealing with this aspect

consideration            had       to    be     given       to       the    intelligence

then available as to the current attitude of the fans

from     Liverpool           and    Nottingham.                 In    both           cases       the

behaviour         during      the       season had been relatively good

in respect of both sets of supporters with the

exception of           the    tendency          for pitch            invasions            in the

case of the No t t i n g h a m supporters.



There       was        also     a       pitch        invasion              by        Liverpool

supporters        at    the     end      of the         1988     Semi      Final and to

this    end       co ntingencies              were      written        into          the       1989

serial      instructions            to    increase          the      manpower             on     the

perimeter track at                 'full time'.
    i   A   p a r ti cul ar      area       of concern at             the    meeting         was    the

        m et hod     of    travel        adopted         by visiting             supporters         and

        e xp erience            indicated          that        the    use       of     trains       and

        pa rti c u l a r l y     special       trains          was   diminishing.             It was

        felt     in       this     connection            that        supporters         knew       that

        whe n    travelling            by    special          trains    they         would    be met

        by police resources,                  escorted to the Stadium and made

        to enter straight away.                         It is clear that this is the

        greatest       form of control on those spectators and to a

        large extent prevents hooliganism.                                 In past years the

        use     of    trains       has       been       more     predominant.                This    is

        somewhat          important          particularly             with       regard      to     the

        Li verpool          supporters             to     whom       the        Wadsley       Bridge

        Railway        Station         on    the    north        side      of    the    ground       is

        made    available.              The    number of supporters                    using this

        facility,          the    number       of       trains       and     times      of    trains

        were     not       known        at    this        planning          stage      and     would

        therefore          be    the     subject          of    later       deliberation            and

        introduced into the police strategy.

4-28    Arrangements             were       made    for        planning         to   proceed        and



t       further meetings to be held under the chairmanship of

        the      new        Divisional              Commander           who          would         have

        responsibility             for       policing          the    event.           Subsequent

        planning          meetings          under       the     chairmanship            of     Chief

        Superintendent Duckenfield took place on the                                      29 March

        1989    and 10 April            1989.           The actual planning team who

        p re pared        the    Operational             Order       were       Superintendent

        Murray,       Chief       Inspector             Beal     and       Inspector          Sewell      Statements 3,
                                                                                                          5, 7, 10
        under        the        supervision              of      Chief          Superintendent

        Duckenfield.
MANPOWER

In    view         of   the    need       to     urgently         ide nti fy     manpower

requirements            the     task       was    embarked          upon     taking    into

ac c oun t     the f o l l o w i n g areas:-

         i)             The need for a level of m a n p o w e r

                        capable of policing the ma t c h and

                        m a i n t a i n i n g public order


         ii)            The e x p e ri enc e of the previous

                        ye a r and any lessons learned


         iii )          The r e spo nsi bil ity of ensuring

                        effe cti ve and efficient p oli c i n g


         iv)            The financial restraints as a

                        c on seq uen ce of cuts in the police

                        football o vertime budget



In      the         light       of          all        these         aspects manpower

r e q u ire men ts       were         identified              and      the      necessary

manpower           level      was    de ter min ed           to   be    8 01    officers.

This      figure        represents         a     cur    cf    some     127     (13.6%)    on

the pre vious year.


THE CUTS

So    far     as    the Ground        Sector,          Leppings        Lane     Terraces,

West        Stand        and          tu rnstiles             are concerned,           the

re d u c t i o n    amounted         to    only        one    Sergeant.           In     the

Lepp ing s               Lane             outer        section,        from      Parkside
        Road      to        the        roundabout           on     Penistone            Road,     the

        reduction            amounted           to         two     Sergeants            and       six

        Constables,          these being on static points.



4.32   So far as uniformed officers generally are concerned,

        the    cuts       were    made     in    the       reduction        in    the     size    of

        some operational                Serials       in that some Serials                    of one

        Sergeant          and     ten     Constables              were     reduced        to     one

        Sergeant and eight Constables and likewise Serials of

        one Sergeant and six Constables on mobile patrol were

       reduced to one              Sergeant and five Constables.                              In the

^      main    the      reductions         were        on        static    Serials        tasked

       with policing the roads around the Stadium and not on

       those      tasked with            specific          public        order    duties.         In

       addition,          it was        the peripheral areas well away from

       the     Stadium        which      bore        the    greater        reductions.            In

       uhe    ground        the m a m      reduction was in the form of the

       loss    of     one     reserve      Serial,          ie one        Sergeant       and     ten

       Constables.              This     reserve       Serial       had     been    placed        on

       standby         duty       in     the    South            Stand     car    park        area,

       Penistone          Road     North,            (Nottingham          Forest        end)      in

       1988.        The     deployment          of    uniformed           officers       in     1988

       and 1989 in pictorial terms is appended hereto.                                                  Appendix 47

       the    officers          inside    the        ground       remained       much     as    the

       previous        year       whereas         those           outside        were     almost

       halved.
The   total deployment      of officers of all ranks            in

various roles for 1988 and 1989 were as follows:

     4 .35   The    determin ati on        of    manpower             levels        in   connection

             with     any   operational          event       has        of       necessity     to    be

             based     on   information          available,                experience      and      the

             results     of the       consultative processes                      embarked upon.

             Un fortunately           it        is         not         possible          to      form

             contingencies             for           unprecedented                  changes          in

             behavioural        attitudes.           However,          the    intention of any

(            plan made in this connection is to ensure flexibility

             in the     deployment         of   resources             and     in this     case the

             same     flexibility      used      in the 1988 plan was reflected

             in the 1989 plan.




    4.36     An       example         would           be         in         considerina             the

             deployment      of manpower             to the entrance                to the tunnel

             giving     access    from       the      rear        of       the    West   Stand      to

             both the North and South Centre enclosures.




             Whilst    no   Serial      is      deputed          to    this      specific     duty,

             the    Operational        Order         has    inbuilt           flexibility        and

             perceived      problems       which       result          in     the    request     for

             redeployment        of    manpower            can        be     facilitated         via
                Ground        Control,          dependant               upon         the      developing

                situation.               To     this        end        there        were      7     Serials

                consisting          of   7     Sergeants          and    72     Constables          in    the

                immediate vicinity of the Leppings Lane turnstiles and

                West       Stand.        in     addition,             there     were        two    reserve

                Serials °f 2 Sergeants and 20 Constables available for

                deployment.



                OTHER RESOORCES

    4.38        The manpower referred to in this                             report    involves          that
/                                                                 *

                utilized            policing the actual events at Hillsborough

               under the command of the Divisional Officer.                                       However,

               total       manpower      must     take       account           of    other       available

               resources,          and   in    this    regard          reference           must    be made

               to     officers       deployed         to    Traffic           Control        duties      and

               those deployed in the city centre under the control of

               the     'D'    Division          Divisional             Commander.                Following

               previous        experience             the        Divisional            Commander          at

               Hillsborough can be more effective if he does not have

           .... to    be     concerned         with        the        logistics        of     directing

               traffic       and    escorting         it    to    the     ground.           In    view    of

               this    the    Chief 'Superintendent,                    Operations          and Traffic

               Division,       took       on     the       task        and     prepared           his    own

               Operational          Order.            These           duties        were     undertaken         Appendix 43
 in     this       way     in     1988       and       1989    and         the    respective

 m a n p o w e r involved was as follows

                    1988          106                   1989          154

 In addition,            the staging of the event at Hillsborough

 of    necessity           affects       the      city       centre        and    once    again

 the     role       of      the      Hillsborough             Commander            cannot         be

 diverted           to     take       control          of     this     aspect.               As        a

 consequence,            a separate Operational Order is prepared

 for dealing with city centre problems associated with

 the    Semi       Final,       and this action was embarked upon in

both      1988       and     in      1989.         The      manpower         dedicated            to

these roles was as follows

                    1988        127                     1989          167



Taking       into account               the three aspects of po licing                        the

total       manpower              available            for     deployment              was        as

f o l l o w s :-

                    1988        1161                        1989       1122



The     three       areas       of    command          maintain       contact          through

radio      and      land     line       communications               and    through          this

method       flexibility              for      re-deployment               is    adequately

catered for.



An     example       of     the       flexibility             of     the    plan       can        be

drawn     from       the     fact       that      in    the    'D'     Division          Order

officers           are     allocated         to    escort          duties         of    public

transport           vehicles,           travelling             from         the        Midland

Station      to the Hillsborough                       ground, and a contingency

is     incorporated             for     those          arriving       at        2.45    pm    to

remain at the Hillsborough Stadium in the Gymnasium
as     a    standby             reserve         for        deployment         as     and        when

required.             This contin ge nc y was adopted in 1988 and on

completion            of     the       match        the     officers       are      again       used

for     escort        duties        back       to     the    railway       station         in    the

city centre.                The same contingency was incorporated in

the 1989 plan.



The m ethod of raising manpower                              for events            such as the

Semi       Final       and       all     other        operational          matters         within

the     South         Yorkshire           Police           area    is    based       on    policy

which      reflects          that        the    Division          upon which the            event

is    to    take      place        should       identify          the manpower             it    can

raise       and       then        inform       Operations           Division         at     Force

Headquarters               of      that        additional          manpower          which        is

required.             The additional manpower is then raised from

across         the     Force        area       from        duty    and       off    duty        time

officers          and       is     notified           to    the     host      Division           for

allocation of duties.

In    v ie w     of     the       fact     that           Hillsborough           hosts      First

Division        Football Matches                    on a regular basis, the vast

m aj ority of officers                   in the Force have at seme time or

another         been        involved           in     policing          at     the        Ground.

Every       effort          is     made        to     ensure       that       officers          are

deployed        to     those       areas        with       which    they      are        familiar

or    if       they        have     not        been        regularly         involved           are

deployed         on     duties         where        they     may    take       up    a     static

point      and        carry        out     a    specific           role.           The    actual

deployment            of      officers           is        normally        undertaken            by
         Superintendent                   Murray             and      his       Deputy       Chief          Inspector

        Beal,        assisted                  by        the     Support            Inspector,              Inspector

         Sewell.            These officers                      have       experience          of deployment

         of     manpower              at        Hillsborough                    Stadium       and           recognise

        those        individuals                    w it h     particular             knowledge.              Because

        of the general nature of the age and experience of the

        Force        the        ma n power                provided             to    police        such        events

        reflects            that          age         and       experience             and    deployment             is

        based        upon        Serials                 under        the       command       of        a    Sergeant

        w ith    5,     6   ,    8        or        10    officers             at     his    disposal.              The

        experience              amongst               these          officers          ranges       across          the

        board        from        none           to         a    vast           experience          of       policing

        similar        events.                           Because of            natural       changes          in    the

        Force        through          retirement                    and    other       normal       wastage          it

        is     possible           that              for        some       of    the    officers             involved

        this would be the first major event they had attended.


        SEGREGATION - A D D I T IO NA L FACTORS

        In     the    planning             terms             the      findings         of    the    Popplewell            Appendices
                                                                                                                          22 & 29
        Report and the advice contained in the Guide to Safety

        and      Sports               Grounds                  is     regularly                 taken              into

        consideration.                              Responses have                  been     made       to        those

        documents           m         a             continual effort                  to     improve          safety

        factors        at       the       Stadium              and    in       particular          to maintain

        segregation so far as opposing fans are concerned.



4 .46   In    connection              with               segregation            much        effort          was    put

        into     the        total          segregation                    of    fans        working          on    the
N o r t h /S o ut h divide.                   In the          first place,             as indicated,

 the command structure was based upon this segregation.

 In    addition          as        in    1988        through        liaison           with       the    F A

and the Club,                 it    was       agreed          that Sectors of the North

Stand adjacent to the Kop and the South Stand adjacent

to     the     Leppings             Lane          Terraces      would           be    reserved          for

neutral            supporters                in     the    form       of    F     A    Members          and

their        club representatives.                            This was          intended          to act

as     a buffer          between              opposing         fans    who       were       likely       to

come          into           conflict                at        those            two         locations.

Furthermore,             to prevent throwing between opposing fans

a     fine    net       was       erected           on the end of the North                         Stand

adjacent           to        the        Kop       through       consultation                 with       the

club.



The     number          of    turnstiles                giving       access           to    the    North

Stand        was       reduced          as    a consequence                of    the       closure       of

the     12    turnstiles                in        Penistone         Road     North.              For    the

purpose           of    segregation                these      were     not       utilized          in an

effort        to       prevent           clashes._ between                 rival       supporters.

Entrance to the North                         Stand was therefore via Lepoings

Lane,       turnstiles             1-10.            Normally,        Leppings Lane access

to    the     North          Stand       is       via     turnstiles            1-8.         It   was    a

club    decision             in     hosting             the    Semi        Final       to    allocate

two     extra          turnstiles              to    compensate             for       the     loss      of

twelve       turnstiles                 in    Penistone          Road       North.               Further

means        of        segregation                   was      the     introduction                 of    a

sterile        area          in     the       service          road . behind               the     South
Stand       extending from the Leppings Lane terraces to the

Police Control Box.



This     has     been        utilized         in    1988        and had       been found to

be     an     effective           measure           in    ensuring        that       Liverpool

supporters            did     not          have the       ability        to     confront

N o t t i n g h a m supporters in the South Stand area.



A     further      point         which       had    been        identified         in    1987    at

the     mat ch        between          Coventry           and    Leeds     concerned            the

housing          of      lost         property           offices.             In     1987       the

property         had       been        taken        to    the     gymnasium             from    all

areas       of     the      ground,          consequently           resulting            in    some

d i f f ic ul ty      and     confrontation                   between     opposing             fans

when     the y        went       to     collect          their    property          after       the

match.           In 1988, and              again         in    1989, arrancrements were

made    w ith      the     club        for property             stores    to be utilized

       both      ends        of       the     Stadium.             For    the       Liverpool

supporters            a portacabin was                   erected in the West                  Stand

enclosure          whilst             No tt ingham         Forest       supporters             were

allocated          the     souvenir           shop       situate       behind       the       Spion

            rvzthi tne agreement or t.ns cj_ub tns cvrr.nasi.um was

identified            as      being           the             logistical           centre       for

operations         in that            the    allocation           of radios         and other

equipment          would          be        dealt        with     at     that       location.

Additionally,              the    gymnasium was                 identified as a venue

for    lost      children             or    other     messages         which       had    to    be

r esponded to from visitors to the Stadium.
  50   In      continuing              the     theme          of     segregation              particular

       emphasis            was         placed           upon         the        accommodation                 of

       v ehicular          traffic           for    both         sets      of     supporters.                 As

       indicated some                  supporters             travel        by     rail,         some         by

       coach,     mini        bus and their                 own modes of transport.                           In

       view      of     this       arrangements                    were     made        for      'special

       trains ' carrying Liverpool                           supporters to be brought to

       Wadsley        Bridge       Station,             a    station        which       is    only        used

       for     football          supporters             and      for Nottingham               supporters

       the     train were          scheduled                to      go     into     the       Midland

       Station        in    the    centre          of       Sheffield.            Whilst        this        was

       generally           the     case        there          are    service        trains           comina

       into     the    Midland           Station            which        would    carry       Liverpool

       supporters and              contingency                   plans       were        made                 to

       transport           them    by        public         transport        buses       direct           from

       the     station       to        the    Leppings             Lane    end     of    the      ground,

       thereby        avoiding           confrontation                   with     the        Nottingham

       supporters.                So    far        as       coaches        are     concerned,               the

       coaches        from Liverpool               were       to be accommodated                   at       the

       North     of    the       Stadium           in    C-laywheels            Lane     and      Halifax

       Road    and     the coaches             from Nottingham                   in Herries             Road.

               buses       and private             cars were likewise                   5.c c o m m c   c s lc G


       in the North/South divide.



4.51   These    plans       were       identical             to those        for the          1988       Semi

       Final    and     would          have     the         added    advantage           of    ensuring

       that    supporters              who     had          attended        the    previous              year

       would be familiar with the arrangements.
Developing           this     theme,        given          that    the     Liverpool           -v-

Nottingham            Forest         Semi        Final        1988         was        held      at

Hillsborough Stadium,                    coupled with the fact that their

last     league       game     at    the       Stadium was              14 January           1989,

it    follows        that    the     same       supporters,             particularly the

'unruly         element'           would        be         equally        familiar            with

policing          methods.                In        particular,            the        practice

regarding         public      houses referred to at paragraph                                 4.74

would be well known.



TICKETS

 Previous            experience           regarding               the     allocation            of

tickets        had    indicated          some        difficulties,              both    in    the

identification               of     the        areas        where ticket           holders

should attend and                 in respect of forgery.                    Efforts were

made     to    combat        both       these        problems.             In relation          to

forgeries,           special        material          was    used         for printing          so

that    they      could      quickly           be     identified.               The    tickets

were    colour        coded       and     over       printed       with     Liverpool          or

Nottingham dependant                 upon -the area               to which        they were

allocated.            This    procedure              had    been        embarked       upon    in

1988 , hcwever,' at                the    de-brief           concerning          that        match

it    was     felt    that    the       colour        coding       was     not    prominent

enough      and      was    not     linked      to     a colour           code    system at

the    turnstiles.             In    1989 , the            club     arranged           for    the

colour        code    to     be     made       much        bolder         and    respective

colours        were        shown     at        the     turnstiles           where        those
tickets        should       be    surrendered.               It    was       through        this

method       that    it     was    anticipated            that     spectators              would

be allowed more             ready access to the ground without the

problem of seeking directions and causing delays.



Additionally,              the     tickets          for      the        Spion       Kop      and

Leppings        Lane      Terraces           were    also      overprinted           showing

    Nottingham            Forest        area*         and         'Liverpool               area'

respectively.                    This        was     done         to     overcome            the

difficulties           experienced            in    the     1588       Semi     Final      when

Liverpool           supporters          purchased           Spion         Kop       tickets,

gained       access,        claiming          ignorance           of     the    fact        that

they     had       purchased       tickets          for     the        'wrong       end'     and

created        segregation          problems.             In    fact      this       did     not

work     and    Liverpool          supporters          still       gained        access       to

the Spion Kop in 1989.



On    the    Spion     Kop       near    to    the     North       Stand       there       is a

small       area    with     limited          access      which        can     be    used    to

isolate        Liverpool          supporters          from        Nottingham          Forest

supporters.               This     contingency            was      put       into     effect

u^iizmg             pcxice        crncers            to        ensure          segregation

between the two.



A    similar       contingency          for    the     Leppings          Lane       Terraces

in    respect        of    Nottingham              Forest      supporters            is     not

viable      because        there        is    no     natural           small     area       for

segregation.
It     will     be    noted          that    the     rear       of    each      Semi       Final

ticket        requests         that        supporters          take     up     position       15

minutes        before kick off.                   In fact publicity circulated

both locally and to the Liverpool and Nottingham areas

asks      supporters             to     time       their         journey           to     arrive

between 10.30 am and 2.00 pm.



NON TICKET HOLDERS

Whilst        the     colour          coding        of        tickets        described        at

paragraph           4.53       was     intended          to    expedite        fast        entry

into     the    Stadium,             there    is    always       the    possibility           as

in     previous           years       of     spectators           attending             without

tickets.             To    this       end,    a    contingency           existed          where

such     persons          loitering          in    the        immediate       vicinity        of

the      ground,           after       kick        off,        would      be       collected

together        and,       m      the       case    of        Liverpool        supporters,

taken to Coal Road,                   an area adjacent to Waasiey Bridge

Station       for dispersal             or to await             for    transport after

the match.            Nottingham supporters                     were to be taken to

Hillsborough              Park       where        the     same        procedure           would

apply.



In 1 9 8 8 , whilst        there are a number who attended without

tickets f the         number          was    not     excessive          and        they    were

simply    dispersed             from    the       area.        It must        be    stressed

that    this    plan was             intended      to deal        with the nuisance

p ro b le m caused by non ticket                    holders          loitering          in the
area     whilst          the     game         was    in    progress.              It    was     never

intended to deal with non ticket holders prior to kick

off.          The         logistics                 of     such     a        plan would              be

impractical              due     to    the      manpower          requirements                and    of

course        the     practical               difficulty           of     identifying               and

removing such people from within the mass of fans.



All     tickets          games        have     been discussed                in    the       past    at

the     pre-season             m e e t i ng    held       each    year       between          Senior      Appendix   52

Officers         of       the         South         Yorkshire           Police and              club

officials           (usually            the         Secretary           and       Chairman           or

Representative Director).



At one of their meetings held on the 24 July 1987,                                                  the

question       was        askad         by      the       clubs whether            or     not       the

police would permit                    entry to non ticket holders rather

than    have        them       milling          about       the    streets             around       the

ground.          They           were      told           that     entry       would          not     be

allowed       as the       long        term affect would                  be to encourage

non     ticket        holders          totravel           safe          in    the knowledge

that they would be admitted.



PUBLICITY

During        planning             stages           it      was     agreed             that         the

information          concerning               the     arrangements            for the match

would    be    promulgated               to     supporters          through            the    media

and    through           their        club programmes.                       This task             was    Appendix 51

undertaken          by    the       Football             Intelligence         Office          under
        the directions             of the Chief Superintendent                            (Operations

        and Traffic Division).                      Emphasis was made on the need

        for     supporters              to        attend      in        good        time     and,          to

        accommodate this,                 arrangements were made with the club

        for     turnstiles           to      be     opened        at    12     noon,       that       is      3

       hours          before              kick        off,         which            under            normal

       circumstances              would        give     adequate             time    for     entry         to

       the ground.                Detective           Superintendent                 McKay        made      a
                                                                                                                  Statement 1
       broadcast on Radio Merseyside on Friday 14 April 1989,

       stressing           that      as    this      was     an     all       ticket       match,       non

       ticket holders should not attend.



       COMMUNICATIONS

4.63   In      terms       of     communication               the       ground         has       a    base

       station        which       can        operate         on    UHF        for    all     officers

       employed on duty in connection with that event in each

       of      the     3   Sectors.               The Control          Room         was    under       the

       command        of    Superintendent                 Murray,           assisted        by      staff

       who     regularly          police          the   Police          Control           Box.        This

       stafr        consists       of      a     Sergeant         and     2    Constables.                 In

       addition        to the UHF facility,                   the VHF traffic channels

       are     monitored        at      that       location.            The     police       officers

       in     the    Control       Box         also have          landline          facilities           to

       the     club,       hammerton           Road Police         Station           and     a direct

       outside       line.        The      club     have     their        own personal radio

       system       for use       by stewards.               The Police Control staff

       link    into this          by way          of one of the clubs radio sets.

       The    Police       Control           Room     has    a     facility          to    over-ride
 the grounds publ ic address                             system.



 In     order          that       c o mm un ications           can    be        maintained           each

 Supervisory                Officer          of    the    rank      of Sergeant             and     above

was       allocated               with       a    personal          radio.            Radio        checks

were        made       prior          to    the    commencement            of    the       operation.




Due       to      experi en ce s             at    the    Semi       Final       held        in     1987,

when         difficulty                    was     encountered             by     officers            not

hearing           radio messages,                  arrangements            were m ade for all

S erials          in       and    around          the    ground      to    be     e q ui pp ed       with

personal             ear pieces             to ensure that crowd noise did not

deter          the      a bility            to    direct       and    control              personnel.

are     essential, and at Hillsborough,                               these are tested on

a     r e g u l ar     basis.               The    procedures         have        in        fact    been

t e st ed        twice          during       this        season,      on        the    1     February

1989        at       the        Symod       Cup    M at ch     and    on    the        18    February

198 9 wh e n         S heffield W e d ne sd a y played Southampton.                                  The

procedures             were       found          to be    effective.             In accordance

with      the     guidance             contained          in the Guide                to Safety at
Sports Grounds                the management of the club are required                               Appendix 29

to     consult           with        the        Fire     Authority        rega rd in g        the

suitability          of        the    evacuation procedures.                     Details       of

the     evacuation               procedures               are         included      in        the

Operation          Order         and        are       issued     to     all     Supervisory         Appendix 53
Officers of the rank of Sergeant and above.



In    brief,       the        plan        r e q u i r e s ,on a pre-arranged            signal,

officers       being           deployed          to     gates,    gangways        and    doors

in readiness              for    evacuation             and specific officers                 are

briefed prior             to the           event       on their        function.        Should

it      be     necessary                   to      implement           evacuation            then

i ns tr u c t i o n s ,peculiar to the problem in hand, are given

to     officers           through            the       Police     Control        Box.          In

essence,       the       plan        caters        for egress          into identifiable

safe     areas           of     the        ground        such     as     the     pitch        and

enclosures behind each of the respective stands.                                         These

plans        are     arranged              in      consultation          with     the        Fire

Service,           Ambulance                Service,           Club      Officials            and

Stewards       and        in    accordance, with                 the    findings        in    the

Popplewell          Report           at    paragraph        4.23,       a copy     of    which

is appended.



The    ground       public           address          system     is    brought     into       use

to advise          the    crowd           or sections       of the crowd to leave

the    Stadium          once     contingencies              have       been    formulated.

It    should       be     m e nt i on ed        that     regular        testing    of        this

system,        using           the         police        over-ride        facility            has

revealed           that        one         of     the     speakers         (adjacent           to
turnstile        73)     to be         defective.           It has taken repeated

requests to the club to have this repaired,                                       this being

achieved      a m atter          of     weeks       before       the    Semi       Final    was

scheduled to take place.



By    way   of     comparison           the    need       has    been        identified      in

the past for a system of speakers actually outside the

turnstiles         in     Leppings           Lane    to    enable        the      spectators

awaiting entry             to    be    addressed          should the           need      arise.

The club implemented this change without undue delay.



INTELLIGENCE

Whilst       the       m aj or i t y     of    planning           can        be    taken     in

advance of the event,                   changes do occur and the role of

the    Football           Intelligence              Officer           cannot        be    under

estimated.             His      liaison       with    the        clubs       involved       and

assessment         of    background           information             concerning         their

behaviour        is     considered            in    depth       and     it    can     dictate

the need for change                to plans right up to kick off.                            To    Appendix 54

this   end    the       plan     is     a broad       brush       stroke          with   built

in flexibility            for change should unforeseen situations




Additional         reference           was    made    to     the       'match       summary1

In terms of Intelligence,                     Liverpool -had in fact played
at     Hillsborough             against          Sheffield       Wednesday         Football

Club     on       Saturday       14       January       1989.       On    that     occasion

the    Liverpool             supporters          totalled       6,10 0 and        the     home

supporters              25,4 24.           The     total       at    the        ground     was

therefore          31,524.           The    attitude of all              supporters        can

best    be d escribed             as      good and in fact there were only

4 arrests,             all     involving the visiting supporters                          from

Liverpool,             2 being        inside the 'ground and                two     outside

the ground.              In addition,             there were 29 ejections                from

the    ground           under    the       Ground    Regulations,           25    being     in

connection            with      home      supporters          and   4 being       visitors

from L i v e r p o o l .



In    terms        of    transportation,             it    was      noted       that     there

were        no    special        trains          from     Liverpool         and     on     the

service trains                approximately 900 attended and on buses

and    coaches          1,100.         Therefore,          seme     4,100       travelled

in     their       own       transport.            The    manpower         committed        to

policing           that        event        totalled          313    officers.             An

Operational             Order    was       produced and          took the        format     as

at    all        league       matches       staged       at     Sheffield        Wednesday

ALCOHOL

The    role       of     the     Divisional         Intelligence            Officer       has

also    been          enlarged       to    include       liaison         with    licensees

in    the    area        of    the     ground with a view to                encouraging

closure          or      the     operation         of     'selective            doors'     to
p r e v en t        clashes             of        rival         supporters                inside           the

p r em is e s.          This        is don e as a matter of course for each

m a t c h day and was a l s o done pre-Semi Final day.

                                                                                     /




It     is      a     fact        that        alcohol           is        not    on       sale        to    the

gen e ra l         p u bl ic        inside         the        Stadium.               This       is        as     a

d irect        result          of a p pl ic at i on by South Yorkshire Police

to    the      Licensing               Bench        of    the        S heffield               Magistates'

Court.             The     e f f ec t       of    this        is    that        those         wishing          to

drink        have        to     do    so     at    licensed              premises         outside              the

ground.             The        p ol ic e     seek        to     control          this,          utilizing

the p r o c e d u r e s         o u t l i n e d in paragraph 4.74,



Consideration                  was      in       fact     given           to    applying             to    the

M a gi s t r a t e s '         Court         for     a        Restriction                 Order       under

Section            67     of     the       Licensing            Act       1964       as       amended           by

S e c t io n       3 of       the    L icensing           Act       1988 .       However,            as any

Restriction               Order         can        only        specify           closure          between

2.30     p m and          5.30 pm and, given that                              'drinking up time'

of      20         minutes             wculd        mean            public           houses           would

effectively               close        10    minutes           before          kick       cff,       it    was

considered              to be of no effect.

Following            the       arrangements               for       p l anning           of    any    major

event        it     is        essential            that       plans,           and       the    policies

 the       wide    spread        of    people       involved         in the       operation,

 it    was        decided    that           briefings        would     be     held      at    the

 Stad iu m on        the day prior                to the event         for    officers         of

       are      the         requirements               for         emergency           evacuation

       STEWARDS

4.80   In     accordance           with     the       Guide        to     Safety       at        Sports        Appendix 29

       G r o u n d s , management          of    the       club    and     the       police       acrree

       that    the stewards            at the Stadium have a responsibility

       for     packing          and    control        of     supporters           entering             the

       ground.         The       police     have       a    responsibility              to       advise

       and    assist       and     on each match             day    stewards are briefed

       by supervisory             officers.           Qn the occasion                of the Semi

       Final    on    15     April      1989 , stewards                were    briefed        by    the

       Inspectors          responsible          for    the    four main           areas       of    the

       ground      and     this       briefing         took       place        after       the     main

       police      briefing.            Incorporated              in     the    briefing          is    a

       reminder            regarding             emergency                and          evacuation

       procedures.              The   responsibility               for    this       task    at    the

       Leppings Lane end fell on Inspector White.                                                            Statement 13
    '81   It    is    of    particular          importance          that,       over      the     years,

          the     clubs       attention         has    been       drawn        to   the    fact        that

          stewards were not performing their duties to the full,

          the most relevant feature being:-

                            (i)           Continual manning of gates                           (both

                                            access/egress and internal)

                            (ii)          Packing of enclosures

 4.82     These       failings       have      been     brought          to the       attention          of

          club officials             during actual            games, at ad hoc meetings

          on ot ii er than match days and at the annual briefing of

          stewards          held     at   the        club    and     to     which         the    police
m
^         attended.           Two    such      meetings           were    held on         the    15 and

          23    August        1988    and       at    those        meetings          stewards          were

          reminded of their duties.                         A copy of          'Instructions for
                                                                                                              Appendix 59
          Match       Day    S t a f f 1 and     'Instruction             to    Stewards'         which       Appendix 60
          are issued by the club are included in the Appendices.



4.8j      In    practice,          however,      the        police       still       perform       some

          stewarding          duties,       rather      than        leave       them      to    chance.

          In particular,             Inspectors         ana       above    are issued with a

          key    to    the    padlocks         which    either           lock or       fasten      back

                             gates,       all        oadlocks        beincr         identic;

          requiring the use of one                     'common key'.                Whilst this is

          a working practice                it does         not    absolve          the clubs      from

          their overall responsibility.



          SEMI FINALS 1988 and 1989 - CHANGES

4.84      In essence the plan for 1989 followed very closely the
plan     for           1988     wi t h     the        exception        of     the         changes

already outlined.                    In addition there were five further

changes           worthy      of        comment ,        the    first        concerned         the

use     of    the        Force          spotter        plane,    which        was       used    to

monitor traffic build up in 1988.                                However, because of

a change of policy                   in procedures regarding searches of

coaches           at    m ot or w ay       intersections             which        had     created

some build up it was not felt necessary to utilize the

plane and in addition there had been some difficulties

with     communication                   links        between        the     aircraft          and

ground.            The     difficulties               experienced           far    outweighed

the     benefits          and      it    was     decided       not     to    use    the      plane

on this occasion.



The     second           concerns          the        introduction          of      hand      held

video        camera        and       evidence           gathering           team who          were

utilized           to     supplement             the     static        cameras            already

installed at the ground.



A   further        aspect        concerned -licensed premises.                            With a

change        of         licensing          laws       concerning            the all           day

opening           of     premises, it          was      noted        that     particular

attention          should       be      given     to these on the build up to

the    match       and     this         fact    was     included       in     the       briefing

notes     for          Serials       around       the     ground.            It     was      their

brief        to        advise        the       Police        Control         Post       of     any

problems          in     particular areas.                   This     policy        had      been

used    in    1988.           However,           it    was     noted    that        year     that
considerable             sales        from        off      licence              premises        had

occurred and in 1989                   it was decided that an additional

responsibility             should           be     included           in        the     briefing

notes       to     pay     particular              attention              to     off     licence

premises as well as on licence premises.



The      fourth       change           yet        again         effects           the         under

employment of officers                  experienced in 1988.                           Following

the    first       phase       of     the    match       that        is     up    to    3.00     pm

kick oft tune officers who had been on coach reception

duties      and    peripheral           patrols          were    under          employed        and

it    was    decided           that    they        could        be    used       as     a    ready

reserve      for     assistance             at    either        end        of    the    ground,

and    to    this        end    coaches           were     in        Leppings          Lane     and

Penistone          Road    North        and       five     Serials              comprising        5

Sergeants and 40 Constables were briefed to make their

way   to    the     coach       for    standby          duties        at       Leppings       Lane

and    5    Sergeants           and         41    Constables              were        similarly

briefed to attend at Penistone Road North.



The   fifth change             concerned route signing.                          In 1988 the

police      were    responsible             for    this     aspect             includina       car

parking      indicators.                In        1989     the        club        agreed        to

provide      the    finance           for    AA    route        signs.           The        Dolice

providing           additional               signs,         particularly                      with

reference to car parking.
OTHER MATTERS

Sunday Match

In   considering             the    possibility      of   staging          the    Semi

Final on a Sunday, the following applied:

        (i)          The Football Association express

                         a wish for both Semi Finals to be

                         played on the same day with the

                         caveat that they would consider

                         changing to a Sunday if live

                         television cover was offered. No

                         such offer was made.



        (ii)         As this was an all ticket game,                  the

                         day on which it was staged would

                        make no difference to the capacity.



        (i i i )     Licensed premises were open until

                        kick off on both dates.



TONNEL         GATES

It   should         be    noted     that    there   are   two    gates       at   the    Appendix 3
                                                                                         (photograph
entrance           to      the     central     tunnel     leading           tc    the
                                                                                         25)
Leppings           Lane     terraces        which   can    be        closed       and

locked.            The     gates     open    into   the    tunnel          and    are

fastened        back.        It is a fact that should these gates

be closed in an effort to stop the flow of supporters

entering           the     tunnel    and     accessing     the       two    centre

pens,     then       in    an    emergency     resulting        in   the     tunnel
     *


         becoming crowded,                it would be impossible to open these

         gates       as they would of necessity open against the flow

         of pedestrians             coming out of the ground.




         T URNSTILE COUNT I NG SYSTEM



    j1   The    club    has        control    facilities      whereby      they      monitor

         through       CCTV     all       the turnstiles     at the     stadium.          This

         monitoring       is linked to a computerized counting system

         and     this     has         a    warning     facility       when     levels       of

         supporters           in     the     various    sections      of     the     Stadium

         reach a 15% shortage of the agreed capacity figure.




4.92     From    a     police       point     of   view,     a     Liaison     Officer      is

         accommodated               in     that    room      in     order      that        any

^        difficulties          at        turnstiles    may   be     relayed     to      Police

         Control.        Ke     is' equipped with a police              personal         radio

         and has       access       to the clubs       landline      system.       The club

         are     totally           responsible        for    the    running        of     this
r




           *
               facility but, by the presence of our Liaison Officer, we

               are     in      a     position       to     know when          ground       capacities          are

               being reached. Where such an occasion arises,                                         then the

               Liaison               Officer         can         advise         Control             of        that

               development.



    4-93       On    the       occasion        of    this    event,          there     is    no record of

               any     such          information           having       been    received           at     Police

               Control;               however,       the     Liaison         Officer        does     indicate

               that       he       attempted        to    contact       Control        due    to    the       fact   statement 'I

               tnat       the      Kop had reached a point                     whereby       capacity was

               almost          achieved.        He could not            get     through due              to over

               loading           of     the    communications                which    was     then        taking

               place.               Despite         this,    the        fact     that        the     Kop      was

               reaching capacity had no bearing on the events.



               CLUB LIAISON

    4.94       It    is     perhaps           important       to     point       out       that     over      the

               years       liaison        with      club     officials          has    been maintained

               through           good     will       and    in     an    effort        to    achieve          our

               common          practice        of     accommodating             the        public        at   the

               Stadium          in    safety.            Whilst     this      liaison        has    resulted

               in    some        overlap       concerning          activities          at     the       ground,

               there        has       been    no     reduction          as    such     in    the        defined

               areas        of       responsibility           of     either          the     club        or   the
police.     The presence of liaison officers as ment i on ed

above     has   been   intended   to   improve   the   flow   of

information      rather   than    usurp   the    authority    or

responsibility of club employees and officials.

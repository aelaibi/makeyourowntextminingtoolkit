DoE Briefing Material


1.   I attach a copy of DoE's draft briefing prepared in
readiness for their oral evidence to the Hillsborough Inquiry.

2.   The issues addressed are cross-referenced to evidence put to
the Inquiry jointiy_by the Football Association/Football League
I think DoE would like our comments later this week, preferably
n?      Friday.  I am willing to do this if you wish although most
of the items seem to be hooligan/alcohol related rather than
Spn                     where the demarcation lies between F8 and
SARD on all this but I would have thought that DoE should stick
to Part I of the Football Spectators Bill.

3   'Home O f f i c e written evidence to the Inquiry also covers some
    n Tnp ?'l'   ' lncludlng ^he sale of tickets.   Are C4 content for
the DoE line proposed at item 6 of the draft briefing material? -

        tl?Jnk F8 and G2 also need to consider in readiness to
expand, if necessary, our line on pitch barrier fencing which
gives rise to differing views,-some strongly held as to their
value in relation to safety at football grounds.    I envisage
clearing any such line with DoE.                            9

     Dear David

     CONTROL OF SPECTATORS

     ^ enclose for your information a copy of the                            new Italian
     regulations for safety and control of spectators.                        A copy has
     been sent to Lord Justice Taylor's Office.

■*" Criticisms of the Football Membership Scheme


   —   Wl11 c-ause additional congestion outside the turnstiles (7.3)
   Line to take

   Potential suppliers of the technology say that some systems would mean no
   extra time would be necessary to check the card at the turnstile* It could
    e done in no more than the time it presently takes to part with tickets or
   to pay for them.


   —   wm     lead to the loss of occasional supporters (7.4)

   Line to take

   JLi±Sj a   requtirfment of the Football Spectators Bill that the scheme must
   1 elude    provisions allowing for temporary membership.    Joining a scheme
   will be    a simple process involving completing a single form with a few
   personal    details and providing two photographs.

   There should indeed be an increase in attendance as a result of the scheme
   by those who would otherwise not attend because of the threat of violence,
   in particular we would expect more families to attend.

The Government should give financial assistance to football by effectively-
reducing the rate of pool betting tax from Its present 42.5# and ensuring
that the entire benefit of the reduction was passed to football (5 *2 5 )


Line to take

The pool betting duty is a tax on gambling, not on football.    Channelling
of a fixed proportion of this tax to football would amount to a
hypotheration of revenue.   It is a basic principle of the tax system that
receipts from taxation are treated as belonging to a central pool from
which resources are allocated according to public expenditure priorities.

The pools promoters through the Football Trust and the Football Grounds
Improvement Trust already provide substantial, financial assistance to
football, about £9-5ni a year. This assistance is not affected by the level
of pool betting duty since they are found from the proceeds of the Spotting
the Ball competitions on which duty is not charged.


[If required on comparison with horseracing levy.

The horseracing levy board was set up in 1961 when off-course betting shops
were legalised and this drew money away from the courses.    Football pools
betting does not, of course, have a comparable effect on the income of
individual clubs.]
4•    The Government should   make   capital   allowances   available    for       ground
     Improvements (5.2&) ~

5* Central and local government should         be   encouraged   to   assist   In     the
   construction of new grounds (9 .6 )


     Line to take

     Football is a prosperous industry which should pay for the measures needed
     to secure the reasonable safety and comfort of its customers.    It should
     not look to the Government for assistance to enable it to discharge its
     responsibilities to its customers.      The Government does not provide
     financial assistance of this sort to any sport.




                                                                               t
* Tfof sale of tickets on match days other than at official club selling
  points should be made illegal (8.3)          “  ~           ----- ---


 Line to take

 While we have every sympathy with the objectives behind this proposal we
                        6 1S ? practicable and enforceable legal remedy to the
 Lnnio"1' 1         p Pr°P°sal if implemented would prevent the legitimate last
 minute sale of spare tickets or tickets which an individual was no longer
 Hnn i r POt l ^ ° n 4-K° ^se’ to a fr>iend.  Moreover, there would still be the
 danger that the           professional' touts would continue their activities
 underground and demand yet higher prices.
7. Recommendations on alcohol consumption:


a) The sections of the Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol, etc) Act,— 128^
   dealing with the consumption of alcohol at grounds should be repealed (9*5)

   Line to take

   This is primarily a matter for the Home Office but our view and that of the
   Home Office is that the measures to control alcohol introduced in 1985 have
   unquestionably played a part in improving the situation inside grounds in
   respect of drink related disorder.    We see no reason for relaxing these
   measures now and it is far from evident that the provision of alcohol on
   the grounds will encourage the hard core of spectators who stay in the pubs
   until the last minute to leave early.


b) The Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol, etc) Act, 1985 should be amended
   to require coach operators carrying football supporters to matches__tocarr^
   supporters direct to grounds and to prevent the consumption of alcohol both
   in the coach and en route (9*5)


   Line to take

   The Home Office position is that there is no evidence that coach operators
   are not abiding by the spirit as well as.the letter of the 1985 Act under
   which it is an offence to consume alcohol on coaches going either to or
   from matches.
8. Green Guide recommendations:


a) It should be a condition of the issue of a Safety Certificate that certain
   specific requirement of the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds are met (6.3)

  Line to take

  This is a Home Officer matter.

   Background

   The Home Office position is that the Green Guide is there to provide
   guidance on safety at sports grounds to be drawn upon by local authorities
   as appropriate according to the circumstances of the case. Whether or not
   there should be certain standard safety requirements to be a condition of
   the issue of all football ground Safety Certificates is a matter for the
   Inquiry.


b) A Working Party should be set up to draw up these requirements of the Guide
   which should be satisfied as a condition of the issue of a Safety
   Certificate (6.5)

   Line to take

   This is a Home Officer matter.'


c) Various amendments and additions to the Guide should be made (6.6 to 6.11)

   Line to take

   These are Home Office matters.

   Background

   The Home Office has not yet formed a view on all these specific
   suggestions.    In some cases they can be supported or indeed are
   self-evident,  such as the suggestion that each turnstile/group of
   turnstiles should give access to one designated area of the stadium.

   The key issue for the Home Office in relation to the FA/FL comments on the
   Guide is the question of perimeter fencing.    The advice in the Guide on
   this stemmed primarily from considerations of prevention of disorder rather
   than public safety although the two are of course inextricably linked. The
   Home Office are still considering the line they should take if pressed by
   Taylor.

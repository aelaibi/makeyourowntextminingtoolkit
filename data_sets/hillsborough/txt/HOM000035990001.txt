HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - COMPENSATION PAYMENTS

Thank you for your letter of 25 January about the possibility of
the South Yorkshire Police Authority making compensation payments
above the statutory bereavement provision of £3,500. You asked
whether such payments would qualify for police specific grant.

We understand that the Lord Chancellor is to review the statutory
provision for compensation and that there have been some recent
cases where payments have been made above the amount specified.
Ultimately it is for the parties involved to negotiate the level
of settlement in each case.     As far as the grant position is
concerned, if on legal advice, your Authority proposes to settle
at a higher level than the statutory figure the Home Office would
be prepared to pay grant on that element of compensation not
covered by your Authority's insurance, provided the total
compensation figure paid did not exceed £10,000 per person.
If your Auth ority proposes to settle at a figure in excess of
£10,000 per case we would need to be consulted beforehand because
of the implication
        '           for grant expenditure.

Spi.on Hop.                  We    had also                been     informed           of      the     designated            parking          areas

for      both       sets          of    fa ns,         I have           attended          matches        at       Sheffield         Wednesday

remember,,           the          briefing             was     very much             the       same.         On    t his     previous

occasion            however,                I had          been     on    the       detail        covering           th e    barriers           on

Vere       Road and               other          junctions              adjacent          to     the    ground.             We    were

from       11.15 a.m.                  on       taking        up    our       positions           there       was     a     steady       flow        of

f a ns     corning a l o n g                Periistsne             Road       from     the       direction           of W a d s ley B r i d g e

Railway           Station.              Most          of    t h e m at        this     time       were       on t he        o p p o s 1 1 e Vs i de .'

of    the     road           from       the          bus    station           and    our       position.



At    about         1 p.m.             the       stream        of       supporters             had     increased            quite

the      r o ad w e r e           Liverpool                supporters            and      they were           directed            across        the

r o ad     to L e p p i n g s           lane          for     the       North       Stand.           It was        noticeable            at     this

ti m e     t h at    many          of       these          fans     were       carrying           tins       of    b eer     and    many        of

them were            actually                   drinking           as    they       walked        along       th e    road.         I would,

add      h er e     that          between             th is    time       and       about        2.43    p.m.        a distance            of

between           100        to    150 y a r d s            away        from     us a l o n g        Penistone            Road     w ere

groups        of     supporters                      sat    on w a l l s       at    the       side     of    the     road,        again

drinking            cans          of    beer          and     it a p p e a r e d       to me         they were            not     in any

great       hurry            to    get          to    the     match.



Just       after         2    p.m.          a    large        contingent             of L i v e r p o o l         fans      were    escorted

down       Pen.i s t o n e         Road          by m e m b e r s        of    the     Mounted          Branch        and        other

officers.              I presumed               these        were        from     the      train     that      was       due     to

arrive      about           this       time,            There      was        still     a v as t     number         of    supporters

again      the m a j o r i t y           being          Liverpool             fans    moving       along       both       sides        of

Penistone          Road       and        again          I would          add     that      many    of    these       fans        had

obviously          been       drinking,                 some     I would          say      f ro m my e xperience,                   quite

heavily.           There          was        the    usual        rowdiness            and    chanting          from       these

supporters             at    this        t im e     but       nothing          that     warranted          any Police               action

At    about       2.'30 p.m.             I looked             up a l o n g       Leppings         L a n e , it w a s        extremely

crowded       and P o l i c e            Constable             McFarlane             in fact       remarked          to me          t hat

the    entire          road       looked           just       like       "a s e a     of    bobbing        heads*.             It was

certainly          impassable                 to    vehicular             traffic.          There       did    not       appear        to       b

any    untoward             incidents              at    this      time        and    everything           appeared            to     be

At 3.0 5      p.m.          that       date        we    liaised with                Police       Sergeant          Ashton          and

              come        out         of       the    ground          t h e y w e r e red f a c e d           and       one,       a middle         aged

              man,        was         crying«              I then         noticedwhat              1 presumed                were injured             persons

              being        carried             to    the       rear       of    the     ambulance.                 The m i d d l e        aged      chap

              stood        in         front          of    the       cor d o n ,      he w a s c r y i n g    and       saying,       "Is       it w o r t h

              entered           the       ground          and    as       I passed          the a m b u l a n c e            1 s a w appro;-;imat®iy ■

              three        injured             parties          at     the      rear       of    the    ambulance              being       assisted          by

              P o l i ce C o n s t a b l e s             and Ambulance                Service.          One        appeared          dead       to me,       he

              was     a    definite             blue        colour         and     d i d n ’t a p p e a r          to    be    breathing.              A t 'the

              rear        of    the       stands          were       Police        Officers            with        other        injured         f a n s , many

              just        lying       on t h e           floor       apparently             lifeless.               The       gravity       of      the

              s i t u at io n was              quite        obviously            dawning          by    now        and       as we    then       entered

              the     tunnel          leading             to    the       rear     of      the    Leppings              Lane       goal    area,       1 was

              dumbfounded                 to    see       the    scene          that       was    spread           out       before       us.       I have

              thought           they were                terrible          and     saddening            but        to a c t u a l l y      See      the

              scene        before          your          eyes    is       beyond        belief.



              There        were       still          a    lar g e      number         of    supporters              on       the    actual       terracing

              both        to    the       left       and       right.           The     wire      fencing           surrounding             the       pi ten

              was     broken          in       places          and     the      entire          goal    area        was       covered       with Police

              Officers              and    fans.           Some        fans      were       injured           and       others       were       walking

              around,           completely                disorientated                 and      dazed.            In    company          with Police

Constable          McFarlatte,                  I continued             on    to    the     pitch where                there       were

bodies       lying          all       over       the      ground,        many       being           attended          by P o l i c e

Officers          and       first          aiders         and     fan s.       I spoke              with       several       of    those

wandering          aimlessly                and     ascertained               it    they were                 injured,       generally

assisting          in w h a t e v e r            way      I could        by    comforting                 them and          getting         them

away    from       the       bodies,             but      in all        honesty          what        words       could you           use     to

them,        1 then          assisted              other        officers           to    place           a body       of a m a l e        onto

one    of    the       broken          hoardings               carried        by L i v e r p o o l            fans.      They      took      him

away    to    the       opposite                corner         between        the       Kop a n d N o r t h           Stand.         By     this

time     1 had         lost        contact          with Police               Constable              McFarlane           and      other

members       of m y         serial.               I assisted            fans       with        a    further          male     youth -

early       twenties,             shortish             l i g ht      coloured           hair.            I believe          he w a s      s t ill

conscious          - he w a s              certainly moving                   and       breathing.               He    too     was     put      on

a   hoarding           and       t a k e n awa y .             Again     I tried           to       console, one            ch ap wh o       was

just    sat       on    the       floor          staring          into -space - but                      again what          could you

say    to 'him.             At    this          stage      I just        c o u l d n ’t b e l i e v e           that     t his     had

happened..             1 was          at    a    loss      for w o r d s       myself           as       to    the    enormity         of

fans™        Chief          Superintendent                     N e s b i t then         requested              that    we    assist         with

trying       to    remove             all       injured         f ans    from       the     area          to a s s i s t     with

treatment          of       the       injured.             Together           with       other           officers        I attempted

were    getting             agitated             because          the    Notts          Forest           supporters          at    the      Kop

end    were       mocking             the       sce n e    (which        at    the-; time            it d i d a p p e a r         so. to

me).        The    fans          were       asking         us w h y      they       were        in the          smaller        end a nd

Police       saying,             “Y o u r       lots      to    blame        for    this,           why d i d        they    open      the

gates?"           Other          Liverpool             supporters             blamed        the          Football       Association

because of the t i c k e t                       allocation-             1 then          h e a r d an a n n o u n c e m e n t          that

the match was being abandoned, with this and after an announcement by Kenny

Dalglish the fans started to drift away and the stadium slowly emptied.                     I

was   then   joined   in   the   cordon   by   Police    Sergeant Ashton     and     Police

Constable    2905   Greatorex.    After   a    short    while   Police   Sergeant    Ashton

directed us to return      to    our designated           duty and we made out           wayto the

roundabout where we again        located Police Constable 243 Landers and            Police

Constable    2804 McFarlane,     together with other members of the          serial,     all

except for Police Constable 2967 Frost.




I would point out at this stage that the length of Penistone Road towards

the railway station was littered with beer cans and bottles.




At around 6 p.m. we were stood down to Claywheels Lane for standby there.

^just    a mass       of    people       trying    to get       in.      There were            no stewards            by ths

 turnstiles,          just 2 or          possibly 3 P o l i c e m a n on horesfaack trying,                           in

 vain to sort          the     crowd      into queues.

 I knew where          I w a n t e d to go as         I went      to the         identical             semi final          at

 Hillsborough          last year          it was    extremely          difficult,             though,        to get        to

 the    turnstiles,          because       of the huge          crowds       outside.               I got    into     the

 ground thro u g h a Gate,                Gate C,     1 beleive,           w h i c h was a l r e a d y         open whe n

 Once    I got       into    the    ground,       I simply hea d e d for                the main tunnel               under

 the West       Stand,       because       so m any     people        e n t e r e d the       gate wit h me,            I was

 swept along          thro u g h the       tunnels      there was          no    way you             could turn around,

 and go back          out.      I d i d n ’t see any P o l i c e m a n           or S t e w a r d s         by the

 entrance       to the       tunnel.

 I m a n a g e d to force my way              thro u g h the      crowd along with my                       brother

          , and at about             14-55 hrs        took      up a position,                m a r k e d at Nu m b e r         1

 on the       grid    in the S up p o r t e r s Quest i onnnaire                 (Q/                 ).     The    crush

 was    so bad at this             time    that    I c o u l d n ’t move my arms.                     Pe o p l e were

 shouting       for    the     crowd to get         back and          I saw some          people           collaspe.

 Minutes after             this,   Peter     B E A RD S L E Y   hit    the      crossbar            for the Liv e r p o o l

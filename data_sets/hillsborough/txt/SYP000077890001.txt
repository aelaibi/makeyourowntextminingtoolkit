at approximately 11.15 am (1115).        This time there was a slow trickle

of supporters making their way to the ground.          They were

well behaved and in good humour.        However,   several of them were

asking where the nearest pub was that was open.          I can remember a

group of approximately eight youths who were walking to the ground,

return past me because they had been told that a pub further up

Halifax Rd was open.    Eventually as the game drew closer the amount of

pedestrians making their way to the ground increased.           Again they were

in good humour and were causing no problems.

I can remember coaches approaching the ground and I was present with

PC GIMLEY and PC EDWARDS when they were directed to Claywheels

Ln for parking.     These buses were checked by PC ONLEY to verify they

were Liverpool supporters and, again,       these too were in good humour.

Eventually somewhere between 1.45 (1345) and 2.00 pm (1400)          the

Claywheels Ln was full and coaches were then directed along

Penistone Rd N to Halifax Rd for parking.          I can remember saying to

myself, as it got after 2.00 pm (1400),       that the supportes    "are

going to be rushing to get to the ground."          I can remember a coach

being directed to Halifax Rd as late as 2.40         (1440).   At this time the

supporters were in large numbers, most of them running towards the

ground,   some drinking from beer cans and I thought to myself,        'fancy

having to have a drink like this and leaving it so late to get into

the ground.*    Although a lot of the crowd ran past me,        they were not

causing any public order    problems,    but just seemed to be in a rush to

get to the ground before kick-off.        I was amazed to find so many

people arriving so late and one of my recollections was of a car

pulling up on Penistone Rd N at the Piszahut with five occupants,

obviously Liverpool supporters,    intending to abandon their vehicle and

rush to the game.     I advised them to park their vehicle properly on

Halifax Rd,    this was about 2.50 pm (1450) and I was greeted with angry
                                                                                                       PAGE        3
                                                                                                       S2215

shouts of frustration from the occupants.                            At this time I can remember

hearing,    on the radio,    of some trouble inside the ground and I can

recollect liaising with Inspector lilLLETT on the Penistone Rd N

roundabout and asking wether or not our serial                                   should make his way to

the ground.     I had no idea what sort of trouble was occurri n g .

Inspector lilLLETT was then informed that all serials should make their

way to the ground and I can recollect going up Penistone Rd N and

informing my serial of this.          We attended at the Leppings Ln end of

the ground where I saw a large group of police officers,                                        some on

horses and a small group of supporters who were venting their feelings

at not being allowed to get into the ground.

I can remember a call was made for an ambulance on the radio,                                         and I

thought that some serious        public disorder was occuring inside the

ground. We were    originally      told toform                   a   cordon around the              gates     to

             officer gave mouth to mouth whilst I performed heart massage.                     The

                 icer who gave mouth to mouth stated it was no use he was dead and

^   /        at this time I can remember a supporter at the back of me saying,                       “Get

        • him to breathe".          I d o n ’t know why,   but I told my colleague that we

             should try again.       I knew he was dead,         but I seemed to want to be

             trying to do something.         I then left him on the ground and went to the ,

             fence at the front.        I can rentem berya supp^rtf/ trying to rip the

             fence away and I assisted in i-rying to pu/j/ 1/ne fence away

             with him.      Eventually there was sufficient          i(op«f and I assisted in

             other officers     passing the dead bodies and injured people through the

             gap in the fence.

             I was feeling sick at the time.           Eventually when all t h e ^ o d i e s    had

             been passed through I went back through the gate and ter tjsw rear of

             Leppings Ln where      I saw approximately twelve dead b(^l4g/ laid on the

             of the wall,     on his back,     complaining of back and stomach injuries.                   I

             placed my jacket over him         and spoke with him and tried to keep him

             conscious.      He was eventually taken by ambulance and I think he would

             have been okay,                                                        ^

             I can then remember being told to go to the s^ack                j£ejjfdry|s Ln stand

             where I formed a cordon so that Liverpool             supporte/yieaviyig the stand

             could be ushered through one gate out of view of the bodies.                     I can

             still hear the chants of being called a murderer by several of the

             supporters     leaving the ground.       I di d n ’t know how to respond but

             felt quite angry as I did         not know what had happened.          Eventaully when

             the crowds dispersed what         was left of my serial was returned to the               N

             stand for a debrief.

            Eventually I retired from duty at 8.00 pm (2000) at Mexborough.

       ■*   Having now had time to think about it,       I am not surprised about the

             build up of supporters outside the Leppings Ln stand.          It was   clear to

            me that people were arriving too late for the game and were rushing

             past me as late as 2.50 pm (1450)      to get to the ground.      Some of them

            seemed hell bent on getting to the ground as quick as possible and on

            reflection that seemed to be the only thing on their minds at that

            time.      I can say that they were not shouting and although in a rush

            were not disorderly.

very sur pr is ed to find t^at                      there was a large ijiass of people                      outs id e

moved      closer       to the           turnstiles,       I was       being    s qu a sh e d a g ai ns t   people

It took me about                ten to f ifteen m in utes                to get     to the turnstiles,              due

to the huge            numbers           of   people    trying     to gXt       ifl the g round at          once.        I

t hr o ug h     into the ground.                 I didn't see any gates                  other    than the

t ur ns ti le s      open as         I went      through.        Once     on the      other side         I was     free

      move about.              It was a con si de r ab l e             relief    to get     in.      I then went
        s An
to frhe tunnel           and stood by the side of                       it for a few m in ut es and had a

been V o        aNJleague m a t c h at this              g round before          so I knew w here           to go.

k now this        because       the    payers      had    come onto       the    pitch to have a kick

a r ou n d before        the   gamers tarted.^sl           d i d n ’t think at the time              of taking

up my m atch viewing              point     that x he      pen was       u nd ul y f u l l .    I have      been

in a lot of crowds and this                   crowd at this            time didn't        bother me.



However,         as time       neared kick      off the       pen was f il ling          up c o n s i d e r a b l y ,

so m uch so that           I d uc ke d under        the    barrier and m o ve d forward.

Eventually         by kicE?* off time         I was       so t i gh t ly p a c k e d a g ai ns t other

people      that     I c o u l d n ’t move.        My arms were          pinned up a ga i ns t my           chest

and    I w a s n ’t free to move.             The only m o v e m e n t         I did have was            that   of

the    crowd - as the            crowd moved,          so did     I.



As    I was      being    crushed       I felt a 1a r g e ^s u rg e       of    peop 1 e frb*^ behind

which       pushed me even further              forward.          This    o cc ur re d at the xS^me of

game    kltxk off.



I remember as            I was    being     crushed       I recall       seeing a man who            I

r eg ularly see at football                matches,        who was       stan di ng a p p r o x i m a t e i y 3

m et r es    in front      of me.        He was     s c re am in g for help.           I w o u ld describe

this man as white,               about 40 years           old,   5 * 1 0 tall,      very slim built,

with    bushy unkempt            ca rr ot -g in ge r     hair.     1 know h e ’s not from L i ve rp oo l

because        I have s po ke n to him before.                   He had a gaunt          e x pr e s s i o n on his

face.       He    is very       pale    in c om pl ex io n and thin faced.                I c a n ’t remember

what    he was wearing,               but the only thing           I can say,         is that w h e n       I

n or ma lly see him at ma tc he s             he w ears a L iv er po ol           FC kagool        type anorak,



As    I ?got push ed Ka nd        crushed forwards            I became a wa re         that     I was

s ta n di ng     on top of^ K e o p I e     who had fallen under                foot.      I lost sight           of

the    bloke       I have    just d es c r i b e d and a l t h o u g h         I cannot      be def i n a t e , I

think     he was        tra mp le d on too.             I know that since             this t r ag e dy has

o cc ur r e d     I have    never     seen him again,             w h i ch    is very unusual.            I think

that     he died        in the    pen.

I became aware             of the gatfe open             in the       p erimeter      fence and      tried to

make my way to it , \ I               saw that          there was a P o l i c e m a n at        the gate who

was    pulling        people outN^f             the    crush.     I saw that          people were        climbing

I sat down and had a fag for a few mi n ut e s                               then   I got up and w a l ked

                                                                                                              and

           X                                                                                    I d o n ’t know

d o n ’t know the          number.         We then d ec id ed to see                if we   could help

anyone.           So we then      ran b ehind the half way                    line w hi ch was       being

P o l i c e d a nd    ripped an a d v e r t i s i n g       board from the side of the                   pitch and

ran back up to the L e p p i n g s Ln end of the                         pitch.

     I w o ul d describe        this    boy as aged between             10-14 years of age,              white,

            tal 1 , slim build,        short    hair,       I c a n ’t remember what        colour       it was,

Ja   but     it was straight.           He was w ea ri ng a dark            g reen s we at s hi r t     type    top

     w ith    long sleeves with a r o u n d - n e c k .           He also wore         blue stone w as h

         carried h i m , together w it h my others mates,                    to ttie^ roffrn under the

     been     conscious,     but he remaine d           lifeless.         I thought      he was       dead.



     As we erft^red a room             I saw Pch| i cemen and stew ar ds who              took     the board

     w i th the bo,y o i

     e verywhere,        lying on boards w it h their               faces    covered.       This      scene

     reariy upset me and             I began tx, cry,          as did                    I know                went

     a p p e a r e d deas& vor was     injured.        I had     lost all      track    of time and

         e n t u al ly myself                   and            left the grou nd via the N o r th

     a nd    let my mum know that           I was alright.             I then    returned to the van at

     the Fox Pub.          I had     tq wait there a long time because we c o u l d n ’t find

     two of the blokes,            who had t r a v el l ed to the game w it h us.                  So    I s ta ye d

     w ith    the others while                        and                       went    back   to the ground

           returned to the van to go home.



           We    left S h e f f i e l d at about 6pm              <1800)



           I feel        that this       incaNi^nt occ ur re d because              fans \w er e      not s t op p ed by

           P o li ce     prior    to getting a n y w he re           near   the g r o u n d ,, to see       if they had a

           ticket or not.              I have       been to other m at ches              where    the P o li c e   have

           e re ct ed       barricades       streets      before      the g ro un d a nd        if you d i d n ’t have a

           ticket you didn't                get    near the ground,



           Also,       I feel     thaK j f        there h a d n ’t been a perimeter               fence     the t ra ge dy

O?*">V t'0'^q u 1dn^t'^have o c c u r r e d ^ ^ h e            e m e r g en c y gates    in the fence are

           i na&qquate         to deal w ith an e m e rg e nc y situation.                      Also,    once at     the

           gate      there     is a wall          that you have to          climb       in order      to get    out of the

           gate.        This was       impossible w hen we were                being      crushed because of the

           sheer weight           of   people       behind you.



           I also think           that      the P olice        didn't    realise what was             happening.           I

           think that when they were                     lined up along          the half way           line,   that       they

           were       prepared more          to deal      w ith a riot        rather      than helping          injured

           peo p i e .

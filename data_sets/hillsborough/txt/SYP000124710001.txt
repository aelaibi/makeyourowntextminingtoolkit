G18

 G52

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?



 G53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED7

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 I THOUGHT THE PLACING OF OFFICERS IN CORDON ON THE PITCH WHOLLY APPROPRIATE.

 FOR 2 REASONS SEGREGATION OF OPPOSING FANS WHILST THERE WAS A PROBLEM

 ON THE FIELD AND FOR ACCESS FOR THE EMERGENCY SERVICES TO ACCESS THE FIELD

 WITH VEHICLES ETC OF WHICH ONLY 2 AMBULANCES CAME ON THE PITCH.

 IN HINDSIGHT THE POLICE WERE SLOW TO REACT BUT IN FAIRNESS THEY PROBABLY

 DIDN’T KNOW THE SEVERITY OF THE SITUATION.



 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS;

 I WENT TO THE SAME GAME   LAST YEAR AND TOOK UP A POSITION IN PEN 3 /BEHIND THE

 GO A L , IN OVER 10 YEARS OF FOOTBALL SUPPORTING IT IS THE WORST CRO^QD CRUSH I

 HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED I WAS CONCERNED FOR MY SAFETY SUCH WAS THE/CRUSH,BECUASE

 OF THIS EXPERIENCE I HAD DECIDED TO AVOID THOSE PENS THIS YEAR AND STAND IN

 THE W TERRACE.    LAST YEAR AT HALF TIME BECAUSE OF THE SEVERE CRUSH I TRIED TO

 GET OUT OF THE TERRACING BY SEVERAL MEANS.

 1) MY POINT OF ACCESS WHICH WAS THE OPEN GATE AT THE BACK OF THE TERRACING

 BETWEEN PEN 2 AND 3.
                                                                              PAGE    ?
                                                                              GSL2576

2) VIA,THE CENTRE TUNNEL WHICH WAS CROWDED SEVERAL FEET INTO THE TUNNEL AND

WAS IMPOSSIBLE AND (2) BY TRYING TO CLIMB UP INTO THE W STAND WITH ASSISTANCE

FROM PEOPLE IN THE STAND BUT THE POLICE WERE STOPPING THAT.         I WAS UNABLE TO

 GET OUT OF THE TERRACING LAST YEAR HOWEVER I TRIED.

 THE LAYOUT OF THE REAR OF THE GROUND AT LEPPINGS LN END IS APPAULING.        THERE

 ARE NO READILY VISIBLE SIGNS TO INDICATE DIRECTIONS TO TERRACING AND SEATS

PARTICULARLY THE TERRACING THE TUNNEL STANDS OUT AS A NATURAL ENTRANCE POINT

AS YOU CAME THROUGH THE TURNSTILE.

 THE LONGTITUDINAL   RAILINGS SEGREGATING THE PENS IN THE TERRACING RESTRICTED

ESCAPE AND IS NOT REQUIRED.

A - o c a t i o n of TICKETS FOR LIVERPOOL FANS WAS REALLY IN APPROPRIATE.

THE POLICE CONTROL BOX TO THE SIDE OF THE TERRACING SHOULD HAVE COMMUNICATED

TO THE OFFICER OUTSIDE WHO TOOK THE DECISION TO OPEN THE GATES, THE OVER

CROWDING    OF THE TERRACING IN PENS 3 & 4 IN ORDER THAT THE ACCESS TUNNEL TO

THOSE PENS COULD HAVE BEEN CLOSED PRIOR TO THOSE GATES BEING OPENED.

 I THINK THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A CHECKING SYSTEM TO ENSURE PEOPLE APPROACHING

THE GROUND HAD TICKETS AND THOSE THAT DIDN’T TURNED AWAY I SAY THIS BECAUSE

 I AM AWARE THAT MANY PEOPLE ARRIVED WITHOUT TICKETS I WAS ASKED SEVERAL TIMES

 IF THERE WERE "ANY SPARES” .

 ^ M   AWARE OF THE HELPLINE TEL NO AND THE SERVICE OFFERED.

A FRIEND WHO ACCOMPANIED ME TO THE SEMI-FINAL LAST YEAR AND HAD BEEN PUT OFF

WATCHING FOOTBALL BECAUSE OF THE CRUSH HE IS:

                 TEL :

 "HE PEOPLE WHO I TRAVELLED OR WATCHED THE GAME WITH MY MOTHER;                  AND

             ARE EXPECTING THE POLICE TO CONTACT THEM                 DID PHONE THE

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 "A    F .A . AND POLICE DECISION TO ALLOjC ATE/I.EPP INGS LANE STAND TO LIVERPOOL

 TOTALLY WRONG.

 OUTSIDE THE GROUND THE POLICE SEEMED TO HAVE GIVEN UP IN CONTROLLING THE

 IT WOULD HAVE MADE THE SITUATION WORSE.

 I FEEL THAT THE POLICE WERE INEPT AT DEALING jm i TH THE SITUATION.    THEY WERE

 SLOW TO REACT,   IT SEEMED TO TAKE THEM A LQfNG TIME FOR THEM TO OPEN THE GATES

 AT THE FRONT,    IT WAS THE FANS wiiO TOOj/THE INITIATIVE AND STARTED MAKING

 STRETCHERS FROM ADVERTISING B O A R D S./WHEN POLICE DID REACT THERE SEEMED A LOT

 STANDING, DOING NOTHING.    I DIoUjOT SEE ONE STEWARD.



 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 ^'HINK   IT IS HIGH TIME THE OFFICIALS STARTED TO TREAT FANS LIKE HUMAN BEINGS

 AND TOOK DOWN THE BARRIERS.     THERE WAS ONE INCIDENT WHERE SOME LIVERPOOL FANS

 RUN ACROSS THE PITCH AS THE FOREST FANS WERE TAUNTING THEM.      ONCE THE FOREST

 FANS REALISED THE SEVERITY OF IT THEY BECAME SUBDUED.

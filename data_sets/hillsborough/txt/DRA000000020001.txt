                    COMPLAINT AGAINST DEPUTY CHIEF CONSTABLE

The Police Authority at its meeting today considered a complaint against the
Deputy Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, Mr Peter Hayes, by Mr Trevor Hicks,
the father of two of the victims of the Hillsborough Disaster.
The complaint was "that it was totally improper of the Deputy Chief Constable
whilst the enquiry of Lord Justice Taylor was still hearing evidence and the
Police internal investigation was still taking place, to state publicly his
decision regarding further action against Chief Superintendent Duckenfield."
The Police Authority notes that the statement of the Deputy Chief Constable was
in response to a specific press enquiry. It is clear to them that the
intention of the Deputy Chief Constable was to indicate that it was his view
that no further action was required against Mr Duckenfield before the
enquiry findings were known. Regrettably it seems that Mr Hayes’statement was
interpreted as meaning more than he intended and the Authority regrets that this
caused further distress to Mr Hicks and his wife.
Mr Hayes has expressed to the Authority his deep regret that his actions may
have caused distress to anyone and stated his readiness to make such an apology
public.
On this basis the Authority has therefore decided to take no further action on
this complaint.

                                      END.


Note to Editors: The Police Authority is disciplinary body for senior officers
of the South Yorkshire Police Force such as the Deputy Chief Constable and is
required by law to investigate complaints made against those officers. If
however the conduct complained of is not such as would lead to a disciplinary
charge the Authority has the discretion not to investigate the complaint.

      SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE AUTHORITY BEGIN DETAILED EXAMINATION OF TAYLOR REPORT

    The South Yorkshire Police Authority today (Friday, 18 August) began the
    detailed line by line" examination of Lord Justice Taylor’s interim report on
    the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster that was promised by Sir Jack Layden JP,
    Chairman of the Authority, at its Special Meeting on-Monday, 14 August.
    The Chief Constable and his Deputy also reported on the actions the Force has
    taken so far and those which it plans to take under the leadership of the Deputy
    Chief Constable, Mr Peter Hayes, who has been nominated by the Chief Constable
    to liaise with the management of football clubs in accordance with a
    specific recommendation of the enquiry.
    Mr Hayes has formed an implementation team at Police HQ. This team has liaised
    with the football clubs, the local authorities and the other emergency services.
    They have concentrated on those of the report’s 43 recommendations, not all of
    which apply to the Police, which have to be achieved before the start of the
    1989/90 football season. All these targets have been met and the remaining
    matters are receiving urgent attention.
    Sir Jack Layden, Chairman of the Authority, said:
     We wholeheartedly welcome the steps which the Police are taking to minimise the
    possibility of a recurrence of the Hillsborough Disaster in South Yorkshire.
    These are the real lessons of Hillsborough. They aren’t to be found in a
    witchhunt^for scapegoats. The answers have to be found by ensuring that South
    Yorkshire s Police apply their full professionalism to making these measures
    based on the Taylor report work in all the football grounds in South Yorkshire
    at each and every match throughout the season.
    The Chief Constable will be reporting on this to the Police Authority
    throughout the coming season."



                                           END.

             T H O R N E SUB D I V I S I O N A2,    ROSSINGTON



             On S a t u r d a y    15 April      1989,   I came on duty at 8 .0 0 a.m.                  at E d l i n g t o n

             P o l i c e Station,        Don c a s t e r and together w i t h other                officers,    was

              conveyed to D o n c a s t e r Police S t a t i o n           in a section Pol i c e vehicle.



             At 8.4 0 a.m.          I paraded      in the     car    park opposite D i visional

             H e a d q u a r t e r s and there met Police S e r g e a n t 2 627 A s h t o n who was                   in

             charge     of Serial         30.    Other members            of this Serial           were Police

             C o n s t a b l e 361 Kitson,       Police C o n s t a b l e 243 L a n d e r s, P o l i c e C o nstable

             D a w s o n and      consisted t o t a l l y of eight Police C o n s t a b l e s and a

             Sergeant.            The Serial     then t r a v e l l e d    in a m a r k e d Police         transit     van

             from D ivi s i o n a l     Headquarters        to S h e f f i e l d   in an e s c o r t e d    convoy.



             At about 9. 4 0 a.m.            we a r r i v e d at H i l l s b o r o u g h football       ground,       where
                                                                                                      PAGE
                                                                                                      R74

we were d e p l o y e d      into the N o r t h S t a n d   for briefing.           We were        then

g iven a packed            lunch w h i c h we    consumed whilst          in the stand.



At    11.15 a.m.       we took up out           p cn^^jDns^at       the roundabout         at   the

j u n c t i o n wit h L e p p i n g s Lane and P e nistone R o a d North,              outside      the Old

Owl Service Station.                 Our duties were        to keep rival         fans apart.             The

L i v erpo ol     suppo r t e r s a r r iving    from the West and the N o t t i n g h a m Forest

suppo r t e r s     coming    to the S p i o n Hop end.



C lose    to the ground          it was     fairly      quiet    to begin with,         but as

time a p p r o a c h e d more and more           fans    came to the ground.             I was

approached          by a number       of fans     during    this     time who were all             looking

^ m ^ ^ c k ^ t s ^to^buy.        In Serial       30,    there were two        people who had

personal        radios,      the Serial     Sergeant,       Police S e r g e a n t A s h t o n had one

al l o c a t e d to him at the ground and Po l i c e Con s t a b l e 243 Landers,                         who

is a C o m m u n i t y Constable,         had his w i t h him.          Police C o n s t a b l e    Landers

was    on duty only feet away from me whe n                      I heard a m e s s a g e    come over

the    radio that          there was    trouble at the Royal Public H ouse w h i c h                      is

near to the gr o u n d at the N o t t i n g h a m For e s t End.



F r o m where       I was    p o sitioned   I could see up from the               r o undabout        up the

road towards          the    railway station where              the Liverpool       s u p p o r t e r s were

arriving.           There was     by now a constant             stream of s u p p o r t e r s walking

from this d i r e c t i o n down towards             the ground.          At a point about

h a l f w a y up the hill        I could see that a large               number    of    poeple were

standing        in the      street   outside a public            house.     I do not know the

name     of   it,    but    I also   saw that all        the     coaches that were arriving

were   being        directed    to a parking are a near              to this     pub.



At about S . 00 p.m.           the flow of supp o r t e r s was           becoming more and more
                                                                                                            PAGE        3
                                                                                                            R74

on the edge of the forecourt                     of the Serv i c e Station.                   I became aware

of a group of a b o u t              12 to 15 L i verpool          supporters who were                beginning

to argue w i t h 2 N o t t i n g h a m Fo r e s t          fans.     I a p p r o a c h e d the       group and

told both parties                  to move on.      A l t h o u h h the a t m o s p h e r e    between the

rival      fans was hostile,             there was         no trouble and e v e ryone                else had

m o v e d away.         P o l i c e Co n s t a b l e L a n d e r s and Police C o n s t a b l e K i t s o n at

this time            had gone       inside the service          station to try and sort                     out a

vehicle w h i c h had been parked on the forecourt with o u t                                  permission.



Th r o u g h o u t    the    later    part of the morn i n g         I saw a number             of fans

walk i n g about            carrying    cans of alcohol            and    I indeed      informed          several

of them that            there was a good           chance     they would not be a l l o w e d                into

the gr ound           if they were       drunk.       As    the time got nearer                to the kick

off time         I saw fans          drinking    from      cans of beer one after                the o t h e r ,

as    if to be trying               to drink    them all,       so they didn't            have       to   leave

them outside            the gr o u n d when they went              in.     There were          still      fans

enq u i r i n g about         spare    tickets at this          time.



At about 2.5 0              p.m.    I noted and     indeed      commented to Police C o n s t a b l e

J^itson that there were                 still    a ^anrge^rmro^r of l^^ej^gool                   fans heading

towards        the ground.            At one    point      there were       soMman^that

them     could wal k          on the    pavement and they had to spill                        onto    the    road.



At about 3 . 0 0            p.m.    the Serial     g a t h e r e d on the     corner      of the j u n c t i o n

  'eppings Lane and P e n i s t o n e Road.                 We were       going to go          into Phase         two

of our duties w h i c h was              to be on standby,               but we jTeard over a radio

that     there was a problem at the                   turn s t i l e s at the L e p p i n g s Lane End,



Over     the     radio       I could hear a lot of s uooorters                   sinqinq and a Police

O f f i c e r ’s voice w h i c h was saying             that a large          number      of fans were

                                                                                                                               R74

             outside    the gro u n d        pushing                                                     .     I then ^ a r d

             someone    shouting         over the                                                        the



             this    request was turned down*                        I then h e a r d someone                saying     that

             people at the front               of the         crush were           g^tiUjrv^^n^ured and that ^ r n e ^ f

             the gates was          fa^^ort^nj^^dama^e^.                 I then heard that                it was going          to be

             n e c e s s a r y to open the gate               in order        to    relieve the           pressure at the

             front.    I ■ U T ^ n h e ^ j ^ ^ U T ^ ^ j j d ^ r ^ |^ ^ ^ ^ ^ n |>(U T ^ j a | t e .



             After    a f e w s eco n d s       I h eard that all a v a i l a b l e officers were                         to

             a t t e n d on the track ar o u n d the side                     of the        pitch,       at w h i c h we started

             to make     our w a y to the L e p pings Lane End.                             I never       heard anyth i n g

             else    on the     radio after            that,       but w h e n we got to the L e p p i n g s Lane

             end turnstiles,            I heard that a m b u l a n c e s had been requested.                              We^ere^

             told    to form a        cordon outside               the g r o u n d.         At    this time we had no

             idea what had h a p p e n e d            inside.          There were           still       a number      of fans

             outside,     some      of them drinking,                  som e of them had tickers w h i c h

             they     showed to us and a s k e d if they                         could go         in.



             An ambulance         then a r r i v e d and s t o p p e d just                 inside       the gate.        I then

             saw a y o u t h being          carried out            of the ground              to the ambulance.                I saw

             the a m b u l a n c e m a n trying          to    r esuscitate           him,       but they then just             left

             him and went         back      to get another y o u t h who                    I saw w ith a resuscitator

       ( A   on his face.           We were all            then told to go                into the Ground.               As we
[rtf         walked    past     the ambulance,                I could see the y o u t h inside,                    he    looked

             as   if he was       dead.

number of fans also who were walk i n g about,                           swearing     and shouting at

us and P o l i c e O f f i c e r s who were a l r e a d y       in the ground.               I saw one fan

pushing a P o l i c e m a n about and shouting,                 "IT'S YOUR F U C K I N G FAULT".

As we neared to the            tunnel        which   leads     onto the terracing              other      fans

w h i c h were     coming    out    of the g r o u n d s h o u t e d at us,         it's too       late now

a n d started swearing.



As    I entered onto the            terracing        I saw that         there was s e v ^ ^ ^ J j m n d x e ^

people milling         about           the    jDit^ch.    I then jjna^de my ^ a y                  the ^ T U : h

via one of the         perimeter        fence gates,          I think       it was    number 4.           I

then saw p t e o ^ ^ ^ L y ^ n g ^ n    the grass        near to the goal.              As    I ente r e d

onto the pitch         I ran behind the goal               to where         I saw    people

bo^yj“j^cmt t h r o u g h a hole         in the       fence    otVU d    the   pitch.        F u r t h e r along

I then saw a large            number     of bodies        piled up on top of e a ch o t h e r .                   I

could not say how m a n y there was as                    legs and a r m s w e r e all           tang l e d

up.     I then saw that a man who was                    conscious was          trying       to free

himself      from the bodies.            So along w i t h another              officer who had

a r r i v e d w i t h a pair of step           ladders,       I climbed up the fence and                  leant

over the top Of the            fence.          Although       I could reach the hands                of the

man,   I could not get a grip                  of him and he        could not move as he was up

to his thighs         in the       bodies,     the weight       of w h i c h held him fast.                   I

then climed down the               fence and star t e d to assist w i t h making                    the hole

in the fence         larger.



As fans      pulled at       it from the        inside,       myself and a senior officer who

had a w hite       band on his hat,            kicked at       it from the outside.                 On

getting      the    hole    larger     I helped to        carry a fan from the terracing

onto   the    pitch.        He was     passed to us by fans who were                    on the

terracing.

I saw several           police    officers on the terracing                    behind the goal who

were    being     pushed about and hit                by some fans but            it was not       possible

to hear what was           said.       The bodies        I saw piled up were all                  just

be^arrH^UTe^goa^J^o^JjTj^LjHJ^j3i^

 tand and they w e r e all              right at the          front     of the terracing,            right

under the top of the              fence.



The y o u t h who       I had    been passed,          I he l p e d    carry to the Side of the

left    goal    post,     but    there was       no    room to        put    him down so w h i l s t      three

others    held him        I helped to take the                goal     net down w h i c h made more

room.      I then went          back to the hole           in the       fence where         I a s s i s t e d to

carry a n o t h e r male y o u t h on to the              pitch.        He was     passed to me by

fans    from the terracing.               The y o u t h was motionless,               but    very w a r m and

was    blueish     in colour.           On finding a space to                 lay him down m y s e l f and

anot h e r Po l i c e    officer       started to try and              revive him.          I searched       for

a pulse     but    could not       find one.           He a p p e a r e d to be dead.           Someone

then    came and took           over    from us.        I think        it was an a m b u l a n c e man.            I

was then a sked by a w o m a n Police C o n s t a b l e                 to try and find some

oxygen for a person she was                 resuscitating,              so I found a medical

person who was going around.                     All    the    time     I could see         people,      fans

and officers alike,              trying    to resu s c i t t e        people,     some     injured     people

who    began to breathe again,              were       being    sick,        others were       just being

covered up by clothing                 because    there was           no more to be done for them.



All    the time     people were          running a bout         shouting and          crying,      trying       to

find    persons they had           lost.      I was      then a p p r o a c h e d by a ma n who had

lost his young           son so    I told him w here            the     injured w o u l d      be taken

an d   pointed out w h e r e       to go    in order          to find out more             information.            I

then saw that a           large    part of the Liv e r p o o l              s u pporters    b egan to surge

towards     the N o t t i n g h a m Forest       suppo r t e r s who had bee n t a u n t i n g them,
  .                                                                                    PAGE
                                                                                                                            R74

              so    I went      to the      centre      of the       pitch w here        I met other m e m b e r s          from

              Serial      30.      We then formed a line ac r o s s                    the    pitch and         s t o p p e d any

              further Liv e r p o o l         fans    from going         towards        the kop.         We stayed         in the

              centre of the            pitch until            about 5 . 1 5   p.m.      when,      in company w ith

              P olice S e r g e a n t Ashton,           we     returned to the           roundabout          on P e nistone

              R o a d North.



              Whi l s t   in the       centre of the            pitch     I saw several            scuffles        broke out

              between the fans              in the seated a r e a an d             I saw Police O f f i c e r s

              removing       persons        from the seated areas                 to    prevent any further

              trouble.          Once     outside the ground              I never        saw any further             trouble and

              the Liverpool            fans all        left the area.



              At about 6 . 2 0         p.m.     in our Serial,           we went        to the Roa d Traf f i c

              Department         building        near to the ground w here we were                         given

              refreshments.



              At about 7 . 1 0         p.m.    we    received        i n f o r m a t i o n to stand down so we

              r eturned to our T r a n s i t            van and        r e t urned to D o ncaster a r r i v i n g

              at E d l i n g t o n Pol i c e S t a t i o n at about 7 . 5 0             p.m.       At 8 . 0 0    p.m.    I went

              off duty and          r e t urned to my home address.



              I have      policed at H i l l s b o r o u g h on one other                    o c c asion w h e n S h e f f i e l d

              Wednesday         played N e w c a s t l e U n i t e d     in the        league.        I did not Police at

              the      location      I was at        on this day,          but    I was       on the other          end of

              Le p p i n g s Lane      near    to a parade           of shops,         where     the awa y supporters

              w ere arriving.             T here was          very   little      trouble on this day despite a

              large turnout            of N e w c a s t l e    fans.

                    Media coverage of the Hillsborough debate

I attach cuttings from local media - Merseyside and Sheffield - on the debate. They
are positive pieces stressing that the Home Secretary has not closed the door on an
inquiry until he h as considered everything in detail.

The local broadcast media in Merseyside are covering Hillsborough heavily. The
slant of their bulletins h as been that the Home Secretary is sympathetic to the
families. They are also running with the line that it may be that there is no new
evidence.

Nationally, Sky have been covering the story briefly a s well, stressing the
sympathetic sta n ce that the Home Secretary took. Cuttings from the late editions of
national new spapers, along the sa m e lines, are also attached.

I anticipate there will be further coverage today in the regional media - cuttings will
be forwarded to you a s soon a s they are available.

Hillsboro’
pledge 7
MICHAEL Howard last night
told grieving Hillsborough
relatives he is considerlnga
new Inquiry into the tragedy.
   The Home Secretaiy made
a personal Commons pledge
to examine claims that a
cover-up had kept crucial
evidence from the official     '
report into the 1989 disaster.
   The move follows the        ;
 recent Granada TV
 dram^-rdocumentary into the
deaths of 96 Liverpool fans at
 Sheffield Wednesday's
 Hillsborough ground.
   Families argue there is
 enough new evidence to
 change the coroner's verdict
of accidental death.

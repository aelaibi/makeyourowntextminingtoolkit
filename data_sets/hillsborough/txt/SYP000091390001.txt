        The    coach left S o uthport at about                half    past e leven         (1130)     on the

        morning.         We were     late    leaving,       the    coach should have           left at about

        quarter        to e leven    (1045).        I cant    remember      the    route we         took or any

        o bvious delays.            The    coach did stop at the            end of the m ot or wa y

        before going          into S he f f i e l d and we were met           by a Police           escort.        We

        were    then e sc or te d towards           the ground by a motor               cyclist.       The

        driver        parked the     coach on the m ain            road that      leads     to the ground.

        There were a number               of other       coaches    parked on the m ain             road w hi ch was

        on a hill,        about a ten minute walk                 to the ground.          We did not get a

        Po li ce escort        to the ground,            we all    made   our own way.          We did not get

        any Police        dire ct io ns     on the way to the ground,                  but we didn't         need

        knew the w ay to the ground.

        O n the w ay to the          ground,       I saw some s upporters              d r inking    cans of beer

        in the street,           but there w a s n ’t any drunkenness.                   I did not see any

        f ighting       or any other        sort    of disorder.

        The    coach had been         parked at some          time    between twenty          past two

        (1420)        and half    past two        (1430).     It tcurf< about          ten minu te s    to walk             to

        time    between half         past two       ( 1 4 3 0 )y^ind twenty to three           (1440).

        The turnstile area was               packed y ith p e o p l e , right back            to the outer

        iron gates.           There were n' t any queues,             it was      chaos.      There was           one

        B ec au s e    of the amount        of people       in front      of the turnstiles,            we walked

        and we thought we              could go under            the            rail and join the       front of the

        crowd going           into    the       extreme    right       hand turnstile.              I saw a number

 ^MTfcV the ground. They did                     this by standVng                 on other    peoples    shoulders.             To

         y right,        there was a blue               concertina gate which                  I now know to be gate

        ’C*.      There were          a number of supporters                       standing    in front         of the gate

        and some were           banging         on the gate.              There was a P o l i c e m a n standing by

        the gate.            Just    before       1 went undar            the metal        hand rail,       I saw gate

        *C*     being opened.           It was onlyy^Sar t ial ly opened and                        I saw a few

        saw     it being slam me d sh<Jt /                At about              the same   time,    there       seemed to be

        a movement           towards    the       left hand t urnstiles                  by the    crowd.        I think    the

        mounted        policeman may have got                  people            to move towards      the       left.     The

        m o ve me nt    enabled me          to slip u n de rn ea th the hand                  rail and get to the

        right hand turnstile.                     I went straight                 through the turnstile and

        handed my ticket              in to the         turnstile               operator and was given the stub

        portion back.                                      had entered the ground just                      in front of

        me.      I d o n ’t know how                                            and                   lot into the

        ground,        but not       long after         going through the turnstiles,                       we met up

        w ith                 and               agai n.

        I did not see any stewards                      outside        the turnstiles.

        We entered the ground at about                         ten to three              (1450).

        Once     inside       the    ground,        I did not see any figrtting or any other                             sort

               and w a t c h e d the m at ch from behind the goals.                     I thought     the tunnel           was

               the only w ay to the terraces and we w a n t e d to w a tc h the m a tc h from

               be hi nd the goals.            We bought a programme and had a slow walk                       towards

               the    tunnel.     We stop pe d somewhere           near    to the       tunnel    and were         talking

               This was    the same gate. tMft            I had earlier seen open,                gate    ’C ’ .     The

               people were       coming       thrcrugh quite      quic kl y and we thought            that we had

               better    get    into    the    tunnel,    before    the    cwowd.

               I did not a ct u a l l y see the gate             beina/opened.           We all went along            the

               tunnel    towards       the terracing.        We y n a d a free         passage along       the

               tunnel.     I did not see any P o l i c e m e n or stewards at the                     entrance        to_

               the    tunnel    or a ny where     irreyffe it.

               At the end of the tunnel,               we went     to the       right,      into what     I now know

               as    pen three.        We entered the       pen at some          time    between ten to three

               (1450)    and five       to three       (1455).

               Once    inside    pen three,       we made our way across                to the    right.      It was

               packed    inside the       pen and       it was a struggle            to get through the             crowd.

               We took up a position a couple of feet                      in front of a crush barrier,

               the barrier at the             rear of the    pen,       towards      pen number     two.      We were

               about    ten to twelve          feet    from the wall       at the       rear of the       pen and about

               the same    distance a ga in from the dividing                    fence between        pen three and

               pen two.

               I have m ar k e d this         position on the separate               grid    plan using      the Figure

               one. -We were      packed       in at    position one,          but   it w a s n ’t a crush.          We


5o£ I          took up position one at about five                   to three         (1455).      Fro m   position

W 3            saw the    players       line up for       the kick       off and then the. m at ch started.

the    rear of the          pen.     T h / push was       ob vi ou sl y     in response       to the kick

off.     The       push carried/us           forwards     down the terracing                           and       I

were    pushed down t he /t erraces               towards       the      right.     I think                  and

             were    carried       towards      the    left.       The    push carried us towards                     the

next    crush barrier           down the        pen and we ended up behind                 it.     I have

m a r k e d this     position behind the               crush barrier          using the Figure           one A

<1A).        The    pressure was        increasing all             the time and we didn't want                        to

get t rapped behind the                crush barrier.              We wa nt ed to get u n d e r n e a t h             it,

but    it was d ifficult             because     of the      intense       pressure.       It was after a

couple of m inu te s           that myself and                     m a n a g e d to slide u nd er n e a t h the

crush barrier.              I had a lot of d if fi c u l t y standing                 up a g a i n after

sliding       under     the barrier          because     of the       pressure.        I m a n a g e d to

s tr a i g h t e n myself     up a g ai n and         look down at the            pitch again.          It was

at this       time     that    I felt       crushed     in by the         crowd and unable         to move.

A number        of other       people       slid u nd er n e a t h that       crush barrier        and this

resulted        in us being          pushed forwards           again.       We were     pushed down

an ot he r    couple of steps and ended up in a position w h i c h was about

four    or five steps           down from the middle                crush barrier and four

people away from the dividing                     fence betw ee n pen three and                  pen two,

w h i c h was      to our     right.        I have m ar k e d this         position on the separate

grid    plan using          the Figure        two.     The     game was       still    in progress and by

now there were a lot of                 people        screaming       desperately.         The screams

were    d i rected towards            the Police        on / h e    track at the front of the                        pen,

I saw people who were                 trying     to c j^Lmb over          the front     perimeter        fence

being    pushed back           in by the Rpl/ce.               Amongst all         the screaming,            I

remember a lad standing                 to my      left who was screaming               desperately.                  The

lad was s l ig ht ly          in front       of me and to my             left,    on the next step

down    I could see           that    his    face was white           he sounded desperate.                  As

I remember,          his s creams were           concerning         his    chest and that         he    couldn't

breath.         That    lad was still           screaming as          I was      looking   towards       the

            think m a in l y because            very few people w ou ld have seen                it.       I do not

            I could no       longer see          him.       There was     onlyibne      place    he    could have

            gone,    and that was straight                  down to the g/ound.          I never saw him a gain

            after    that.        The    lad who had been standjfng to my                  left a nd on the next

r/          step down was a w hite male and had mot^ley coloured hair w h i c h was                                      cut

            short above          the ears.        F ro m where     th/s    lad was s t anding          in relation to

            me,   I did not get a look at his fac^l,                      I could only see the              right side

            of his face,          but he did not wear /lasses                and was       clean shaven.            He was

            a ged about      twenty years.            The    lacy was about       six feet      in height and of

            m e d i u m build.         He wore a light /coloured top,                possibly a        *T* shirt or

            sweatshirt.           I think       it h a X r/d colouring as well,               possibly some sort

            of pattern,          but    I'm not too sure,          and blue denim jeans.                  I did not see

            his footwear.              I w o ul d estimate      that     I realised this         lad had stopped

            scre am in g and       could no       longer see him,          at about      ten past         three.

            (1510).        For    the next       ten minutes       or so,    I was      still    unable       to move.

            I w an t e d to get out,            but    it was    impossible.         I realised that             the gate

            at the front of the                pen was      now open and     people      towards       the front of

            the   pen were making a mad dash towards                       it.     By about      twamty       past three

            (1520)    s ufficient         people       had got out of the           pen and t Were was a bit

            more space       in the       pen.        I went over       to the di v,id ing^Pence wit h             pentwo

            and stood there             for about       ten minutes w it h my faqjf to the fence,

            helping     other      people out of the             pen.     I did this by cupping my hands

        together,        m aking a foot       lift.        At abos^T three             thirty        (1530),          I climbed

        over   the fence and went             into    pen twif.            People were             going    through the

        gate   in the      front    fence and ont\> JChe track                      next to the           pitch.        I went

        thro ug ht he     gate and onto        the track at about                    twenty to four              (1540).           By

        now a lot of        people     had a l r ea dy been             carried away on hoardings,                       but

        s up po rt ers we re still         ripping hoardi ngs down.                      I a ss i s t e d       to rip

        hoardings        down from     in front of the S ou th S t a p ^ r ^ n e a r                     to the Lap pi ng s

        Lane   end.       I did not a c t u a l l y assist              in c ^ f r y n q j ^ n y    of the dead or

        injured      people on any hoardings.                  At some stage               I went         to the area of

        the dug outs        in the S outh Stand and                 collected buckets                    of water.           I

        then went around the area               in front           of L ep pings Lane and gave                        people

        water where        required.        I had     previously seen ball                     boys       doing       this.        I

        did not have any other              involvement w it h any dead or                          injured       people.I

        a r ou n d quarter      past   three     (1515).           We    returned to the                 coach and

        even tu al ly found out           from one of the organisers                       that                 had

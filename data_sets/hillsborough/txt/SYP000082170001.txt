                At 7.30 am Saturday 15th April                1989 I paraded at Claywheels Lane

                Pa lies 0-fficer Sheffield where I checked the serviceability of the

                Mobile Cell Unit and at about 8,15 am proceeded to the ground                                  in

                company with PC          1185 KRAJtWSKl.



                On arrival at the ground a change of vehicles                            took place and our

                duties for that day was to supervise the detention of a/ rast e d                               pers a n

                within the mobile             cell unit.     The unit was one of twj/ of the ground

                both of which were parked under the North Stand.                                '/he units were

course         of    their       detention          some      required             the    facility           of a      bucket           to

urinate.             One    prisoner          was    a    diabetic         and          during       the     t i me    he was

d e t a i ned       requi red a n           injection         of    insuIin.




To    the      r i g h t of      our     ceil      unit    was      the    St       J o h ns     Ambulance            F irsl       Hid

Part      where       injured          persons       began arr ivin g                   shortly       before          the    kick        oft

and      in    l a rge     numbers          after    the      games       had       started.            These         persons        were

It    soon      became        apparent          that      a major         incident             had    occured          and     I

established              that     there       was    to    be      no    change          in our       duties          concerning

Johns         Ambulance          were       distressed          by w h a t         they       were    seeing.            These       young

cadets         were      seated        in our       vehicle         r e - a s s u r e d , comforted                and      praised

for      the    good work           they were            doing,         thus       removing          them      from      the       First

We    were      then       given       the    custody         of    a small             boy who       had      become        seperates

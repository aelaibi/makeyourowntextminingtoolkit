           Lord Ferrers has asked me to thank you for your letter of 4 May to
           Douglas Hogg with which you enclosed one from Mr          of
                                      Gloucestershire who makes observations
           on the Hillsborough tragedy.

           As you know an enquiry under the Chairmanship of Lord Justice
           Taylor has been formed to investigate the events of Hillsborough
           and to make recommendations. I have therefore forwarded yours and
           your constituent's correspondence to Mr R Whalley, Secretary to the
           enquiry who can be contacted at this address. You will appreciate
           that it would be improper for Lord Ferrers to make observations at
           present.

Dear Sirs

ADLINGTON -V- DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

We confirm our conversation with Mr Croston of 7 January and confirm our
attendance at your offices on 14 January at 9.30am.

We also thank you for agreeing to provide us in any event with a copy of any
document that is requested by HFSG when they attend at your offices and since
undoubtedly Winckworth Sherwood will require similar papers you will prepare copies
for them as well. For completeness we are copying this letter to them.

Yours faithfully

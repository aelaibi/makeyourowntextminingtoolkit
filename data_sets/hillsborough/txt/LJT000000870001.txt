Sir,

Although I have no form al qualifications in a technic al subje ct, as I am a
railway enthusias t I scruti nise Her M aje sty's Railway In spectora te "Acciden t
Reports" in g re a t detail. I do not buy every one, but with well over AO in my
priv a te library I consider myself a highly "experienced layman" in such
m a tte rs.(I have learned both bad and good signal box working p r a c tic e s through
these books, without needing to visit a signal cabin!)

My principal diversion away from my labours though is the watching and
r e fe re e in g of association football m atc hes. I had never been as f a r north as
Sheffield for a gam e, but I just knew t h a t I would be buying a copy of your
R eport into the d is aste r which occurred th e r e , when it cam e out. This because
the dis as te r had wider implications for th e gam e, o th e r than the ev en ts on the
fa te d 15th. April 1989!

From a "book review" angle I must w holehea rtedly c o n g r a tu la te you on your
noble task. Whilst d iffe re n t in many r e s p e c t s from a railway collision, th e re
were two f e a t u re s in th e Hillsborough D isas ter which have paralells in a
railway calam ity. Firstly t h e r e was the "cause & e f f e c t " as pect; and Secondly
th e r e had to be examined the pote ntial failings of persons in authority: in this
cas e Police and Club Officials; r a t h e r than train drivers and signalmen!

Both Interim and Final Reports are now in my library and I just extend the debt
of g r a t t i t u d e owed to you by all d e c e n t football supporters for your
rec om mending t h a t Identity Cards NOT be im ple m ente d, a f t e r the enabling
legislation had reached th e s t a t u t e book. To r e f e r to a railway m a tte r : did you
see the falability of London Underground's au t o m a t ic t i c k e t g ates as evidence
t h a t electronic access to prem ises or facilitie s was not reliable enough?(Of
course London Underground has a generally steady passenger flow through the
day - exce pting peak hours - whereas a football ground has a single 20 minute
spell when it can be like bedlam a t the turnstiles!) It is splendid t h a t you were
able to impose sanity and good-sense upon this p a r tic u la r m a t t e r , and flew
valiantly in the face of Government policy. Additionally football supporte rs
everyw here owe thanks for the f a c t t h a t you granted audience to th e ir
re p r e s e n t a ti v e body the F.S.A..

I would suspect t h a t th e r e are only two sections of the football community who
would ta ke exception to your recom mendations:

1        Firstly your c o m m e n t t h a t F o re s t fans would have died if THEY had
         had the Leppings Lane end of the ground: im putes t h a t Fore st fans are
         arr o g an t la te c o m m e r s , like th e ir Liverpool co u n terp arts . Curiously this
         s eem s to c o n t ra d ic t another sect io n of the Interim Report where you
         confirm t h a t the majority of F o re s t supporte rs were punctual in th e ir
         arrival a t Hillsborough.

2        Third and Fourth Division Clubs' officials: I find it incredible t h a t you
         see fit to impose a l l - s e a t e r conditions on grounds which ably c a t e r for
         a meagre fo u r-fig u re a t te n d a n c e . For c om fort reasons I always buy a
         s e a t t i c k e t a t Barclays League grounds, let alone any s a f e ty provisions
         t h a t pertain on my watching a game; BUT when I am a t dear, but
         humble, Welling United I nearly always stand as I feel t h a t I can not be
         unsafe a t a low a t te n d a n c e m a tch (l,0 0 0 or less). Welling's playing
         s tre n g th makes them a t le ast possible candidate s for promotion from
         the G.M. Vauxhall Conference into the 4th. Division of the Barclays
         League!!!(Thus an " a ll - s e a t" dictum has ram ifica tions throughout the
         game.)

The re is an o th er c a terg o ry of citizen who I am sure feels agrieved by the
c o n t e n ts (or lack of it) of your Hillsborough Reports:

3       The non-footballing resid ents of Sheffield's 6th. Postal Distric t: I can
        only imagine t h a t the demands of t a c t prevailed, BUT why did you not
        roundly condemn the actio ns of th e "phalanx" of Liverpool supporters?
        They both: directly (urinating in gardens) and en-passant(by weight of
        numbers) ruined the lives for th e residents of the local s t r e e t s near
        Hillsborough Stadium. I find it quite incredible t h a t the feelings of
        Sheffield resid ents have never once been considered as something of
        value in this equation. You seem to have bent over backwards to
        p la c a te the feelings which ran very high on Merseyside. Even though I
        am a football fan I to tally conce de t h a t res idents near grounds have a
        right to some semblance of order.

Because I am a r e f e r e e I would claim technic al neutrality, but I do w rite
a r ti c le s for the                        London Branch supporte rs ' n e w s le t te r
("I                   f)Â« The enclosed is my reac tion to Hillsborough. 'S6 1SW' is
th e Hillsborough p o s tal-co d e as I could not think of a ti tl e for my monograph.
It was not w r itte n as a '                Report" I would hasten to s t a t e , but it was
w ritt e n from the heart.

A f t e r Heysel, I found it no surprise t h a t deaths occurred on a subsequent
occasion when Liverpool F.C. were on th e ir travels. Having been to w hat I now
think of as d ear Hillsborough I am now angered t h a t poor Wednesday's ruination
(and rellegat io n a t the end of 1989/90) means t h a t the rampaging red
Merseyside army has claimed "life 96"! Of course Liverpool F.C. have never
once conce eded th e ir responsibility as regards the actio ns of th e ir supporters. I
do not count the a t te n d a n c e of players a t funerals as conceeding responsibility.
The very consumation of Merseyside arroganc e is t h a t Liverpool supporte rs can
behave exactly as they like: using the t e a m ' s success as " c a r te blanche".

I r e g r e t th e length of this l e t t e r , but one of the charm s of life in this noble
realm is man's freedom to voice his views to all and sundry a t a sta ndard postal
ra te ! I rem ain ,

                                   Yours Faithfully,

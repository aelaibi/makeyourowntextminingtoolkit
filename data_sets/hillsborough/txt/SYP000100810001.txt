Police Constable 2988




On Saturday 15 April 1989 I rang on duty at 9 .00a.m.                           My instructions were to be

at the ground at 9.^5 a.m. for a briefing for the semi final.                                All the officers

on     duty    were    seated      in    the   north      stand    where   they   were      given    a    full     and

comprehensive         briefing      by    Chief    Superintendent          Duckenfield      and     other    senior

officers.        I have no doubt that at the end of the briefing each officer knew what

was    expected of him and what his specific                       duties were. The senior officers                 in

charge of any specific task or part of the ground were introduced and stood up in

order that they could be recognised.                      I was on Serial 1, which was supervised by

PS Chapman.

After the briefing packed meals were handed out and consumed.                               My specific duties

were    to patrol          the perimeter track         from     11.15   a.m.   to kick off then take up a

position on the perimeter track for the duration of the game.                                 My point was in

front of the north stand at its junction with the Spion Kop.                                  I patrolled the

perimeter track until 12.30 p.m. when I was released by PS Chapman to have a                                       hot

meal.         Following      this I returned        to    the     perimeter    track until        1.45 p.m.       when

because of the large volume of prisoners being taken to the police room,                                      I was

instructed by police control to                   'man'    the door to the police room allowing only

those    with prisoners or other legitimate                       access into the room.           Most    of those

arrested were for offences involving drunkenness and many of them were violent.

By 2.30 pm the drivers of the prison buses were reporting that the cells on the

buses    were       full    and   that   they were        having    to put     two to a cell.        I was       still

manning       the    door    to   the police      room     shortly      after the kick off,          when    it    was
ROBERT BURKINSHAW                                 -2 -                                                      R290




reported    that    there was        a pitch      invasion and that all available officers were

asked to go on to the pitch.                  I made my way to the pitch but on the way met PS

Paul    Morton     who    had   just     come     from    the    pitch.         He   was visibly       shocked   and

shouting urgently for an ambulance that was parked near to the pitch between the

north stand and the Kop, to follow him onto the pitch.                               He stated that there were

at least twelve people dead at that time. He was met with disbelief.                                     He got the

ambulance to follow him on to the pitch and slowly towards the Leppings Lane end

of the ground.

I saw that there were between 200 to 400 people on the pitch and that people were

being crushed behind the wire fences                      at the rear of the Leppings Lane goal.                    I

went to the gate at the rear of the goal                        and saw that although the gate was open,

there    were     about    4    or   5     bodies,      obviously     dead,      laying in       the   gateway    and

blocking it.        I climbed onto the wall at the side of the gate and shouted to the

people     to    stop    pushing     and    try    to    move    back.      A    number     of    supporters     were

screaming and spitting, obviously full of hate for the police and shouting that

it was     the    fault of the         police.     I     did not    at    that       time   understand what      they

meant.     Efforts were made           to remove         the bodies       without      success until one youth

braced his arms against the uprights of the gate in an effort to relieve some of

the pressure, with his help it was possible to remove all of the bodies and some

children        from the compound.           From that moment         it was just a matter of ensuring

that people came out            in a more orderly way without falling.

An unconsious person            was passed through to me and together with another person I

carried him onto the pitch where I tried to revive him with mouth to mouth and

chest massage,       after a few minutes          an ambulance driver tried a resuscitator on

him but stated that the man was              dead.   The man was mid 20's, slim build,               clean

shaven.     No other desc.

I tried to revive at least two other persons, without success. When the extent of

the    disaster     was   becoming     apparent, I       told   police    control    on    at   least   two

occasions    that    a temporary mortuary          was   required and      asked    them   to suggest      a

venue.      The   gymnasium      was   designated     and   bodies   and    injured    were     taken   and

directed    there,    as were     any medical      personnel     who volunteered       their    services.

More   and more      Liverpool    supporters      were   by this time      on the     pitch.    The Notts

Forest supporters for reasons best known to themselves, had started jeering. This

inflamed the Liverpool supporters who started running towards                         them.     They were

held back by a line of police officers across the pitch.                       I saw one officer in a

state of shock being ranted and raved at by a supporter without apparently seeing

or hearing him. At this stage              in the proceedings,       the fire brigade arrived and

assisted with the removal of the dead and injured.

When   it became apparent         that most of the dead and injured had been released,                     I

assisted with       carrying a stretcher to the gymnasium.                  By this    time,    emergency

medical supplies had just arrived and I assisted in carrying them to the top end

of the     gym where      the   injured    were   being attended        to by volunteer doctors and

other medical staff.            I assisted a doctor in emptying and sorting the crates and

handing     out   medical       supplies   where     required.    All    the   injured     persons      were

eventually transferred to hospital via a fleet of ambulances and I tied up all

the remaining medical supplies             into the crates in which they came and left them

piled up in the centre of the gym.

Most    of    the    bodies     had been brought to the gymnasium by this time and when a

number       of body bags arrived I assisted in placing some of                                  thebodies in them.

During       the rest of the evening Iobtained supplies of body tags,                                rubber gloves,

reports      and     any other         items   required       and assisted with         the    reception of more

bodies       which      had    earlier     been   taken       to hospital      but which      had    been     dead on

arrival.

Numerous senior CID officers attended as did the police surgeon/pathologist Prof

Usher and his team.              Numerous councillors, Social Workers, Salvation Army workers

and other personnel were in attendance to minister to the needs of the relatives.

The    local      councillor          Irvine   Patnick        later   attended    with     Colin      Moynahan,      the

minister of sport, and the Chief Constable.

Chief    Superintendent           Mole     arrived     quite early        on   in the    proceedings              to coÂ­

ordinate and supervise the                 police officers              dealing with             the situation.

An area was later screened                 off in the top part of the gym where relatives who had

made a       preliminary identification               of a body from Polaroid photos of the deceased

taken        earlier,         could    view    the particular         body     with   a view          to    positively

identifying them. CID officers were mainly concerned with this.

I ceased duty at about 1.30 am Sunday 16th April.

I feel       that    the manner         in which      the     incident was dealt with can only reflect

credit       on   the    police.       Many    officers       were    deeply   shocked     but      those   who    could

detach themselves              from the emotional side of it acted in a professional manner

and carried out their duties the best they could under difficult circumstances.

The fans arrived too late and a lot of them under the influence of drink, to get

into the ground in time for the kick off.

I have attended most of the matches at the SWFC since arriving in the division.

     G27.   DID YOU ASSIST ANY OF THE INJURED?              (BRIEFLY EXPLAIN)



                 NO - I WAS ONLY ONCE AWARE OF BEING CLOSE TO AN INJURED

     PERSON WHEN I SAW A SUPPORTER WITH A LEG INJURY I THINK BEING ASSISTED

     OUT THROUGH THE T U N N E L .         THEY PUT HIM TO LEAN UP AGAINST FENCING BY

     THE TURNSTILES.

            HAVE YOU ANY COMMENT TO MAKE ABOUT THE ACTIONS OF THE POLICE

            OFFICERS AT THE TIME OF THE DISASTER?



                 SO FAR AS OUTSIDE THE GROUND IS CONCERNED THE CROWD

     MANAGEMENT WHEN I WAS THERE TRYING TO GET IN AROUND 1430 WAS LACKING -

     THINGS WERE EASIER LATER BUT AS I HAVE RECORDED IN MY SUBMISSIONS I

CONCLUDE THAT BY THEN THE GATES HAD BEEN OPENED.



<330.   HAVE YOU ANY COMMENT TO MAKE ABOUT THE ACTIONS OF ANY OF THE

        MATCH STEWARDS AT THE TIME OF THE DISASTER?



            I PRESUME IT WAS THEIR PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY TO DIRECT FANS

AND MONITOR CROWD DISTRIBUTION.       THEY SEEMED DECIDEDLY ABSENT WHEN I

WENT IN AND THROUGH THE TUNNEL.       I FEEL THIS IS PARTICULARLY

SIGNIFICANT WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WHO WERE STILL TO

COME IN AFTER     I HAD GAINED ENTRANCE.



<331.   HAVE YOU ANY COMMENT TO MAKE ABOUT THE ACTIONS OF ANY OTHER

        PERSON IN AUTHORITY AT THE TIME OF THE DISASTER?

Q35.     IF YOU ATTENDED LAST YEARS SIMILAR MATCH WAS THERE ANYTHING

         SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT WHICH YOU THINK IS A CONTRIBUTORY FACTOR

         TO THIS DISASTER?    (BRIEFLY EXPLAIN)



               THE CROWD BUILD-UP AND SUPERVISION AT LEPPINGS LN END       I

HAVE COVERED THIS WITHIN THIS      QUESTIONNAIRE AND WITHIN   MY SUBMISSION.



Q36.      HAVE YOU ANY COMMENT TO MAKE ON THE DISTRIBUTION    OF FANS IN   THE

         STANDING AREA TO THE FRONT OF THE WEST STAND?



               I HAVE MADE THIS IN BOTH THIS QUESTIONNAIRE AND IN MY

S U B M IS SIO N.



Q37„     DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS ON THE WAY THIS DISASTER WAS CONTROLLED

         FOLLOWING THE RECOGNITION OF THE INCIDENT HAPPENING?



               I WOULD MAKE A POINT ABOUT MY PERCEPTION OF LARGE NUMBERS OF

POLICE SEEMINGLY UNDIRECTED.       MUCH OF THE RESCUE WORK SEEMED TO BE

IMPROMTO AND IMPROVISED BY THE FANS,



               I HAVE WONDERED SINCE WHETHER   IT WAS A MISTAKE TO GIVE NO

INFORMATION GOING OUT OVER THE PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM,,



(338. IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL

       TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?



               I HAVE PREPARED A SUBMISSION WHICH ACCOMPANIES THIS.    I CAME        '

OUT OF THE TUNNEL A LITTLE AFTER THE GAME HAD BEEN STOPPED,       PEOPLE

WERE! GOING OUT AND UNIFORMED OFFICERS WERE GOING IN - IT WAS BUSY BUT

PASSABLE     ■- I SAW NO BODIES OR INJURED IN THE TUNNEL EXCEPT THE INJURED

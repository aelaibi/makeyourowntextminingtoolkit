        seeing         three m ou n t e d       pari ice.

        We    joined this             group     of    people and other                people     came from behind.                    The

        mass     co nst a n t l y      grew and           I was       pushed to the          left    to by gate           ’8 ’ .      11

        was a hot day and w i t h the                       crush of         people      it was      getting           quite

        t urnstiles.             I saw       p jfb p le    being       lifted out        of the      crowd and           climbing

        up out         of the \ cr qdfd to get              out of the          crush.       I was    glad to see              people

        climbin g        up as        it,    in theory,           m e a n t / t h e r e was more      room for           the    rest

        of u s .        I saw that           half a dozen              people    or more        climbing       up.

        It was         obvious        that     people             «    in some     d i s c o m f o r t and    I saw one

        person a c t u al ly           being      sick.       He       couldn't move and was                 simply sick over

        the     people a r ou nd him.

        I saw a nother               person who           had fain t e d       in yne       crowd,    he was a teenager

        and    he was        lifted out           over      the       crowd,

        E v e n t u a l l y at about 2 . 5 5              (1455)       it h£gan       to ease and a police                    off icer

        sent me         round to w here              gate         s w^s      open and        I wa l k e d    into       the    ground.

        This     was     the first           time     l/had agren to H i l l s b o r o u g h and during                       the

        crush      I got split              up fjjram my friends.                Inside       the ground           1

        did     not     notice an[y s/gns                 or stewards and             the    only obvia^us way

        to the         terraces        wWs    t hr o u g h the tunnel.                I went along           the       tunnel and

        although         it was        quite      crowded         I was able          to walk J c h e whole             length

        w it h o u t    stopping.

        At the         end of the           tunnel        I saw a lad sitting                on a wall.            I know him by

        sight as         coming        from F o r m b y and he e n c o u r a g e d me and others                         to go the

        The    pen became             packed and           in a short          time     I was    pushed quite             close       to

                didn't         go back     or ease         off.

                The    crowds         in the Pen        became         so tight that                 I   c o u l d n ’t move my arms          and

                at    times      c o u l d n ’t move my head.                   I can        remember       one    person a c t u a l l y

                was    resting a g ai ns t           the    people           in front         of him.        The    side of his           face

                that     I could see            turned      purple and              it a p p e a r e d     that his       legs had gave

                way.         I think      this     person        probably           died.          All a r o u n d rne people were

                s c re am i n g whilst          others      were       silent.              Others were          trying    to     climb out.

                I was        i m m e d iately    behind         the    gate w h i c h         leads       onto the       pitch and        the

                •First time           I noti c e d     it was when              I became a ware             of    it being        open and

                police         officers       trying       to    pull        people         out.

                A fter a con s i d e r a b l e         time      the       pressure          began to       come from behind and

                as    people         became     free    they were             helping         others       who were       in

                c rowd       thinned      I saw a number of people                           p r o b a b l y £0 or so,         on the

                gr o u n d     in the v i c i ni ty y n         the        b a r r i e r.     From       their    colour       it was

                obvious         that    some     of / h e m were            dead.

                I e ve nt u a l l y got         to the     back of the                pen and stood there                 for a time

                looking         for my friends and                then        I went         through^he           side    gate     into Pen

                2.     This      must have         been getting               towards 3 . 3 o p m          (1330).        I then went

'did not         seek medical        a ttention.           I did not see any property                taken from

the      injured      or dead.       The    only        thing   I did see was a person on the

terrace          picking    up coins and          i m m e d i a t e 1y other suppo r t e r s       rounded on

him and          I saw a    punch thrown.               A police       officer      intervened and took

that       person     on to the       pitch.       This     h a p p e n e d muc h     later on whe n things

were       being     tidied up.                             /

O th e r    o bs er va ti on s    I w o u ld make w'</r&        that     the m o u n t e d officers           o u t s i de

the      gr o u n d had    lost    control      of Jthe s i t u a t i o n and a p p e a r e d to      lose

their       tempers.        When     f’Vans were trying           to    climb    out of the        pens       the

police       officers were           i n kt i    1y      trying    to stop them and also trying                      to

s top      the    fans    climbing       up out of the          pens     into    the    stand above.

The      police      officers      be h i n d the goals,          2 or 3 officers,            very   soon

became aware             of the    s er io us n e s s    of the s i t u a t i o n and were screaming

for      people      to move      back.      Other       officers who        came      over   to help them

o b v i o us ly    thought       they were      dealing w ith a           pitch       invasion and d i d n ’t

i mm ed ia t e l y    respond      to the situation.

W h en     I was     outside      the ground        the crush          reached a stage where              I    knew

the gates          had to be opened to              prevent       injuries       or    loss   to   life.         With

hindsight          this may       have    been a bad d e c i s i o n       to open the gate,              but more

police       presence an d o rg a n i s a t i o n on the a p p r o a c h              to the turnstiles

could       have     p r evented    the while           situation.

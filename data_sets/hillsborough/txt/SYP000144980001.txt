    Q46. DO YOU HAVE AMY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE DISASTER

           WAS HANDLED AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?



    I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE LACK OF C OHM IN ICAT' ION CONCERNING WHAT HAD

    H A P P E N E D ? TO THE GROUND STAFF

    AS FAR AS THE POLICE ARE CONCERNED,     THEY APPEARED TO USE LARGE


3
    NUMBERS TO KEEP THE RIVAL FANS APART, WHICH DID NOT APPEAR NECESSARY,

    WHEN   I FEEL THEY COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER USED TO ASSIST THE DEAD &

    INJURED,




    047=   FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE AS A TURNSTILE OPERATOR,   IS THERE

           ANYTHING SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS MATCH WHICH

           IN YOUR OPINION MADE IT DIFFERENT FROM SIMILAR PREVIOUS

           MATCHES?




    APART FROM THE FACT THAT FANS SEEMED TO ARIVE A LOT LATER THAN USUAL

    AND THERE WERE MORE POLICE THAN I HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE NO.

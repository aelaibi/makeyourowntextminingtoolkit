  HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY INTERIM REPORT:     ADV A NC E COPIES

  I am grateful to Chief Superintendent Cornmill of HM Inspectorate
  at Sheffield for his help in arranging for advance copies of
  Lord Justice Taylor's interim report to be issued at 9.30 am at
  Sheffield to parties to the inquiry and to one or two other
  selected people on Friday 4 August.  I attach a list of the
  recipients of the advance copies with an indication against each
  of the number they are to be given.

  Th irty copies of the Interim Report will be ready for collection
  by the Chief Superintendent at 9 am on 4 August from
  W Harteley Seed, 154-160 West Street, Sheffield.   Three copies are
  spare - at present at l e a s t ) .

    I should be grateful if, after final confirmation later today that
   Ministers are content for publication to go ahead at 11 am on
   4 August, Mr Cornmill will arrange for a room at the Old Town Hall
   in Surrey Street, Sheffield to be made available to him for the
   purpose of issuing the advance copies.         As soon as this is
 ^ a r r a n g e d we should be given the room number so that the Inquiry
jj Team can let the would-be recipents know during the course of
" tomorrow, 3 August. The Secretary to the inquiry, Mr Whalley,
   advises that Mr Cornmill approach Mr Pat O'Neill at the City Hall
   to make the arrangements for a room and further suggests that
   Committee Room 4 would be one which would be familar to the
   parties to the inquiry.

  As to the handling of giving out advance copies, Mr Cornmill
  should be advised to convert the final copies he collects from
  W H arteley Seed into CFRs by tearing off the front covers and by
  affixing on to the lower half of the title page of each copy of
  the Report (ie the new cover) a gummed label.    Sufficient stocks
  of ready-gummed labels are also enclosed.   Mr Cornmill m a y as a
  precaution wis h to ask for recipients to sign for the copies.      We
  expect that most parties to the inquiry which employed solicitors
  will arrange for their copies to be collected by clerks from those
  firm.   At Annex B is a list of the parties and their legal
  representatives.   We expect that Dr Popper and Prof Usher will
  send someone from the Medico-Legal Centre at W a t e r y Lane and that
  Dr Nicholson will send someone from the Health and Safety
  Executive.   We will let you know of any further details of w h o m Mr
  Cornmill should expect, if they come to hand.

  I understand that you will arrange for Mr Cornmill to receive the
  enclosures by tomorrow morning.  I shall let you know as soon as
  possible when we have the Ministerial go-ahead for publication and
  for these arrangements.

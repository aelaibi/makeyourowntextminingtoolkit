Dear Miss Steel,
                         RELEASE OF POST-MORTEM REPORTS

    Thank you for your faxed letter of 6th June.

    Subject to the views of the Coroner, I do not myself see any objection to
the post-mortem reports being released to the bereaved families on a provisional
basis in the manner that you suggest.

    I have accordingly passed your request on to the Coroner, and he will no
doubt be in touch with you direct.

                                   Yours sincerely,




                                                      &4S-

Dear Sir,

I refer to the 1 tter from H.A. Coroner addressed to you and   'ted ^the siat May
with regard to t e question o£ releasing the Post Mortem repot

Counsel, Mr Hytn ir QC and Mr King, are briefed at the Inquiry Li bJhalf if the
bereaved and inj ired, the instructions coming from me and my [rm 6n behllf of
the Steering Confliittee of the Hillsborough Group of Solicitors

The Hillsborough Group of Solicitors (which infact is continue Ily {h*6wlrife in
number as more A r m s are instructed on behalf of bereaved and tnjured) currently
numbers 114 firnffi the majority of whom have supplied full deti tls of th^ names
and addresses oi their client^ and as new clients are added tc 1their particular
list given us d« jails so that’our records - although probably     few days* out -
are -pretty well ipto date.

There are three ^najor exceptions to this where firms at the mi fientha^e W r e l y
stated ''numerous clients" 50 jjlus clients or given one name pj is 46/BO nfore.

Therefore the i ormation as tar as the deceased are concerns^ irtay not bi 100%
accurate in tha some families who as far as I am aware have     ccKkuIt^d
Solicitors may   fact be client© of one of the firms who have] dvbh  me
incomplete info; ation.

With that Cavea1j I enclose herewith a copy.list of those victj fis wiiosfe f a m i l i e s
have consulted i Dlicltors who* are part of the Hillsborough So, ' i c i t b r s ' d ro u p .
As you will see there are 71 pf the 95 victims who fall into        iis categ&'y.
                                                                                             i
As far as some f the familie^e are concerned there has been a'Pdelay i n t h e i r s e e k in g
legal advice am four of the 'families concerned only consulted * S o l i c i t o r s w i t h i n
the last week o: ten days. Ijf and when I receive notice of S . i c i ^ o r e f e t i n g
for any familie currently no|t represented I will of course ll yoli k n b $ .

 The question of   'the provisional death certificates and the rej [b estl'^ '-lu rth er
 information was   made .at a conference with Counsel open to ai F S o i i c i t o r i i n th e
 Group and any c   ients of thoqe Solicitors.    We and Counsel    ire l&keiJ £o p u t
 forward that re   uest on their behalf.                                I ' : i: I -
                                                                       1 : I
 Whereas it is o course a matter for yourselves and the Coror !r i t may §sj a p p r o p r i a t e
 if he sees fit IO authorise Hjhe release of the post mortem re- Ftortd on a ' p r o v i s i o n a l
 basis to the be eaved families for this to be done through oi telV es if ^ r in ly
 because in some cases there 4re two separate firms instructe     .n r* e la ti6 n t o one
 individual wher for example !there may be two separate sets o|. D e fe n d a n ts .

in touch.

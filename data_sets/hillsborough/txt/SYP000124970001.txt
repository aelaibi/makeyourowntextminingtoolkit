 DON'T THINK THAT THEY WERE AWARE OF THE SERIOUSNESS OF SITUATION.

 2. POLICE OFFICERS WERE       USED TO FORM A CORDON ACROSS THE PITCH TO STOP ANY

 TROUBLE, AND EVEN POLICE DOGS WERE BROUGHT ONTO THE PITCH WHICH ONLY

  INSENSED THE SITUATION.

  IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

  1. THE CHOICE OF HILLSBOROUGH AS THE VENUE WAS WRONG, AND ONCE HILLSBOROUGH

 HAD BEEN CHOSEN LIVERPOOL SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE OTHER END.

 2. THERE ARE FEW TURNSTILES AT THE LEPPINGS LANE END TO COPE WITH A CROWD OF

 T^T     SIZE.   THE POLICE SHOULD HAVE GOT IN AMONGST THE CROWD TO FORM

 ORDERLY QUEUES.

 3.     THE GAME SHOULD HAVE BEEN DELAYED T O ^ O P   ANY PANIC IN THE CROWD TO GET IN

 TO THE GROUND FOR THE KICK OFF.                           j ~ T 7 y j\ j
 4.     THE PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM WAS A JOKE.    I COUtSDN’T HEAR ANY ANNOUNCEMENT

 MADE,

 5.     OUTSIDE THE TURNSTILES WERE POLICE OFFICERS, WHO WERE STANDING JUST ON THE

 OUTSKIRTS OF THE CROWD, THEY SEEMED AT A LOSS TO KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT

 THE CRUSH.

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT      U WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?                                    5*L     C          ,

 THE POLICE SHOULD"HAVE ORGANISED THE CROWD INTO QUEUES AT THE TURNSTILES.

 THINK THE DECISION TO O^EN THE GATES TO CUT THE CRUSH DOWN WAS STUPID; THE

 POLICE SHOULD HAVE CLOSED 56 MANNED THE PERIMETER GATES AND CONTROLLED THE

 SITUATION BETTER.     THERE WEREN’"T^BNOUGH POLICE AT THIS POINT OUTSIDE THE

 GROUND TO DO THIS.     THE POLICE WERE NON-EXISTENT,   IT WAS UTTER CHAOS AT THE

 TURNSTILES.

 ANNOUNCEMENTS COULD HAVE BEEN MADE TO TELL THE CROWD WHAT TO DO AND WHERE TO

 dQ     THERE WERE ABOUT 20-30 POLICEMEN INSIDE THE GROUND BY THE TURNSTILES.

 THEY WEREN’T DOING ANYTHING.     THEY COULD HAVE BEEN USED OUTSIDE BY THE

 TURNSTILES.

 OR THE INJURIES TO ANY

 THE POLICE RESPONSE WAS &E.RY SLOW - THEY JUST DIDN’T REM/T - THEY TREATED

 A LOUD SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 LOUD SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT.

 <352

 NO.


<319

 <353

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 aW     er       THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 IT WAS TERRIBLE - EVEN THEN WHEN THE GAME WAS STOPPED THE E£H*RASIS WAS

 STILL ON CROWD CONTROL & THE POLICE LINED UP ACROSS THj^FITCH, WHEN SOME

 OF THEM COULD HAVE HELPED THE FANS IN THE PEN S.              S9ME. POLICE DID GOOD

 WORK - BUT THERE WAS A LACK OF LEADERSHIP OR PyTCCTION TO HELP THOSE

 POLICEMEN AT THE IMMEDIATE SCENE.               IT SEEMEIVTHAT THE FANS WERE DOING

 EVERYTHING & USING THEIR INITIATIVE, AS OPPOSED TO THOSE IN POSITIONS OF

 AUTHORITY TAKING CONTROL OF THE SITUATION.

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO                THIS

 FIRSTLY I WOULD SAY THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF ANGER DIRECTED TOWARDS THE

 POLICE BECAUSE OF THEIR TOTAL LACK OF RESPONSE TO THE SITUATION - EVEN

 THOUGH I NEVER SAW ANY ATTACKS (PHYSICALLY) ON A POLICpmN.

 THE TOTAL LACK OF COMMUNICATION WAS VERY POOR - THEY COULD HAVE APPEALED

 FOR MEDICAL STAFF & KEPT THE FANS INFORMED AT THE SAME TIME.

 THOSE IN AUTHORITY HAVE FAILED TO RESPOND T O / m E           INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO

 THEM - LEADING UP TO THE MATCH - WITH TH^/AVAILAB ILIT y OF CAMERAS, THEY

 Q54

 I N H E R E ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 1) LAST YEAR WAS FAR BETTER ORGANISED, SUPPORTERS WERE ABLE TO/GET INTO

 THE GROUND EASIER THIS YEAR THERE WERE NO POLICE ON TURNSTILES OR STEWARD

 THE OTHER SIDE OF TURNSTILES.

 2) THE TICKET ALLOCATION WAS GROSSLY UNFAIR, LIVERPOOL SHOULD HAVE BEEN

 ALLOCATED THE SPION KOP OR IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN PLAYED AT OLD TRAFFORD IN THE

 FIRST PLACE.     I WOULD CRITICIZE THE F .A. ON THIS DECISION.
                          A--------------------
 3) THE PERSON WHO GAVE THE ORDER TO OPEN THE GATE OUTSIDE DIDN’T HAVE ANY

 CHOICE, THE SITUATION OUTSIDE THE GROUND WAS DESPERATE.
                                                                        PAGE   9

 4) I THINK THE KICK OFF SHOULD HAVE BEEN DELAYED (THEY DID SO IN THE REPLAY

 AT OLD TRAFFORD WITH NO PROBLEM).

     POLICEMEN COULD HAVE HELPED MORE INSTEAD OF BEING LINED UP ACROSS THE

 MIDDLE OF THE PITCH.     I THINK THEY WERE MORE WORRIED ABOUT A PITCH INVASION

 THAN THE SAFETY OF PEOPLE.

 034

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 WHEN I WAS OUTSIDE THE GROUND GETTING CRUSHED I WAS FORCED TO ASK A WOMAN IN A

 SHOP TO LET ME IN TO GET AWAY FROM THE CROWD.      WHEN I WAS INSIDE THE POLICE

 HORSE WAS BACKED INTO THE SHOP WINDOW.     WE GOT OUT AFTER THIS AND I CAME

 ^ p O S S TWO POLICEMEN CRUSHED AGAINST THE WALL NEAR   TO THE TURNSTILE AT A.

 I REMEMBER SAYING TO "TRY AND DELAY THE KICK-OFF."

 HE JUST PUT HIS ARMS UP SAYING WHAT COULD HE DO.

 I SAID, "YOU’D BETTER DO SOMETHING HERE,    IT'S GETTING   OUT OF ORDER."

 I REMEMBER HIM SAYING,    "I’VE LOST IT SCOUSE."

 I HEARD HIM SHOUTING OVER AND OVER INTO HIS RADIO,      HE WAS USING A CODE WITH

 THE NUMBER 28 IN IT BUT HE GOT NO REPLY.     HE GOT OUT AS FAST AS HE COULD.

 THE PROBLEM WASN'T THAT THERE WASN'T ENOUGH POLICEMEN THERE IT SEEMED THAT

 THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.     I THINK THEY WERE WAITING FOR ORDERS THAT JUST

 DIDN'T COME.                                                     5   ^      f

 IT WAS HARDLY ORGANISED THIS TIME.     I WENT LAST YEAR AND IT SEEMED TO BE MUCH

•1)   THE INITIATIVE WAS TAKEN BY THE SUPPORTERS.         THE POLICE ETC. WERE SLOW

TO
 1
   REACT ____
         TO THE SITUATION, EXCEPT FOR THE FEW WHO WERE RIGHT BY THE

FENCING.

2)    THE POLICE ON THE HALF WAY LINE SHOULD HAVE HELPED THE INJURED AFTER IT

BECAME EVIDENT THAT A SERIOUS INCIDENT WAS OCCUR ING AND NOT TROUBLE AMONGST

THE FANS

3)    THE POLICE DOGS CAME ONTO THE PITCH WHEN THERE WAS NO NEED.

Q54

IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

J ^ I C I A L INQUIRY?

1)     I THINK THIS TICKET ALLOCATION WAS WRONG THE AVERAGE HOME GATES

SHOULD HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED.           I THINK THE WAY THAT SUPPORTERS TRAVELLED WAS

IRRELEVANT TO THE ALLOCATION.

2)     THE POLICE SHOULD HAVE ORGANISED THE CROWDS INTO MORE ORDERLY QUEUES AND

NOT ALLOWED A GREAT MASS OF FANS TO CONGREGATE THUS AVOIDING THE NEED TO

OPEN ANY EXTRA GATES, OR EVEN GET THE GAME DELAYED TO ALLOW ALL THE

SUPPORTERS     TO GET IN AND AVOID THE PANIC JUST PRIOR TO THE KICK OFF.

3)     THERE   WAS A TOTAL LACK OF STEWARDS INSIDE OR OUTSIDE THE GROUND I

ONLY SAW ONE AND HE WAS AT THE ENTRANCE TO MY STAND.

4 ^    THE POLICE MAN POWER AT THE GROUND DID NOT SEEM TO BE USED EFFICIENTLY

AND IF IT HAD HAVE BEEN USED CORRECTLY A LOT OF THE PROBLEMS WOULD NOT

HAVE OCCURRED.           IT ONLY TOOK COMMON SENSE.

5)     THERE   WAS A LACK OF COMMUNICATION WITHIN     THE GROUND, THE PUBLIC

ADDRESS SYSTEM WAS NOT USED CORRECTLY.

6)     THROUGHOUT THE TIME OF THIS INCIDENT THE FANS WERE MAGNIFICENT, THEY

NEVER STOPPED HELPING THE EMERGENCY SERVICES.

7)     THE LOCALS AROUND THIS GROUND WERE SUPERB THEY HELPED IN EVERY WAY

POSSIBLE.

Mrs S STRINGER,


Kirkby,
Merseyside ,




          Madam,

REQUEST FOE THE RELEASE O F INFORMATION

I refer to your letter regarding your request for copies of statements in
connection with your son Paul.

The policy on the release of information is as follows

The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police invited the West. Midlands Police
back in April 1989 to undertake the investigation into the Hillsborough Disaster.
In fulfilling this investigatory role the West Midlands Police constitutionally
were acting as the agents of South Yorkshire Police.

 The policy on the release of information has variously been determined by Lord
 Justice Taylor, later the Director of Public Prosecutions (in conjunction with the
 "“d i c e Complaints Authority), and the C o n n e r . I n o w have to look to South



•
, -rkshire Police, as principals of the information, for the policy in responding
 l    your request.

Kz the present time the policy of South Yorkshire Police directed to me is not to
release any information to any party.  This is based on legal advice that has been
given which indicates that information should only be released on the order of a
court which could include that of the Coronet. •

I am sorry I cannot be any more helpful at the moment and as explained                                         at th*
pitsa-inc tinirt I. niubt decline your request.

Yours faithfully,

Dear Madam

Thank you for your letter w h i c h was received on 11 June 1991 asking for . ‘
certain material arising from the Hillsborough Investigation.      The position
is that South Yorkshire Police have adopted a policy based on le-gal advice
that at the present time m e ans that none of this type of material is released.

If there is any change in this policy I will write to you again.

     very sorry to learn of your sorrow arising from the tragedy and would
. Jend my deep sympathy at y o u r loss.

Yours faithfully

 l'naijk you for your letter o f the 5th instant, the contents of which I note.
  V
 I was told yet again by the Assistant Chief Constable of South Yorkshire that
 they were awaiting the ou t co m e of disciplinary proceedings before allowing
 release of client and w it n es s statements.

 As a decision has now b e en m a d e as to the individual officers who are to face
 these disciplinary procee in g s — simply Duckinfield and Murray - I have written
 yet again on the basis that no w whatever evidence they are going to use must be
 known and asking them to c o n f i r m that statements not specifically required-
 for these proceedings will be released.        I am copying that to  Peter Metcalfe
 of Hammond Suddards to try to get somemovement from that end.

 As soon as we have any news             I will let you know.

 As far as the Inquest v e r d i c t is concerned I know that families were extremely
 concerned over the ac ci d en t al death verdict.   This is understandable -and
  ^terlines the absence of a n y Coroner's verdict between that of accidental
 c-^^h and unlawful killing.        I note that in the real disaster the verdict
 last week was equally one o f accidental death.

 The points raised in your t h i r d paragraph were considered both by us and by
 Counsel instructed in c o n n e c t i o n with the Inquest and we did not consider
 that there was a realistic c ha n c e of success on judicial review.       The families
 Group - as is their right — h a v e taken further advice elsewhere and although
 I do not know the position it m a y be that judicial review proceedings are
 underway.

  If your client is a me mb e r o f the Hillsborough Families Group she would get more
  information through them t h a n I have on this particular point.

  I note that you are now h a n d l i n g this matter and we have am ended the records
  accordingly. •.

  Every good wish.     Yours s i n c e r e l y ,

            Dear Mrs Stringer

            Re: Hillsborough

            We now enclose copy letter we have received from Elizabeth Steel who is the
            solicitor heading the Hillsborough Steering Committee.    You will see that she
            has dealt with in that letter the position regarding disclosure of witness
            statements not relied^at the inquest/ which you have asked us to obtain. There
            is still an ongoing dispute regarding this with the Police.

            In relation to the question of judicial review, that is dealt with in the latter
            part of Miss Steel's letter. You will see that the Hillsborough families group
            have taken seperate legal advice and d f you are a member of that group, you may
            care to ascertain the position regarding the advice that they are pursuing
            regarding judicial review.

            Finally, you mentioned recently that you wished      to include as part of your
            claim, the legal costs which you had incurred in    relation to reprsentation at
            the inquest.   If you* will forward to me a receipt for this amount, we will
            endeavour to claim this back as part of your claim.

            Yours sincerely




            DAVID PHILLIPS & FAKT&ERS

 Mrs.          A .E . Williams,


 Merseyside,



 Dear Mrs. Williams,

 Further to my letter of the 4th February I have now had the
 opportunity of d i s cu ss ing your request with Dr. Popper.

It is apparent that the situation is not as simple as your letter
originally led me to believe.    The statements of Mr. Bruder and
WPC Martin were not tendered in evidence at the Inquest as such,
rather it was a case of the contents of the statements being referred
to when either the Pr es enting Officer or the d o c to r were questioned.
I do however accept that short extracts from Mr. Bruder's statement
were quoted in this manner.

As a matter of general principle I should say that I might not
accept that Rule 57 of the Coroners Rules 1984 therefore applied
to these statements.    However, havin g spoken b o t h w i t h Dr. Popper
and Chief Superintendent Mole (who is now in charge of the paper
wor k retained by Sou th Yorkshire Police) we feel that as you clearly
are still very anxious that an exception can be m ade in this case.
Accordingly I enclose copies of the statements of Mr. Bruder and
WPC Martin.   There is also a p h o t o c o p y of a fo r m completed by WPC
Martin and referred to in her statement.

So far as the photo gr ap hs are concerned itis not withi n my ability
to let you have copies and I have referred this to            Chief
Superintendent Mole.    He informs me that he w i l l supply you with copies
of the photographs reques te d subject only t o :confi rm ati on that the
copyright of those p h oto gr ap hs lies with the p o l i c e rather than with
individual news media.     Mr. Mole is in the proc es s of organising
photographs etc. for a large number of relatives and I am sure he
will ask you to be patient whilst he deals w i t h all requests.

I hope that provi si on of these documents will u l t i m a t e l y assist you
in coming to terms w i t h the terrible traaedy w h i c h has befallen
your life.


Yours s i nc er el y.

    Dear Ms

    Thank you for your letter which was responded to by the Chief Constable's
    Staff Officer, on the 13th November 1991-

    As indicated in the Staff Officer's letter we were awaiting legal advice,
    and I have to inform yo u that that advice directs us not to release any
    information until such time as all discipline matters have been finalised.
    You will no doubt be aware that discipline matters are still pending against
    one officer in South Y o r k s h i r e , and until such time as the outcome of that
    matter is determined, I am unfortunately unable to release any material.

     I can once again assure you that the photograph has not been forgotten,
     and I will make every effort to release it as soon as I am in a position
    Ito do so. .

    Yours sincerely,

Hr Philip Hammond




Dear Hr Hammond

REQUEST FOR STATEMENTS

Thank you for your letter of the 5 Hay 1992, I am sorry for the delay in
replying but I think that this has been explained to you over the telephone
by my staff.

Rule 57 of The Coroners Rules 1984 says that a Coroner, on application, shall
supply to a properly interested person (which obviously includes you) a copy
of any report of a post-mortem examination, or of any notes of evidence, or
of any document put in evidence at an Inquest.

I was, therefore, able to supply you with a copy of the Post-Hortem Report
without any difficulty.  However, it was necessary for me to ascertain
whether the statements that you refer to were "any document put in evidence
at an Inquest".  So far as I can ascertain this is not the case, it may be
that those witnesses gave evidence orally, but that is different to their
statements becoming a document put in evidence.

However much I would like to assist you, I am afraid that this means that I
do not personally have the power to release these statements to you.  So far
as I can see the power rests with the Chief Constable on whose behalf the
statements were taken.

A number of relatives have requested statements from the Police and I gather
that almost without exception the documents have been supplied.   I cannot say
whether this includes statements from Ambulance Service Personnel.

I have, therefore, referred your request to Chief Superintendent Brian Hole
who is the officer who is dealing with such requests.

Being acutely aware of the delay in dealing with your request, I have spoken
with Hr Hole this morning and he has assured me that he w i ll telephone you
this afternoon.  I have given him the number




                                      ---                      pont/d.

                            -   2 -




I am sorry if your request seems to be going around the houses but I am
placed in a situation whereby I cannot release documents that do not belong
to me unless there is a specific legal power for me to do so.

If I can be of further assistance please do not hesitate to contact me.




Yours sincerely

         Dear Mr Hammond

         HILLSBOROUGH INQUES"’
         REQUEST FOR STATEMENTS

         Thank you for your letter of the 11 May 1992.  I have given this matter a
         great deal of thought because I am most sympathetic to your request and
         would wish to assist you if I can do so within the terms of the statute that
         govern, my position.

         I should say that I have considerable difficulty in accepting the points set
         out in the second paragraph of your letter.   It is clear that the relevant
         statements were taken by or on behalf of the South Yorkshire Police for a
         number of purposes, but the prime purpose was for the criminal enquiry which
         resulted in papers being sent to the DPP.   I must maintain, therefore, that
         unless such statements fall within Rule 57 that they are the property of the
         Police and not mine to give away.  Thfere is a specific legal precedent on
         this point.

         However, whilst we may disagree about the law involved, I remain sympathetic
         to your perfectly understandable request to have sight of the statements.   I
         have, therefore, had further talks with the Police and have agreed to release
         the documents on the basis that Rule 57 either might apply or might well have
         applied in the more normal circumstances of an individual Inquest.

         Accordingly, I enclose the statements that you have asked for.  I hope that
         these will assist your family to come to terms with the tragedy which has
         befallen you.

         If I can be of further assistance, please let me know.

 Mr & Mrs E Spearitt


 RUNCORN
 Cheshire


 Dear Mr & Mrs Spearitt

 HILLSBOROUGH INQUEST

 Further to our recent telephone conversation I am writing to advise you of
 the up to date situation on your request for sight of various statements.

You are aware of the case of R v Hammersmith Coroner (exp Blair Peach) which
makes it clear that statements given to a Coroner by the Police for the ’
purpose of an Inquest remain in the ownership of the Police.  The Coroner has
no power to let other parties have sight of these documents unless they
subsequently fall under Rule 57 of The Coroners’ Rules.  Rule 57 entitles an
interested party to obtain from the Coroner a copy of "any document put in
evidence at an Inquest".  This.would normally mean a statement which was read
out to the Court as an agreed piece of evidence in the absence of the person
who made the statement.

The power to release the statements requested therefore lies with the South
Yorkshire Police and not with me.    The Police have taken the view that they
should not release statements witfftJtt£ the consent of the statement maker.     I
gather that in the vast majority of cases this permission has been given and
thus legal difficulties have been avoided.       Unfortunately the situation has
not been so straight forward in A d a m ’s case.                **

Dealing with each of the requests in turn:-

     a)       The statements   of former Special Constable               do not fall
              within Rule 57   but he has now given his consent ror tne release of the
              statements and   these should have been posted to you last Friday direct
              from the South   Yorkshire Police.

     b)       In the main the statements of Pc Harratt do not fall within Rule 57.
              This Officer gave oral evidence at the Inquest and it is quite plain
              therefore that Rule 57 cannot apply.  However, Pc Harratt’s statement
              of the 4 October 1989 was put to him on a number of occasions during
              his evidence and I take the view that either this statement was an
              exhibit or that it should fall within Rule 57. Accordingly I enclose a
              copy of that statement.  Unfortunately it will not be of very much use
              to you as this was the third statement taken from the Officer, the main
              factual evidence being contained in the two earlier documents.

                                                                         Cont/d


                                        Fax: (0742) 726247
                                        -   2 -



       At the present time Pc Harratt has not given his consent for the
       release of the other documents but I have to-day approached the Police
       again and asked that a Senior Officer speaks with Pc Harratt to see if
       there is any prospect of him giving consent.  I will let you know the
       result of this immediately it is communicated to me.

  c)   The statements of Ambulance Personnel do not come within Rule 57. Each
       of the three people involved have refused permission for the release of
       their statements.  I understand that this is a policy decision by all
       members of the South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service rather
       than in any way related just to Adam’s case.   I have asked that this
       decision be re-considered but without success.  I am not at all hopeful
       that any different result can be achieved but I have now been invited
       to speak again with the Solicitor representing the Ambulance Service
       and I will do this in the next two or three days.  I am not sure if any
       form of compromise can be worked out but as I am very sympathetic to
       your request I will certainly make efforts on your behalf.

I will continue with the various points mentioned above and will write.to you
again within the next ten days.


Yours sincerely

Dear Mrs Stringer

Hillsborough Inquest

Thank you for your recent letter.  I was sorry to learn that the      ..
solicitors acting for this office have not been in touch with you or your
legal advisers.  I have spoken to them again this morning, they have
confirmed that your request is being dealt with and that they will write
to you about this within the next few days.

Whilst I do not wish to appear unhelpful or impolite, I feel it is wrong
for me to be corresponding with you ditect when there are solicitors on
both sides dealing with the case. I wonder therefore if I could ask you to
direct future correspondence through your solicitors until such time as
the Judicial Review is concluded.

       Dear Mr

       I refer to a letter received               from Mrs Stringer,          a   copy   of     which    I have
       attached for your information.

       The material Mrs Stringer has requested was not                    introduced at          the    inquest
       and as such is not in the public domain.

       It is the policy of South Yorkshire Police not to release                                 post    mortem
       photographs and to date no such material has been released.

       Please be assured that I do not wish to be obstructive and am eager to assist
       in whatever way I possibly can.

Dear Ms Carlile

Inquest into the death o f your brother Paul

Thank you for your letter of 7th February. I am sorry for the delay in replying but I believe
you will already have received an acknowledgement indicating that I was away on holiday.

It is quite correct that the Coroner must hold papers relating to an Inquest for a minimum
of 15 years. The law relating to the inspection of such documents is contained in Rule 57
of the Coroners Rules 1984. This sets out that a Coroner shall supply to any “properly
interested person” (a phrase defined elsewhere in the rules, but which would include you)
a copy of any post-mortem report or any notes of evidence or of any document put in
evidence at an Inquest. There would normally be a charge for copying such documents
although this has generally been waived where applicable to the Hillsborough relatives.
Alternatively the Coroner may permit such a person to inspect such report, notes of
evidence or documents without charge at his office.
This means that the Coroner only has power to release either a post-mortem report, a
transcript of a case, or copies of statements that are actually read out as documentary
evidence. Any other documents that the Coroner is given sight of do not come under his
control and it is up to the owner or maker of that document to authorise its release rather
than the Coroner. Sadiy it seems tc me that the majority of statements in your brother’s
case probably fall within this latter category and I do not have the right to send copies of
them to you, however much I may wish to do so.
However, I am aware that you have been in correspondence with the Police and that they
have now sent you certain statements and may soon be in a position to send you others. I
understand that one witness (who in fact comes from Liverpool) has refused permission for
his statement to be released by the Police and thus I now need to review the transcript of


                                       Fax: (0114) 272-6247
the Inquest in so far as it relates to your brother (obviously a very substantial task) to see
whether this statement might come within the definition of those that you are automatically
entitled to.

I would therefore be grateful for your continuing patience. I hope to be able to write to you
again within the next week or ten days. I can assure you that I am very sympathetic to
your request but I am sure you will realise that I am bound by the law and am unable to
hand out documents without regard to the legal position.
I will write to you again shortly.
Yours sinrprplv___

Dear Mr

RE: HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

I refer to your letter of 7 July 1998 on the above subject.

The South Yorkshire Police Authority have agreed ^to allow their Clerk and Treasurer to
consider applications from serving and retired officers for financial assistance for legal
representation for prosecutions arising out of the Hillsborough disaster. The Clerk and
Treasurer, Mr W Wilkinson, has delegated power to approve such applications. I have
forwarded your application to Mr Wilkinson and he will respond to you as soon as he is able.

Yours sincerely

                            Dear Sir

                            Re: Hillsborough Disaster

                            W e have been approached by Mr Roger Greenwood of
                                        Yorkshire, who is a retired Chief Superintendent with South Yorkshire
                            Police who was on duty at Hillsborough on the date of the disaster.

                            In view of recent developments our client feels that he is in need of legal representation.
                            I understand from him that the Police Authority have agreed to indemnify him in
                            connection with his reasonable legal costs.

                            Please confirm that the Authority will be responsible for such reasonable costs.

                            I await to hear from you.

                            Yours sincerely

Dear Ian

Adlington -v- David Duckenfield

Further to our recent correspondence and discussion regarding South Sefiton, for your
information I enclose herewith a copy o f the letter o f 10th July from the Magistrates’ Court
confirming the Order made. I am sure you will be particularly pleased to see that we
managed to get an Order for Costs, and we will process that as required within the three
month period.

We shall no doubt be chatting again shortly, particularly as I would like to discuss other
potential police witnesses with you.

Yours sincerely,




                                          1                                                     I

Dear Sirs,

                        ADUNGTON -v- DUCKENFIELD and MURRAY


         I refer to our earlier correspondence in relation to the above case and, in particular,
your letter of today.

        The proceedings in respect of the defendants Duckenfield and Murray were brought
before the court this afternoon and the magistrates agreed that they should be withdrawn. The
court made an order that the defendants’ costs should be taxed and m ade payable from central
funds in accordance with Section 16 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985.




                                        Yours faithfully,



                                                  v
                                    Clerk to the Justices.

 Dear Sir

 The Hillsborough Disaster

 I would inform yu. ;hat I have now taken over the conduct o f the above matter from Watts
 Leather, Solicitors.

 I refer to their letter to you o f 1st July 1998 and enclose a copy for ease o f reference. I also
 enclose a copy o f a letter we have today written to the Director o f Public Prosecutions which
 sets out the reasons why we are requesting documents and information. The same
 considerations apply obviously to statements and documents in your possession.

 There are two specific matters which we wish to raise with you at this stage in addition to our
 general request. The first relates to originals o f witness statements. We have been supplied in
 the last year with dozens o f witness statements taken from spectators at the disaster. We are
 now engaged in our selection o f witnesses for the committal bundle. W e shall obviously need
 all the originals, and request you to provide them to us.

 The second matter concerns the informal statements given by various officers o f the South
 Yorkshire Police. As the extract from Hansard which is attached to the letter to the Director
 o f Public Prosecutions makes clear, we have now been able to see both edited and unedited
 versions o f these statements. We are studying them. We shall wish to speak to some o f these
 officers individually, and may wish to call some o f them as witnesses. Their statements are not
 in proper form. W e should therefore be grateful if you could provide us with addresses (work
 addresses if preferred) where we can contact them to put questions to them on an individual
 basis for investigative purposes and to prepare the magistrates’ court papers. For convenience
 we attach a list o f the names and stations (so far as is known from the existing statements) o f
 those whose current addresses we want to establish. Can you also confirm you will not seek

 Dear Sir

 The Hillsborough Disaster

 I would inform you that I have now taken over the conduct o f the above m atter from W atts
 Leather, Solicitors.

 I refer to their letter to you o f I s*July 1998 and enclose a copy for ease o f reference. I also
 enclose a copy o f a letter we have today written to the Director o f Public Prosecutions which
 sets out the reasons why we are requesting documents and information. The same
 considerations apply obviously to statements and documents in your possession.

 There are two specific m atters which w e wish to raise with you at this stage in addition to our
 general request. The first relates to originals o f witness statements. W e have been supplied in
 the last year with dozens o f witness statements taken from spectators at the disaster. We are.
 now engaged in our selection o f w itnesses for the committal bundle. W e shall obviously need
 all the originals, and request you to provide them to us.

 The second m atter concerns the informal statements given by various officers o f the South
 Yorkshire Police. As the extract from Hansard which is attached to the letter to the Director
 o f Public Prosecutions makes clear, w e have now been able to see both edited and unedited
 versions o f these statements. W e are studying them. W e shall wish to speak to some o f these
 officers individually, and may wish to call some o f them as witnesses. Their statements are not
 in proper form. W e should therefore be grateful if you could provide us with addresses (work
 addresses if preferred) w here w e can contact them to put questions to them on an individual
 basis for investigative purposes and to prepare the m agistrates’ court papers. F or convenience
 we attach a list o f the names and stations (so far as is known from the existing statements) o f
 those whose current addresses w e w ant to establish. Can you also confirm you will not seek
 to raise any charge for o ur seeing witnesses.

Dear Miss Coombes

THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

I refer to your letter o f 20 July 1998 addressed to M r Daines, Assistant Chief Constable and his
response to you dated 22 July from which you will be aware that M r Daines has asked us to act on
behalf o f the Chief Constable.

I note that you have taken over the conduct o f this matter from Messrs Watts Leather. I enclose
copies o f our letters o f 6 and 21 July addressed to that firm.

Regarding your request for access to documents and witnesses, our advice and instructions remain
the same, ie we will await the outcome o f the CPS review before taking any action.

Regarding charges for access to documents and/or interviews with serving police officers, or indeed
any other services, again M r Daines has informed me that he will not make a final decision until he
has DPP/CPS advice.

I trust this clarifies the position.


                                                                                                       R E C E IV E D

     Hillsborough Stadium Disaster

     I refer to your recent requests of statements and information, some made direct to South
     Yorkshire Police and some made to Mr            Home Office Policing Policy Unit.

     You began private prosecutions on 26 June 1998 for alleged offences concerned with the
     disaster. The Director of Public Prosecutions is reviewing the case. I am awaiting legal
     advice on whether I should release information.

     I will write to you again as soon as practicable.

     Yours sincerely

 We have been asked by the South Yorkshire Police to reply to your letter o f 3 August 1998
 addressed to the Assistant Chief Constable.

 As you are aware Summonses have been issued in the Leeds Magistrates Court against David
 Duckenfield and Bernard M urray in connection with matters arising out o f the disaster.

 In connection with those Summonses requests for documentation and information have been
 received from a number o f persons.

 The Chief Constable sought guidance pursuant to Section 3(2)(e) of the Prosecution of Offences Act
 1985 from the Director o f Public Prosecutions in relation to those requests.

 The response was that the Crown Prosecution Service were reviewing the question o f whether to
 intervene in the private prosecutions and that the Chief Constable might wish to delay any voluntary
 disclosure o f documentation until that review was complete and a decision was made.

 The Chief Constable has accepted that guidance and accordingly will not respond to any requests for
 documentation or information until the CPS review has been completed and the decision o f the DPP
 is known.

Dear Sirs

Adlinsrton v Murray Adlington v Duckenfield

The purpose o f this letter is to request to you as a matter o f urgency to make available the
original papers and copies in the possession o f your clients in relation to the Hillsborough
disaster to both the prosecution and defence; alternatively, at the very least, to release them as
soon as possible to some neutral third party.

The HSFG is becoming increasingly concerned that all original papers are in the custody o f the
South Yorkshire Police. Such papers as w e have received from the Home Office in the last
year have led us to believe that the South Yorkshire Police adopted a deliberate policy o f
withholding material and not revealing facts as disclosed by its junior officers in their first
statements after the disaster.

We have received both edited and unedited versions o f the statements o f the South Yorkshire
Police officers. The process o f omitting material facts extending patently beyond that
suggested in Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s report, and makes us suspect that he was misled in
the course o f his “Scrutiny7’. We are in the process o f preparing a detailed analysis.

We have also received in the last year statements from spectators w hose identities were
completely unknown to us before. M ost o f these statements were not on the Master Witness
List o f statements submitted to the Director o f Public Prosecutions in 1990 and most o f these
witnesses were not called at the Inquest. W e suspect the DPP was given an unbalanced
account o f the evidence.

We invite you to explain by what legal process the W est Midlands Police entrusted all the
original papers, including copies o f the West Midlands Police report and the advice o f leading
counsel on the subject o f prosecutions to a force that w as under suspicion and itself had
admitted negligence? Why should the papers be in the possession o f the South Yorkshire
Police at all?

                                                 1

We have seen a copy o f a document called the “Phillips Report”. This is not the occasion to
comment upon it. We do, however, request you to explain to us how material that appears to
have been collected by the W est Midlands Police came to be in the possession o f the South
Yorkshire Police in 1990 in order that Mr Phillips might be invited to deliver his opinions upon
it?

Assistant Chief Constable Daines has already expressed the opinion publically that ‘It is hard
to imagine a private prosecution getting beyond the first hurdle”. Is it right in these
circumstances, that he should make, or be party to decisions about the disclosure to the
prosecutor o f the material in his possession at a time when the very existence o f the
prosecution is under challenge.

We invite you to agree, without, o f course, the slightest admission o f impropriety, that the
papers should no longer remain in the custody o f the South Yorkshire Police. Justice must be
seen to be done. The South Yorkshire Police have an obvious interest in the outcome o f the
prosecution, and there is at the very least a temptation to keep shrouded in secrecy relevant
documentation, especially if it casts the force in a dubious light.

Even if our suspicions are unfounded it is obviously in the interests o f all parties to have
simultaneous access to the archive. There may be material exculpating the defendants. We
note that the South Yorkshire Police accepted publically the findings o f Lord Taylor. It must,
therefore, take the position, as Lord Taylor did, as a central finding that the failure to arrange
for the diversion o f the supporters from the central pens when the gates were opened was “a
blunder o f the first magnitude”, and the immediate cause o f the disaster.

We ask you to explain therefore how it is appropriate that South Yorkshire Police continue to
hold the papers when it has associated itself without reserve with an inquiry which has blamed
at least one o f the defendants, acting on its behalf, so comprehensively?

We refer to our letter o f 20th July to Mr Daines requesting the addresses o f police officers with
whom we wish to speak. There is no possible bona fide reason why the DPP’s review should
prevent you from supplying this information. How can it be contrary to the interests o f justice
to give us these addresses so w e can progress matters?

The argument that you will no nothing until the DPP has made a decision to take over the
prosecution is unreasonable in these circumstances. We invite you to reply positively to this
letter before the end o f the week, or w e shall apply for a witness summons directed to Mr
Daines requiring the production o f all relevant documents. If there is another suitable person
on whom the summons should be served, please let us know before 5 pm on Friday 14
August.

Yours faithfully

Dear Sirs

H illsborough D ocum entation

Thank you for your letter o f 12 August 1998.

We must advert directly to the final paragraph o f your letter. Neither we nor our clients accept that
it is “unreasonable” to obtain guidance from the DPP and, having obtained that guidance, to follow
it.

That policy will continue to be applied impartially to prosecutor, Defendants and to any other party
seeking information or documents until the CPS review is completed and the decision o f the DPP
known.

The other points made in your letter (which are not accepted) would in any event only become
matters for consideration if the prosecutions are to proceed.

        Dear Sirs

        Adlington v M urray Adlington v Duckenfield

        We inform you as a matter o f courtesy that we shall not be asking for a witness summons
        tomorrow directing the production o f witness statements, exhibits and documents in view of
        continuing correspondence betw een us and the Crown Prosecution Service. We hope that in
        spite o f your unco-operative attitude the material will be disclosed in due course. If this does
        not happen we shall serve a witness summons upon you in the next few weeks.

        We shall, however, be drawing our concerns to the attention o f the M agistrate tomorrow. We
        invite you to attend to hear our concerns and w e would, o f course, have no objection if you
        wished to make representations to the court.

        Yours faithfully

    Dear Mr Metcalf

    We have written today to M r Croston at the Crown Prosecution Service in York. We enclose
    a copy of our letter and o f the file.

    Winkworth and Pemberton, from whom Mr Duckenfield now has the advantage of receiving
    appropriate professional advice, represented the South Yorkshire Police during the “Scrutiny”
    of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith. No doubt the reason that you did not advise the force last year
    was because o f the prominent part your firm had played in giving advice in 1989-91, and no
    doubt later in the various civil and other proceedings in which the force had interests. It was
    probably thought that your firm, and you yourself, had been too close to events.

    It is utterly inappropriate that you are involved now. The DPP will not make a decision on
    this matter before October. We want to uncover further evidence to support the charges. We
    believe that much o f that evidence has been suppressed. It is wrong that you should advise the
    South Yorkshire Police to maintain exclusive custody o f the archive, when you and your firm
w   have been so deeply concerned in the way in which information and evidence has been
    collected, edited and presented to outside tribunals, courts and law enforcement authorities
    over the years. We are considering, with leading counsel, all legal options in respect o f your
    and your firm’s conduct, and we contend, meanwhile, that you have a clear conflict o f interest
    in continuing to advise the South Yorkshire Police.

    Yours sincerely

 Yourself - v - Duckenfield & M urray

 Thank you for your letter o f 24 August 1998.

 I cannot comment on your second paragraph save to note that the first sentence is factual and

 As to your third paragraph neither I nor The Chief Constable can see any conflict o f interest.

Dear Sirs

Adlington v Murray. Adlington v Duckenfield

You will recall that on 20th July last we wrote to Ian Daines, Assistant Chief Constable, South
Yorkshire Police, requesting the addresses o f serving and former officers o f South Yorkshire
Police. In particular, we sought the address o f former Inspector Harry White. You
responded, on 22nd July, on behalf o f M r Daines, declining our request pending the outcome of
the CPS review.

You will be aware that the case is due back m Leeds Magistrates’ court on 7th December for
directions. W e intend to apply for a witness summons, directed to M r White, to produce
certain documents which he has in his possession. Could you please supply his address for
insertion in the Summons and subsequent service.

W e also intend to apply for a witness summons directed to M r Daines. Your attendance is not
required although you may attend if you wish.


Yours faithfully

I f an Application is to be made at some time in the future it would be helpful if you can set out the
precise basis upon which a Summons is being sought and we can then consider whether to oppose it.
Obviously this would save any requirement for judicial review proceedings if an inappropriate
Summons is issued.

Dear Sirs,


ADLINGTON v MURRAY: ARLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD


Further to our correspondence o f last week, and particularly to our letter o f Friday evening in
reply to your faxed letter o f 5:26 pm that day, I write to inform you o f events in court yesterday,
although no doubt you have already had a report from Mr Manning.

Counsel presented on behalf o f the Prosecution draft witness summonses, which had been drawn
up to require the production o f witness statements and exhibits. We enclose copies. Counsel
informed the court o f the approach that the South Yorkshire Police had taken on your advice
since last July, namely, that voluntary disclosure was inappropriate while the CPS review took
place. In the event, it was agreed that the better course was not to issue summonses at present
but to set aside a day in the week before Christmas for the matter to be the subject o f argument,
and the magistrate indicated that it would be helpful if you were present or represented on that
occasion.

The week before Christmas was chosen at our request, because, if the case is to proceed we wish
to begin the process of inspecting the archive and copying the relevant parts as soon as possible.
Our leading counsel requested 23rd or 24th to give you a few days opportunity to prepare after the
 18th December, the date that the decision is due to be announced. However, the court could only
accommodate us on Monday 21st, and the whole day has been allocated to this case. If the case
is taken over and discontinued, the date will o f course be vacated.

On 17th August 1998 you wrote to us in these terms;

                “ Neither we nor our clients accept that it is “unreasonable” to obtain guidance
                from the DPP and, having obtained that guidance, to follow it. That policy will

                continue to be applied impartially to prosecutor, Defendants and to any other
                party seeking information or documents until the CPS review is completed and the
                decision o f the DPP known.”

We trust, therefore, that you will comply with any guidance from the CPS that material should
be disclosed to us if the outcome o f the review is in our favour. In any event, it would help us if
you could indicate your attitude to the production o f the various categories o f documents on the
schedules attached to the draft summonses, if possible within the next week, so that the issues the
magistrate has to determine are eliminated or narrowed. If at all possible higher court proceedings
should be avoided. We are sure that you are keen as we are that the South Yorkshire council
taxpayer should be spared as much inappropriate expenditure as possible.

We understand that all the material is on the Holmes computer as well as in paper form, and we
trust that the physical disclosure o f the material, however bulky, will not present serious problems.
No doubt you have already given thought to the practicalities o f disclosure in the last five months.
One possibility is that the material might be delivered to some neutral third party, such as,
perhaps, the Crown Prosecution Service, rather than to the front door o f the magistrates court.

A number o f critical documents that we received from the South Yorkshire police at the direction
o f the Home Secretary, before the supply was terminated on your advice, were very badly copied.
No doubt a repetition will be avoided if substantial disclosure becomes appropriate.

On Friday last, you supplied us by letter with the last known address o f former Inspector Henry
White. Would you now please also supply us with the names and addresses o f the other officers
whose names were on the list sent to Mr Daines with our letter o f 20th July 1998 (copy attached),
so that we can approach them before 21st December.

For the avoidance o f doubt, we should inform you that the concerns that we have previously
expressed about your past and current roles in this case have not been alleviated in recent months.




Yours faithfully,




Ann Adlington
Solicitor.

Dear Alan

 Hillsborough Prosecutions

I enclose letter and attached documentation received from the HFSG.

I also enclose draft reply which I would like to send out on Friday 11 December 1998 if at all
possible. Alternatively it can await M r Dames’ return if you prefer.

You will see that they are seeking a very large number o f documents indeed. I have one or two legal
observations namely: -

 1.            There is now a provision in Section 97a o f the Magistrates’ Court Act 1980 (inserted by the
               Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 Schedule 1) which allows the Magistrate to
               make a Witness Summons returnable at a date other than that fixed for the hearing.
               Although the Section is a bit obscure it seems to me that the plain purpose is to
               accommodate a situation where the Prosecutor needs to obtain a document to bring before
               the Court for the hearing but needs to have this in advance.

2.             On the face o f it the statements are not going to be admissible at the hearing (an old style
               committal) without the attendance o f the witness concerned and we could reasonably argue
               that the statements are therefore irrelevant and should not be produced. I believe the HFSG
               Counsel will try and counter this by arguing that the statements fall within Section 24 o f the
               Criminal Justice Act 1988 or that they may well be admissible under Section 23 and the
               Magistrate need not concern himself with admissibility at the stage o f issuing the Witness
               Summons.

3.     None o f this in my view gets the HFSG passed the main stumbling block which is that a
       Witness Summons for the production o f documents is intended only to cover documents
       which the Prosecutor already knows are relevant and indeed knows the contents o f In this
       case it seems quite certain that the procedure is being used to obtain documents for
       investigative purposes.

I hope that we can discuss this matter on Friday or Monday agree a choice o f Counsel and I can then
deal with a Brief

Yours sincerely

FAQ: Mr P Metcalf




Dear Peter

HILLSBOROUGH PROSECUTIONS

Thank you for your letter dated the 10 December 1998, with enclosures.

At the time of writing to you I have had an opportunity to read the documents, including your draft
letter to the Hillsborough Family Support Group which carries the 10 December, as its date.
However I have not had an opportunity of discussing the matter any further with Mr Daines who only
returns to the office later on Monday or on Tuesday. I note you will try to obtain the services fo Miss
Kate Thirlwell for the 21 December.

Nevertheless, I feel that we should instruct Counsel and dispatch the letter to the HFSG in readiness
for any hearing on Monday the 21 December. I am placing a copy of your letter and the
accompanying correspondence before Mr Daines.

He will also have a copy of my letter.

Please arrange to dispatch your draft to the HFSG.

Yours sincerely

Dear Sirs

Adlington - v - M urray. Adlington - v - Duckenfield



Thank you for your letter o f 8 December 1998. The ACC designated to deal with this matter by The

Chief Constable is currently on leave and the points made below are merely matters which occur to

us as o f potential significance




1.              Unless there are some overriding considerations to the contrary we would anticipate that our

                 clients would wish to comply with CPS guidance as well after as before any decision on

                 intervention.




2.              We do not think that the position is helped by an Application to issue a Witness Summons

                 returnable on the first working day after the date on which the DPP decision is anticipated.

        3.   The Application has the air an attempt to “force” The Chief Constable into reaching a hasty

             decision. In view o f the possibility o f such a Witness Summons setting an inappropriate

             precedent it seems to us likely that there will be a contest when there must be at least a

             reasonable possibility o f the matter otherwise being dealt with amicably.




        4.   We believe that the matters which will principally concern the Chief Constable will be

             fairness as between Prosecutor and Defendant and the question o f cost: in a different context

             in your letter you make reference to protecting the interests o f the Council Tax payers o f

             South Yorkshire and you may rest assured that this is in the mind o f The Chief Constable.




        5.   It is possible that there will be some documentation in the schedules you have prepared

             which is arguably protected by public interest privilege. We rather doubt that will be the

             case but you should take that simply as an observation based on perusal o f the schedules.




        6.   If the DPP does not intervene in the prosecutions and you insist on proceeding with your

             Application on 21 December 1998 then we would expect you to deal with points raised by

             the cases o f         R   -v -   S h e ffie ld   J u s tic e s   e x   p   W r ig le y   [ 1 9 8 8 ]   R T R   78   and   R   -v-   G r e e n w ic h

             justify in relation to each statement why you believe this will be admissible without the maker

             being called. These points are not necessarily exhaustive.




                                                                                                                                 clii.057-0009.adlington.1212.pcm

With reference to the balance o f your letter we do not know what material is or not on the

HOLMES system and indeed we are not in a position to say whether any o f the documents which

you identify do exist or are in the Hillsborough archive held by our clients.




We are not in a position to comment on the question o f what arrangements could be made in respect

o f documentation although we are quite sure that our client would take exception to the reference to

a “neutral third party” . We are not sure what point you are making in your next paragraph. If the

Home Secretary has been providing you with documentation then he has neither started nor stopped

doing so on the basis o f our advice.




As to your pre-penultimate paragraph you kindly attached a copy o f your letter to M r Daines but not

unfortunately the list which we presume was in turn attached to that letter. It is as well to make

clear that the address given to you for M r White was that publicly available by examination o f the

Writ which he issued against the South Yorkshire Police and others in 1990 or 1991. Where an

address is not already a matter o f public record we would be surprised if our clients would be

prepared to supply this without the consent o f the officer concerned.




Your final paragraph is meaningless. If you have any specific and relevant point to make then we

suggest that you make it.




Yours faithfully

Dear Mr Metcalf

Adlinuton v Murray: Adlington v Duckenfield

You will no doubt have heard o f the decision o f the Director o f Public Prosecutions,
announced today, that he will not exercise his powers to take over the prosecutions.

We luive read your letter o f I4’1' December in which you purport to reply to our letter of 8"'
December. We note with disappointment that you do not indicate that you will appear or be
represented on the hearing on Monday 21s'. As we reported to you, the magistrate expressed
the hope that you would attend. You suggest uncharitably that the application for witness
summonses may be intended to "force” the Chief Constable into reaching a “hasty” decision.
Since the question o f disclosure has been discussed in our letters to you now for several
months, it is absurd to suggest that a request for you, after fair notice to assist or deal with the
issue of witness summonses puts the Chief Constable at some disadvantage.
                                             -•ate
We know that Mr Dailies expressed the view last spring that the prosecutions were likely to
"fall at the first hurdle", but no reasonable person can be surprised at the CPS decision in view
of the matters that have been disclosed at the insistence o f the Home Secretary after Lord
Justice Stuart-Smith's "Scrutiny".

Your concern is, understandably, to avoid public costs. No doubt this concern is shared by
the South Yorkshire Police Authority. It must be sensible that judicial review by any party in
this case is avoided if at all possible, and no doubt the Police Authority above all other parties
wishes to avoid this type o f expense, especially when, as we have been informed, it is funding
the costs of the entire criminal defence as well, and, perhaps, the judicial review proceedings
that Mr Manning has been threatening in relation to the CPS decision if adverse to his client.
We do hope therefore that you will be present before Mr Cadbury on Monday, to help him
and us, constructively, about early and timely disclosure o f the various papers we have
requested.




         Phone 0151 236 1919. Fax 0151 226 1936. E Mail info@hfsg.org
       1st Floor Central Buildings 41 North John Street Liverpool L2 6RR
If you are not present, we shall draw the magistrate’s attention to these matters and proceed
as we think right, setting out the relevant history o f events.

You say you do not know what material is on the Holmes computer. We enclose for your
information a Parliamentary reply by Mr Boateng o f 3rd November 1998, which makes the
position look rather simple.

As a matter o f courtesy we would inform you that we are copying this letter to the solicitors
for the Defendants.

Yours sincerely




Ann Adlington
Solicitor

    Dear Ms Adlington
                                                                 Hillsborough Prosecutions

    Thank you for your fax o f today which I received at 5.35pm.

    I thought that numbered paragraph 6 of my letter made the position clear but for the avoidance of
    doubt the application for a witness summons against Mr.Daines will be opposed and he will be
    represented at the hearing by Miss Louise Varty o f counsel.

    I remain of the opinion that the application is misconceived but I should make quite clear that in
    taking this view I do not in any way prejudge the separate issue of whether material from the
    Hillsborough archive should be made available to the prosecution and. o f course, to the defence.
    This is a matter under consideration by the South Yorkshire Police now that the decision of the DPP
    has been made.

    Subject to my clients’ instructions I hope to be able to write to you further on this point early in the
    New Year but obviously the present application represents a distraction from that objective.

Dear Mr Newell

Adlington v Murray and Duckenficld

I write to you about the question o f disclosure of the statements and exhibits in your
possession in this case.

We have repeatedly been told by the CPS in the course of the review o f the last five and a half
months that, if the Cl’S decided not to intervene and discontinue, there would be disclosure by
the CPS o f the statements and exhibits in its possession.

We have accepted this patiently, and we had every reason to believe that we would be given
the proper opportunity to prepare our case, indeed, this morning Mr Croston told us at 9.30
that we could come to York tomorrow to begin the inspection process.

However, we were then told that because the defendants have indicated that they would apply
for Judicial Review o f your decision, you would have to consider the question of voluntary
disclosure and its timing again.

We regard this as unacceptable. Everyone has known or believed that a decision adverse to
the defendant s would be the subject o f Judicial Review. It has never been your position that
voluntary disclosure would await not only a decision not to discontinue, but the end o f any
unsuccessful judicial review proceedings.

The delay since the issue o f summonses is unacceptable. The Judicial Review proceedings are
obviously speculative in character, and leave will be resisted by us, and we hope the CPS, on
the basis that the defendants have other remedies, namely, application to dismiss for abuse of

process.

There can be no justification for the postponement o f the disclosure o f this critical material
the grounds that one party might be granted leave to quash the decision not to take over
proceedings which are pending in a lower court.

The magistrate lias confirmed that the committal proceedings will begin on 19"' April.

I look forward to an early reply.

 Dear Ms Adlington

 H IL L S B O R O U G H STADIUM DISASTER 1989
 PR IV A TE PR O SE C U T IO N S: RELEA SE O F D O CU M EN TA TIO N

 As you are aware my firm represents the Chief Constable in this matter.

 Now that the DPP has decided not to intervene in the prosecutions the South Yorkshire Police
 would like to progress the issue o f disclosure o f copies o f relevant material from the Hillsborough
 archive.

 It has been suggested that the decision o f the DPP may be the subject o f judicial review proceedings
 by the Defendants. The South Yorkshire Police do not propose to delay disclosure on the basis that
 such proceedings are being considered but will review the position if such proceedings are actually
 instituted and reserve the right to suspend disclosure pending the outcome in that event.

 I should make clear that this decision has no effect on our position in relation to the application for
 the issue o f a witness summons directed to the Assistant Chief Constable. That application is due to
 be considered again on 7 January 1999 and if it is proceeded with it will be resisted.

 Reverting to the matter o f disclosure the following points are relevant:

 1.            A vast amount o f material has been requested. I must ask that you indicate your priorities so
               as to enable attention to be directed first to the material which you consider most important.

 2.            We have considered carefully the guidance o f the CPS to the effect that the consent of a
               witness should be sought before a copy o f his or her statement is made available. We believe

       that in the circumstances o f this particular case that may be an unreasonable requirement and
       subject to the safeguards set out in the following three paragraphs the Police are prepared to
       supply material without that requirement being fulfilled. The safeguards are:

       2.1     The material supplied and any further copies taken will be used only bona-fide for the
               purposes o f the present prosecutions and not for any other purpose whatsoever.
               Aside from actual use in court it will be made available only to legal representatives
               o f the prosecution and, where necessary, to expert or other witnesses.

       2.2     At the conclusion o f the prosecution all such material and any copies taken will be
               returned to the South Yorkshire Police. The Chief Constable will be prepared to
               consider alternative proposals for safe custody o f the material provided that such
               proposals clearly continue to satisfy condition 2.1 above.

       2.3    In the case o f each item we shall require a brief explanation of the relevance o f the
              material to one or more o f the charges.

              Item 2.1 and 2.2 must be supported by your written undertaking as a solicitor,

3.     There will be a substantial cost in providing this material. Rather than charge on an item by
       item basis the South Yorkshire Police propose to use the services o f a documents officer and
       to charge his time at £30.00 per hour plus VAT. For the avoidance o f doubt the time charge
       will apply for any work in connection with provision of documents or dealing with any other
       requests raised by the prosecution whether dealt with in this letter or otherwise. That charge
       will include the cost o f all black and white A4 copying but an additional charge will be levied
       in respect o f the copying o f any videos, tapes, photographic prints or any other non-standard
       material including black and white photocopies o f non-A4 size. An account will be rendered
       to you every fortnight following commencement o f copying and this must be paid within 7
       days failing which provision o f material will be suspended. Given that the Hillsborough
       Family Support Group, who we believe are your Clients, do not appear to have a legal
       personality, we will require your personal solicitor’s undertaking that these charges will be
       met as outlined above.

4.    Express guidance from the CPS is that there must be equality between prosecution and
      defence so that all material supplied will be copied at the same time to the two Defence
      solicitors. This will be chargeable to you on the basis set out above.

5.    CPS guidance is that original statements should not be released from the archive. We are
      prepared to consider making appropriate arrangements for the inspection of specific
      individual statements or other original material if good reasons are put forward.

There is no reason why this process should not now commence quite quickly once the terms above
have been accepted.

I look forward to hearing from you.

31 December 1998

Dear Mr Metcalf

I have received your letter o f 30lh December 1998 sent by facsimile.

I had spoken to Mr Croston o f the CPS last week and to a different CPS lawyer yesterday,
before receipt o f your letter. I have been told that the intention o f the CPS is to disclose the
material in their possession subject to any convincing objection in law that you might raise on
behalf o f South Yorkshire police, but I am pleased to say that they will not be charging £30
per hour. No doubt you have also been in touch with Mr Croston or his colleagues and been
told of their attitude already. I had assumed from the terms o f your letter that you would not
be advancing any such objections but I am surprised to read in a letter from the CPS which I
received this morning that you are suggesting that the CPS should postpone their disclosure
pending the outcome o f judicial review proceedings. There is no sense in proposing the
voluntary disclosure o f material in possession o f South Yorkshire police and asking the CPS
to withhold theirs.

The reservation in the third paragraph o f your letter makes the prospect o f early disclosure by
your clients more apparent than real in any event. It is not correct to say that judicial review
 proceedings are “being considered” . On 21s*December, leading counsel for M r Murray and
junior counsel for M r Duckenfield both told the court in unambiguous terms, in the presence
o f the prosecution and your counsel, that an application for judicial review would be made and
Mr Harrison QC told the court that he intended that it would be lodged in the first two weeks
o f January. He told the court this after Miss Varty had indicated that voluntary disclosure
would be withheld if such an application were to be made, and after prosecution counsel
protested at the potential delay in the disclosure process. (Miss Varty later appeared to adopt
a more amenable attitude when the Magistrate suggested that many o f the documents might be
disclosed by agreement between the parties so that the committal proceedings would be
conducted in an orderly and efficient way.)

I am sure that, if the defence had changed their minds, or were now undecided as to whether
to apply for judicial review, they would have told us, because they know that the CPS decided
to delay a decision as to voluntary disclosure on the 21s' only by reason o f the declared
intention o f the defence to challenge the CPS decision.

The prosecution considers it wholly unreasonable o f the defendant to form, and act upon, a
concluded decision to apply for judicial review, when they believe that the decision-maker may
or will provide reasons for his decision within a short time. We must, however, accept the
reality that attack upon the rationality o f the decision is to be made whatever the reasons, and
whether reasons are supplied or not. I therefore ask you to tell me whether the Chief
Constable will indeed “suspend” the process when the proceedings are “instituted” (by which I
surmise you mean lodged with the Crown Office) or at least explain why you cannot tell me
now. I am sure that your clients will agree that it would be pointless to spend time and incur
expense in setting up a procedure, and in installing a “documents officer”, if the arrangements
were to be put into abeyance within a few days. I hope that you will throw more light on this.

I also request that you clarify the following matters:

(A)    What is the “guidance” to which you refer in paragraph 1. I understand that the
       present position o f the CPS is that they have no guidance to offer because they have
       decided not to intervene. However, since last July the makers o f statements have
       requested copies o f their statements from South Yorkshire police. May we please see
       a copy o f the “guidance” to which you refer, which apparently you have been ignoring
       for the last six months. Why were the statements not disclosed if such guidance was
       given and the makers consented.

(B)    What limitation is the proposed undertaking specified in para 2.1 intended to add, if
       anything, to such undertakings as are implied in relation to disclosure by common law?
       We note that you are not suggesting that the Defence give similar undertakings.
       Please explain why not.

(C)   In para 2.3, you suggest that your client will “require” a brief explanation o f the
       relevance o f the material to one or more o f the charges. Such a position implies that
       an individual decision on behalf o f your clients is contemplated in relation to each item,
       either to disclose or withhold. Do you propose to apply the test embodied in section
       97A o f the Magistrates Court Act, or some looser standard? If the test is to be
       “materiality” you will understand that a court, after applying the same test, does not
       charge the prosecution for photocopying at a rate equivalent to a salary exceeding
       £50,000 a year, and then make a further charge at the same rate for supplying copies
       o f the same material to the defence. I suspect also that the application o f the
       “materiality” test would be rather less generous in your hands than the Court’s. If the
       proposed criterion is different, please set it out.

(D)   The basis on which the exorbitant charge is to be levied is unclear. The HSFG could
      find a competent and trustworthy person to do the job for nothing except travel
      expenses, or at a commercial rate o f under £5 an hour. You may well be right to say
      that VAT is chargeable, but I should like to know on what basis, and how the hourly
       rate has been calculated, so that the HFSG can inform itself properly before deciding
       whether to authorise this unusual expenditure. Please also inform me o f the detail in
       which the invoices will be drafted, so that we can be assured that the time and
       activities o f the documents officer will have been reliably set out.

(E)    You tell me that all material disclosed to us will also be disclosed to both defendants.
       Fortunately we can relieve you o f that responsibility. At all three hearing before the
       Leeds District Magistrates’ Court, the prosecution has raised the difficulties it has
       experienced in obtaining documents from the South Yorkshire police and CPS. On
       each occasion it has openly invited the defence to support its request to both these
       bodies that documents be disclosed. The prosecution has pointed out that the
       defendants might reasonably expect that such disclosure might assist their case.
       However, on each occasion, perhaps mindful o f cost, the defence have declined to
       support the request. Instead they have argued that it is for the prosecution to disclose
       to them all relevant material in their possession.

       Miss Varty will be able to confirm this in relation to 21s1December, and Mr Manning
       will, we trust be prepared to confirm that this was also his expressed position at the
       earlier hearings. It is therefore wholly unnecessary for you to supply the defence with
       copies and to charge us for doing so.

       If this does not cause you to change your mind, please confirm that it is also proposed
       to supply the defence with any material that they may request, on what criteria, and
       whether it is intended that such material will also be copied to the prosecution at the
       expense o f the defence (ie the expense o f the South Yorkshire Police Authority). You
       do not say if you have written in similar terms to the defence solicitors, as opposed to
       merely sending them a copy o f your letter to us.

(F)    Please inform me, in any event, why you propose to charge us for the supply to the
       defence o f the same material as you send to us. Such an arrangement would make a
       mockery o f the “equality between prosecution and defence” which you refer to, and
       the impartiality which you have professed in earlier letters. Surely the defence should
       pay for their own copies.' The prosecution have obligations o f disclosure of all relevant
       material to the defence, which it will abide by, and at a fraction o f the cost of your
       expensive “documents officer’’. Fortunately as I have said, the defence will look to us,
       and not to you to disclose.

(G)    Who is it proposed will be the “documents officer”? Will he have had any previous
       connections with the Hillsborough inquiries and an interest o f his own to protect? We
       have already been alarmed to hear that the former custodian o f the archive, PC
       Greenway, has been suspended from duty on suspicion o f serious misconduct, but was
       nevertheless invited by your clients to inspect documentation in the archive on the 18lh
       December.

There is a further objection to your proposal to charge us for copying material to the defence.
You know that the defendants are in receipt o f public money for their defence, namely, funds
from the South Yorkshire Police Authority. It is obvious from the fact that the defendants
have already announced a concluded decision to apply for judicial review, that the Authority is
liberal with its money. It will obviously meet the reasonable copying o f the defence, and, on
the basis o f recent experience, there is every reason to believe that the Authority will accept
even your proposed rates o f charging, particularly when the money will be coming back to a
body which it finances.

When the prosecution applies in due course for its costs, it is unlikely that, upon conviction,
the defendants would be ordered to pay the whole sum. In that event, or in the event of
acquittal the prosecution would have to look to recover its costs from public funds, and will
face taxation. The taxing authority is unlikely to regard the costs which you stipulate for a
person who is essentially a photocopier as in any way reasonable. The proposal we make to
finance the costs o f copying to the defence is undoubtedly more reasonable, and conducive to
the saving o f public money.

I agree with you that the question o f the issue o f witness summonses is separate, and that any
agreement we may reach does not prejudice our right to apply for such summonses, or your
right to object to them. However, it is possible that we may agree about disclosure, and so
avoid the necessity o f the application on 7lh January. The prospect o f this will obviously be
improved if you reply to this letter today. If the hearing o f the 7lh is unnecessary we would
wish to inform the Leeds Court, which has always been helpful to us, as early as possible. No
doubt the Court will conclude its business today earlier than usual.

We should tell you that the decision o f the South Yorkshire Police Authority to fund the
defence is one that we have challenged. We suggest that it was made unlawfully and
irrationally, as you have no doubt heard. We shall be making further formal representations to
the Authority, and will be copying the file as a matter o f courtesy to the Chief Constable. If
you have been advising either the Authority or the police in that matter, please let me know,
so that I can serve the papers on you directly.

Yours sincerely

LIVERPOOL
L2 6RR


Dear Ms A dlington

As Chair of the Chief Police Officer's Staff Association, Mr N ew ing has asked m e to
respond to the points enum erated in your letter of 25 February, 1999.

1.     Advice and guidance to police authorities on financial assistance to police
       officers in legal proceedings is contained in Hom e Office C ircular 4/1998. I am
       sure you w ill have a copy of the Circular b u t a copy is enclosed in case you have
       not seen it.

       Provision of financial assistance to officers involved in civil proceedings appears
       to be beyond doubt by virtue of Section 88 of the Police Act 1996.

       The provision of legal assistance in crim inal proceedings is, how ever, less
       certain as explained in the Circular.

2.     This is a m atter of national concern. As expressed in the Circular it has alw ays
       been regarded as an im portant principle that police officers should be able to
       carry out their duties in the confidence th at their police authority w ill support
       them, if they act in good faith and exercise their judgem ent reasonably.

       It is the uncertainty that surrounds the advice and the discretion w hich lies w ith
       the police authority th at has necessitated the provision of legal expenses
       insurance funded by individual officers through their Staff Associations.

3.    It is very im portant for the m orale of officers th at this issue is resolved as early
       as possible, given the basic principle at 2 above.

4.    ACPO does not have the pow er to fund the defence of the officers.

5.    The question is answ ered at (2) above.

On a m ore general note it has alw ays been the case to m y know ledge th at in the
exercise of discretion as to costs in our courts that, in general, no attention is paid to the
fact that a plaintiff or defendant is entitled, in right of his m em bership of a Staff
Association to legal representation. His righ t to an order for costs depends in the
ordinary case upon the m erits of his claim thereto. The fact that his Staff Association
supports him through legal expenses insurance is considered as irrelevant to the fact
that he m ight have borrow ed the m oney on term s that he w ould not be expected to
repay.

I, therefore, consider th at the m ere fact that an officer has been provided w ith legal
representation by his Staff Association is irrelevant to the question w hether an
application for reim bursem ent should be granted either by a court or in this case the
police authority. It is the first time, to m y know ledge, th at the legality of the authority
approving reim bursem ent of legal costs from public funds has been challenged.

I hope this inform ation is of value to you.

Yours sincerely,

Dear Mr Newing,

R   v.   S o u th      Yorkshire Police            A u th o r ity ,   ex p a r t e Chief Constable of S o u t h Yorkshire Police

On 5"' February 1999 you wrote a letter to the Chief Constable o f South Yorkshire Police, a
copy of which I enclose, It has been produced in evidence in judicial review proceedings in
which I am the Respondent prosecutor.

I am preparing evidence for the court and should be grateful if could answer the following
questions:

1            Can you give examples o f the practice and understanding o f which you speak?
             Obviously, if there are cases in which officers have received financial assistance from
             their Police Authority as opposed to the Police Federation or Superintendents
             Association, all parties would benefit from hearing about them, and I therefore ask you
             to provide further details.

2            Why is this a matter o f national concern, given that the two former officers have the
             same rights to apply for legal aid as any other citizen?

3            Why do you suggest that "as early a hearing as possible" should be sought? Are there
             other cases pending which are affected by this decision?

4            Does ACPO have the power to fund the defence of the officers?

5            The Police Federation has power to fund the defence of its members in criminal
             proceedings. In what circumstances does it do so, and why, in your experience, does it
             have the power if it is the practice o f Police Authorities to fund the defence?

uiven that the case is said to be o f such importance, I do hope you feel prepared to answer
these questions, so that the court can be given as much information as possible.

  Dear Mr Wood

  Thank you for your letter dated 25lh February, which I received only today. I wonder if you
  would kindly clarify the second paragraph under the number “2". Does the insurer agree to
  fund costs irrespective of any power in a police authority to give financial assistance, or only
  if, for example, the authority declines? Do insurers agree to give assistance only if there has
  been a denial of negligence or fault, for example? It is not reasonable to believe that an
  insurer would agree to pay if a police authority was in the habit of paying as a matter o f settled
  practice.

  Similarly, it is not clear why police authorities are willing to give financial assistance from
  hard-pressed public funds if insurers are under an obligation to pay.

      I should again be very grateful for your assistance.

 Hillsborough : Officers Addresses

 Further to my letter o f 25 May 1999 I have now discussed this matter with Tan Daines.

 By way o f background I should say that the addresses of officers and former officers are held by way
 o f computer records.

 Serving officers are required to provide their address to the Chief Constable pursuant to Regulations
 which require the Chief Constable to approve residence in a particular place.

 The addresses o f retired officers are held for pension purposes.

 It follows from the foregoing that any provision of addresses without consent would amount to a
 breach o f the Data Protection Act.

 Having regard to this and other factors M r Daines has decided that he will not provide the addresses
 requested without consent o f the officers and former officers concerned.

 Therefore the two options are those previous floated, namely that either Mr Daines will write to the
 officers and former officers named and ask them if they consent to their addresses being provided

         Hillsborough Stadium Disaster 1989
         Officers Addresses______ ________

 ***     I enclose copies o f my exchange of correspondence on this issue with the HFSG.

         I start from the proposition that if other things were equal a police force should generally expect to
         act in a way which allows justice to take its course. Thus if this was a question o f making available
         documents prepared in the course o f a criminal investigation then whatever views we had about the
         merits it would be proper to make them available subject to being satisfied as to materiality and
         payment o f costs. That is in fact the exact line you have adopted. However the information now
         being sought is not the fruit o f a criminal investigation but is in the hands of the SYP as employer or
         former employer o f these officers.

         That being the case, I believe that there are legal objections to passing over these addresses to the
         HFSG without the officers7 consent. In particulan-

         1.            On the assumption that the addresses are held as computerised records the Data Protection
                       Act 1984 applies. [NB that when the Date Protection Act 1998 is brought into force (no
                       date yet) this distinction will disappear and the same law will apply to paper records as to
                       computer records. ]

         2.            The Force will have a Data Protection Registration Certificate which will no doubt provide
                       for legal disclosure o f information held by the Force for a wide variety o f purposes and to a
         Offices aba

                                                                                                      26 May 1999
                                                                                                    Ian Daines Esq
                                                                                          Assistant Chief Constable
                                                                                            South Yorkshire Police

                     wide variety o f persons. I would be surprised if this included disclosure o f addresses to a
                     private prosecutor but this is something which you would ha.ve to check before making a.
                     definitive statement to that effect.

           3.       I f disclosure o f the data to a private prosecutor is not covered by the registration then prima
                     facie such disclosure would amount to a criminal offence under Section 5(2)(d) DPA 1984.

           4.1.     Personal data arc exempt from the non-disclosure provisions where the disclosure is (inter
                    alia) for the purpose o f prosecuting an offender; but

           4.2.     That provision is expressed to operate as. a defence to a person charged with an alienee
                    under Section 5(2)(d) who then lias to "prove that he had reasonable g i'o n m h fo r believing
                    that failure to make the disclosure would h a w been likely to p reju d ice   the prosecution
                     o fa n   o ffe n d e r



           5.       As you can appreciate I am not particularly happy about advising you to put yourself at risk
                    o f a prosecution where the law then requires you lo “prove” something in order to make out
                    a defence.

           6.       Aside from the foregoing there are civil remedies in the Act (Section 23) and at common law
                    (see for example Swimiey -v- Northumbria Police. [The Timex May 25 1999] which allow a
                    person whose data are the subject o f unauthorised or negligent disclosure to sue for
                    compensation. It could be argued that disclosure of addresses in this case would be neither
                    unauthorised nor negligent buL the position is not clear cut.

           7.       Finally, the original CPS guidance given on 15 July 1998 dealt with the disclosure of
                    addresses. The guidance is that every effort should be made to obtain consent, before any
                    consideration is given to disclosure without consent. 1 have not overlooked the fact that the
                    separate guidance on disclosure o f statements lias effectively been superseded by our own
                    decision to offer voluntary disclosure on terms. However, disclosure o f statements o f police
                    officers would be most unlikely to provide a home address and it is my view that specific
                    disclosure o f addresses raises different issues a n d that the guidance in that respect, remains
                    valid.

           You may think it worthwhile instructing me to obtain Counsel’s opinion on the matters raised above.
           I f that is to be done then I think Counsel would need to liavc:-

           1.       A copy of the South Yorkshire Police Data Protection Registration Certificate including
                    details o f authorised recipients of information.

           2.       Confirmation that the addresses conecrncd are held in computerised rather than paper record
                    form.

           Dear Miss Adlington

           Hillsborough ; Officers Addresses

           Further to my fax o f 21 May 1999 my clients have suggested ihat you may care to provide a letter
           addressed to each officer (presumably in identical terms) inviting them to contact you direct if they
           wish to do so thereby avoiding the need for our clients to act as intermediaries and also allowing
           those officers or ex officers who wish to respond the ability to do so direct, Obviousiy your letter
           should provide appropriate contact numbers and/or addresses and my clients will then forward it.
           with a letter indicating simply that this communication has been received.

           On the assumption that your letters will not be controversial it may save time i f these are sent direct
           for the attention o f lan Daines at Police Headquarters at Snig Hill in Sheffield but if you do take this
           course o f action it might be helpful if you let me have a copy of a sample letter ( a s s u m i n g they will
           all be in the same terms) so that I am in a position to comment i f asked to do so.

           Yours sincerely

           Dear Miss Adlington

           Hillsborough : Officers Addresses

           Further to my fax o f 21 May 1999 my clients have suggested that you may care to provide a letter
           addressed to each officer (presumably in identical terms) inviting them to contact you direct if they
           wish to do so thereby avoiding the need for our clients to act as intermediaries and also allowing
           those officers or ex officers who wish to respond the ability to do so direct. Obviously your letter
           should provide appropriate contact numbers and/or addresses and my clients will then forward it
           with a letter indicating simply that this communication has been received.

           On the assumption that your letters will not. be controversial it may save time if these are sent direct
           for the attention o f Ian Daines at Police Headquarters at Snig Hill in Sheffield but if you do take this
           course o f action it might be helpful if you let me h a v e a copy of a sample letter (assuming they will
           all be in the same terms) so that I am in a position lo comment if asked to do so,

           Yours sincerely

    Your R ef PCM.SB.CHI.57 9

    Dear Mr Metcalf

    Further to your fax of 24 May 1999 we are usable to agree to the procedure you have
    suggested. We share your objective that the South Yorkshire police should not act as
    intermediaries between us and the witnesses. This would clearly be inappropriate not least
    because o f the position taken by the Police Authority in regards to fUnding.

    We would invite you to provide the addresses of the individual officers as requested.
    Naturally these addresses would be treated in the strictest confidence once received. No
    doubt your client would not, wish to be seen to impede or control access to potential
    witnesses.


    Yours sincerely

     Dear Miss Adlington

     Hillsborough : Officers Addresses

     Thank you for your Fax o f 25 May 1999, I will put your request to my clients but in view of the
     legal complications surrounding the release o f addresses (or last known addresses) without consent I
     would be surprised if they were to alter their position. Given that no progress will be made while my
     clients are considering the position you may wish to consider whether it is worthwhile providing the
     letters suggested in my fax o f 24 May 1999 so that ai least these can be sent out,

     I have no objection to your doing this without prejudice to your contention and you should be given
     the addresses in any event.

     Yours sincerely

Dear Ms Adlington

SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE ARCHIVE

I refer to your faxed letter of 15 November 1999, our telephone conversation and my fax of
16 November 1999. Please find enclosed a schedule of the documents, statements, photographs
and indexes disclosed and copied to you, between 17 September and 2 November 1999.

Moving on to the other points in your letter, whilst I disclosed to you on 16 September 1999 two
statements, S3718 and S3718A, made by former PC                and again, on 17 September 1999,
together with a Police Officers’ Questionnaire (QPO) completed by             you did not request and
I did not supply you with copies of these statements.

I am unsure of and cannot identify the relevance of the Index of Actions from HOLMES to the
Prosecution in the case of Adlington - V - Duckenfield and Murray. Nor can I find anything in the
order in respect of material held by the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police in the
“Hillsborough Archive” made by the Honourable Mr Justice Hooper in the High Court, on 3
September 1999, that required disclosure of this index. I have discussed this with Mr George
Croston of the Crown Prosecution Service and am declining to disclose the index. Having said
this, I would point out that there are 8,678 actions on the index and I estimate that it would take
over three hours just to print it, providing the equipment could function correctly over this period.

Finally, I am presently unable to ascertain the whereabouts of the photographs which should have
been in the file marked Hicks. A search of likely places in the archive has not revealed them, but I
will continue to look for them as and when I am working in there.

Dear M r Hepworth

SYP Archive

Solicitors for M r Murray have asked me to provide an index o f all material “uplifted” from the
archive. In order to ensure that I have provided copies o f all material to the defence, I should
be grateful if you would forward a copy o f your list. As discussed previously, I am unable to
locate the statement o f PC            yet I am almost certain that I have been provided with a
copy o f his statement. I f this is t le case, I should be grateful if you would send me a further
copy.

Leading Counsel has also advised me to obtain an index o f “Actions”.

Finally, were you able to ascertain the whereabouts o f the photographs which ought to have
been in the file marked “Hicks”? You will recall that I drew this to your attention on 28
October.

I thank you for your assistance.



Yours sincerely




Ann Adlington
Solicitor

 A t 9.00a.m . (0900) on Saturday, 15 A pril 1989 (150489), I paraded for

    duty at Ecclesfield Police Station for duties in connection w ith the

 F.A. Cup Sem i-Final betw een Liverpool and N ottingham Forest to be

 played at H illsborough.

 A t 9.30 a.m. (0930) the sam e day I arrived at H illsborough. I was in

 charge o f sub-sector 5, N orth Stand, serials 11 and 12. I made

 contact w ith the Sergeants in charge o f these serials and issued them

 w ith their serial orders and papers regarding intelligence m atters.
m
^ B o th Sergeants reported their serials up to strength.

 A t 10.00 a.m. (1000) a m ain briefing was given to all officers in

 the N orth Stand by C hief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD. Further

 briefings w ere given by Superintendent M URRAY, D etective Sergeant

 CHARLESW ORTH and Inspector SEW ELL.

 A t 10.30 a .m (1030) I briefed m y serial Sergeants and they inform ed

 me o f the deploym ent o f their officers in relation to their serial

 duties. C hief Inspector CREA SER was m y sector com m ander and

 A t 11.15 a.m. (1115) in the N orth Stand I briefed approxim ately two

 dozen stew ards w ho w ould be on duty in the N orth Stand on the

 em ergency evacuation procedure, their responsbility in relation to

 tickets and seating and the exit o f supporters at the end o f the game.

 I also told them to notify the nearest Policem an should they encounter

 any problem s. A pproxim ately six o f the stew ards said this was their

 first tim e as stew ards. T he C hief Steward, w hose nam e I can't

 recall, then gave them another briefing, w hereupon I left to carry out

 other duties.

 D uring the tim e betw een 11.30 a.m. (1130) and 2.40 p.m . (1440) I

^ p i a l l y visited the officers on the inside o f the turnstiles and

 then back and through both levels o f the N orth Stand. It was a

 circular route. B etw een 2.00 p.m. (1400) and 2.40 p.m. (1440) I was

 on that circular route checking both levels o f the N orth Stand back

 towards the turnstiles at Leppings Lane. Som e Liverpool supporters

 whom I saw had been drinking, the m ajority w ere well behaved. They

 were not drunk but had had som e alcohol and sm elled strongly o f it.

 It was not until later that events and people turned sour. These

 people entered the ground via turnstiles at Leppings Lane and entered

 the N orth Stand.

    about 2.40 p.m . (1440) I jo in ed officers under m y com m and and were

 engaged on duties at the rear o f turnstiles 1 - 8 at the Leppings Lane

 end w hich gives access to the N orth Stand. I had heard over the radio

 o f som e problem s at the Leppings Lane end involving crushing, so I

 decided to go and see w hat was happening. I could see through the

 turnstiles a very, very large crow d m assed from the turnstiles back

 across the road com pletely covering that area. People at the front,

before they could get through the turnstiles, w ere being pushed and

crushed against each other, against the w all betw een the turnstiles

and against gate 'A ', a concertina gate. As I saw this the officers

  on duty there told m e o f the problem and that it had been going on

  for som e time. A s people entered through the turnstiles into the

  ground they approached me, nearly everyone shouting abuse about the

  situation outside and saying that if som ething isn't done then people

  will be crushed and killed outside. I told these people I was aware

  o f the problem and tried to reassure them. Som e replied w ith abusive

  rem arks such as, 'Y O U BASTARDS COULDN'T POLICE A PISS U P,’ and 'YOU

  CUNTS W ILL K ILL SOM EONE OUT THERE.’ Some o f the younger m ales had

  been drinking, som e w orse for drink w ere using obscene language

  tow ards m e and other officers such as ’BASTARD BISSIES,’ and

 ^ p ^ A C K G ETS.’ I w arned several about their conduct and language.

  They w ere dragged aw ay b y other youths and disappeared into the crowd.

  N o further action was taken against them , it w ould have caused

  m ore problem s than it w ould have solved.

  As the Liverpool supporters w ere entering I saw that som e o f the w om en

  and children w ere w hite faced, visibly shaking and crying. Police

  O fficers who w ere on turnstile duty outside (F2 T)’ G roup officers,

  Police Constables 43, 602, 3027) had to clim b over the turnstiles to

  avoid being crushed them selves. These officers w ere also visibly

  shaken/shocked, w hite faced and they said the situation outside was

^ ^ b e a r a b le and people w ere being crushed. I saw people clim bing over

  the w all onto the ro o f o f the turnstiles gaining access to the rear o f

  the W est Stand/Leppings Lane terracing. I could hear only part radio

  m essages about the situation and about a gate to be opened.

  I heard gates ’A ’ and ’C ’ m entioned. W hen the radio was free I

  radioed into the control room , telling them w hat the situation was

  like as I saw it and asked for clarification if any gates should be

  opened. T he reply was broken and interrupted. I again asked for

  clarification and the reply was no gates to be opened. The situation

  continued and two to three m inutes later it appeared to be getting

  w orse and gate 'A ' was being pushed against from outside and visibly

  bow ing under the pressure. I heard over the radio instructions for

  the gate, including gate 'A ', to be opened. O fficers at gate 'A'

  opened it and a Police cordon was placed at the side o f the gate to

  the fencing to funnel people into the ground tow ards the N orth Stand.

  N o one was allow ed to enter o r attem pt to enter the area to the rear

  o f the W est Stand/Leppings Lane terrace. This influx o f people lasted

  two to three m inutes and pressure outside was relieved. A s the people

  entered som e w ere abusive, blam ing the Police for the problem s outside

  (sw earing and cursing). Tickets as far as I'm aw are w ere not taken or

 ^ p ^ p le checked for tickets. As the situation becam e calm I left the

  area and returned to the N orth Stand.

  Shortly after kick o ff I entered the N orth Stand and saw a num ber o f

  people and Police O fficers on the track and field behind the goal and

  in front o f the W est Stand/Leppings Lane terrace. I m ade m y w ay down

  and as I did I could see people clim bing over the perim eter fence to

  go onto the pitch. A t first I thought fighting had broken out but as

  I arrived behind the goal by the centre pen, I could see there was no

  fight but people trying to escape the crush. O thers w ere scrambling

  over the side fences to the side pens and others clim bing and being

^ p f te d into the W est Stand by people already in the stand. The

  em ergency gate was opened and people w ere escaping, being pulled

  through the gate by Police O fficers. I could see people on the ground

  inside the centre pen by the em ergency gate being tram pled on by

  people trying to escape. Some people w ere alive but trapped by their

  legs under other people. Police O fficers w ere pulling people through

  the gate and helping others over the fence. I could see people

  crushed against the fence, they w ere blue/purple in colour, others

  w ere scream ing for help. People to the rear o f the pen w ouldn't or

  couldn't m ove back, despite num erous shouts and arm w aving requests to

   move back and out through the tunnel. I saw it was necessary to gain

   access to the pen to help people and organise things, so I and a small

   group o f officers m anaged to gain access to the pen.

   I could see, once inside the pen, the bodies o f a large num ber o f

  people piled on top o f each other, one o f the bodies was a child aged

  about 10 years and no bigger than m y ow n son. T heir faces w ere blue-

  ish/purple in colour w ith legs and arm s tw isted, tucked under them and

  other bodies. T hey w ere obviously dead. I continued to shout at

  people in the pen to m ove back and out through the tunnel and w aved my

  arms to this effect. T hey didn't m ove. Some o f them shouted abuse, I

 ^ p r d som eone shout, ’M URD ERIN G BASTARDS,’ spat and som e coins and a

  gobstopper (sw eet) hit m e as we tried to help. People in the W est

  Stand and side pens also shouted abuse, spat and threw some objects.

  The throw ing o f objects and coins didn't last long, a few seconds, but

  the abuse and spitting continued from the W est Stand and pens.

  Remarks like, 'FU CKIN G B ISSIES,' w ere used. There were a num ber o f

  people in the pen on the ground who w ere alive and I directed and

  assisted officers to get them out through the em ergency gate onto the

  pitch. They w ere passed to officers on the track. A s m ore and m ore

  officers gained access to the pen people w ere eventually m oved back

^ J ^ d out through the tunnel. Bodies w ere rem oved out onto the track to

  w aiting officers. I assisted in rem oval o f the bodies from the pen.

  I do not know the identity o f the officers who received the bodies.

  There w ere such a large num ber o f bodies, I don't know the exact

  num ber I assisted/directed in m oving. I could see a crush barrier had

  given aw ay and was bent alm ost to the ground on the left hand side

  o f it as you look from the track. W hen all the bodies had been

  rem oved, the pen w ith people still inside was preserved on

  Superintendent G reenw ood's instructions and left as it was for the

 tim e being. A short tim e later, tw o Scenes o f Crim e O fficers in

  civilian clothes entered the pen and started to take photographs. The

  sm all group o f people still in the pen m ade hostile approaches to them

  and they had to quickly leave the pen, assisted by Uniform officers.

  I saw people, including Policem en and Policew om en, in various stages

  o f shock, they w ere w alking about in a daze, others crying and one

  even shouting at other Police O fficers for no apparent reason. They

  w ere all directed to the Police Room for treatm ent. Some, including

  som e Police O fficers, refused. I then stood by at the Leppings Lane

  end, then stood by in the N orth Stand. I located m y serial

  Sergeants and they eventually reported the position o f their serials.

 0^    officer from serial 11, Police Constable 2409 had been taken to

  hospital w ith concussion. They w ere then stood down. A fter a short

  outside the ground as a Police Constable and Police Sergeant and now

  as an Inspector. I am thoroughly conversant and experienced at

  w orking football m atches at H illsborough.

  Radio com m unication was not good. I found m essages fading or broken.

  to get them out to first aiders. This elation lasted only a few

  seconds and then I was dow n again until I found som eone else alive.

  A few people w ere found alive but there w ere m ore dead than alive.

sm all group o f idiots who drink and cause problem s and did so on the

day. The m ajority o f Liverpool supporters are decent, football

loving people.

A fterw ards I felt angry because we w ere being spat on and abused as we

tried to help people.

in concentration.

 Dear Ms Adlington
                                                                                                                                   n Gjan 1999

 Hillsborough Stadium Disaster 1989
 Private Prosecutions - Release of Documentation

 Thank you for your letter o f 3 I December 1998.

 It is disappointing that you do not indicate clearly an intention to accept the proposals which have
 been put forward but instead raise a number o f issues many of which are o f doubtful relevance.

 What ever may have been said in Court about a Judicial Review my understanding is that no
 proceedings have been commenced. Ifju c h proceedings are commenced and/or leave is obtained
 the legal position will again arguably revert to what it was before the DPP’s decision was
 announced. In other words there will again be the possibility o f intervention and it is arguable that
 the South Yorkshire Police should then revert to the original guidance o f the CPS which was to
 await the decision before considering release o f documentation.

 I am bound to point out that had you simply accepted the offer instead o f raising this and the other
 queries the process o f disclosure could by now be underway.

 You have asked for clarification on other matters and I am observing your paragraph lettering:-

 (A)           Guidance requested for the CPS by the Chief Constable is provided pursuant to the
               Prosecution o f Offences Act 1985 and is confidential. You will have to take on trust that it
               has been accurately summarised in our correspondence.

 (B)         I do not know what undertakings could possibly be implied at common law. Unless it is your
             intention to misuse the material you should have no problem giving the required undertaking.

             The difference between prosecution and defence is that you are asking for the material
             whereas the defence is not. It is part o f the CPS guidance that material be copied to the
             defence if requested by and provided to the prosecution. Clearly an undertaking cannot be
             requested in circumstances where the CPS guidance requires that material be supplied,

(C)          I suggest that you raise this point if and when material which you request is refused on
             grounds o f lack o f materiality.

(D)          The proposed charge is a reasonable one. You ignore the fact that it will include the cost of
             black and white A4 photocopying (both to yourselves and the defence) You also ignore the
             fact that a documents officer cannot exist in a vacuum but requires office facilities and
             secretarial support. As to the drafting of invoices these will simply indicate the amount of
             hours spent in each period. Under English law an explanation is required if VAT is not
             chargeable rather than if it is.

(E)          This has being dealt with under (B) above.

(F)          This has been dealt with under (B) above

(G)          Quite simply this is none of your business.

I do not think the balance o f your letter requires comment save to note that we are in agreement that
the question o f voluntaiy disclosure is a separate matter from the Application for a Witness
Summons.

Turning to the latter we have reserved Counsel to appear at Court on 7 January 1999 and we do
need to know as soon as possible whether the hearing is to proceed. Obviously we will be seeking
to recover costs if Counsel appears and the matter is then adjourned.

Dear M r Metcalf,

Adlington v Murray: Adlington v Duckenfield


We have received your letter to us o f 4th January 1999. W e regret that you have taken such an
unco-operative and sullen attitude to our requests for further information. We have been told that
the CPS will inform us by tom orrow o f its own attitude to voluntary disclosure o f documents in
its possession, and we expect to be told by them matters relevant to the question o f disclosure by
South Yorkshire police. For that reason I am sending the CPS copies o f our recent
correspondence.

We are therefore unable to inform you whether the hearing on Thursday will proceed or not. For
the time being, we do not propose to ask the court to vacate the date, but if this position changes
in the light o f CPS guidance or information we shall let you know. I have the following questions
arising from your letter to which I should be grateful if I could have an answer before 5pm today,
in the hope that an informed decision may be taken as to whether the hearing should proceed on
Thursday.

1.     Is the South Yorkshire police force prepared to allow either me and other lawyers for the
       prosecution, or the lawyers for the defence, to see the papers we have listed in the draft
       schedules to the witness summonses in order to eliminate unnecessary copying and
       expense?

2.     Is the South Yorkshire police force prepared to hand over voluntarily the originals o f any
       o f the papers that have been specified on the draft schedules, or any other papers, either
       to the prosecution or the court?

I note that you are concerned about the costs o f Thursday’s hearing. My understanding o f the
attitude to costs taken by the South Yorkshire Police Authority in this case leads me to believe
that they are unlikely to leave you exposed.

I should point out that the South Yorkshire police appeared at the hearing on 21st December
because the magistrate requested it. I had assumed that you were proposing to appear or be
represented on 7th on the same basis. An application for a witness summons is usually made ex
parte. You are not, o f course, obliged to be present, and we are not obliged to inform you o f any
application we make for such a summons.

If you instruct counsel, that is because you have chosen to appear voluntarily at the hearing, and
you cannot expect us to meet you costs, nor, if you threaten us with applications for costs, can
you expect us to inform you o f our intentions in relation to summonses in future.


I look forward to your reply,



Yours sincerely,



Arm Adlington.

          Dear Madam

          RE: ADLINGTON v. DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

          I understand that you spoke to Mr Booth on 30 December 1998 on the question of
          voluntary disclosure in this case. I thought it would be helpful if I wrote setting out
          the position of the CPS.

          Given the enormous public interest in the case and the overriding need to ensure that
          there is a fair trial, the CPS is anxious to be as open and fair as possible. This means
          being fair to you the prosecutor as well as the defendants. I am sending a copy of this
          letter to the solicitors for the defendants.

          In our view, the course most likely to achieve fairness would be voluntary disclosure
          of some o f the material we hold. However, as you are aware, the South Yorkshire
          Police do not necessarily agree that voluntary disclosure is appropriate at this stage
          and they have, through their solicitors, suggested a delay until such time as the
          judicial review proceedings are concluded. Accordingly I have written to them
          indicating the CPS view but also asking whether there are any further reasons they
          can put forward which might influence our view. I have asked for a reply on or before
          6 January 1999 so that I can write to you before the hearing on 7 January 1999 with
          the CPS decision in principle.

          I refer to 'some’ o f the material. I know that there have been discussions about the
          material held by the CPS. It is not our intention to disclose material which attracts
          either legal professional privilege or public interest immunity. For example, we will
          not voluntarily disclose copies of counsel’s advice, our own internal memoranda and
          opinions nor correspondence with the police. In effect, the material we are proposing
          that we will disclose will comprise copies of witness statements and accompanying
          exhibits. Of course, disclosure will be even handed and we intend that any material or
          facility we make available to you will also be made available to the solicitors for the
          defendants.


                                                                   (ISJ)
                            C r o w n P r o s e c u tio n   S e r v ic e 'W & r k r n g i n   th e     i n tc m s ts o f J u s tic e

            You will be aware that the material we hold does not comprise original witness
            statements as, to the best o f my knowledge, they are held by the police.

            It appears from correspondence that you have already acquired a large amount o f
            material as you have pointed out differences between versions o f the same witness
            statement. To avoid unnecessary duplication, it would be very helpful if you could
            provide a list of the material you already hold so that we can see what further material
            you require. Alternatively, you might like to indicate on a copy o f the schedule we
            provided what further material it is that you require.

            I will endeavour to make a decision before the next court hearing but will write again
            in any event.

            Yours faithfully

Dear Mr Enzor

I thank you for your letter o f 3 lsl December 1998. As you know there is a hearing listed at
Leeds District Court for Thursday 7th January, which it may be possible to avoid, in the
interests of saving costs. We enclose a copy o f the letters that have been exchanged between
us and Hammond Suddards.

We should be very grateful to receive tomorrow your written confirmation that the voluntary
disclosure procedure will proceed in relation to CPS material. You will see that Mr Metcalf
has not indicated any objections to this CPS disclosure.

You will note that Mr M etcalf still claims to be relying on your “guidance”. I should be very
grateful if you could guide him so far as to suggest that he should not look to us to pay his ,
exorbitant costs o f copying to the defence the material we seek.


Yours sincerely

       R E : ADLINGTON v. DUCKENFIELD AND M URRAY

       Further to our telephone conversation o f yesterday, I can confirm that the Crow n
       Prosecution Service is now ready to give voluntary disclosure o f relevant docum ents
       in our possession having considered representations from the South Y orkshire police.

      This disclosure w ill be in accordance w ith the procedure noted in our letter o f 31
      D ecem ber 1998 to you and w hich w as copied to the solicitors for both defendants. It
      will be evenhanded as betw een the parties and w ill not include docum ents subject to
      legal privilege or public interest im m unity.

      W e consider that it w ould be right and proper to m ake a charge for this voluntary
      disclosure based on the cost price o f the service provided to this office by our
      photocopying contractor. This w ould b e j. charge o f 1.9 pence per page. H ow ever,
      w e have decided that the first £50 o f charges to any party w ill be paid by us . A bill
      for the rem aining am ount, i f any, w ill be sent direct to that party from the contractor,
      A lphagraphics.

      I note your request in the last paragraph o f your letter o f 5 January 1999. I regret that
      I am unable to advise the C h ie f C onstable o f South Y orkshire on any m atter unless a
      formal request has been m ade by him or those acting for him . That is not the case
      here.

      Please contact m e to arrange a date and tim e for your inspection o f our docum ents at
      this office. I understand that M onday 11 January 1999 m ay be suitable to you.

      Yours sincerely _______ .

 Private Prosecutions - Release o f Documentation

 Thank you for your fax timed at 11:47 on 5 January 19 9 9 .

I must say at the outset that your request for a response by 5:00 pm yesterday was unrealistic. Both
I and, more particularly, the A ssistant Chief Constable have other responsibilities besides dealing
with your correspondence. It seems to me that your request for an urgent response has been
dictated by your linking the issue o f disclosure o f docum ents from the Hillsborough archive with the
hearing dealing with your A pplication for a W itness Summons.

W e have already m ade it clear that we do not regard the tw o issues as connected and the
Application for th e W itness Sum m ons wifi be resisted if persisted with.

I f you are linking the tw o issues then it was clearly not sensible for your Leading Counsel to urge the
Stipendiary M agistrate to re-list the m atter for hearing so quickly, but that is a problem entirely o f
your own making.

Turning to the substance o f your letter I note that you still do not actually indicate w hether or not
you will be taking up th e disclosure offer which was made a w eek ago.

To deal with the different points which you do raise.-

 1.          Subject to the previously mentioned points m ade at 1 (priority) and 2.3 (materiality) o f my
             letter o f 30 D ecem ber 1998, w e have no objection to you personally, as a qualified practising
             solicitor, examining docum entation rather than taking copies. I f you wish lawyers other than

       yourself to be involved you m ust state w ho they are and confirm their legally qualified status.
       I f the D efence wish to inspect docum entation they will have to ask.

       W hat must be clearly understood is that there are cost implications in providing the
       docum entation for inspection and the same charge as previously mentioned will apply in
       respect o f the sorting o f docum ents to and from the archive, the provision o f inspection
       facilities and the presence o f the docum ents’ officer to deal with any queries.

2.     Turning to the question o f production o f original docum entation the first point to be made is
       that if a C ourt o f com petent jurisdiction orders the production o f any docum entation then
       such an O rder will o f course be complied with.

       Subject to that I should say that the original CPS guidance was that it would be
       inappropriate for original statements to be rem oved from the main H illsborough archive.
       Their suggestion w as that if copy statem ents had been provided then it should be a simple
       m atter for new originals to be prepared by the prosecution and used in Court proceedings.

       As to other evidence I have not inspected the archive but I believe that a very large number
       o f the item s in it will themselves be copies rather than original items. W here how ever an item
       is clearly identified as original and is required for production at C ourt then subject to the
       C ourt agreeing to accept custody o f that item I would not anticipate this presenting any
       problem.

Yours sincerely

R e le a s e o f d o c u m e n ta tio n



I refer to previous correspondence in th e above m atter. P lease confirm by 22nd M arch that
the Chief Constable will pro d u ce to us, alternatively to the Leeds D istrict M agistrates’ Court,
on a voluntary basis the follow ing docum ents and things:

1.         The originals o f all statem ents o f w itnesses upon w hom w e have indicated w e intend to
           rely in com mittal proceedings o r w hose statem ents will form a supplem entary bundle.
           (Please see Schedule 1). N o d o u b t you will have been inform ed th at at th e hearing in
           Leeds on 21“ D ecem ber, the Stipendiary stated that it w ould be sensible fo r SYP to
           produce the originals o f statem ents at this-'stage. H e stressed that the committal
           proceedings should be orderly. F urther, it may be the case that the D efence will agree
           some statem ents thereby obviating the need to call live evidence. O bviously, w e will
           need the originals o f any such statem ents.

2.         The originals o f the docum ents and exhibits listed in Schedule 2. P lease n o te that
           these w ere referred to in Schedule D o f the draft application fo r a W itness summons.
           Again, on 21st D ecem ber, th e Stipendiary com m ented that there m ust b e many
           docum ents in Schedule D th at com e w ithin the definition o f “m aterial and relevant” for
           the purposes o f section 9 7 o f M agistrates’ C ourts A ct 1980. Y o u w ill see that these
           documents and things are all o f prim ary and obvious relevance to th e issues in the case.



3.        Y ou have been provided w ith copies o f the Inform ations and subm issions presented to
          the Leeds co u rt in July 1998 and w e do n o t believe it is necessary to explain item by
          item why each o f th o se item s is relevant. Y ou have also have seen o u r detailed


                                                                  P ag e 1 o f 2

       submissions about the cases against bo th defendants in the file o f m aterial produced in
       the course o f the funding dispute, about w hich w e have already w ritten to you today
       twice. H ow ever, y ou will appreciate that plans, photographs, charts, video recordings
       and tape recordings are all material evidence in criminal proceedings if they are
       relevant to th e issues. It will obviously be necessary for the court to see the layout o f
       the ground as it w as at the time in detail. Item 189 is relevant to the question o f how
       many supporters w ere still to be adm itted w hen the pens becam e crow ded. Standing
       Instructions, operational orders and briefing notes as specified are all relevant to the
       know ledge o f the defendants o f facts central to the charges. The radio tapes items
       211-220 are likely to contain very im portant evidence as to w hat w as said about the
       circumstances in w hich gate C w as opened.

4.     The originals o f notes/docum ents referred to in officers’ statem ents and
        correspondence. (S chedule 3) The notes and reports referred to in this schedule are all
        likely to contain contem poraneous and highly material accounts o f the disaster. They
       will also contain assertions m ade by M r D uckenfield and M r M urray about w hat M r
       Duckenfield did and said betw een 2.30 and 5pm in connection w ith the circumstances
       in which gate C becam e open, and about the disaster generally. They will also contain
        assertions o f m aterial evidential value from other officers present at the disaster and/or
       the briefings. All these assertions are likely to be admissible and m aterial evidence
       under section 2 4 o f th e Criminal Justice A ct 1988, o r in the case o f the defendants,
       evidence o f adm ission by either defendant. These notes will be admissible in evidence
       even if the w itnesses w ho m ake them are not called, subject to a discretion to exclude
       possessed by th e ju d g e at trial.

5.     The originals o f the exhibits o f PC T revor B ichard called TB 1-4 and footage from the
       clubs’s cam eras positioned in the area o f gate C, tog eth er w ith originals o f
       photographs referred to in D etective Sergeant C arr’s report dated 25th A pril 1989.

6.     Please n o te that i f you fail to respond satisfactorily by 22nd M arch I will tre at this as a
        refusal under Section 9 7 M agistrates C o u rt A c t 1980, and take my ow n course about
        applying fo r w itness sum m onses. Y ou will rem em ber th at w hen w e previously
        corresponded ab out “ voluntary disclosure”, you sought to im pose highly expensive
       and onerous conditions on us, in contrast to the open and willing co-operation w e
       received from th e CPS. B earing in m ind the history o f altered and concealed
       statem ents in this case, y o u will see th at w e do no t feel able, as a general rule, to invite
       the court to accept th e integrity o f copies, w here the originals are available.
       Furtherm ore, although th e b est evidence rule barely survives in the law o f evidence, all
       courts prefer to a c t on originals rather than copies, w here possible.

Yours faithfully

 Documentation_____________________

 Further to my fax o f 15 M arch 1999 the complete hard copy o f your letter arrived on 16 M arch
 1999.

 Firstly, I reiterate that if the C ourt orders the production o f any docum entation The C hief Constable
 will comply with the C ourt Order.

 Secondly, I have som e trouble in reconciling the balance o f your letter with the position previously
 reached in relation to docum entation. To reiterate:-

 1.          Whilst the D PP w as considering w hether to intervene in the prosecutions the policy o f The
             C hief Constable in accordance with guidance from the CPS was not to release any
             docum entation to any party.

 2.          Before the D PP decision w as announced on 18 D ecem ber 1998 you had applied to the C ourt
             for a W itness Sum m ons directed to ACC Ian Daines to produce a large num ber o f
             docum ents as evidence at the committal hearing.

 3.          It w as I think originally suggested that production should be ordered at some time other than
              the hearing but this contention w as not pursued.

 4.          In spite o f The C hief C onstable’s indication that he w ould consider the position in relation to
              the release o f docum ents once the D P P ’s decision w as to hand you proceeded with your

       Application on 21 December 1998 - the first working day after the DPP decision - and both
       you and ACC Ian Daines were represented by Counsel.

5.    I was not present at the hearing but as I understand it your Counsel spoke fo r quite some
       time and it may well be that during his address the Stipendiary Magistrate made remarks
       about what documentation might or might not be produced.

6.     However, when Counsel fo r M r Daines spoke she put forward the argument that much i f not
       all o f the material which you were seeking would not amount to admissible evidence in the
       hands o f M r Daines.

7.     Subsequently the hearing was adjourned. A t this stage I am not entirely clear whether this
       was fo r want o f time or to give you the opportunity o f considering the argument put forward
       but at all events no attempt has ever been made to resume the hearing.

8.    Subsequently The C hief Constable offered to provide access to documentation and exhibits
       on terms which there is no need for me to reiterate here.

Y our letter appears to ignore the history as set out above. To summarise:-

1.     The C hief Constable w ill produce to the Court any document which he is ordered to
       produce.

2.    The offer to provide copy documentation etc as set out in my letter o f 30 December 1998
       remains open.

3.    I f despite the above you believe that there is anything to be gained by proceeding w ith a
       Witness Summons then you shoy)d re-instate the Application previously issued which
        currently stands adjourned.

Yours sincerely

In relation to the hearing on 10 May can you tell me whether the intention is to apply only for an
order relating to the items excised from the list attached to the current summons. Alternatively will
you he seeking a summons relating to all the items referred to in your letter o f 12 March and in each
o f the Schedules 1 to 3? 1 should in any event say that Counsel's availability (which may be relevant
if this application is considered to be part heard) depends on the question o f whether another matter
is settled. I hope to have further information in the near future.

As to service my provisional view is that once a hard copy o f the summons has been actually
received by Ian Daines the sensible course would be for him. or myself on his behalf, to write
confirming receipt

1 thank you fo r your fax o f yesterday responding to my earlier one. I can confirm that at the
hearing on the 10"' May, we intend to apply fo r a witness summons relating to the items
excised from the list attached to the current summons. In relation to Schedule 1 forwarded to
you under cover o f my letter o f 12"' March, I am unable yet to say which o f those statements
we w ill be seeking by way o f witness summons. This is dependent upon the Defence
indicating which statements may be read out at committal and which witnesses they require us
to call to give oral evidence.

In relation to Schedule 4 o f the current summons, you w ill note that the material listed here is
that referred to in paragraph 5 o f my letter o f 12"' March.

Finally, 1 confirm that I am forwarding to M r Daines the original summons issued on Monday
and endorsed by the Stipendiary Magistrate. I should be grateful i f receipt could be
acknowledged.

Dear Ms Adlington
                                                                Hillsborough: Prosecutions

Thank you for your letter o f 28 April.

On behalf o f Ian Daines 1 confirm 1hat he has personally received the summons issued on 26 April.

In relation to Monday’s hearing there are two matters which I would like to raise:

1. Your letter o f 28 April leaves open the possibility that a summons will be sought on May 10 in
respect o f some or all o f the statements listed in Schedule 1. Can you please let m e know as soon as
possible if there is to be such an application and if so which statements will be sought.

2. Although it is possible to derive a list o f the documents to be sought on May 10 by comparing the
deleted sections o f the issued summons with the items listed in and with your letter o f March 12 it
would obviate any possibility o f an accidental error if a new list o f items sought was prepared for the

O ffices also at:

        London                         Manchester                         Bradford                      Lloyds of London                                 Brussels

A list o f Hie names o f the partners and tbeir professional qualifications is open to inspection at our offices. The partners are either solicitors or registered foreign lawyers.

 Looking at the Sum m ons as issued it is not absolutely clear to me w hat is now being referred to

 D ear Miss Adlington

 Hillsborough: Witness Summons

 Thank you for your fax o f 23 May 1999 with enclosures.

 I can now confirm that M r______ has received the original Witness Summons issued on 10 May
 1999,

H e tells me however that no sum has been tendered in payment o f the costs and expenses o f
production.

 Is this an oversight or is there no intention o f paying any expenses?

 Yours sincerely

 Thank you for your fax o f 23 M ay 1999 with enclosures.

 I can now confirm that M r                                         has received the original W itness Summons issued on 10 M ay

 H e tells me how ever that no sum has been tendered in payment o f the costs and expenses o f
 production.

 Is this an oversight or is there no intention o f paying any expenses?

Dear Mr Metcalf

Hillsborough: Witness Summons

I acknowledge receipt o f your fax o f 14thMay. Please confirm by return that Mr Paines has
received the original witness summons issued on 10th May.

Given the role played by Mr Daines in the past, I am astonished that he appears to be insisting
that he be paid conduct money. Please confirm that this is correct. If so, can you let me know
the precise mileage from Snig Hill to Leeds Magistrates’ Court. If necessary, I can arrange
for the precise amount o f cash to be tendered to Mr Daines at the meeting o f the South
Yorkshire Police Authority on Friday.

Finally, I understand that you have some concern that there may be difficulty in playing the
audio tapes as the machine necessary for playing the tapes might be obsolete. I should be
grateful if you would indicate the type o f equipment needed. If necessary we will secure the
equipment ourselves so as to avoid any unnecessary delays.

Yours sincerely

 Thank you for your fax o f 18 M ay 1999. I apologise for the spelling error in the fax o f 14 May
 1999 and confirm that M r Daines has received the Witness Summons.

 I think you have m isunderstood the rest o f my letter. 1 merely asked w hether the failure to tender
 any conduct money w as an oversight or w hether it was deliberate. I f the latter is the case then I was
 going to ask w hether this was because you_ contend that there is no requirem ent to tender conduct
 money to a police officer and, again, in that event, w hether you have an authority for this
 proposition.

 Perhaps w e can clarify this point before I take instructions.

 I f it w as the case that you agree that conduct money should be tendered then clearly this would have
 to cover the cost o f the operation as a whole rather than merely the cost o f travelling from Sheffield
 to Leeds. There does not appear to be a lot o f authority on the point but you may care to look at
 the unreported case o f M o r r i s & O t h e r s -v- B a n k o f A m e r i c a N a t i o n a l T r u s t & - S a v i n g s A s s o c i a t i o n

Rather than get into any argum ent at this stage may I suggest that you undertake to pay to M r
Daines such costs, if any, as are determined by the C ourt to be reasonable within the meaning o f
Section 97.

I have received an enquiry from the Court about machinery likely to be required to play the tapes
and I am trying to follow this up. M y understanding from a casual conversation with the Documents
Officer prior to the previous hearing is that these are m ulti-track tapes which will require some sort
o f special equipm ent in o rder to be played.

I will let you know as so o n as I have any further information.

Yours^sincerely             „—^      ^----- --

 I am told that the machine required to play the Control Room tapes is an ICR40 International
 Communications R ecorder/R eproducer. I understand that this would originally have been supplied
 by RACAL. The South Y orkshire Police no longer have this machine as the technology has since
 been superseded.

 I have com m unicated the above information to the M agistrates’ Clerk.

Witness Summons

1.    Thank you for your letter o f 18th May 1999 I do hope that you will be able to give us
      proper information about the equipment needed to play the tapes at court on Monday.
      On the matter o f Mr Daines’ costs, we shall o f course pay such costs as are determined
      by the court to be payable under section 97.

2.    We wrote to you last summer asking for addresses o f a number o f police officers who
      we might wish to interview or call as witnesses. The matter was left in abeyance
      pending the outcome o f the CPS review o f the case. We attach now an amended list
      o f officers whose addresses we seek. “We should be grateful to receive this
      information, which must be easily accessible to the Chief Constable, as soon as
      possible.

3.    As a result o f our continuing investigations into the case we request that you please
      supply the statements R516A and B, the second and third statements o f retired Police
      Sergeant Higgins. These should have formed part o f the statements which were placed
      in the House o f Commons library at the request o f the Home Secretary but these two
      were not there. They should therefore have been disclosed already. Please confirm
      that you will supply these without the formality o f a witness summons.

4.    We also wish to see transcripts o f interviews conducted by the West Midlands police
      with Police Constables Smith and Illingworth. We know o f the existence o f these
      statements from a transcript o f interview between the West Midlands police and
      Superintendent Marshall. We attach a copy o f the relevant page o f that interview.
      The contents o f these written interviews will obviously fall within section 24 o f the
      Criminal Justice Act 1988.
         Phone 0151 236 1919. Fax 0151 236 1936. E Mail info@hfsg.org
       lit Floor Central Buildings 41 North John Street Liverpool L2 6RR
5.     We also need to have copies o f the original statement made by Bernard Murray, which
       we have in a computerised form, unsigned, dated 3rd May 1989 with the reference
       R232. The statement w e have was obviously prepared by an operator o f the word
       processing system from a handwritten or typed original. The undated statement o f Mr
       Duckenfield (R230) is signed by him. We will need to produce the original o f that
       document to the court. Please confirm to us that there will no difficulty in supplying it
       for the committal proceedings.

6.    Mr Daines may think it would be sensible to bring the documents mentioned in
      paragraphs 3,4 and 5 above on Monday where if necessary, we can serve a witness
      summons upon him, in order to save the cost and inconvenience o f a separate hearing.

7.    On the 10th May Miss Varty argued on behalf o f the Chief Constable that a number o f
      computer generated documents that we were seeking would only be admissible in
      evidence if section 69 o f the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 was complied
      with. This is obviously a technical and formal matter, since no-one has ever suggested
      in previous enquiries that the Holmes computer system was defective. Accordingly,
      we shall seek to deal with this matter by a certificate drafted in accordance with
      Schedule 3 paragraph 8 o f the 1984 Act. After we have decided what documents will
      be presented to the court we shall draft a certificate and ask the appropriate person to
      sign it.

8.    Please indicate who occupied “a responsible position in relation to the operation o f the
      computer in 1989", who should sign the certificate as required by paragraph 8(d). The
      more inconvenient way o f complying with section 69 is to call a witness live to give
      the necessary evidence. If we had to take such a course, it seems to us that DS Carr
      would be the appropriate person to summon to court. We should be grateful in due
      course to receive your comments.

Yours sincerely




Ann Adlington

 D ear Miss Adlington

 H illsborough ; W itness S u m m o n s

 Thank you for your fax o f 19th May.

 Y ou will now have received my fax relating to the tape playing equipment.

 In relation to costs I shall be grateful if you will confirm that you personally as the Prosecutor will be
 responsible for paying such costs, if any, as are found to be reasonable within the meaning o f Section
 97 in respect o f M r Daines complying with the Witness Summons. Obviously, as with any Solicitor,
 I would expect you to ensure that funds are available to you to meet such costs but it seems to me
  i        t                           1                      *
 that, as you are the Prosecutor, only you can give the necessary undertaking.

 In relation to point 2 o f your letter my client is prepared to write to the Officers named (at their last
 known address in the case o f those w ho have retired) asking if they consent to have their addresses
 disclosed. I f consent is received they will be disclosed.

 In relation to numbered points 3, 4 and 5 I should say firstly that the copy page referred to in point 4
 w as not attached. M ore im portantly I note that these points all relate to W itness Statements or
 transcripts o f interview rather than docum ents o f the type which we have been concerned with in the
 present W itness Summons. I w as not present on 2 lsl December but my understanding is that the
 M agistrate accepted our C ounsel’s point that som ebody's statem ent could not be a docum ent which
 could be produced by another person under Section 24. If that point is to be revisited then it will no
 doubt need to be argued.

  As to points 7 and 8 this is a matter which requires careful cpnsideration. Much o f the input will
  have been carried out by West Midlands officers, presumably using their own equipment. The
  HOLMES system itself was not designed by South Yorkshire Police. Moreover one o f the
  documents (the turnstile count) is clearly the product o f the SWFC computer. My client is therefore
  considering the position in relation to your request.

  Dear Sir/Madam

  Statement of Evidence Regarding Documents to be Produced at Court

  Ia m required by the Leeds Magistrates Court to produce various documents to the Court at
  10.00 am, Monday 24 May 1999. i shall attend Court and produce all of those documents
  which I have been able to locate. I have prepared the attached witness statement which
  explains those documents of which I have found originals, those of which I have found
  copies and those which Ihave been unable to find.

 This afternoon the South Yorkshire Police Authority is meeting to consider paying the legal
 expenses of Messrs Duckenfield and Murray. They and their solicitors will be at the meeting,
 as will as Ms Adlington, the prosecutor. At that meeting I shall hand to the prosecutor and
 defendants a copy of m y statement with this covering letter.

 These arrangements have been made pursuant to the discussion between Peter Metcalfe,
 m y solicitor and the Clerk to the Court.                                          l ,

      Ia m Ian Dames, Assistant Chief Constable, South Yorkshire Police. Amongst m y many other

      duties is a responsibility to assist the Chief Constable in the handling of matters arising out of the

      Hillsborough Stadium Disaster of 15 April 1989. Itransferred from Northumbria Police to South

      Yorkshire Police on promotion to the rank of Assistant Chief Constable in July 1996. Ihad had no

      previous dealing with Hillsborough Stadium Disaster issues and took on this responsibility in 1997.



      The Chief Constable has an archive of material relating to the disaster which is kept at Heeley

      Police Station, Windsor Road, Sheffield. The archive is kept in a room which measures

   approximately 17 feet square. Itis stocked from floor to ceiling with Hillsborough Stadium Disaster

   material. This material includes maps, sketches, photographs, questionnaires, statements, video

  tapes, transcripts of Lord Justice Taylor's Public Enquiry and of the 1991 Inquest, copies of the

  T a y lo r Report and many other documents concerned with the disaster and its aftermath. These

  documents have arrived in the archive from a number of different sources. Some are generated

  by South Yorkshire Police staff, some were generated by the 1991 Inquest (and are held on behalf

  of the Coroner). Som e were generated by the West Midlands Police, who assisted Lord Justice

  Taylor in his Judicial Enquiry, and later prepared papers for the Director of Public Prosecutions.

  The archive contains perhaps as many as one million pieces of paper. The H O L M E S computer is

  used as an index to some of the material which is held in the archive.



  Icannot prove the authenticity of any document in the archive in the sense that Icannot say that

  the document is an accurate record of what itpurports to record nor that itwas made by the
  person who is purported to have made it.

  Continuation o f Statement o f IAN DAINES



      The archive is an historical record of a tragedy. Ia m required to produce to the court a large

      number of documents and Ido so. Iwould ask that these documents are returned to m e at the

      conclusion of these proceedings so that Ican preserve the integrity of the archive. Aiso Iwould

      ask that these documents are used only for the purpose of these proceedings as they relate to a

      traumatic event in the lives of many people,



      Ihave received a summons from the Leeds Magistrates Court, dated 26 April 1999. which was

      issued in connection with the prosecution by Ann Addlington of David Godfrey Duckenfield and

      Bernard Dean Murray. The summons requires m e to produce a large number of documents to the

      court on the 24 May 1999. Ihave caused staff to look most carefully for the documents described

      in the summons. In some cases they have found only copies. Iwill now go through the schedules

     of documents and each item individually. The summons requires m e to produce documents as

     listed in Schedules 1 to 4. There is no Schedule 1 so Ishall progress immediately to Schedule 2.



     Ia m required to produce a document described as “Plan by witness Holdsworth”,number 36, I

    have located a photocopy of a plan of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Hillsborough Ground. It

    bears the name Roger Holdsworth and a signature which could be that of Mr Holdsworth.



    Ia m required to produce a series of plan§,“prepared by Brades for the Judicial Enquiry”,document

    numbers 91, 92, 93, 94 and 95. Iproduce plans which purport to be prepared by Ralph Brade and

    Associates, Consulting Engineers. The plans are in the form of transparencies as used by

    draughtsmen and engineers but they bear no signatures. Ialso produce paper copies of these
    transparencies.



    Ia m required to produce documents “Prepared by the West Midlands Police for the Judicial

    Enquiry", these are document numbers 96, 97, 99, 100, 101, 103 and 106.

    Document 96 appears to m e to be a photocopy, itis not dated but has printed on itthe words

    “Surveyed 27/4/89" and purports to be singed by D R Goodhall.

      Document number 97 also appears to be a photocopy, itshows no date and contains the words

      “Surveyed 26/4/89”,itpurports to be singed by D R GoodhaN.

      Document number 99 is not signed but contains the following printed information “D.L.R. 5.1.90.”

      Document number 100 is not dated but contains the information “Surveyed 25/4/89", itpurports to

      be signed by D R Goodhall.

      Document number 101 purports to be signed by D R Goodhall and contains the information

      “Surveyed 21/4/89”.

      Each of m y references to survey dates is text printed on the documents and is not hand written.

      Each of the documents contains no date to indicate when the author signed it.

      Document number 103 purports to be singed by D R Goodhall but with no date of signing. There

      is printed text that itwas “Surveyed 21/4/89 - 25/4/89”.

      Document number 106 is not signed or dated by hand. On itis printed “D.L.R. 5.1.90."



      Ia m required to produce a “Plan of the Hillsborough Stadium prepared by Brades for the Judicial

      Enquiry”,document 107. The document is a piece of paper, A3 size, which shows the Sheffield

    Wednesday Football Club Hillsborough Ground. Itis not signed or dated and itselfcontains no

    information as to its author. Written in pencil in the top right-hand comer is “D2532”. On the

    H O L M E S computer index D2532 refers to a plan of the Hillsborough Stadium.



    Ia m required to produce the “B B C plan showing position of cameras and cameramen”,document

    108. I have located a document which purports to contain that information, itappears to be a

   photocopy. Itis not signed or dated and contains no information regarding its author. At the top of

   the page itis possible to decipher that itappears to be a fax from the BBC, timed at 1539 hours on
   17 April 1989.



   Ia m required to produce a number of albums of photographs, document numbers 149, 150, 151,

Dear Miss Adlington

Hillsborongh : Officers Addresses

Further to my fax of 21 May 1999 my clients have suggested that you may care to provide a letter
addressed to each officer (presumably in identical terms) inviting them to contact you direct if they
wish to do so thereby avoiding the need for our clients to act as intermediaries and also allowing
those officers or ex officers who wish to respond the ability to do so direct. Obviously your letter
should provide appropriate contact numbers and/or addresses and my clients will then forward it
with a letter indicating simply that this communication lias been received.

On the assumption that your letters will not.be controversial it may save time if these are sent direct
for the attention o f Ian Daines at Police Headquarters at Snig Hill in Sheffield but if you do take this
course o f action it might be helpful if you let me have a copy of a sample letter (assuming they will
all be in the same terms) so that 1 am in a position to comment if asked to do so.

Yours sincerely

Your Ref: PCM.SB.CHI.57-9

Dear Mr Metcalf

Further to your fax o f 24 May 1999 we are unable to agree to the procedure you have
suggested. We share your objective that the South Yorkshire police should not act as
intermediaries between us and the witnesses. This would clearly be inappropriate, not least
because o f the position taken by the Police Authority in regards to funding.

We would invite you to provide the addresses o f the individual officers as requested.
Naturally these addresses would be treated in the strictest confidence once received. No
doubt your client would not wish to be seen to impede or control access to potential
witnesses.


Yours sincerely

 Dear Miss Adlington

 Hillsborough : Officers Addresses

 Thank you for your fax o f 25 May 1999. I will put your request to my clients but in view o f the
 legal complications surrounding the release o f addresses (or last known addresses) without consent I
 would be surprised if they were to alter their position. Given that no progress will be made while my
 clients are considering the position you may wish to consider whether it is worthwhile providing the
 letters suggested in my fax o f 24 May 1999 so that at least these can be sent out.

 I have no objection to your doing this without prejudice to your contention and you should be given
 the addresses in any event.

 Yours sincerely

 Dear Miss Adlington

 Hillsborough : Officers Addresses

 Further to my letter o f 25 May 1999 I have now discussed this matter with Ian Daines.

 By way o f background I should say that the addresses of officers and former officers are held by way
 o f computer records.

 Serving officers are required to provide their address to the Chief Constable pursuant to Regulations
 which require the Chief Constable to approve residence in a particular place.

 The addresses o f retired officers are held tw-pension purposes

 It follows from the foregoing that any provision of addresses without consent would amount to a
 breach o f the Data Protection Act.

 Having regard to this and other factors Mr Daines has decided that he will not provide the addresses
 requested without consent o f the officers and former officers concerned.

 Therefore the two options are those previous floated, namely that either Mr Daines will write to the
 officers and former officers named and ask them if they consent to their addresses being provided

Mr W C Crawford


Dear Mr Crawford

I am the prosecutor in the pending criminal committal proceedings against David Duckenfield
and Bernard Murray for manslaughter arising out o f the Hillsborough disaster. The committal
proceedings are due to start on 5th July. After these proceedings were commenced in July
1998 the defendants applied to the Crown Prosecution Service to take over and discontinue
them.

This application failed and the decision o f the CPS to allow the prosecution to continue has
been upheld by the High Court (except in respect o f a charge o f attempting to pervert the
course o f justice against Mr Duckenfield which has been discontinued).

I have copies o f statements which you made in 1989, and am considering whether to call you
as a witness. However, I do not have your current address, which the Chief Constable o f
South Yorkshire police has declined to disclose to me. I am therefore sending this letter for
your attention in a sealed envelope, contained within another envelope addressed to Mr Ian
Daines, the Assistant Chief Constable, in the hope that he will forward the sealed letter to you
with your address on it.

I should be grateful if you would please make contact with me to discuss the matter.

Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Metcalf

You will recall that you wrote to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith on 11th November 1997 referring
to Chief Inspector Bettison’s note o f a meeting on 17th April 1989. At the Leeds Magistrates’
Court on 10thMay 1999, Ms Varty asserted that Mr Bettison was not present at the meeting
on 17th April. You had presumed he was present because o f a reference to “NB1" in a
schedule.

Please find enclosed copy Chief Constable’s briefing notes o f the meeting held on 17th April.
You will note that they give no indication as to who was present at the meeting. There is no
schedule appended to the notes and certainly nothing which would lead you to presume that
Mr Bettison was present. Can you please confirm whether or not the briefing notes are
complete. If there is a schedule in existence I should be grateful if you would provide me with
a copy. Finally, are you able to say whether any other meetings took place on 17* April 1989?


Yours sincerely

 Dear Sir

                               Adlington v Duckenfield and Murray

 As you are the custodian o f all original statements relating to the Hillsborough Disaster, it has
 not been possible for me to ascertain which statements comply with the requirements o f
 section 102 Magistrates’ Court Act 1980. Copy statements in my possession are, in the main,
 computer generated. You have previously refused witnesses access to their original
 statements quoting CPS guidance. It is understood that these will be produced to the court if
 ordered, and if available.

 At this stage it is imperative that I at least have copies o f the original signed statements so that
 I can fulfil my duty to the court and the defence. In the circumstances I should be grateful if
 you would provide me with copy signed statements o f those persons listed in the attached
 schedule.


 Yours faithfully

Dear M r Metcalf

I enclose a copy o f a letter and annexes which I have sent to M r Croston at the CPS. I refer
you particularly to paragraph 56. The contents o f the letter affect you and the Assistant Chief
Constable, and bear upon custody o f the archive. I invite you to make any observations about
the contents o f the letter to M r Croston and copy them to me. M r Daines’ comments in
relation to the matters raised at paragraphs 44 and 45 would be helpful.

The substance o f the Representations o f 24thiy\ugust and 24th September is contained in the
material w e sent you between December and February last and which was relevant to the
funding issue and the discretion o f the Police Authority. It is therefore unnecessary for us to
enclose them unless you request a copy. I assume you do not wish to see the selection o f the
edited and unedited statements because, o f course, you are familiar with them.

 Dear Miss Adlington

 H illsborough

 Thank you for your letters o f 1st and 4th June 1999.

 In relation to your letter o f 1st June the “schedule” referred to is a schedule o f the documents sent by
 South Yorkshire Police to

 Lord Justice Stuart Smith in October or November 1997 in response to the Judge’s request for
 information about the background to the taking o f Statements from South Yorkshire Police Officers.

 The Officer who prepared the schedule apparently decided to allocate references to each document
 based on where it had been located. I am told that the notes o f the meeting o f 17th April were found
 in a box o f documents left behind by M r Bettison when he left the South Yorkshire Police. The
 Officer therefore (I am told) marked the extract from these notes as “NB1”.

 When I w rote to Lord Justice Stuart Smith I had a copy erf the schedule o f documents but not copies
 o f the documents themselves and I made the assumption that the reference “N B1” indicated that this
 was a document prepared by M r Bettison. It seems that that was not the case and indeed, as you
 rightly observe, it seems that he was not even at the meeting which I understand also accords with
 his recollection.

 As to whether the briefing notes are complete I saw these notes for the first time shortly before the
 Magistrates Court Hearing on 24th May this year. They appear to be complete and M r Daines has

information is no better than yours.

As to your letter o f 4th June 1999 I have sent this on to M r Daines but I understand that he is on
leave until 21st June 1999 and I do not know to what extent he is in contact with his office. It would
be safest to assume that if there is to be response it will not arrive until the week commencing 21st
June.

             Dear Ms Adlington

            Hillsborough Stadium Disaster 1989 - Request for Information

            I refer to your letter dated 4 June 1999, which I have considered on m y return from leave
            today. Ihave a number of Hillsborough related enquiries to deai with so please bear with me
            ifIdo not cover all of the issues, fa m replying by fax as quickly as Ican but by the time you
            receive this Ishall be out of the office until the morning of Thursday 24 June 1999.

            You ask for original statements of 24 people in a schedule which begins with
            R oger Holdsworth and ends with Bernard Dean Murray. I have taken legal advice on your
            request and Ia m prepared to consent to it ifyou will provide m e with an assurance that this
            is your only req u est for signed statements. You will recall that previously you had asked for
            many copy statements but we could not come to an agreement about that. Ifyour request is
            limited to these 24 statements then Ican release them without charge or further conditions. I
            would also be obliged if you can assure*me that the statements are for use in connection
            with the committal proceedings and will be copied to both defendants.

            I refer now to your letter dated 11 June 1999, in which you ask m e lo provide you with the
            dates and places of death of Mr Lang and Mr Creaser so that you can obtain copy death
            certificates. Ihave not yet enquired whether we hold that information either in paper form or
            on computer record, obviously such information can be regarded as sensitive and Iwould be
            obliged ifyou could assist m e by telling m e why you wish to obtain a copy death certificate. I
            presume it is in some way connected to the committal proceedings but I would welcome a
            clear explanation.

            Yours sincerely

Dear M r Daines

Adlington v Duckenfield and Murray

I refer to your letter o f 21st June in response to mine o f 4th June. As stated in my letter o f 4th
June, it is imperative that I have at least copies o f the original signed statements so that I can
fulfil my duty to the Court and to the defence. Computer generated copy statements o f all 24
witnesses have been served on all parties. I will o f course serve all parties with any copies
which you now provide.                           *

I confirm that at the moment I do not envisage that w e will need any more statements for
committal proceedings. That situation may o f course change after committal.

In relation to the M r Lang and M r Creaser, I need to obtain copy death certificates for the
committal proceedings. Their statements have been served as part o f the committal bundle
and formal proof o f death will be necessary to render them admissible. I am sure that your
Pensions department will have the dates and places o f death.


Yours sincerely

            Dear Ms Adlington

            Adlington v Duckenfield and Murray

            Irefer to your fax of 23 June 1999. Iwill ask M r | t o provide you with copies of the
            original signed statements to which you refer. I have spoken to him and he tells me that
            there are some difficulties. For example there are statements by more than one person in
            one of the names to which you refer. I will ask M r | t o contact you direct about
            these matters and to forward the statements to you. I note your assurance that you do not
            envisage the need to ask for any more statements for the committal proceedings.

            Mr Lang died on 5 September 1990, at Barnsley.                   Mr Creaser died on 3 June 1996, at
            Barnsley

            My solicitor, Peter Metcalfe, has forwarded to m e your letter to him of 4 June 1999. Your
            letter to Mr Metcalfe included a copy of your letter to Mr Croston, Crown Prosecution Service.
            At paragraph 56, of your letter to Mr Croston you say that you have sent a copy of your letter
            to the Police Complaints Authority and to the former Coroner. Your letter quotes widely from
            the Chief Constable’s briefing notes. I produced that document to the court at Leeds as
            required by a witness summons. You have now furnished it to other people including the
            former Coroner who is no longer a public servant. I do not think you should have done that
            without the permission of the court. I do not propose to make an issue of this case but if
            there are further such cases Iwill be obliged to take the matter further.

ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD & MURRAY

I refer to your letter of 4 June 1999 to Assistant Chief Constable Ian Daines and subsequent
correspondence regarding the provision of copies of the original statements of 24 named
individuals in the schedule to that letter.

Please find enclosed copies of the various statements made by 23 of the 24 persons named.
Number 19, Peter Carr, did not make any statement, nor officer’s report regarding the disaster.
The two reports he did produce were internal for the use of South Yorkshire Police.

You should also be aware that the statement of number 13, Glen Kirton, whilst typed, produced in
the same format as for other members of the FA and appearing to be an original is unsigned.

Ihave also copied the original statement of Susan Elizabeth Davies requested in your letter dated
24 June 1999 and this is numbered 25 on the attached schedule.

Please note that Ihave N O T copied any of these statements to either defendant.

                 Dear Ms Adlington

                 Irefer to my fax of the afternoon of 5 July 1999. Ihave now received legal advice from my
                 solicitor, Peter Metcalfe. His advice is that I have no legal obligation to produce original
                 statements to the court. However, iftheir production is necessary to allow the proceedings
                 to continue efficiently then Iwould not wish to be obstructive by not producing them. Imust
                 say that your request came as something of a surprise as you had not previously suggested
                 that the original statements would be needed. I must also say that your request came to m y
                 attention on the morning of Monday 5 July 1999. by which time the committal proceedings
                 had already begun, having been scheduled some months ago.

                 Iwould ask you to explain why original statements are now needed when previously copies
                 were sufficient. Iwould also ask you to explain what you mean by producing the statements
                 at court. Are you suggesting that Ishould be there in person? Are you suggesting that the
                 statements should be handed to a named member of court staff? Are you suggesting that
                 the statements be handed to you? If you«re suggesting that the statements be handed to
                 you, I would require your undertaking, as a solicitor, that the statements be kept in safe
                 custody and returned immediately after the hearing unless, of course, the court orders that
                 they remain at the court.

                 Subject to a satisfactory response to the above Iwill be able to allow the original statements
                 to be produced.

                 In recent days I have received a number of faxes from you, the content of some overlaps
                 with the content of others. I have tried my best to respond to each either directly or by
                 asking Mr Hepworth to supply you with information. I do have many other duties, besides
                 dealing with the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster, and itwould help m e to reply to you properly
                 if you could furnish m e with a consolidated schedule of outstanding requests that are
                 relevant to the committal.

                 Yours sincerely

Dear M r Daines

Adlington v Duckenfield and Murray

I thank you for today’s fax referring to your fax o f 6th July. Unfortunately, I was unable to
respond to your earlier fax as I was away from the office for the whole o f last week.

In response to my request for original statements please find enclosed copy letter from M r
Metcalfe dated 6th January 1999 in which he confirms that South Yorkshire Police would
produce original documentation if ordered by a Court o f competent jurisdiction. Although
such an order has not been made I confirm that production o f the originals is necessary to
allow the proceedings to continue efficiently.

For a statement to be tendered in evidence at committal proceedings as opposed to calling a
witness to give live evidence, an original statement must tendered which complies with Section
102 M agistrates’ Court Act 1980. I have been requesting the Defence for some time to
indicate which witness statements could be read out. In the absence o f any written indication
by the Defence, the Magistrate, on 26th April and 10th May, declined to order the production o f
original statements on the grounds that where a witness gives live evidence, his previous
written statement is superseded by his deposition at committal.

I w rote to you on 4th June explaining that at that stage I needed to ascertain which o f our
witness statements complied with the requirements o f Section 102.

You responded by forwarding copies o f the original statements o f 24 o f the 25 witnesses. I
subsequently w rote on 2nd July requesting that you produce all original statements to the Court
including those o f Lang, Crawford, Creaser and White referred to in that letter, copies o f
which you had previously omitted to send. I further asked that you produce the original
statement o f Steve Curry.
As to the timing o f production I should be grateful if you would have them available for
production to the Court on Thursday 15th July at 2pm. At 11 am on that day the Stipendiary
will make a ruling on “abuse o f process”. Obviously we will not know until then whether
committal proceedings will in fact continue. I am sorry that I cannot give you a more definite
indication. As you will appreciate, such matters are beyond my control.

Please note that we also require you to produce the original o f DS C arr’s report as this will be
put in evidence under section 24 Criminal Justice Act 1988.

Finally, I still await copy statement o f Mr        ‘equested on 2nd July.

I am conscious that you do have other duties besides dealing with the Hillsborough Stadium
Disaster. I f M r Hepworth has any queries relating to the above, he may speak to me directly.


Yours sincerely




Ann Adlington

          Dear Mr Daines

          Or Friday 2 July I spoke to Ann Adiington and gave her my authority to
          approach you for the release of a statement I made in the aftermath of the
          Hillsborough disaster. I now understand you require a written request.
          Therefore, please accept this letter as my authority to release the statement to
          her directly.

          I was surprised to learn my statement, which had been given to the Officers of
          the West Midlands Police, is now in the South Yorkshire Police archives.

          Yours faithfully                                                      ^

    Dear M r Daines

    Adlington v Duckenfield and Murray
    Statement by

    Your letter was faxed to Ann Adlington today at Leeds M agistrates’ Court where Alun Jones
    QC brought it, and the relevant correspondence, to the attention o f the Stipendiary Magistrate.
    There has been a strong indication by the Stipendiary M agistrate that this statement must be
    faxed no later than Monday morning. The Defence have also indicated their support for this
    statement to be faxed.

    Obviously the witness needs to refresh his memory and the Defence needs a copy in advance
    for the purposes o f cross-examination. Can you, therefore, fax            statement to this
    office immediately.

Dear Ms Adlington

ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD

I refer to your letter dated 2 July 1999 addressed to Assistant Chief Constable Ian Daines,
acknowledging receipt of the copies of 44 original statements made by some 24 witnesses in
respect of the Hillsborough Disaster, which I had forwarded to you on 28 June last. You also
asked Mr Daines to note that I had not supplied copy original statements from four former South
Yorkshire police officers and he in turn has asked me to search the H O L M E S database and the
Hillsborough Archive to ascertain ifIcan locate these statements. This Ihave now done and Iwill
deal with each named individual in turn.

Anthony Gordon L A N G (deceased) statement dated 30 June 1990. A search of the West
Midlands Police H O L M E S database does not reveal the existence of a statement by LANG
bearing this date. A manual search of the Archive has also failed to reveal any further statements
other than the undated statement bearing the reference numbers R333 and S1074 and the
statement dated 1 June 1989 bearing the ceference numbers R333A and S1074A, copies of which
Ihave forwarded to you. Ido note however that at paragraph 20 of your letter dated 3 June 1999
to                      1 of the C P S Casework Directorate you make specific reference to the
statement of PC LA N G dated 30 June 1999 and Ipresume you have a copy of it. Ifthere is any
reference number written on that copy and you could communicate itto me itmay help me locate
the original. (Unfortunately Ihave not seen Appendix E to your letter).

William Cameron C R A W F O R D unamended statement dated 28 April 1989. A search of the
Hillsborough Archive revealed a hand-written statement by Sergeant C R A W F O R D , dated
28 April 1989, which had been given the same reference number, R170 as the typed statement, a
copy of which Iforwarded to you earlier.

Robert Wallace C R E A S E R (deceased) unamended statement dated 3 May 1989. Ia m unable
to find any original statement made by Chief Inspector C R E A S E R that bears the date 3 May 1989.
Ihave however found an original typed undated statement signed by that officer that Ibelieve may
be the one to which you are referring. Once again this statement has been given the same
reference number R252 as the typed, signed statement which Icopied to you earlier. Iwill explain
the significance of the dates on the H O L M E S statement printouts later in this letter.

Harry WHITE unamended statement dated 2 May 1989. I a m unable to find any original
statement made by Inspector WHI TE that bears the date 2 May 1989, but in searching the archive
Ihave found an original, hand-written undated statement, which Ibelieve may be the original of the
one to which you are referring. This statement again bears the same reference number R215,
(although itis not really visible on the photocopy) as the typed signed statement Iforwarded to you
earlier.

I enclose for your information copies of the statements of Sergeant C R A W F O R D , Chief Inspector
C R E A S E R and Inspector WHITE to which Ihave referred above. Iapologise for not finding these
statements during my first search of the archive, but by way of explanation Iwould point out that
when statements are first registered on H O L M E S they are given a numerical reference number. A
second statement by the same individual gets the same numerical reference with the letter A
added. A third statement has the letter B added to the reference and so on. To identify
statements and locate them in the archive Ifirstly interrogate the H O L M E S database by name to
identify the reference numbers of the statements made by an individual. I did not expect two
statements to bear the same number.

Moving now to the dates on the H O L M E S statement printouts. The very first line on the printout
shows the date on which the printout was obtained. The date on the first page of a H O L M E S
statement printout below name, age, address, occupation and telephone number of the person
making it is a blank to be filled in by the indexer first registering the statement on the H O L M E S
system and normally the indexer would type in the date the statement was made, but ifthe box is
left blank the H O L M E S system has a default date that automatically goes into that box, this being
the date the transaction is being carried out. To change it or delete it that date has to be
overtyped. Itherefore believe that the dates on the copies of the statements of Robert C R E A S E R
and Harry WHITE that are in your possession are the transaction dates for their entry on the
H O M E S system not the original dates of the statements.

I hope you find the above information useful.

Dear M r Metcalf,

R v. Duckenfield and Murray

1      The defendants in this case were committed for trial on 20* July on charges o f
       manslaughter and misfeasance. The stipendiary magistrate, M r Nigel Cadbury, had
       heard five days o f argument, and sworn oral evidence from me, before rejecting the
       defence argument that the prosecution was an abuse o f process o f the court and
       oppressive. He then rejected a defence argument that there was no case to answer
       after a mere three days o f evidence and argument.

2      We understand .that the Presiding Judge o f the North-Eastern Circuit, M r Justice
       Hooper, wishes to hold a preliminary hearing soon, probably on 3rd September, but
       possibly on 20* August. W e shall wish at that hearing to raise the important question
       o f access to the Hillsborough archive.

3      As you know, we have been arguing for nearly a year now that there is no lawful basis
       for South Yorkshire police to hold the papers. By virtue o f the fact that on 16* April
       1989 the Chief Constable o f the South Yorkshire police asked the Chief Constable o f
       the W est Midlands police to conduct an inquiry into the policing at the Hillsborough
       disaster, it appears that the fiction has been maintained that South Yorkshire police
       “ own” the information, o f which, it has been said, they are “principals” .

4      Therefore, it is apparently argued, the South Yorkshire police were the primary
       commissioners o f evidence and inquiry, and other investigative and legal bodies were
       subordinate. Accordingly, the South Yorkshire police has been able, upon your own
       advice, (a) to decline to disclose material to the bereaved families at the Inquest in
       1990, and (b) to deny it to the prosecution in 1998-9.




             Phone 01S1 236 1919. Fax 01S1 236 1936. E Mail info@ hfsg.org

    For the same reason, the South Yorkshire police was, on your advice, able to
    influence, in its own favour, the supply o f information and evidence to the CPS in
    1989-90, when a decision whether to prosecute was under consideration, and, no
    doubt, to influence the supply o f information to the Police Complaints Authority.

6   Although we have repeatedly deployed these arguments in the course o f the various
    applications by the defendants to have the proceedings stayed or discontinued, and in
    the course o f their applications for public funding, we have never heard an answer to
    them. Neither have you offered any rebuttal or contradiction at all over the last twelve
    months.

7   A conspicuous feature o f the case in the last twelve months had been the support that
    the South Yorkshire police has given to the defendants. The Chief Constable has
    urged the South Yorkshire Police Authority, successfully, that it should pay the entire
    legal fees and out o f pocket expenses o f the defendants on the ground that they acted
    “reasonably and in good faith” at the time o f the Hillsborough disaster, and that it was
    necessary to do this to maintain the morale o f officers who have to take “ split-second”
    decisions.

8   It is obviously absurd that the Crown, in whose name the prosecution will now be
    conducted, is denied access to evidential material which is obviously relevant to the
    case by a body which is actively supporting the defence. Furthermore, as you will
    know, the prosecution has duties o f disclosure to the defence, namely, to disclose any
    material in the possession o f organs o f the state that may arguably assist the defence,
    subject to public interest immunity considerations and legal professional privilege.

9   We shall raise these matters with M r Justice H ooper at the first hearing. We invite you
    meanwhile to explain in writing;

    (a) the legal basis on which you contend that the papers belong to, or are possessed by,
    the South Yorkshire police;         **-

    (b) whether the Chief Constable is prepared to hand the archive over to a neutral third
    party;

    (c) what other steps the Chief Constable proposes to take to co-operate with the
    Crown.

    In the past you have failed to assist the prosecution. W e believe that this refusal was
    influenced by the mistaken view expressed by M r Daines in 1998, before the
    summonses were issued, that any private prosecution was likely to “fall at the first
    hurdle.” W e invite him now to take this case seriously. Since the arguments are well
    known to you, we suggest that we can reasonably expect a comprehensive reply by 6*
    August.
11     In the light o f that reply, we shall prepare for the Crown Court bundles o f
       correspondence and compile a skeleton argument, and consider the legal options
       available to us should you refuse co-operation. N o doubt you will wish to attend the
       first hearing o f the case and be represented. We shall keep you informed o f the date.
       We shall send a copy o f this letter to the defendants and to             o f the CPS,
       from whom the Chief Constable may wish to seek advice under section 3 (2) (e) o f the
       Prosecution o f Offences Act 1985.

12     I look forward to your reply.

 Dear Miss Adlington

 H illsborough : P rivate Prosecutions

 It is difficult to understand from your letter exactly what you are requesting.

 The position is not helped by a rather indiscriminate use o f the word “you” which variously appears
 to mean former Chief Constables, the present Chief Constable, Assistant Chief Constable Ian Daines,
 the South Yorkshire Police in general, my firm and/or myself personally.

 It is also difficult to know what exactly you are saying about the Hillsborough archive. This term is
 in any event a shorthand for a vast quantity o f material which has come to the South Yorkshire
 Police through a variety o f sources, including the Taylor Inquiry, the mini Inquests, the civil
 proceedings, the Main Inquest, the criminal investigation, the disciplinary proceedings and the
 Hillsborough Scrutiny. It can hardly be disputed that this archive is in the physical possession o f the
 South Yorkshire Police and access to it is therefore under the control o f the present Chief Constable.
 I am not aware o f anybody having put forward arguments to the effect that South Yorkshire Police
 “own” the information or are “principals” in relation to it. For understandable reasons there is a
 dearth o f authority as to the ownership o f a criminal investigation file but it can hardly be doubted
 that the normal home for such material would be with the Police Force for the area where the crime
 is alleged to have taken place.

 Be that as it may, in relation to the committal proceedings the Chief Constable sought guidance from
 CPS in relation to documentation and complied with the guidance given.

 The Chief Constable also made clear that he would comply with any request or Order o f the Court in
 the relation to the production o f documentation and that also was done.

The Chief Constable also offered voluntary access to documentation from the archive subject only to
provision o f some comment as to its relevance, payment o f costs and a reservation o f any possible
issue o f legal professional privilege. It was indicated that the last issue was unlikely to present a
problem in relation to any evidential material. That offer was never taken up but was simply
described as extortionate.

The suggestion that the South Yorkshire Police have “failed to assist” the Prosecution is therefore
misconceived.

Turning to the points raised in your numbered paragraph 9 the answers are as follows:-

a)   The South Yorkshire Police do not advance any "contentions" about the archive. They are in
     physical possession o f it and they affirm that in dealing with it they are subject to the guidance
     o f the Director o f Public Prosecutions (through CPS) and to any guidance or directions o f the
     Court.

b)   As stated above the Chief Constable will deal with the archive subject to any guidance and
     directions referred to.

c)   You do not state what other co-operation is being sought.

Prior to receipt o f your fax the Chief Constable had already asked CPS to advise in relation to any
future request from the Prosecution for documentation and no doubt such guidance will be
forthcoming in the near future. The Chief Constable will then make any necessary future decision
about the archive in the light o f such guidance. There is therefore no need for the Chief Constable to
be represented at any Pre Trial Review hearing unless this is requested by the court.

Finally, although it does not appear to bear any relevance to the core o f your request I should say
that so far as I am aware neither I nor my firm advised the South Yorkshire Police about disclosure
of material to bereaved families at the inquest in 1990 or the supply o f information to the CPS in
1989 or 1990. Both the inquest and the CPS consideration were supported by the West Midlands
Police who certainly did not seek our advice as to the disclosure o f material. I would be very
surprised if (as you appear to suggest) the CPS, HM Coroner, the West Midlands Police or the PCA
sought the advice o f the South Yorkshire Police on this subject either.




Yours sincerely

               Dear Ms Adiington

               Adlington v Puckenfield & Murray

               I have asked the Director Public Prosecutions for advice on disclosure to you of material that
               may be relevant to the prosecuting you are conducting. I have now received that advice. I
               have consulted my legal adviser and I am happy to accept the DPP’s advice. Mr George
               Croston, Prosecution Team Leader, offered the advice on behalf of the DPP. He is on leave
               this week. As soon as he returns, I will be able to write to you again making specific
               proposals.

               Yours sincerely

Dear M r Daines,

R v. Dackenfield and Murray



Thank you for your letter o f 11th August. We look forward to hearing from you again as a
matter o f urgency on this matter. Since M r C roston has already given his advice and you have
been advised by your own lawyers, it is not clear why M r C roston’s absence on holiday
prevents the prosecution from being told now what disclosure the South Yorkshire police
intends to make.

You may know that a preliminary hearing has been arranged before M r Justice H ooper at the
Crown Court at Leeds for 3rd September at 2 pm. The prosecution wishes to raise the whole
question o f access to documentation before the judge at this hearing, and we therefore need to
know as soon as possible what you are intending to disclose. It is possible that we shall again
wish to serve a witness summons upon you, but it may be that this can be avoided. However,
it seems probable in the light o f the history o f the case that m atters o f law will arise, and that
these will affect you. The prosecution will ask for these to be resolved as soon as possible, so
that we can use the time profitably in the months before trial.

You may consider therefore that you ought to be legally represented on 3rd September.
Leading counsel for the Crown will circulate a skeleton argument beforehand o f legal matters
that he intends to raise. It would be helpful to know w hether we should correspond with you
or M r M etcalf about this.

Yours sincerely, .

         Dear Ms Adlington

         Adlington v Duckenfleld & Murray

         I refer to my letter of 11 August 1999 and to your reply of 12 August 1999. Now that Mr
         Cro ton has returned from holiday, I have had the opportunity of discussing matters with
         him.

         I am prepared to allow supervised access to non-sensitive documents. Mr Croston has
         offered his services in assisting my staff in that supervision. There are some dates when he
         is on leave or otherwise engaged. My proposal is this;

         1.       Please send me a schedule of material to which you seek access.

         2.       Please arrange direct with Mr Croston and the Force Hillsborough Archivist, Mr Alan
                  Hepworth, dates on which the three of you can meet at Heeley (Sheffield) police
                  office for the purpose of releasing material.

         The puipose of asking for a schedule of material is;

         1.       To allow staff the time to locate the documents.

         2.       To determine whether each document as sensitive or non-sensitive.

         Yours sincerely

 20th August 1999

 Dear M r Daines

 R v. Duckenfield and Murray

 Thank you for your letter dated 17th August, which we received by fax . W e are encouraged
 that M r Croston is to be involved in the process o f disclosure. I earnestly hope that it can
 begin soon, so that a clearly defined procedure is established and operating in advance o f the
 hearing before M r Justice H ooper on 3rd September.

 I write on the basis that you have satisfied yourself that you are in a position, in law, to
 disclose material prepared and collected, not only by the South Yorkshire police for its own
 and external investigations, but also by the $ fest Midlands police force, and any other outside
 police force that may have investigated the disaster, for the purposes o f :

          (a) the inquiry commissioned by the Chief Constable o f the South Yorkshire police on
          16th April 1989;
          (b) the Taylor Inquiry;
          (c) the inquiries o f the D irector o f Public Prosecutions;
          (d) the C oroner’s inquest; and
          (e) the investigations o f the Police Complaints Authority

 In view o f the legal issues arising in this difficult and controversial case, I should be grateful
 for your confirmation in this respect. .

 The material which w e wish to review as relevant to the trial itself, and in part to the abuse o f
 process/ oppression argum ent which M r Duckenfield’s solicitors have told us is to be brought
 yet again, is as follows:




        Phone 0151 236 1919. F a x 0151 236.1936. E M ail in fo@ hfsg.org
      ljt Floor C en tral B u ild in g s 41 North John S treet L iverpool L 2 6 R R
      The originals o f all signed edited and unedited reports and statem ents made by officers
      o f the South Yorkshire and any other police forces (eg N ottingham shire and
      Merseyside) relating to the disaster and its surrounding circumstances. It is necessary
      for us to see these because o f the scale o f the editing exercise, and because there is
      doubt surrounding the circumstances in which parts o f some statem ents came to be
      written. The best example o f this is, o f course, the confusion surrounding the
      statements o f Inspector H arry W hite. Y ou will recall that another statem ent o f his
      came to light after a letter from D r Popper to M r Croston in June o f this year.

      For the avoidance o f doubt, this category includes all statem ents made by officers as to
      the lies told by David Duckenfield on 15th April 1989 about the circumstances in which
      the exit gates became open.

(2)   All pocket-books o f officers containing notes o f the events o f 15th April, whether made
      contemporaneously, or within days, or later, and all handw ritten and typed “resumes”,
      or other similar notes, made by officers shortly after the incident. The
      Nottinghamshire officers, Brazener, who was called as a live witness at committal,
      Hoad, and W alton refer to them. ( See reports R 498, R 499, and R 450, where one o f
      these resumes is apparently attached.)

(3)   All original signed statements collected by the W est M idlands police from those who
      had been present at or in the vicinity o f the ground at the tim e o f the disaster.

(4)   All notes and tape recordings o f meetings held by South Yorkshire police officers in
      the days and weeks after the disaster at which assertions o f fact, admissible under
      section 24 o f the Criminal Justice Act 1988, were made about the disaster. (An
      example is the collection o f three sets o f briefing notes o f meetings held by or under
      the auspices o f the Chief Constable on 16th, 17th and 19th April, which were produced
      by you to the M agistrates C ourt on 24th June. I f the notes are a transcript o f a tape
      recording, we wish to hear and have copies o f those tape recordings also)

(5)   All documents, photographs, plans, videotape and models, either prepared to show or
      demonstrate the lay-out o f the ground, or which record events at Hillsborough
      between 1 and 6 pm on 15th April 1989, in addition to those produced by the witness
      statement, and w hether such things w ere prepared by police, Sheffield W ednesday
      football club, City Council or emergency services.

(6)   All tape recordings and transcripts o f tape recordings showing the content o f
      conversations taking place in o r from the police control box between 1 pm and 6 pm
      on 15th April 1989, not being conversations recorded by the radio multi-channel
      system (which we have already examined after you produced the tape on 24th May),
      whether made or produced by police officers or emergency services

(7)   All tape and.video recordings o£ accounts given by police officers or other witnesses in
      interview, w hether or notuncbaf <^ution, relating to the disaster.
(8)    All indexes to witnesses, statements or exhibits produced for any o f the inquiries into
       the disaster.

(9)    All expert reports prepared for the South Yorkshire or W est Midlands police forces,
       whether for any o f the above inquiries, or for the contribution hearings o f autumn
        1990, apart from the Phillips report o f August 1990, a copy o f which you produced to
       us in October 1997. I f there are other versions o f the Phillips report, we wish to see
       them.

(10)   A copy o f the W est Midlands Police R eport which was sent to the DPP and Coroner in
       1990. This cannot be considered sensitive (a) because a copy o f the Interim Report o f
       that force o f O ctober 1989 is in the Public Record office, (b) because you have a copy,
       though the Report was prepared for the DPP, and (c) because the Coroner has a copy.

(11)   A copy o f the opinion signed by Gareth Williams QC ad Peter Birts QC which was sent
       to the DPP in 1990. This is no longer privileged because a copy has been sent to your
       force, although it was, o f course, your force that was primarily under investigation.
       Any surviving privilege was waived when it was produced to Lord Justice Stuart-
       Smith, who quoted from it in the report o f his “ Scrutiny” .

(12)   The electronically-recorded versions o f the above, where they exist, stored on the
       Holmes com puter system. W e have ascertained that the material can be copied
       electronically from that system into a disc form that we can use. Such copying will
       relieve us o f the need to photocopy vast numbers o f documents, although we anticipate
       that there will remain a large number o f documents that we shall need to copy after
       inspection.            ‘
                                             ■’• ate


(13)   The charges, and list o f witnesses statements prepared for, the disciplinary proceedings
       brought against the tw o defendants, but abandoned after M r Duckenfield retired from
       the force.

W e anticipate from your previous attitudes tow ards the prosecution that you will claim that
the items in (10) and (11) are “ sensitive” . I f so, please indicate why you consider them to be
sensitive, and what reason in law you offer to justify withholding them from the Crown.

It may be that the list above includes the whole, or practically the whole, o f the “ archive” .
W e cannot be more specific, o f course, because we do not know the identity o f all the
witnesses; a difficulty you will remember that hampered us in specifying material in the witness
summons. W e need to see this material not simply for our own purposes, but because we have
to disclose all material that may possibly be relevant to the defence. Unfortunately, we do not
know what the defence will be, and the question which factual issues will be contested at trial
has not been made known.

In order to make our task, and yours, m ore manageable, we have invited the defence to set out
the nature o f their defence, but they have not done so. They declined to do so for what
appeared to be tactical reasons at the committal.
You will appreciate that the committal changes the responsibilities o f the prosecution. Given
(a) the powerful rejection by the court o f the allegations o f the defence that we were abusing
the process o f the court, and (b) the strength o f the prima facie case, it was not necessary for
us, consistent with the law, to do more in tw o days at the magistrates’ court than to call tw o
live witnesses, read a few uncontroversial statements, show the compilation video, and read
the defendants’ evidence to the Taylor Inquiry and Inquest.

Our public duties now that w e prosecute in the name o f the Crown are greater. W e wish to
have as complete and full access to your material as if we were the Crown Prosecution Service
having the conduct, on indictment, o f a case in which your force had investigated and
instituted the proceedings.


I should be grateful if you could indicate w hat exactly you mean by “ supervised” access. We
shall wish to inspect and copy material in some privacy, not least because you have expressed
public support for the defendants, and have procured the costs o f their defence and expenses
from public funds.

The above list o f material is, I hope, complete so far as trial material is concerned. Other
material relevant simply to the abuse hearing may be requested later. I reserve the right to
seek other material for the trial, after discussions within the prosecution team. I consider it is
more important, however, to give you an early, and possibly incomplete list, than to delay. I
shall send a copy o f this to M r Croston, and seek to arrange an early meeting w ith him and M r
Hepworth as you suggest.

Yours sincerely.

Dear Mr. Daines

R v Duckenfield & Murray
Access to archive

I refer to previous correspondence, in particular my letters o f 12th and 20th August.
On 24th August Mr. C roston informed me that he had given you further guidance and that you
would be writing to me. I still await your response having provided you on 20th August with a
comprehensive list o f material to which we seek access.

W e cannot possibly allow this m atter to remain in such a state o f uncertainty. I am having a
consultation with Leading Counsel tom orrow . I f we do not have your clear proposals by then,
we will have to make representations and ask the court to resolve m atters on 3rd September.

Yours Sincerely

                 Dear Mrs Adlington

                 ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

                 I refer to your letter of 20 August 1999. I have discussed your letter with Mr George Croston,
                 CPS, and Mr Peter Metcalfe, Hammond Suddards.

                 If we are in possession of items 1 - 9 and I can find them then I am prepared to disclose them.
                 In particular, I do not know whether we hold pocket books of officers containing notes of the
                 events of 15 April 1989 (item 2 on your list). If we hold the pocket books, I will disclose the
                 relevant pages. I will let you know as soon as the position is clear.

                 I am not at liberty to disclose the opinions of Gareth Williams, QC, and Peter Birts, QC. They
                 were commissioned by the DPP and it is for him to decide whether he wishes to disclose
                 them. Similarly, I am not at liberty to disclose the W est Midlands Police Report to the DPP.
                 However, if Mr Croston wishes either document to be released and we have copies of them, I
                 will release them to you.

                 I will enquire whether it is possible to transfer HOLMES material onto a disc for your use (item
                 12 on your list). I will need to check with the Home Office whether they wish me to release
                 material in this manner, the HOLMES system is a Home Office system.

                 You ask me to define what I mean by “supervised" access. This is Mr Croston’s phrase and
                 perhaps you should clarify it with him. For my part, I see it in the following terms:

                 You will come to our archive store. If you wish to be accompanied by legally qualified staff. I
                 would ask to be told of their names before arrival. Material will be brought from the storeroom
                 to another room and you will examine the material while my staff are in the room but they will
                 not overhear your conversations. If you want a document to be copied, my staff will do that
                 either immediately or as soon as practicable. Originals will be returned to the store.

                 On 30 September 1998, my solicitor Peter Metcalfe (Hammond Suddards) wrote to you and at
                 paragraphs 2.1, 2.2 and 3 he asked for assurances from you regarding confidentiality and
                 payment of an administration charge. Please respond to these requests.

                 Yours sincerely

Dear M r Daines,

R v. Duckenfield and Murray

Yesterday I received from you by fax a handwritten note apologising for two errors in a letter
you say you had w ritten earlier.

I have not received that earlier letter perhaps because, as on at least one earlier occasion, you
sent it by second class post.

Please fax me a copy o f that letter this afternoon. I emphasised in my letters o f 12th, 20th and
26th August why this m atter is urgent.

Yours sincerely,




Ann Adlington
Solicitor

              Dear Ms Adlington

              Thank you for your letter o f 31 August 1999 addressed to Mr. Croston. I have now
              received the annexes. Mr. Croston is away from the office at the moment.

             I note with interest that the charge which was discontinued by the Crown Prosecution
             Service now appears in the Indictment. I would be grateful if you would let me have
             a copy o f the Indictment for my information. I would also be grateful if you would let
             me Imow whether the Indictment has been lodged?

             So far as paragraph 8 is concerned, the Crown Prosecution Service does not intend to
             attend the hearing on 3 September 1999 nor does it intend to be represented at the
             hearing.

             A copy o f this letter goes to Mr. Daines.


             Yours sincerely,

        Dear Ms Adlington

        RE:      A D LIN G TO N v D U C K EN FIELD AND M U RRA Y


        Thank you for your letter o f 27 August 1999. Mr. Croston is away from the office at
        the moment.

        I am not prepared to voluntarily disclose either the W est M idlands Police Report or
        the Advice o f Gareth W illiams QC and Peter Birts QC. I refer in particular to Mr.
        Croston’s letter o f 15 June 1999 which contained the reasons. Those are still current.

        In the second paragraph o f your letter you suggest that privilege has been waived.
        Privilege has not been waived by the Crown Prosecution Service and Mr. Daines quite
        clearly says that he is not at liberty to disclose the documents himself. I am not sure I
        understand how you came to the conclusion that privilege had been waived.

        I have also received faxed copy o f your letter o f 31 August 1999 enclosing the
        “matters to be raised by the Crown” . The annexures were not o f course, enclosed.

        At this stage I am unable to comment in detail on the document. The only m atter
        which I w ish to raise at this stage is in relation to paragraph 5.13. As has been stated
        in previous correspondence, the CPS does not consider that it should advise the South
        Yorkshire Police about its custody o f the Hillsborough archive. The CPS would not
        wish to take over control o f it.

        I am sending a copy o f this letter to Mr. Daines.

 R v D U CK EN FIELD AND M URRAY

I am instructed to write to you on behalf o f the Crown Prosecution Service. The South Yorkshire
Police have sought advice from the Crown Prosecution Service about the disclosure of a
document in their possession which related to the Hillsborough Stadium disaster and which m a y
therefore have a bearing on the current prosecution o f Messrs Duckenfield and Murray brought
by the Hillsborough Family Support Group (“the prosecutor”). Messrs Duckenfield and Murray
have been committed to stand trial at the Crown Court at Leeds. I understand that the matter is
listed for a hearing before you on 3 September 1999, for issues o f disclosure to be considered.

The prosecutor has sought disclosure from the South Yorkshire Police o f ail documents in their
possession which are relevant to the prosecution. The docum ent about which the South
Yorkshire Police have sought advice is a report dated 12 April 19990, signed by_____________
and a letter dated 23 July 1990, from Sir John Woodcock, then H M C hief Inspector of
Constabulary, to Mr Richard Wells, then Chief Constable o f the South Yorkshire Police. I
enclose copies o f those two documents.

The report by |__________[vas drawn to the attention o f the then Director o f Public Prosecutions
in 1990, who subsequently sought the advice ofLeading Counsel as to the effect o f its content.
The advice was given by you, then a member o f the Bar, in an Opinion dated 27 July 1990. I
enclose a copy o f your Opinion.

The Crown Prosecution Service has considered the report b\|___________p d the letter from Sir
John Woodcock intends to advise the South Yorkshire Police that they should be disclosed to the
prosecutor. Because the present Director o f Public Prosecutions formerly acted for Mr
Duckenfield, he has taken no part in this decision. Following the usual practice of the Crown
Prosecution Service, they also intend to advise the South Yorkshire Police that the documents
should be disclosed to both the prosecutor and the defendants at the same time. This advice will
extend to the report b y __________ md the letter from Sir John W oodcock alone. There is no
suggestion by Crown Prosecution Service that either your Opinion, or any o f the associated
correspondence, should be disclosed to either the prosecutor or the defendants.
    I have been instructed to write to both the prosecutor and the defendants, informing them of the
    existence o f |__________ [report and Sir John Woodcock's letter enclosing a copy o f each. The
    Crown Prosecution Service also wishes me to draw to the attention o f both the prosecutor and
    the defendants that 1 have written to you in the terms o f this letter; and preferably, to send to
    those concerned a copy o f this letter.

I should be pleased to instruct Counsel to appear before you on 3 September to provide such
assistance as you would wish. I have not yet instructed Counsel in that capacity and should be
grateful to know your reaction to the proposal before doing so. The Crown Prosecution Service
is anxious that [ should write to both the prosecutor and the defendants as soon as possible, and
certainly before 3 September, but did not want to do so without first drawing the matter to your
attention.

I should welcome any comments that you might care to make on the suggestion that 1 should
instruct Counsel to appear before you on 3 September; and on the letter that I intend to write to
the prosecutor and the defendants in advance o f that date.     I should add that the Crown
Prosecution Service will ensure that__________ gir Geoffrey Dear, Sir Clive Whitmore and Sir
John W'oodcock are all informed o f the disclosure o f the two documents in advance of that
disclosure taking place.

In the Crown Court sitting at Leeds
H ooper J
3rd September 1999


                         R v. David Duckenfield and Bernard Murray


                               M atters to be raised by the Crown


1      Length o f trial. The prosecution hesitates to estimate the length o f the trial, because it
       has yet to see the voluminous collections o f papers prepared by W est Midlands Police
       for the Inquiry in 1989 by Lord Taylor; for the Crown Prosecution Service in 1989-90;
       for the Coroner in 1989-91; and, with other forces, for the Police Complaints
       Authority in 1989-92. It has acted so far on the basis o f :


               (0      the limited number o f statements made available by the Home Office to
                       the prosecution in 1997-8;
               00      transcripts o f the Taylor Inquiry and inquests made available at the time
                       o f these inquiries;
               (iii)   edited and unedited statements o f South Yorkshire police put in the
                       H ouse o f Common library at the insistence o f the Home Secretary in
                       April 1998 ;
               (iv)    the material made available in the last year by the Crown Prosecution
                       Service (who were given in 1990, for the purposes o f deciding whether
                       to bring prosecutions arising from the disaster, only about 11% o f the
                       total statements collected)


1.1    All the original and copy material is held by the South Yorkshire police, but, as
       appears below, there is doubt and uncertainty as to the extent o f disclosure which that
       force will make, and the terms on which it will be made.


1.2    However, the central part o f the prosecution case is likely to be the evidence o f
       witnesses whose statements were served for committal, which are likely to be
       uncontroversial; photographic, video and other documentary evidence; and the
       admissions o f the defendants to the Taylor Inquiry and the Coroner’s Inquest.


1.3    It is thought likely at this stage that the prosecution case will be complete in three to
       four weeks. The prosecution believes that the defence will probably call no evidence.



                                                 1
The prosecution believes that the issues in the case are likely to turn on the
interpretation o f known events, rather than on disputed questions o f fact. This forecast
is tentative because, in accordance with the observations made at the outset o f the
abuse o f process hearing to the magistrate by leading counsel for M r Duckenfield,
supported by leading counsel for M r M urray, the nature o f the defence did not emerge
at the lower court. At the abuse o f process hearing and committal proceedings, the
defendants declined to give evidence.


In assessing the length o f the trial, it should be borne in mind that, some months after a
preliminary committal bundle had been served, it was estimated by leading counsel for
M r M urray on 21st December 1998 at the Leeds M agistrates Court that the committal
would take at least four weeks, apart from the abuse o f process hearing. In the event,
the committal proceedings took less than three days, after an abuse o f process hearing
which took less than five days.


The defence. In the interests o f trial management, it is submitted that the defendants
should be invited to set out in general terms the nature o f their defence, as if this were
a case to which section 5 (5) and (6) o f the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act
1996 applied. (It has been agreed by all parties that, since there had been a police
investigation in 1989-90, the provisions o f that Act did not apply; hence the “old-
style” committal and disclosure procedures govern the case.)


Admissions. The defendants made admissions o f uncontroversial facts at committal
under section 10 o f the Criminal Justice Act 1967, but insisted on purporting to limit
the scope o f those admissions to the committal proceedings.


The prosecution has invited the solicitors for the defendants by letter o f 22nd July 1999
to indicate before 3rd September that the same admissions will be made for trial, and, if
not, to explain why. The prosecution wishes to know now w hether it needs to incur
the expense o f proving the subject-matter o f those admissions formally at the trial.
Relevant correspondence between prosecution and defence since committal is Annex
A.


In particular, it will be argued that the leave o f the court is needed by virtue o f section
10 (4) o f the 1967 Act to withdraw the admissions, notwithstanding the purported
limitation on their effect.
The admission in evidence o f the defendants’ evidence to previous inquiries. The
prosecution submits that the defendants should disclose at an early stage whether they
intend to object to the admission in evidence o f their evidence to the Taylor Inquiry
and the Inquest, interviews w ith W est Midlands Police? and should indicate in writing
the legal basis for any such objections. It is submitted that, should any such argument
be contemplated, the m atter should be resolved at an early preliminary hearing. If the
evidence were to be excluded, the prosecution would need to prove some o f the basic
facts admitted in the course o f that evidence, to the extent that it were possible, by
other means.


Disclosure o f the Hillsborough archive. A bundle o f correspondence passing between
the prosecution and the South Yorkshire police is attached as Annex B. At present the
Chief Constable holds all the papers relating to the disaster that were collected for
other judicial and investigative bodies. The Crown needs to see them. It is submitted
that there is no lawful basis upon which the Chief Constable should be regarded as the
custodian o f the papers, capable o f deciding for himself whether, to whom, and under
what conditions those papers should be disclosed.


The Court will be asked to give guidance to the Chief Constable to make available all
material described in the letter o f Ann Adlington to M r Daines o f 20th August 1999, on
the same modest financial terms that the Crown Prosecution Service imposed when it
disclosed its material last January. The Court should particularly request disclosure o f
material in usable disc form as well as originals o f documents requested. It appears that
it will be unnecessary to conduct legal argument about the legal basis for disclosure;
the letter o f M r M etcalf o f 26th July 1999 indicates that the Chief Constable will act
upon a request from a court.


It had been hoped to have resolved this m atter by agreement before 3rd September. The
most recent letter from M r Daines o f 26th August suggests, however, that this problem,
which was raised by the prosecution on 22nd July 1999, tw o days after committal, will
not be resolved for some time in the absence o f guidance and requests from the Court.
The only material that was disclosed by the South Yorkshire police to the prosecution
before the committal hearing consisted o f a few documents that the prosecution was
able to identify w ith the precision required by section 97 o f the M agistrates Court
1980, and one document that was “voluntarily disclosed” . They were produced to the
court only after a formal application for a witness summons, the issue o f which the
Chief Constable opposed in its entirety through lawyers at court on 10th May 1999.
5.3    In spite o f the ostensibly open attitude displayed by the South Yorkshire police since
       committal, the prosecution fears procrastination and delay, in the light o f the unco­
       operative attitude shown by the force in the previous twelve months,. I f the trial is not
       to take place until summer 2000, it is vital that the long inspection process should
       begin in September 1999, before the administrative demands o f a pending trial become
       pressing.


The conditions required by the South Yorkshire police

5.4    The reference by M r Daines at the end o f his letter o f 26th August to assurances and an
       “administration charge” are set out in the letter o f M r M etcalf o f 30th December 1998
       (not “ September”).


5.5    These conditions are unacceptable. The “conditions” numbered 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3
       cannot be insisted upon. The only bodies with standing even to seek any such
       conditions would be the bodies for whom the material was collected, namely, the
       Taylor Inquiry (Home Office); the CPS; the Coroner; and the Police Complaints
       Authority. It appears to be accepted by M r M etcalf in his letter o f 26th July 1999 that
      the archive is not held by South Yorkshire police by legal right.


5.6    The South Yorkshire police are not competent to request the conditions for the further
       reason that the common law implies limitations upon the use o f material obtained for
      the purposes o f criminal proceedings. These implied undertakings provide adequate
       protection for the rights o f others. See Taylor v. Serious Fraud Office [1998] 3
      W.L.R. 1041 (HL).


5.7    It is particularly offensive to seek to “require” a brief explanation o f the relevance o f
       documents to the charges for the following reasons:


               (i) the Chief Constable is not to be the judge o f the relevance o f documents to
               legal issues; nor should he or his lawyer claim be the arbiter o f the question o f
               what material should be disclosed to, and subsequently by, the Crown;


               (ii) the Chief Constable has supported the defendants in these criminal
               proceedings; although he has always admitted in civil proceedings that the
               conduct o f which the defendants are accused was negligent, and caused death,
               he has procured the funding o f their defence by the South Yorkshire Police
               Authority in foil, and all associated costs and expenses, both for the criminal

                                                 4
                    defence to these charges, and for any ancillary judicial review proceedings that
                    the defendants may be advised to bring;


                    (iii) M r Daines expressed the view in a police periodical, after the “ Scrutiny” o f
                    Lord Justice Stuart-Smith in 1998, that any private prosecution was likely to
                    “fall at the first hurdle”;


                    (iv) the prosecution has common law duties to disclose any material that may
                    possibly be relevant to the defence (see R v. Kecme (1994) 99 Cr. App. R. 1);
                     and to disclose material in the possession o f “the total apparatus o f the

  t                 Crown”( R v. Ward (1993) 96 Cr. App. 1.)


      5.8    The charges o f £30.00 per hour, proposed by M r M etcalf to be levied for the purposes
             o f copying the material to the prosecution, are extortionate. To seek, in addition, to
             levy the same charge on the prosecution for copying the same material to the defence
             solicitors, who are in any event supported by the local police fund, is calculated to
             frustrate the prosecution and the criminal process. The prosecution is not supported
             by public funds. By contrast, the Crown Prosecution Service has copied all its “non­
             sensitive” material for the prosecution at a purely nominal cost, without conditions or
             resentment.


      5.9    For information, correspondence passing between the Crown Prosecution Service and
             prosecution on this subject is attached as Annex C.

      The earlier control o f the papers by South Yorkshire police


      5 10   The Court is asked to bear in mind in this matter that the South Yorkshire police force,
             in its own interests, appears to have exercised a tight control over the papers in the
             case at critical stages in the history o f the investigations into the Hillsborough disaster.
             Attached are letters w ritten in relation to disclosure o f statements at the main Inquest
             between November 1990 and M arch 1991 in connection w ith requests o f Trevor Hicks
             and Sandra Stringer, bereaved parents (Annex D). These letters, written by very senior
             members o f the W est Midlands police, suggest that South Yorkshire police, who were
             an interested party at the Inquest, and who were engaged at the time in civil
             proceedings, controlled the process o f disclosing material to the bereaved families at
             the Inquest through their lawyers.


      5.11   The lawyers acting for South Yorkshire police at the time the-W est Midlands police

                                                       5
             made these assertions were Hammond Suddards o f Leeds, and in particular, M r Peter
             Metcalf, who has advised the police about the prosecution’s requests for disclosure
             since this prosecution was instituted in July 1998.


      5.12   Attached are other letters showing that the South Yorkshire police, sometimes with
             the help o f the Coroner, controlled the disclosure o f material collected by or for other
             agencies after the inquest until the disclosure ordered by the Home Office in 1997
             (Annex E ). These matters were referred to in the witness statement o f Ann Adlington
             which constituted her evidence in chief at the abuse o f process hearing at the Leeds
             Magistrates Court on 8th July 1999. Although she was cross-examined extensively

  t          about other matters, her evidence in relation to this correspondence was not
             challenged or investigated by the defence.


      5.13   For all these reasons it is submitted that it is imperative that the prosecution achieves
             early and complete access to the archive; and welcomes the full co-operation o f the
             Crown Prosecution Service in this process as a neutral party. It is submitted that all
             the material should ideally be transferred to the control o f the Crown Prosecution
             Service, and that disclosure should thereafter be made as requested by the court.
             Otherwise, the court is asked to request full and unrestrained access to all the archive
             in the possession o f South Yorkshire police, at all normal working hours, and that the
             prosecution can take its own photocopier and computers to the archive, subject to the
             supervision o f the CPS.


1 0   5.14   The defence have hitherto declined to support the Crown in its requests for disclosure
             o f the Hillsborough archive. It may be that both defendants have had access to it
             already. W inkworth Sherwood, who now represent M r Duckenfield, represented the
             legal interests o f the Chief Constable during the “ Scrutiny” o f Lord Justice Stuart-
             Smith, and have presumably had access to, and may retain copies of, most o f the
             relevant material. It is to be presumed that M r Duckenfield instructed them to defend
             him in the current proceedings with these matters in mind.


      5.15   M r Manning o f W alker M orris represented M r M urray throughout the Inquest, where
             he undoubtedly had access, formally and informally, to extensive South Yorkshire
             police documents and information denied to those who represented the bereaved
             families.


      5.16   The defence is invited to support the prosecution position in relation to the
             Hillsborough archive.

                                                      6
Access to original documents; the significance of the edited statements

5.17   At the insistence o f the Home Secretary, all South Yorkshire police statements
        relevant to the disaster were placed in the House o f Commons library in April 1998.
        There are over 100 examples o f police statements, edited so as to remove assertions o f
        fact hostile to South Yorkshire police, most o f which could not have been shown to
       Lord Justice Stuart-Smith in 1997, who reported only a few examples o f editing.
       Evidence is available suggesting that this editing process was conducted by South
       Yorkshire police officers under the advice or guidance o f M r Metcalf. Only the edited
       versions were sent to the CPS and Coroner in 1990 and 1991. The prosecution should
       be entitled to inspect all original documents and insist upon their transmission to the
       court where they are o f evidential relevance. .


6      Disclosure. The prosecution disclosed all the witness statements and exhibits in its
       possession to the defence before committal, allowing full inspection at its Liverpool
       offices. The subject is dealt with in a letter from the prosecution to W inkworth
        Sherwood dated 27th August in Annex A.


7      The indictment. Counts 1 ,2 and 3 reflect the charges on which the defendants were
       committed for trial. Counts 4 and 5 have been added as permitted by the proviso to
       section 2 (2) o f the Administration o f Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1933. As
       a matter o f history, count 4 is based upon a charge alleged in the summons issued by
       the Leeds M agistrates Court in July 1998, but which the Crown Prosecution Service
       took over under section 6 (2) o f the Prosecution o f Offences Act 1985, and
       discontinued under section 23 (3), in April 1999. Count 5 is new.


7.1    It is submitted that M r Duckenfield told lies to representatives o f the Football
       Association, his superior officer M r Jackson and others about the circumstances in
       which the Gate C (and perhaps other gates) became open. Contemplating that an
       inquest or other forms o f judicial inquiry would be instituted, and knowing that
       inquiries were being made by persons which were relevant to such judicial inquiries,
       M r Duckenfield sought, at a time when it was apparent to him and many others that
       fatalities had been caused, to attribute the deaths to the actions o f Liverpool supporters
       in breaking open a gate or gates. R v. Vreones [1891] 1 Q.B. 360; R v. Selvage and
       Morgan (1982) 73 Cr. App. R. 333




                                                 7
7.2   M r Duckenfield admitted telling these lies, and allowing others to believe them, when
       cross-examined at the Taylor Inquiry. A jury is entitled to believe that he told these
       lies, not in order to prevent supporters turning in anger on the police, but to deflect
       blame from himself at the inevitable judicial inquiry or inquiries.


7.3   The same facts support the lesser charge o f misconduct in public office; R v. Dytham
       (1979) 69 Cr. App. R. 387


8     Copies o f this argument and relevant annexes will be provided to the Crown
       Prosecution Service, and M r Daines, with an invitation to both to attend or be
       represented at the hearing on 3rd September.

Dear Miss Adlington

Access to Hillsborough Archive

My Counsel tells me that he has sent a draft o f the Order made on Friday to Alan Jones for
agreement.

Ian Daines has asked me to indicate that access will be available as soon as the draft is agreed but
obviously would appreciate one or two days notice as some attention will have to be given to the
physical arranagments at Heeley Police Station where the archive is stored.

I have a provisional arrangement to meet M r Daines on W ednesday when precise arrangements can
be discussed.

In the meantime it might be helpful to have some idea o f when you would like to start.

Yours sincerely

                             Notes of Hearing 3 September 1999
                                     Mr Justice Hooper
                                    Leeds Crown Court

1. Representation

HFSG/Prosecution -    Alan Jones QC
David Duckenfield -   William Clegg QC
Bernard Murray -      Michael Harrison QC                                       /_   A
Chief Constable -     Nigel Godsmark                                            ^

2. Issues relating to SYP                                                                 a

2.1   These were dealt with after the other issues noted below.

2.2   The Judge indicated at the outset that in his experience it was normal for the
       prosecutor to demand production o f large files o f eg Local Authority papers which
       were then examined for relevance by the local authority lawyer and if necessary by the
      judge.

2.3   Counsel for SYP said that we had already indicated that we would provide access to
       documents, with limited exceptions, subject to payment and agreement as to
       confidentiality.

2.4   The Judge was dissatisfied with the idea that payment should be required in relation to
       documents which were prima facie likely to be relevant.

2.5   He acknowledged that he could only make a formal witness order in respect o f
      documents which were relevant. However he pointed out that if he made such an order
      (which he would do if necessary) then it would be for then SYP, entirely at their own
      expense, to examine all the documents for relevance and to certify that this had been
      done.

2.6    He said that in the light o f that he expected that the Chief Constable would prefer to
       give voluntary access. This should be without charge except in relation to documents
       which were not obviously relevant.

2.7    He then went through the numbered categories in the HFSG letter o f 16 July and ruled
       as follows:

       2.7.1   (1), (2), (3), (6), (7) and (9). Unpaid access to be allowed.

       2.7.2   (4). Unpaid access to any items in this category which record assertions o f fact
               by either Defendant. Otherwise access to be paid.

       2.7.3   (5) Unpaid access to photos and videos. Otherwise access to be paid for.

       2.7.4   (10) and (11). No access at this stage
        2.7.5    (12). No order now. If no agreement then to be resolved by hearing before
                 Judge in London in first week o f October.

         2.7.6   (13). N o order at this stage.

2.8     I f copies are provided by SYP these can be charged for.

2.9     W here charges are allowable the rate is £20 per hour.

2.10    This order does not require the production o f any item unless:

        2.10.1          It is in the SYP archive.

        2.10.2          It is not privileged on either Public Interest or Legal grounds. It was
                         specifically conceded by Alan Jones that a note o f a meeting with legal
                         advisers present would be privileged.

3. Plea and Directions Hearing

3.1     Although dealt with at this stage in the note this hearing actually took place before the
        discovery issues above were dealt with.

3.2.    The Judge dealt first with the issue o f his previous involvement in respect o f the
        report. There was no objection from any party to his continuing to deal with the case.
        There was also no objection to his signing the indictment. At this stage Alan Jones
        raised the issue o f an Order under Section 4(2) Contempt o f Court Act 1981 but the
        Judge said that he would defer this until the end o f the hearing.

3.3.    All parties agreed that the Trial should commence on 6 June 2000 with an estimated
        length at this stage o f 6 to 7 weeks.

3 .4.   The Judge then asked if there was any objection to the various counts being put to the
        Defendants for plea. William Clegg on behalf o f David Duckenfield complained o f the
         addition o f extra counts to the indictment after committal, particularly as one o f them
         appeared to reflect very closely the count which had been discontinued. He said that
         he would be seeking either the intervention o f the Attorney General or a stay o f these
         counts. Alternatively he might seek to apply to quash them as an abuse o f the process.
         Alan Jones argued that the counts should be put. The Judge ruled that the Defendants
         should only plead to the three counts which were the subject o f the committal and both
        Defendants pleaded not guilty to each count.

3.5.    There was then much discussion as to when the preliminary hearings would be heard as
        to whether there was any abuse o f the process and/or applications to stay on other
        grounds. In the end it was agreed that there would be hearings on 20 and 21
        December 1999 and again 4/7 January 2000 although it was made clear that Michael
        Harrison on behalf o f M r Murray would not be available on the December dates.

3 .6.   The Judge ordered that the Defendant's evidence if any on the abuse argument should
        be served by 19 November 1999 with a Skeleton Argument 7 days later.           I f no
        evidence was to be called then the Skeleton could be served by 3 December 1999. In
        any event the prosecution should serve a Skeleton by 17 December 1999.

3.7.    So far as the main Trial was concerned the prosecution had to serve expert reports if
        any by 19 November 1999 and the question o f whether the Defendants needed to serve
        any reports would be considered at the hearing on 20 December 1999.

3.8.    There was then a lengthy argument over admissions in which Alan Jones sought to
        press for the Defendants to make the same admissions as had been made at the
        Magistrates' Court. William Clegg explained that whilst they would make admissions,
        eg. about photographs, plans etc. they would not make any admissions about the
        structure o f the ground or the policing. They wanted the Prosecution to call witnesses
        in this respect so that witnesses could be cross examined. The Judge said that he had
        no sanction to force any admissions but ordered that those admissions which were
        going to be given should be made within 7 days. Alan Jones said that under no
        circumstances would he call any witnesses from the South Yorkshire Police as in view
        o f the Prosecution they were not "witnesses o f truth". The Judge said that this was not
        essentially a m atter for him but by 22 October 1999 the Prosecution would have to go
        back to the Defendants indicating how they intended to prove matters which they had
        alleged.

3.9.    By the end o f November the Prosecution were to serve all witnesses statements and
        exhibits on which they propose to rely and then the Defendants had to indicate by 17
        December 1999 which witnesses they were going to insist on being called in person.
        There was something o f an exchange o f this point between Alan Jones and the Judge
        as Alan Jones kept indicating that they might wish to add further witnesses at a later
        date and the Judge in turn referred to the possibility o f "fine tuning".

3.10    The next issue was the admissibility o f alleged previous admissions whether to Taylor
        or elsewhere. The Judge ruled that the Defendants should serve a Skeleton Argument
        as to what they were going to say about this by 26 November 1999.

3.11.   They were then Ordered that Further & B etter Particulars o f the Indictment should be
        given by the Prosecution to the Defendants by the end o f this month.

3.12.   The Judge then dealt with the contempt o f Court issue and made Orders restricting the
        reporting o f what had been said at the hearing. Incidentally he returned to this issue at
        the end o f the hearing relating to documents after the Defendants and their
        representatives had left Court. He raised a specific concern about the HFSG Internet
        sight and said that he would consider making an Order closing this down in case
        material inadvertently appeared on it which could influence a jury. Alan Jones said that
        they would be extremely careful about this and indeed his thought was that the
        Transcript o f the Trial might itself be posted on the Internet. The Judge did not
        comment on this one way or the other.

              Dear Ian

              Hillsborough - Documentation

              Further to our meeting yesterday I apologise for the delay in getting this draft out but there was a
              fax waiting for me from Ann Adlington (copy enclosed) which it seems came in on Monday
              afternoon without my being notified.

              In any event the fax misses the point because the Judge wanted an Order to be drawn up recording
              the full details not only o f the undertaking but o f what was to be provided. As previously mentioned
              our draft o f that Order was sent to Alan Jones on the morning o f Monday 6 September 1999 and as
              at 10:30 this morning there has been no response in spite of a reminder.

              In all events here is my draft letter to Ann Adlington. I should be grateful if you would consider it
              carefully as it is intended to set out the basis upon access will be provided and also makes a number
              o f assertions as to the instructions I have received about existing documentation. You may wish to
              check it with Alan Hepworth and discuss it with me before a final version is agreed on.

              Yours sincerely

                              DRAFT LETTER TO ANN ADLINGTON FROM PETER METCALF



                      Dear Miss Adlington

                      Hillsborough : SYP Documents

                      Further to my earlier fax and in the hope that the matter of the Order is quickly sorted

                      out I thought it might be helpful to set out some points about the inspection process

                      which as far as my clients are concerned can begin at 2 days notice as soon as the

^                     Order is agreed.



                      Firstly the Hillsborough archive is stored at Heeley Police Station, Windsor Road,

                      Sheffield.




                      Although this is not a normal working police station it is the headquarters of the

                      Discipline & Complaints Department o f the South Yorkshire Police and accordingly

                      there are one or two security issues which 1 should deal with initially:-

                                 will be parked there must be known and logged in advance. This can be done

                                 direct with Alan Hepworth.




                      2.        Access will be restricted to yourself and legally qualified staff with names,

                                 notified in advance. For the avoidance of doubt this does not in any way affect

                                 what happens to documents which you copy and take away           That is a matter

                                 regulated solely by your undertaking.

                   3.        Access will be available from 10:00 am to 4:00 pm Monday to Friday but

                              always with prior notification.




                   4.        My clients will provide a room for document examination which will have a

                             power supply. There will also be access to washroom facilities



                   5.        My clients propose that they will work their way through the requested

                             documentation dealing first with that which is not to be the subject o f a

                             supervision charge. They propose to bring through boxes, one at a time for

                             examination




                   6.        The intention is that a police officer or civilian member of staff will be present

                             in the room during inspection but not in hearing of any conversation




                   7.        If requested our clients will make available without charge an audio tape player

                             and a VHS video player and monitor. As these are normal working items of

                             equipment for use at the police station they are likely to be required from time

                             to time for other purposes but I would not expect this to create any difficulties.

                             Please let me know if they are required.



                   8.        If there are non-standard audio or video tapes there will be no equipment

                             available to play these.

                     9.         Turning to the question of copying you indicated that you would probably

                                bring your own copying machine and power will be available for this as noted

                                above. Alternatively my clients will provide copies o f plain A4 material at a

                                price o f       p per A4 sheet.




                      10        If you require copies o f items other than plain A4 then my clients will endeavor

                                 to arrange this on the following basis:-



                                A3 - black & white per sheet

                                Colour photocopying per A4 sheet

                                Photographic prints per print

                                VHS video tapes                   each

                                Normal audio interview tapes             each



                      11.       There may be some items which my clients can neither copy nor arrange for

^                               copying eg. BBC broadcast standard video tape. In such cases it will be for

                                you to make use o f the reference numbers to obtain material direct from the

                                BBC




                     I now turn to the categories o f documents requested but before doing so I should deal

                     with that part o f your fax o f 6 September 1999 relating to where items may be located.

                     I am instructed that it has been the policy of the South Yorkshire Police to locate

                     Hillsborough documentation (including the box referred to in your letter) in the archive

                     at Heeley Police Station.        I am also instructed so far as my clients are aware no

                     material has been moved out o f the archive save to deal with the requirements of Lord

                     Justice Stuart Smith and those of                     It may be that there is other relevant

                     material elsewhere but (with the exception o f item 9 which I will deal with below) my

                     clients do not accept an obligation to search for the indicated material except within,

                     the archive at Heeley Police Station.




                     As to the specific items >




                     1.        No comment needed.




                     2.        I am told that there are no notebooks known to be within the archive. Any

                                "recollections" o f the type referred to should be found within item 1 above.



                     3         No comment needed.




                     4         My instructions are that no meetings were tape recorded. I am also instructed

                                that my clients are not aware o f any other notes of meetings within this

                                category attended by the Defendants other than those for which you have the

                                notes. This is being checked further. At this stage I have no instructions in

                                relation to notes of any meetings at which assertions o f fact about Hillsborough

                                were made in the days and weeks following the disaster but at which the

                                Defendants were not present. However, as such notes would be a chargeable

                                item it is for you to indicate whether a search to be made.




                                For the avoidance o f doubt all o f the foregoing excludes any consideration of

                                notes o f meetings at which Counsel or solicitors were present.

                  5.        You probably have most o f these items already but if there are any others then

                            they will be produced.




                  6.        My instructions are that there are no tapes other than those already produced



                  7.        This of course is now restricted to officers o f the rank o f Inspector and below.

                            Otherwise no comment.




                  8.        I await hearing whether you wish a search to be made in respect of this

                            chargeable item.




                  9.       My clients tell me that they do not have a copy of Mr Bume's report. I believe

                            I have a copy which was loaned to Lord Justice Stuart Smith and subsequently

                            returned. I will try and locate this and send it to you,




                  The remaining items were left over to be the subject o f a further Application if so

                  advised




                  This brings me to the issue o f the HOLMES computer. My clients believe there may

                 be some misunderstanding here in that all o f your requests are for original signed

                  documentation. HOLMES is not (or was not then) a scanning system and the material

                  entered on the HOLMES system is entered by way o f copy typing.                 None o f it

                 therefore can be described as original signed material although no doubt within the

                  physical files there are statements printed off from HOLMES and then signed by the

                  maker.




                  It would be helpful to know now if this affects your wish to have access to the

                  HOLMES material.




                  Aside from these points my clients are writing as indicated to The Home Office to ask

                  whether there are any legal or security objections and are also obtaining comments

                  from their own technical expert on HOLMES as regards any technical issues.




                  I hope that our Counsel will be hearing from M r Jones in the very near future.



                  Yours sincerely

              Your Ref PCM.SB.CHL057-9

              Dear Mr Metcalf

              R v, D uckenfield and M urray

              May I confirm the agreement between leading counsel fertile prosecution and counsel
              instructed by you on 3rd September 1999 and announced to thejudge. Condition number 2.1
              at page 2 of your Letter of 30* December 1998 will remain in force until further notice We
              shall put forward proposals to you in the next week about the conditions we propose to put
              before thejudge, but for the time being, so that there will be no delay in the beginning of the
              process of disclosure, we agree that this condition will apply unless and until agreed or
              ordered otherwise.

              The prosecution accepts, of course, that care must be taken with these papers. I shall
              undertake in writing to the court before the inspection and copying process begins that the
              papers disclosed, and copied, will be examined only by me, W*jlwig       one ofthe two named
             junior counsel who will be working on the case,                   trainee             a fiiH
             tune employee at these offices, and Trevor Hicks andPM Hammond, Chairman and Vice-
             Chairman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group. The prnfwentio" ™iTTnrrt
             any doubt or inquiry as the characters o f these people, for which I vouch as a unlinW of the
             Supreme Court

              Written undertakings will therefore be provided to the court, and copies of such provided to
              you, that condition 2.1 will apply until further notice. The above persons will sign such
              undertakings, I shall ensure that copies of all documents provided arm kept in s^aira
              conditions at these offices, or in counsel’s chambers. The undertakings will be signed by the
              above. I assure you that we do not want unauthorised persons to gain access to these papere.

             These conditions applyjvo tem without nrtjudice to our general argument that the Chief
             Constable has no right whatsoever to seek to apply conditions in respect of material collected
             try the West Midlands polk* for various other bodies.

                 Givoa that the material was collected for other bodies by the W«*t Midlands police, there are
                     circumstances in which the prosecution will ever agree to              2 . We will,
                 however, abide by any order o f the judge in this reaped if you should seek to insist on such an
                 absurd condition, and if the judge requires it. If we receive copies o f these documents, we
                 intend to keep them as part o f our own “Hfllsborough ardhivw" unless ordered to the contrary,
                 and we regard ourselves free to use them, with due regard to csnstderations o f confidentiality,
                 and within the law, for legitimate public comment on the disasterafter trial, and for other
                 lawful purposes.

                 Will you please indicate without delay that the South Yorkshire poHce will agree to our
                 copying die data on the Holmes computer system ontoa formatwhich we can use. We have
                 an expert available from Sellers Imago who can copy the material and convert it.

                 I invite you to indicate that the process o f inspection can begin this week, and photocopying as
^                soon as we can install our own photocopier in the premises where the papers are kept

                 I wish also to confirm that the material you will disclose is all the material in. the agreed
                 categories which is in the possession o f South Yorkshire pottos, whether or not it is kept in the
                 premises descried as an "“archive store” by Assistant CfakfConstable Dawes in Ms letter dated
                 26* August 1999. Tfcria archive is presumably tkrt located at Heeley Police Station, as
                 mentioned in Mr Dames' witness statement of 19® May 1999. My concern arises from the
                 contents ofyour tetter to me o f 10* Miay 1999, in which you referred to “a box o f documents
                 left beirind by Mr Bettisan” Any documents relating to the disaster, M ing within tie agreed
                 categories, held, by South Yorkshire police, whether within the formal archive or not, axe to be
                 disclosed, subject to PH and legal professional privilege

                In your letter to me of 26* July 1999, you disputed that you or your firm “advised the South
                Yorkshire police about disclosure o f material to bereaved fiurdfics at Ac inquest or die supply
                o f information to the CPS in 1989 or 1990 ” I enclose for your information, again, a copy o f
                letters written by Trevor Hides to his solicitor o f 13* November 1990, and the reply o f Mr
                Mervyn Jones. These and other similar documents were provided to the Chief Constable
                earlier this year in connection with the fimding issue. ( Please see Annexes D and E of material
                forwarded to Mr. Daines/ you on 31** August.)

                 You were acting personally for the South Yorkshire police at the inquest, and also in civil
                 proceedings at the time. Ifyou intend that we should accept your demal at fece value, I
                 should be gratefW far your explanation o f Mr Jones* assertion that die policy o f disclosure in
                 relation to the inquest was to be detettuned by the Sooth Yorkshire police in the fight o f legal
                 advice. Waa his r ^ y misleading? Were the Wes* Midland* police in your view
                 “constitutionally the agents o f the South Yorkshire police”? And if you were not advising the
                 South Yorkshire police, who was?

      Dear

      THE      QUESTS

      Further to our discussions                    I      would   confirm   my   ■individual   family
      “matters" are as fo llo w s :-

      Sarah Louise Hicks

     You already have copies o f the sutwnaries where Shaun Michael Fortune,
     Jeffrey Rex and Lesley Tudor a l l report conditions in the crush*’
     presumably you have copies of t h e ir f u l l statements. Perhaps they may
     form suitable witnesses and, wiih the exception of Mr Fortune, 1 see Dr
     Popper has decided to c a ll them.     In addition Paul McCaffrey has been
     called, he gave evidence saying he saw Sarah laying qn her back,          t
     would lik e to e s ta b lis h whether anybody whatsoever was giving any
     assistance to Sarah between the time quoted of 14.50 (probably 15.05
     when the b a rrie r was reported to have snapped) and 15.21 when PC Man
          ill helped carry Sarah through the hole in the perimeter fence,
     should PC Marshall be c a lle d as^a witness and do you have a copy of his
     statement?

     At sometime between 15.38 and 1 5 .SO hours an un identified member of the
     medical team stated Sarah was beyond help*          I appreciate t h i * point has
     already been d e a lt w ith by Dr Colin F le n le y ’ s evidence but th is is an
     1i : - ^ rat1.£,n of the ne8tl f a r the -Coroner to go beyond 15.15            In
     addition i t was not u n t i l 16.20 th a t Dr Mathew James Bull examined Sarah
     and c e rtifie d " l i f e e x t i n c t " .

           As with Sarah, Mr Lesley Tudor states he saw Sarah and V ic lo r ia around
           14.55.  V ic to ria appeared to be 1n distress and he describes Itow Uie
           crush continued and how he became trapped from behind by a p ile uf
           bodies, before e v e n tu a lly being released and taken to h o s p ita l.

           PC 1926 Peter John McGuinness states th a t, with other people, he pulled
           Victoria from the p i l e Of bodies at IS .21 hours and Paul Winston Turner
           Is Seen helping V ic to r ia on to the pitch in video/photographs timed at
           15.20-   There is no evidence in the summaries r e la tin g lo this G/7

           described her s l i g h t l y prominent two fro n t teeth and rust on .her face
           from the broken b a r r i e r . He went on to describe how V ic to r ia was pinned
           by her legs and was bent over backwards on the top of the p i l e of bodies
           and how she was removed in a semi-eoncious s tate . He went on to say how
           she was la id on her bock on the terraces he/others removed lier blue
           cardigan when he had been t o ld she was beyond help.                       He claimed he did
           not know how to do mouth to mouth resuscitatio n, he was put o f f by the
           smell of vofftit from her mouth and rust from the b a r rie r on her face and
           the’ fact "she was o n l y a young school k id “ . He described how he sat and

  Dear Miss Adlington

  Access to Hillsborough Archive

  My Counsel tells me that he has sent a draft of the Order made on Friday to Alan Jones for
  agreement.

  Ian Daines has asked me to indicate that access will be available as soon as the draft is agreed but
  obviously would appreciate one or two days notice as some attention will have to be given to the
  physical arranagments at Heeley Police Station where the archive is stored.

  I have a provisional arrangement to meet M r Daines on Wednesday when precise arrangements can
  be discussed.

  In the meantime it might be helpful to have some idea o f when you would like to start.

  Yours sincerely




  P C METCALF

                                      Notes of Hearing 3 September 1999
                                              Mr Justice Hooper
                                             Leeds Crown Court

         1. Representation

         HFSG/Prosecution - Alan Jones QC
         David Duckenfield - William Clegg QC
         Bernard Murray - Michael Harrison QC
         Chief Constable - Nigel Gods mark

         2. Issues relating to SYP

         2.1    These were dealt with after the other issues noted below.

         2.2    The Judge indicated at the outset that in his experience it was normal for the
                prosecutor to demand production o f large files o f eg Local Authority papers which
                were then examined for relevance by the local authority lawyer and if necessary by the
                judge.

         2.3    Counsel for SYP said that we had already indicated that we would provide access to
                 documents, with limited exceptions, subject to payment and agreement as to
                 confidentiality.

         2.4    The Judge was dissatisfied with the idea that payment should be required in relation to
                documents which were prima facie likely to be relevant.

         2.5    He acknowledged that he could only make a formal witness order in respect of
                documents which were relevant. However he pointed out that if he made such an order
                (which he would do if necessary) then it would be for then SYP, entirely at their own
                expense, to examine all the documents for relevance and to certify that this had been
                done.

         2.6    He said that in the light of that he expected that the Chief Constable would prefer to
                give voluntary access. This should be without charge except in relation to documents
                which were not obviously relevant.

         2 .7    He then went through the numbered categories in the HFSG letter o f 16 July and ruled
                as follows:

                2.7.1   (1), (2), (3), (6), (7) and (9). Unpaid access to be allowed

                2.7.2   (4). Unpaid access to any items in this category which record assertions o f fact
                        by either Defendant. Otherwise access to be paid.

                2.7.3   (5) Unpaid access to photos and videos. Otherwise access to be paid for.

                2.7.4   (10) and (11). No access at this stage
06/09 '99 MON 17:29                                    HAMMOND SUDDARDS                                        @0 04




                  2.7.5    (12). No order now. If no agreement then to be resolved by hearing before
                           Judge in London in first week o f October.

                  2.7.6    (13). No order at this stage.

         2.8      If copies are provided by SYP these can be charged for.

         2.9      Where charges are allowable the rate is £20 per hour.

         2.10     This order does not require the production of any item unless:

                  2.10.1          It is in the SYP archive.

                  2.10.2          It is not privileged on either Public Interest or Legal grounds. It was
                                   specifically conceded by Alan Jones that a note o f a meeting with legal
                                   advisers present would be privileged.

         3. Pica and Directions Hearing

         3.1      Although dealt with at this stage in the note this hearing actually took place before the
                  discovery issues above were dealt with.

         3.2.     The Judge dealt first with the issue o f his previous involvement in respect o f the______
                  report. There was no objection from any party to his continuing to deal with the case.
                  There was also no objection to his signing the indictment. At this stage Alan. Jones
                  raised the issue of an Order under Section 4(2) Contempt o f Court Act 1981 but the
                  Judge said that he would defer this until the end of the hearing.

         3.3.     All parties agreed that the Trial should commence on 6 June 2000 with an estimated
                  length at this stage o f 6 to 7 weeks.

         3.4.     The Judge then asked if there was any objection to the various counts being put to the
                  Defendants for plea. William Clegg on behalf o f David Duckenfield complained o f the
                  addition o f extra counts to the indictment after committal, particularly as one of them
                  appeared to reflect very closely the count which had been discontinued. He said that
                  he would be seeking either the intervention o f the Attorney General or a stay o f these
                  counts. Alternatively he might seek to apply to quash them as an abuse o f the process.
                  Alan Jones argued that the counts should be put. The Judge ruled that the Defendants
                  should only plead to the three counts which were the subject o f the committal and both
                  Defendants pleaded not guilty to each count.

         3.5.     There was then much discussion as to when the preliminary hearings would be heard as
                  to whether there was any abuse o f the process and/or applications to stay on other
                  grounds. In the end it was agreed that there would be hearings on 20 and 21
                  December 1999 and again 4/7 January 2000 although it was made clear that Michael
                  Harrison on behalf o f M r Murray would not be available on the December dates.

          3 .6.   The Judge ordered that the Defendant's evidence if any on the abuse argument should
                  be served by 19 November 1999 with a Skeleton Argument 7 days later.          I f no

                 evidence was to be called then the Skeleton could be served by 3 December 1999, In
                 any event the prosecution should serve a Skeleton by 17 December 1999.

         3.7.    So far as the main Trial was concerned the prosecution had to serve expert reports if
                 any by 19 November 1999 and the question o f whether the Defendants needed to serve
                 any reports would be considered at the hearing on 20 December 1999.

         3.8.    There was then a lengthy argument over admissions in which Alan Jones sought to
                 press for the Defendants to make the same admissions as had been made at the
                 Magistrates' Court. William CJegg explained that whilst they would make admissions,
                 eg. about photographs, plans etc. they would not make any admissions about the
                 Structure o f the ground or the policing. They wanted the Prosecution to call witnesses
                 in this respect so that witnesses could be cross examined. The Judge said that he had
                 no sanction to force any admissions but ordered that those admissions which were
                 going to be given should be made within 7 days. Alan Jones said that under no
                 circumstances would he call any witnesses from the South Yorkshire Police as in view
                 o f the Prosecution they were not "witnesses o f truth". The Judge said that this was not
                 essentially a matter for him but by 22 October 1999 the Prosecution would have to go
                 back to the Defendants indicating how they intended to prove matters which they had
                 alleged.

         3.9.    By the end o f November the Prosecution were to serve all witnesses statements and
                 exhibits on which they propose to rely and then the Defendants had to indicate by 17
                 December 1999 which witnesses they were going to insist on being called in person.
                 There was something o f an exchange o f this point between Alan Jones and the Judge
                 as Alan Jones kept indicating that they might wish to add further witnesses at a later
                 date and the Judge in turn referred to the possibility o f "fine tuning"

         3 .10 The next issue was the admissibility o f alleged previous admissions whether to Taylor
               or elsewhere. The Judge ruled that the Defendants should serve a Skeleton Argument
               as to what they were going to say about this by 26 November 1999.

         3.11.   They were then Ordered that Further & Better Particulars o f the Indictment should be
                 given by the Prosecution to the Defendants by the end o f this month.

         3.12.   The Judge then dealt with the contempt o f Court issue and made Orders restricting the
                 reporting o f what had been said at the hearing. Incidentally he returned to this issue at
                 the end o f the hearing relating to documents after the Defendants and their
                 representatives had left Court. He raised a specific concern about the HFSG Internet
                 sight and said that he would consider making an Order closing this down in case
                 material inadvertently appeared on it which could influence a jury. Alan Jones said that
                 they would be extremely careful about this and indeed his thought was that the
                 Transcript o f the Trial might itself be posted on the Internet. The Judge did not
                 comment on this one way or the other.

Dear Ian

Hillsborough - Documentation

Further to our meeting yesterday I apologise for the delay in getting this draft out but there was a
fax waiting for me from Ann Adlington (copy enclosed) which it seems came in on Monday
afternoon without my being notified.

In any event the fax misses the point because the Judge wanted an Order to be drawn up recording
the full details not only o f the undertaking but o f what was to be provided. As previously mentioned
our draft o f that Order was sent to Alan Jones on the morning o f Monday 6 September 1999 and as
at 10:30 this morning there has been no response in spite o f a reminder.

In all events here is my draft letter to Ann Adlington. I should be grateful if you would consider it
carefully as it is intended to set out the basis upon access will be provided and also makes a number
o f assertions as to the instructions I have received about existing documentation. You may wish to
check it with Alan Hepworth and discuss it with me before a final version is agreed on.

Y om s sincerely________

                   Given tiiet the mauaial was coDecied for other bodies by the West MidLmds police, there are
                      targgnstance* in which the prosecution will ever agree to condition 2.2 . WewilL,
                   however, abide by any order oftbe judge in this respect ifyou should seek to insist on such an
                   absurd condition, and if tbe judge requires ir. If we receive copies of these documents, we
                   iotaid to kaep them as put o f our own “HiQsboroi^gh archive" unless ordered to die contrary,
                   uxl we reyard ourselves free to uae them, with due regard to caosideretiooa of confidentiality,
                   and within tbe l»w, for legitimate public corarrnmr on the disaster after trial, and for other
                   lawful purposes.

                   WiD you please indicate without dday that the Souifc Yorkshire police w ill agree to our
                   Bflpyftig t iw» «in t h e K a l t e a t <*ui»pntg-system o n to a. f h n n at w h ic h w e c a n use. We h ave
                   ■w BtyreawMlfthte from Sellers Imago -who can copy the material and convert it.

                   I invite you to indicate that the process of inspection can begin this week, and photocopying &g
                   toon as we can W  m»*T1our own photocopier in the premises where the papers are kept.

                   I wish also to confirm that the material you will diadoie is all die material in the agreed
                   categories which is in the possession o f South Yorkshire police, whether or not it is kept in the
                   p raises           as an “archive stops’' hy Assistant Chief Constable Dime* In his letter doted
                   26* August 1999. This archive is presumably that located at Hfidey Police Station, as
                   HKMrtimifri fa MrPfiinrV n'itnw jninmimt nf I^Tifgy I1?*1? My concern arises from the
                   contents of your letter to me of 10® May 1999, in which you referred to “a box o f documents
                   left behind by Mr Bettism." Any documents relating to tbe disaster, {ailing within the agreed
                               held by South Yockahiie police, whether within tbe formal archive or not, are to be
                   dfedosed, subject to PH and legal professional privilege

                    In your letter to me o f 26* Juty 1999, you disputed that you or your firm “advised the South
                    Yorkshire police about disclosure of material to bereaved families at the request or the supply
                    rtf^ formation to the CPS in 1989 or 1990.” I enclose jar your information, again, a copy of
                    letter? written by Trevor Hicks to his soKdtof o f 13* November 1990, and the reply of Mr
                    Mervyn Jonga, These and other «jnalar documents were provided to the Chief Constable
                    earlier this year in connection with the finding issue. ( Please see Annexes D and B of material
                    &Hwarded to Mr. Daines/ you on 31*1August.)

                    You were acting personally for the South Yorkshire police at the inquest, and also in civil
                    proceedings at the time. If you intend that we should accept your denial at fius value, I
                    should be grateful for your escpiaiiatioo ofM r Joaes’ assertion that the policy of disclosure in
                    relation to the inquest w sj to be determined by the South Yorkshire police m the light of legal
                    advice. Was his reply misleading? Were the West Midlands police in your view
                    “constitutionally the agents o f tbe South Yorkshire polise’0? And if you were not advisng the
                    South Yorkshire police, who was?

                    Yours sfacoely.

           THE IHQOESTS

           F u r t h e r t o our discussions   I   would     confirm   my   individual   f a m i ly
           "m atters" are as f o l 1ow$: -

           Sarah Louise Hi cits

         You already have copies of the summaries where Shaun Michael Fortune,
         Jeffrey Rex and Lesley Tudor a ll report conditions in the crushv
         presumably you have copies of t h e ir f u l l statements. Perhaps Uicy may
         form suitable wilt-,esses and, with Hie exception of Mr Fortune, 1 see Dr
         Popper has decided to c a l l them.     In addition Paul McCaffrey has been
         called, be gave evidence saying he saw Sarah laying on her badt,             [
         would like to establish whether anybody whatsoever was giving any
         assistance to Sarah between the time quoted of 14.50 (probably 15.06                          *1
         when the barrie r was reported to have snapped) and I S . 21 when PC Alan
       >Jl3CAhall helped carry Sarah through the hole in the perimeter fence.
 |       Should PC Marshall be c a lle d «s**a witness and do you have a copy of h i s
 r       statement?

           At sometime between I S . 38 and IS.SO howrs an unidentified member cf the
           medical team stated Sarah was beyond help.         I appreciate t h is p o i n t has
           already been dealt w ith by Or Colin Flenley's evidence but this is an
           illu s tr a tio n of the need fo r the -Coroner to go beyond 1 5 . 1 5 .          In
           addition i t was not u n t il 1 6. 20 that Dr Hathew James Bull examined Sarah
           and c e rtifie d “l i f e e x t i n c t * .

           H .5 5 . v ic to r ia appeared to be in distress and he describes how Uie
           crush continued and how he .became Lrapped from behind by a p ile of
           bodies, before even tually being released and taken to ho sp ital.

           Victoria from the p i l e o f bodies at 16.21 hours and Paul Winston Turner
           is seen helping V ic t o r ia on to the pitch in video/photographs Limed at.

Dear Mr Metcalf,

R v. Dvckenfield and Murray

May I confirm the agreement between leading counsel for the prosecution and counsel
instructed by you on 3rd September 1999 and announced to the judge. Condition number 2.1
at page 2 o f your letter o f 30* December 1998 will remain in force until further notice. We
shall put forward proposals to you in the next week about the conditions w e propose to put
before the judge, but for the time bong, so that there will be no dday in the beginning o f the
process o f disclosure, we agree that this condition -will apply unless and until agreed or
ordered otherwise.

 The prosecution accepts, o f course, that care must be taken with these papers. 1 shall
undertake in writing to the court before the inspection and copying process begins that the
 papers disclosed, and copied, will be examined nnlvhvwie leading and one o f the tw o named
junior counsel who will be working on the case,                   trainee solicitor and a full­
time employee at these offices, and Trevor Hicks and Phil Hammond, Chairman and Vice-
Chairman o f the Hillsborough Family Support Group. The prosecution will not countenance
any doubt or inquiry as the characters o f these people, for which I vouch as a solicitor o f the
 Supreme Court.

Written undertakings will therefore be provided to the court, and copies o f such provided to
you, that condition 2.1 will apply until further notice. The above persons will sign such
undertakings. I shall ensure that copies o f all documents provided are kept in secure
conditions at these offices, or in counsel’s chambers. The undertakings will be signed by the
above. I assure you that we do not want unauthorised persons to gain access to these papers.

These conditions apply pro tem without prejudice to our general argument that the Chief
Constable has no right whatsoever to seek to apply conditions in respect o f material collected
by the West Midlands police for various other bodies.

        Given that the material was collected for other bodies by the West Midlands police, there are
           circumstances in which the prosecution will ever agree to condition 2.2 . We will,
        however, abide by any order o f the judge in this respect i f you should seek to insist on such an
         ••   m              j   | «   ■   *   *        w       »                   *       •       rm, m       J

        and we regard ourselves free to use them, with due regard to considerations o f confidentiality,
        and within the law, for legitimate public comment on the disaster after trial, and lor other
        lawful purposes.

        Will you please indicate without dday that the South Yorkshire police -will agree to our
        copying the data on the Holmes computer system onto a formal which we can use. We have
        an expert available from Sellers Imago who can copy the material and convert it

        I invite you to indicate that the process o f inspection can begin this week, and photocopying as
        soon as we can install our own photocopier in the preanises where the papers are kept.

       I wish also to confirm that the material you will disclose is all the material in the agreed
       categories which is in the possession o f South Yorkshire police, whether or not it is kept in the
       premises descried as an “archive store’' by Assistant Chief Constable Daines in his letter dated
       26* August 1999. This archive is presumably that located at Heeley Police Station, as
       mentioned in Mr Daines’ witness statement o f 19* May 1999. My concern arises from the
       contents o f your letter to me o f 10* May 1999, in which you referred to “a box o f documents
       left behind by Mr Bettison.” Any documents relating to the disaster, M in g within the agreed
       categories, held by South Yorkshire police, whether within the formal archive or not, are to be
       disclosed, subject to PH and legal professional privilege

       In your letter to me o f 26® July 1999, you disputed that you or your firm “advised the South
       Yorkshire police about disclosure o f material to bereaved families at the inquest or die supply
       o f information to the CPS in 1989 or 1990.” I enclose for your information, again, a copy o f
       letters written by Trevor Hicks to his solicitor o f 13* November 1990, and the reply o f Mr
       Mervyn Jones. These and other similar documents were provided to the Chief Constable
       earlier this year in connection with the funding issue. ( Please see Annexes D and E o f material
       forwarded to Mr. Daines/ you on 3 1*1August.)

        You were acting personally for the South Yorkshire police at the inquest, and also in civil
        proceedings at the time. I f you intend that w e should accept your denial at face value, I
        should be grateful for your explanation o f Mr Jones* assertion that the policy o f disclosure in
        relation to the inquest was to be determined by the South Yorkshire police in the light o f legal
        advice. Was his reply misleading? Were the W est Midlands police in your view
        “constitutionally the agents o f the South Yorkshire police’5? And if you were not advising the
        South Yorkshire police, who was?

        Yours sincerely,

  THE INQUESTS

  Further to our discussions                 I   would    confirm   my   in d iv id u a l   fam ily
  "matters" are as f o l lo w s : -

  Sar'ah L o u is e H ic k s

  You already have copies o f the summaries where Shaun Michael Fortune,
  Jeffrey Rex and Lesley Tudor a l l re p o rt conditions in the crush,
  presumably you have copies o f t h e i r f u l l statements.    Perhaps they may
  Form suitable witnesses and, w ith the exception o f Mr FurLuno, 1 see Dr
  Popper has decided to c a l l them.      In a d d itio n Paul McCaffrey has been
  called, he gave evidence saying he saw Sarah layin g on her back,.             I
  would lik e to e s ta b lis h whether anybody whatsoever was giving any
  assistance to Sarah between the time quoted of 14.50 (probably 15.06
  when the b a r r ie r was rep o rted to have snapped) and 15.21 when PC Alan
  Ma.cs.hal 1 helped c a rry Sarah through the hole in the perijneter Fence.
  Should PC Marshall be c a lle d asT’a witness and do you have a copy of his
  statement?

  At sometime between 15.38 and 15.50 hours an u n id e n t if ie d member of the
  medical team stated Sarah was beyond help .            I appreciate t h i s point has
  already been d e a lt w ith by Dr C o lin F le n le y 's evidence but t h is is an
  i l l u s t r a t i o n of the need f o r the -Coroner to go beyond 1 5 .1 5.      In
  addition i t was not u n t i l 16,20 t h a t Dr Mathew James Bull examined Sarah
  and c e r t i f i e d " l i f e e x t i n c t " .

     V ic to ria Jane Hicks

     As with Sarah, Mr Lesley Tudor states he saw Sarah and V ic t o r i a around
     14.55.   V ic to r ia appeared tg be in d is tre s s and he describes how Hie
     crush continued and how he -became trapped from behind by a p i l e of
     bodies, before e v e n tu a lly being released and taken to hospiLal.

     PC 1926 Peter John McGuinness s tates t h a t , with oth er people, he pulled
     V icto ria from the p i l e o f bodies a t I S . 27 hours and Paul Winston Turner
     is seen helping V i c t o r i a on to the p itc h in video/photographs Limed at
     15-28.     There is no evidence in the summaries r e l a t i n g to th is C/7
     minutes.

     described her s l i g h t l y prominent two fr o n t te e th and rust on her face
     from the broken b a r r i e r .    He went on to describe how V i c t o r i a was pinned
     by her legs and was bent over backwards on the top of the p i l e of bodies
     and how she was removed in a semi-concious s ta te -                       He went on to say how
     she was la id on her back on the te rra c es he/others removed her blue
     cardigan when he had been t o l d she was beyond help.                         He claimed he did
     not know how to do mouth to mouth r e s u s c ita tio n , he was put o f f by the
     smell of vomit from her mouth and rust from the b a r r i e r on her face and
     the' fact "she was on ly a young school k id " . He described how he sat and
     cuddled her f o r some minutes beFore she was passed on to the pitch -
     this six minutes could have been v i t a l to V i c t o r i a ' s s u rv iv a l had she

Dear Miss Adlington

H illsborough : SYP D ocum ents

Further to my earlier fax and in the hope that the m atter o f the Order is quickly sorted

out I thought it might be helpful to set out some points about the inspection process

which as far as my clients are concerned can begin at 2 days notice as soon as the

Order is agreed.




Firstly the Hillsborough archive is stored at Heeley Police Station, W indsor Road,

Sheffield.




Although this is not a normal working police station it is the headquarters o f the

Discipline & Complaints Department o f the South Yorkshire Police and accordingly

there are one or two security issues which I should deal with initially:-




1.     The registration numbers o f vehicles which will be entering the car park and

        will be parked there must be known and logged in advance. This can be done

        direct with Alan Hepworth.




2.     Access will be restricted to yourself and legally qualified staff with names,

        notified in advance. For the avoidance o f doubt this does not in any way affect

        what happens to documents which you copy and take away. That is a matter

        regulated solely by your undertaking.
3.   Access will be available from 10:00 am to 4:00 pm Monday to Friday but

     always with prior notification.




4.   My clients will provide a room for document examination which will have a

     power supply. There will also be access to washroom facilities.




5.   My clients propose that they will w ork their way through the requested

     documentation dealing first with that which is not to be the subject o f a

     supervision charge. They propose to bring through boxes, one at a time for

     examination.




6.   The intention is that a police officer or civilian member o f staff will be present

     in the room during inspection but not in hearing o f any conversation.




7.   If requested our clients will make available without charge an audio tape player

     and a VHS video player and monitor. As these are normal working items o f

     equipment for use at the police station they are likely to be required from time

     to time for other purposes but I would not expect this to create any difficulties.

     Please let me know if they are required.




8.   If there are non-standard audio or video tapes there will be no equipment

     available to play these.
9.     Turning to the question o f copying you indicated that you would probably

       bring your own copying machine and power will be available for this as noted

       above. Alternatively my clients will provide copies o f plain A4 material at a

       price o f       p per A4 sheet.




10.    If you require copies o f items other than plain A4 then my clients will endeavor

       to arrange this on the following basis:-




       A3 - black & white per sheet

       Colour photocopying per A4 sheet

       Photographic prints per print

       VHS video tapes                   each

       Normal audio interview tapes             each




11.    There may be some items which my clients can neither copy nor arrange for

       copying eg. BBC broadcast standard video tape. In such cases it will be for

       you to make use o f the reference numbers to obtain material direct from the

       BBC.




I now turn to the categories o f documents requested but before doing so I should deal

with that part o f your fax o f 6 September 1999 relating to where items may be located.

I am instructed that it has been the policy o f the South Yorkshire Police to locate

Hillsborough documentation (including the box referred to in your letter) in the archive

at Heeley Police Station.   I am also instructed so far as my clients are aware no

material has been moved out o f the archive save to deal with the requirements o f Lord
Justice Stuart Smith and those o f M r Cadbury. It may be that there is other relevant

material elsewhere but (with the exception o f item 9 which I will deal with below) my

clients do not accept an obligation to search for the indicated material except within

the archive at Heeley Police Station.




As to the specific items




1.     No comment needed.




2.     I am told that there are no notebooks     known to be within the archive.       Any

       "recollections" o f the type referred to should be found within item 1 above.




3.     N o comment needed.




4.     My instructions are that no meetingswere tape recorded. I am also instructed

       that my clients are not aware o f any other notes o f meetings within this

       category attended by the Defendants other than those for which you have the

       notes. This is being checked further. At this stage I have no instructions in

       relation to notes o f any meetings at which assertions o f fact about Hillsborough

       were made in the days and weeks following the disaster but at which the

       Defendants were not present. However, as such notes would be a chargeable

       item it is for you to indicate whether a search to be made.




       For the avoidance o f doubt all o f the foregoing excludes any consideration o f

       notes o f meetings at which Counsel or solicitors were present.
5.     You probably have most o f these items already but if there are any others then

       they will be produced.




6.     My instructions are that there are no tapes other than those already produced.




7.     This o f course is now restricted to officers o f the rank o f Inspector and below.

       Otherwise no comment.




8.     I await hearing whether you wish a search to be made in respect o f this

       chargeable item.




9.     My clients tell me that they do not have a copy o f M r Bume's report. I believe

       I have a copy which was loaned to Lord Justice Stuart Smith and subsequently

       returned. I will try and locate this and send it to you.




The remaining items were left over to be the subject o f a further Application if so

advised.




This brings me to the issue o f the HOLMES computer. My clients believe there may

be some misunderstanding here in that all o f your requests are for original signed

documentation. HOLMES is not (or was not then) a scanning system and the material

entered on the HOLMES system is entered by way o f copy typing.               None o f it

therefore can be described as original signed material although no doubt within the
physical files there are statements printed off from HOLMES and then signed by the

maker.




It would be helpful to know now if this affects your wish to have access to the

HOLMES material.




Aside from these points my clients are writing as indicated to The Home Office to ask

whether there are any legal or security objections and are also obtaining comments

from their own technical expert on HOLMES as regards any technical issues.




I hope that our Counsel will be hearing from M r Jones in the very near future.




Yours sincerely

    Dear Mr Daines

    R v. Duckenfield and Murray

    Thank you for your letter dated 17111August, which we received by fax . We are encouraged
    that Mr Croston is to be involved in the process o f disclosure. I earnestly hope that it can
    begin soon, so that a clearly defined procedure is established and operating in advance of the
    hearing before M r Justice Hooper on 3rd September.

    I write on the basis that you have satisfied yourself that you are in a position, in law, to
    disclose material prepared and collected, not only by the South Yorkshire police for its own
    and external investigations, but also by the West Midlands police force, and any other outside
    police force that may have investigated the disaster, for the purposes o f :

             (a) the inquiry commissioned by the Chief Constable o f the South Yorkshire police on
             16* April 1989;
             (b) the Taylor Inquiry;
             (c) the inquiries o f the Director o f Public Prosecutions;
             (d) the Coroner’s inquest; and
             (e) the investigations o f the Police Complaints Authority

    In view of the legal issues arising in this difficult and controversial case, I should be grateful
    for your confirmation in this respect. .

    The material which we wish to review as relevant to the trial itself, and in part to the abuse o f
    process/ oppression argument which M r Duckenfield’s solicitors have told us is to be brought
    yet again, is as follows:

           @          The originals o f all signed edited and unedited reports and statements made by officers
                      o f the South Yorkshire and any other police forces (eg Nottinghamshire and
                      Merseyside) relating to the disaster and its surrounding circumstances. It is necessary
                      for us to see these because o f the scale o f the editing exercise, and because there is
                      doubt surrounding the circumstances in which parts o f some statements came to be
                      written. The best example o f this is, o f course, the confusion surrounding the
                      statements o f Inspector Harry White. You will recall that another statement of his
                      came to light after a letter from D r Popper to Mr Croston in June o f this year

                      For the avoidance o f doubt, this category includes all statements made by officers as to
                      the lies told by David Duckenfield on 15* April 1989 about the circumstances in which
                      the exit gates became open.

                     electronically from that system into a disc form that we can use. Such copying will
                     relieve us o f the need to photocopy vast numbers of documents, although we anticipate
                     that there will remain a large number o f documents that we shall need to copy after
                     inspection.

                         the force.

               We anticipate from your previous attitudes towards the prosecution that you will claim that
               the items in (10) and (11) are “sensitive’7. If so, please indicate why you consider them to be
               sensitive, and what reason in law you offer to justify withholding them from the Crown.

               It may be that the list above includes the whole, or practically the whole, o f the “archive”
               We cannot be more specific, o f course, because we do not know the identity o f all the
               witnesses; a difficulty you will remember that hampered m in specifying material in the witness
               summons. We need to see this material not simply for our own purposes, but because we have
               to disclose all material that may possibly be relevant to the defence. Unfortunately, we do not
               know what the defence will be, and the question which factual issues will be contested at trial
               has not been made known.

              In order to make our task, and yours, more manageable, we have invited the defence to set out
              the nature o f their defence, but they have not done so. They declined to do so for what
              appeared to be tactical reasons at the committal.
                                                                                                                P. 0 0 5

           You will appreciate that the committal changes the responsibilities o f the prosecution. Given
           (a) the powerful rejection by the court o f the allegations o f the defence that we were abusing
           the process o f the court, and (b) the strength o f the prima facie case, it was not necessary for
           us, consistent with the law, to do more in two days at the magistrates’ court than to call two
           live witnesses, read a few uncontroversial statements, show the compilation video, and read
           the defendants’ evidence to the Taylor Inquiry and Inquest.

           Our public duties now that we prosecute in the name o f the Crown are greater. We wish to
           have as complete and full access to your material as if we were the Crown Prosecution Service
           having the conduct, on indictment, o f a case in which your force had investigated and
           instituted the proceedings.


           I should be grateful if you could indicate what exactly you mean by “supervised” access. We
           shall wish to inspect and copy material in some privacy, not least because you have expressed
           public support for the defendants, and have procured the costs o f their defence and expenses
           from public funds.

           The above list o f material is, I hope, complete so far as trial material is concerned. Other
           material relevant simply to the abuse hearing may be requested later. I reserve the right to
           seek other material for the trial, after discussions within the prosecution team. I consider it is
           more important, however, to give you an early, and possibly incomplete %t, than to delay. I
           shall send a copy o f this to M r Croston, and seek to arrange an early meeting with him and Mr
           Hepworth as you suggest.

           Yours sincerely,

 The material which we wish to review as relevant to the trial itself, and in part to the abuse o f
 process/ oppression argument which Mr Duckenfield’s solicitors have told us is to be brought
 yet again, is as follows:

            (1)       The originals o f all signed edited and unedited reports and statements made by officers
                     o f the South Yorkshire and any other police forces (eg Nottinghamshire and
                     Merseyside) relating to the disaster and its surrounding circumstances. It is necessary
                     for us to see these because o f the scale of the editing exercise, and because there is
                     doubt surrounding the circumstances in which parts o f some statements came to be
                     written. The best example o f this is, o f course, the confusion surrounding the
                     statements o f Inspector Hairy White. You will recall that another statement o f his
                     came to light after a letter from D r Popper to Mr Croston in June o f this year

                     For the avoidance o f doubt, this category includes all statements made by officers as to
                     the lies told by David Duckenfield on 15AApril 1989 about the circumstances in which
                     the exit gates became open.

            (2)       All pocket-books o f officers containing notes o f the events o f I5mApril, whether made '(L*u / o o
                     contemporaneously, or within days, or later, and all handwritten and typed “resumes”, c^cL <U
                     or other similar notes, made by officers shortly after the incident The                             L-'
                     Nottinghamshire officers, Brazener, who was called as a live witness at committal,          's
                     Hoad, and Walton refer to them. ( See reports R 498, R 499, and R 450, where one of
                     these resumes is apparently attached.)

            (3)      All original signed statements collected by the West Midlands police from those who
                     had been present at or in the vicinity of the ground at the time o f the disaster.

            (4)      All notes and tape recordings o f meetings held by South Yorkshire police officers in
                     the days and weeks after the disaster at which assertions o f fact, admissible under
                     section 24 o f the Criminal Justice Act 1988, were made about the disaster. (An
                     example is the collection o f three sets o f briefing notes o f meetings held by or under
                     the auspices of the Chief Constable on 16th, 17* and 19* April, which were produced
                     by you to the Magistrates Court on 24* June. If the notes are a transcript o f a tape
                     recording, we wish to hear and have copies o f those tape recordings also)

            (5)      All documents, photographs, plans, videotape and models, either prepared to show or
                     demonstrate the lay-out of the ground, or which record events at Hillsborough
                     between 1 and 6 pm ori 15th April 1989, in addition to those produced by the witness
                     statement, and whether such things were prepared by police, Sheffield Wednesday
                     football club, City Council or emergency services.

            (6)      All tape recordings and transcripts of tape recordings showing the content of
                     conversations taking place in or from the police control box between I pm and 6 pm
                     on 15* April 1989, not being conversations recorded by the radio multi-channel
                     system (which we have already examined after you produced the tape on 24* May),
                     whether made or produced by police officers or emergency services

            (7)      All tape and video recordings q f accounts given by police officers or other witnesses in
                     interview, whether or notuncbf caution, relating to the disaster
2 5 - AUG.' 99 (WED! 0 9 : 4 3   S. Y. P. CHIEF DEPT




            (8)      All indexes to witnesses, statements or exhibits produced for any o f the inquiries into
                     the disaster.

            (9)      All expert reports prepared for the South Yorkshire or West Midlands police forces,
                     whether for any o f the above inquiries, or for the contribution hearings of autumn
                     1990, apart from the Phillips report o f August 1990, a copy o f which you produced to
                     us in October 1997. If there are other versions o f the Phillips report, we wish to see
                     them.

            ( 10)    A copy o f the West Midlands Police Report which was sent to the DPP and Coroner in
                     1990. This cannot be considered sensitive (a) because a copy o f the Interim Report o f
                     that force of October 1989 is in the Public Record office, (b) because you have a copy,
                     though the Report was prepared for the DPP, and (c) because the Coroner has a copy

            ( 11)    A copy o f the opinion signed by Gareth Williams QC ad Peter Birts QC which was sent
                     to the DPP in 1990. This is no longer privileged because a copy has been sent to your        O ’. £$&
                     force, although it was, o f course, your force that was primarily under investigation. 4 ^ ) S/Vc ^w-^J
                     Any surviving privilege was waived when it was produced to Lord Justice Stuart-        ^ ~         %.c
                     Smith, who quoted from it in the report o f his “ Scrutiny” .

            (12) The electronically-recorded versions of the above, where they exist, stored on the
                     Holmes computer system. We have ascertained that the material can be copied
                     electronically from that system into a disc form that we can use. Such copying will
                     relieve us of the need to photocopy vast numbers of documents, although we anticipate
                     that there will remain a large number o f documents that we shall need to copy after
                     inspection.

            (13)     The charges, and list o f witnesses statements prepared for, the disciplinary proceedings
                     brought against the two defendants, but abandoned after Mr Duckenfield retired from
                     the force.

            We anticipate from your previous attitudes towards the prosecution that you will claim that
            the items in (10) and (11) are “sensitive77. If so, please indicate why you consider them to be
            sensitive, and what reason in law you offer to justify withholding them from the Crown

            It may be that the list above includes the whole, or practical^ the whole, o f the “archive”
            We cannot be more specific, of course, because we do not know the identity o f all the
            witnesses; a difficulty you will remember that hampered us in specifying material in the witness
            summons. We need to see this material not simply for our own purposes, but because we have
            to disclose all material that may possibly be relevant to the defence. Unfortunately, we do not
            krow what the defence will be, and the question which factual issues will be contested at trial
            has not been made known.

            In order to make our task, and yours, more manageable, we have invited the defence to set out
            the nature o f their defence, but they have not done so. They declined to do so for what
            appeared to be tactical reasons at the committal.
                                                                                                                 P. 005

            You will appreciate that the committal changes the responsibilities of the prosecution. Given
            (a) the powerful rejection by the court o f the allegations o f the defence that we were abusing
            the process o f the court, and (b) the strength of the prima facie case, it was not necessary for
            us, consistent with the law, to do more in two days at the magistrates’ court than to call two
            live witnesses, read a few uncontroversial statements, show the compilation video, and read
            the defendants’ evidence to the Taylor Inquiry and Inquest.

            Our public duties now that we prosecute in the name o f the Crown are greater. We wish to
            have as complete and full access to your material as if we were the Crown Prosecution Service
            having the conduct, on indictment, o f a case in which your force had investigated and
            instituted the proceedings.


            I should be grateful if you could indicate what exactly you mean by “‘supervised” access. We
            shall wish to inspect and copy material in some privacy, not least because you have expressed
            public support for the defendants, and have procured the costs o f their defence and expenses
            from public funds.

            The above list o f material is, I hope, complete so far as trial material is concerned. Other
            material relevant amply to the abuse hearing may be requested later. I reserve the right to
            seek other material for the trial, after discussions within the prosecution team. I consider it is
            more important, however, to give you an early, and possibly incomplete list, than to delay. I
            shall send a copy o f this to M r Croston, and seek to arrange an early meeting with him and Mr
            Hepworth as you suggest.

            Yours sincerely,

                   MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: I will make the following order - who
              is going record the order?

                        MR. GODSMARK:   I will, your Honour.

                        MR.   JUSTICE HOOPER: Would you do it?
    B
                        MR. GODSMARK: Yes.

                   MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Well, I say order, it is not really an
              order because parts of it are ordered and parts are n o t . I am
              going to give the result of the day.

                   MR. GODSMARK: M y Lord, I beg your pardon,           but before you do
              so, there are concerns about undertakings.

                   MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Yes, I will list the things and then we
              will do the - subject to conditions which I shall look at with
              Counsel in a moment and following the arguments that have been
              presented to me, the South Yorkshire Police will make available
              for inspection and copying, at their expense, the matters set
              out in paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 of the letter of the 20th of
    D
              August of 1999 from the Hillsborough Family Support Group to the
              Assistant Chief Constable, Mr. Ian Danes.

                      Insofar as 4 is concerned, the South Yorkshire Police will
              make that available, if it contains assertions of fact made by
              either of the two d e f e n d a n t s . To the extent to which it does
              not, the P r osecution are entitled to see those documents on
    £         payment of - it is £30 an hour? That is an agreed fee for
              t h e ...?

                        MR. JONES:    It is not agreed, m y Lord,   it imposed by....

                   MR. JUSTICE HOOPER:         Payment of a fee which I shall discuss
              with Counsel later.

                   5. Insofar as photographs and video tapes taken on the day,
              they will be m ade available to the P r osecution in the same way
              as 1, 2 and 3. T hen as far as the photographs and video tape and
              the balance, will be on payment on a fee wh i c h I shall determine
              later.

                        6. Is in categories of 1, 2 and 3, as is 7.

                        8. Avai l a b l e on payment of a fee.

                        9. The same as categories 1, 2 and 3.

                        10 and 11 I shall consider later,        if it is necessary to do
               so   ,




                     12.       Unless the Prosecution and the South Yorkshire police

               October, in London, at a time to be arranged through my clerk,
               and 13 I am not dealing with today.
                    Right, fee. You want £3 0 for providing a civilian to
               supervise.

                     MR. GODSMARK: Including the copying. We are doing all the
                copying included in t h a t .

                     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Let us not deal with the copying
               because either they bring   there own photocopier or,
     B         alternatively, they are going to get it on disc anyway. So what
               about just the person who   is going to suprevise this?

                     MR. GODSMARK: All that I can say about this is that it is
                the estimate of Mr. Danes, the Assistant Chief Constable, is
                that that what it costs him to have an individual there, in
                terms of payment for that individual, support services and all
                the unse en o v e r h e a d s .

                      MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Yes.

                      MR. JONES: Well,   m y Lord....

                     MR. GODSMARK: Sorry, I beg m y learned friend's pardon, with
                the observation that that is about what it costs to get you r car
     U         serviced these d a y s .

                     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: A little bit more,        perhaps, but anyway.
                Mr. Jones?

                         MR. JONES: Well, m y Lord, the origin of our complaint is,
                as your Lordship knows, that there was a levy of £30 an
                h o u r ....
     E
                     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: What do you say it should be? You are
                going to have to p a y something under t h e ....

                     MR. JONES: Well, we would have said that ten was more than
                adequate, more than enough. It is not b u ying a house, I know, my
                Lord, but one would have thought that - my Lord there is a deep
                history of lack of trust be t w e e n the two sides here.

                     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER:      I appreciate that.    I cannot deal with
                that today.

                     MR. JONES: No, of course not, but, m y Lord, £30 an hour we
                would regard as extortionate, bearing in mind, m y Lord, if I may
                just make this point, the So u t h Yorkshire Police have procured
                all the costs of the defence from the begi n n i n g of this private
                prosecution, all the costs and out of pocket expenses for the
                defendants. M y Lord, in those circumstances, now that the matter
                has gone past committal, one would have hoped for a little more
                gracious attitude as the CPS have shown, who are not charging us
                anything.

                      MR.   JUSTICE HOOPER:   £20 an hour. Next point?

any disclosure exercise.

     MR. GODSMARK: In m y submission, it is desirable, in the
circumstances that we have here, that those undertakings be
acknowledged and also that we are aware w e l l ....

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER:  Would you like to draft them now and
then I will   retire while you draft them    with Mr. Jones, and if
you cannot reach agreement, I will   rule    on it. Do you think you
can reach agreement on that?

     MR. GODSMARK:     I am sure.

     MR. JONES: Well, m y Lord, I would submit that we ought to
be bound by such undertakings, as implied at common law. M y Lord
it has been  decided in the case of T a v l o r , by the House     of
Lords, last  year. There is another case           called Mahn and R a h n . My
Lord, we should be subject to exactly the same implied
undertakings as though we were defendants in the case or
prosecutors.

       MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Well, I am giving you - because of the
wa y we have approached today - you have got a lot, Mr. Jones. I
want you to draft the undertakings, work together so that we do
not have any p r o b l e m s .

     MR. JONES: Well, m y Lord, we will try and agree, we try and
agree in q u a r t e r - o f - a n - h o u r . If not, we will have to ask your
Lordship to rule.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER:       First of all, you set out the ones you
are prepared to give.

     MR. JONES: Well, m y Lord,       I say the common law is adequate
protection, as it stands.

     MR.    JUSTICE HOOPER: Just draft what you say the common law
does and    then we will see how far apart you are.

      MR. JONES: V e r y well.

      MR. JUSTICE HOOPER:        What else?

     MR. GODSMARK: M y Lord, I think it implicit in the order
that you have made that we are talking about material that is
actually in the archive and in the po s s e s s i o n of the Chief
Constable.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Oh, yes, definitely. Yes, this w h y we
have to, I say, we have to go the route of the witness summons -
you are treating it as a witness summons without actually
issuing it.
                      MR. GODSMARK: I see the point of that, yes.

                   MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Yes, all right, quarter-to-two, please.
              You will now draft those undertakings. I think this order is so
              important that it ought to be drawn up rather more as if it was
              in a civil case.

                   MR. JONES:      I am sure my learned friend and I can deal with
              that,
     B
                      MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Could you do that?

                   MR. JONES: My Lord, I genuinely am anxious about this, my
              Lord. There is a big point of principle here. M y Lord, we do not
              understand w h y we are not to be trusted to receive documents on
              exactly the same basis as a prosecutor or defence team would, in
              any criminal c a s e ....

                   MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Well, Mr. Jones, you m a y be right, you
              may be wrong, but the first thing we going are going to do is
              draft what you say you are prepared to give.

                      MR. JONES: Yes.

                   MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Having done that, if there is
    D
              disagreement, and it is now quarter-to-five, it m a y be things
              will get delayed.

                      MR. JONES: V e r y well.

                                           (Short A d j o u r n m e n t )

    £              MR. JONES: M y Lord, we need not decide that at the moment
              because it is at the end of all all proceedings. M y Lord, 2.3
              has gone, requiring a brief explanation of relevance to the
              material, arid the outstanding condition is 2.1 materials
              supplied and any further copies taken will be u s e d in a bona
              fide for the purposes of the prosecution and not for any other
              purpose whatsoever. M y Lord, we have agreed, w ith your
              Lordship's approval, that that will ap p l y pro tem and if we
              cannot agree, then we have liberty to re-apply the matter afresh
              at the beginning of October.

                    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Well,          that is what is to apply now,    for
               the time being.

                      MR. JONES: Yes.

                    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Yes, well, anything else? One thing I
               meant to raise in the presence of the defendants and forgot to
               do so, is there an Internet site for the...?

                      MR.   JONES: Hillsborough Family Support Group.       There is,
               yes.

    H                 MR.   JUSTICE HOOPER:      Is there one?

     MR. JONES: There is, yes.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: The last time I had Internet site I
ordered it to be taken off because of the danger of....

     MR. JONES: My Lord, we have thought about that, a ___________
did make observations about i t . My Lord, we have got the matter
under review, I will discuss it with m y learned friends. My
Lord, can I raise with your Lordship the interesting prospect
that we proposing, w ith the Court's approval, the evidence given
in the trial, if there is a trial should be posted on the
Internet.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Yes, well that is a matter we do much
later, but what I had in the last case I had an Internet site,
in that case it was the Prosecution worried about the contents
of the Internet site because the defendants were rather someone
a considerable degree of popularity. I do not want a prosecution
going wrong because of something that should not be on the
Internet site.

     MR. JONES: My Lord, that is understood. We will make sure a
picture of you r Lordship is not put on i t .

        MR. JUSTICE HOOPER:   I do not mind about that. Thank you
v e r y much.

Dear Miss Addlington

HILLSBOROUGH: SYP DOCUMENTS

Thank you for your letter o f 24 September 1999.

As I understand it the only outstanding issue is access to Holmes records o f material held in the
archive.

I understand that you and                  have now spent several days and have been granted access
to all material covered in the Order. I gather the process has gone very well.

In the circumstances I wonder whether any request for access to Holmes tapes,of material inspected
in hard copy in any event,is still necessary?

Yours sincerely




SIMON HILLS

Dear M r M etcalf

Hillsborough: SYP Documents

I thank you for your letter o f 14* October 1999.

In order to ensure that the statements on Holmes are copied in a compatible format, 1 should
be grateful if you would provide me with the name and contact number o f the individual at the
Home Office or within SYP who is dealing with the technical side o f this matter. I will then
pass this on to our IT consultant as it obviously makes sense for them to liaise on this aspect.


Yours sincerely

HTIXSBOROITGH

Thank you for your letter o f 15 October 1999 addressed to M r Metcalf.

Aside from any security aspects which I do not want to get bogged down with at this stage I think it
is a good idea for our respective clients' experts to liaise.

Perhaps you could let me have the name and details o f your IT consultant and we will try and ensure
that someone from the police force contacts him or her.

Yours sincerely

Dear Peter

Hillsborough Stadium Disaster - Request for Access to HOLMES Material

I refer to the latter dated 7 October 1999, from Ms Ann Adlington, solicitor to the Hillsborough
Family Support Group. I refer also to the latter dated 7 October 1999, from Simon Hills (your
colleague).

The HOLMES system was introduced in the mid 1980s and has now been superseded by
HOLMES II. HOLMES I is not millennium compliant. The HOLMES system was used by
South Yorkshire Police and by West Midlands Police following the Hillsborough Stadium
Disaster of 1989. I think there are some problems with Ms Adlington’s request for copies of
the HOLMES tapes:

1.     Is Ms Adlington seeking access to the entire HOLMES material base? I see
        problems with that because the database may well include confidential materials
        such as staff’s personal problems and senior investigating officers’ policy
        considerations. The database also includes statements of witnesses. Exactly what
        material is Ms Adlington seeking?

2.     For what purpose does she seek it that is relevant to the prosecution?

3.     If we are able to transfer the material on to tapes or a disk it would only be of use to
        someone who knows how to operate HOLMES. Does Ms Adlington have the
        services of such personnel? There is no point in my spending the time copying from
        tape to tape if Ms Adlington cannot make use of it.

4.     Ms Adlington has had every co-operation in providing her with access to the
       documents held in the archive and has requested copies of a relatively small number
       of papers I wonder therefore why she continues to want access to the HOLMES
       tapes.

Dear Ian

H illsborough

Further to my letter o f 28 September 19991 have had a response from Ann Adlington to my letter to
her o f the same date.

She refers me to paragraph 12 o f her letter to yourself dated 20 August 1999. I take it from that
that she still does wish to have access to the Holmes computer.

As I understand it although material can be copied electronically from the system into disc form that
would require the user to have knowledge o f access codes which the Home Office is not prepared to
release. I suggest I simply send a response to Ann Adlington along those lines. In the meantime I
think it would assist if we could have a letter from the Home Office confirming their approach. The
danger is that Adlington will contact the Home Office direct leaving us somewhat a hostage to
fortune. Equally a letter from the Superintendent who deals with the Holmes computer would assist.

I will be out o f the office now until Tuesday 12 October 1999 and look forward to your instructions
as soon as possible thereafter.

Kind regards.

Yours sincerely

   I received your letter dated 28 September 1999 this morning. It had not been franked and sent
   through the Royal Mail, instead it appears to have been sent via the DX system. Please note
   that we do not have a DX number and all communications must be sent by post to the above
   address to avoid delay.

   In reply to your query re access to the Holmes tapes, I refer you to paragraph (12) o f my
   letter o f 20 August to Ian Daines, (attached). It is essential that access to the Holmes tapes is
   made available, in order to limit the number o f items which need to be copied from the
   archive.

SUBJECT:       RELEASE OF HILLSBOROUGH MATERIAL FROM HOLMES COMPUTER


I refer to our discussion of Wednesday 27 October 1999 and ask that you arrange for the following
action to be taken. Material should be transferred from HOLMES I to HOLMES II and then on to
CD-ROM. The work should be undertaken by UNISYS so that we can give to the prosecutor one
CD-ROM for her use, two CD-ROM’s that the prosecutor can forward to the two defendants, and
one CD-ROM that the prosecutor can forward to the court. We should retain at least one CD-ROM
for our own use. We will pay UNISYS the cost of this work and seek to recover that cost from the
prosecutor.

The material to be released on the CD-ROM should be:

1.      The index consisting of statement reference number, date of statement and name of
        statement maker.

2.      The text of each of the approximately 3,900 statements.

The index should only be released if the prosecutor does not already have it.

I am obliged to release this information because of the comments of Mr Justice Hooper in relation to
the private prosecution of David Duckenfield and Bernard Murray.

Dear M r Hepworth

Transfer o f data from Holmes

Further to our recent                       the above, I have now had the opportunity to
discuss the same with                Our requirements for the transfer o f the data are as
follows:-

        1.     The 3,000+ statements held on Holmes to be supplied on CDRom.

       2.      Data to be supplied as ACSII text file, one file per statem ent

Where addresses o f witnesses are disclosed I undertake not to supply these to any third party
without the consent o f the witness. An exception to this will obviously have to be made when
providing copy CDs to the Defence.

I look forward to receiving your charging proposals and timetable at your earliest
convenience.

I thank you for your assistance in this matter.
                                                                      &

 Dear Mr Hepworth

 Transfer o f data from Holmes

 Further to our recent discussions regarding the above, I have now had the opportunity to
 discuss the same with               Our requirements for the transfer o f the data are as
 follows: -

         1     The 3,000+ statements held on Holmes to be supplied on CDRom.

        2.     Data to be supplied as ACSII text file, one file per statement,

 Where addresses of witnesses are disclosed 1 undertake not to supply these to any third party
 without the consent o f the witness. An exception to this will obviously have to be made when
 providing copy CDs to the Defence.

 I look forward to receiving your charging proposals and timetable at your earliest
 convenience.

 I thank you for your assistance in this matter.

 Yours sincerely

               H OTES/COMM EHTS:



                              Thank you for contacting me to discuss the exporting o f statements from the Holmes system.

                              As requested, here are some proposals regarding the format to be used for supplying the data,

                              1. It would be preferable to receive the data on CDROM

                              2. I understand that the statements are stored as unformatted text I f so, please can you
                                 supply the data as ASCII text files, one file per statement

                              3. I understand that the Holmes system uses some form o f coding data to allow statements
                                 and other documents to be indexed. It would be useful if these indexing records could
                                 also be provided on the CD. In this way we could construct a database that would allow
                                 the text files to be indexed, A commonly used format for exporting this type o f
                                 information is ‘comma-delimited’ or CSV format

Dear Mr Jones

Today we are removing the remaining bay of the broken crush barrier No 124A
from the Leppings Lane Terrace. We are also removing barrier 125 from Pen 3
and barrier 129 from Pen 6, and these will be subjected to further examination
and testing in our laboratory. This is in accordance with your letter to
Mr Mackrell of 6 July 1989.

To date our examinations have concentrated on Pens 3 and 4, but in attempting
to locate a barrier similar to 124A in dimensions, structure and condition, we
examined barriers in other Pens at the Leppirjgs Lane end and also at the Spion
Kbp end. We were attempting to locate barriers which showed evidence of
corrosion under the straps at the supports and, if possible, to identify an
isolated case where corrosion had created actual holes in the horizontal tube.
In a brief examination we identified holes in various barriers within Pens 1/2,
3, 4 and 6 at the Leppings Lane end and also holes in 32 of the older style
barriers at the Spion Ktop end. Some of these Spidn Kdp barriers showed 'severe.:
                                                                                |
corrosion, with large holes of up to »'50irm being found* It must be stressed
that our examination Was in no way exhaustive and in our opinion a thorou^v
examination by an independent structural engineer is required.

It should      be noted that in his evidence to the Court of Inquiry, Dr Eastwood J
was shown      a photograph of a hole in barrier 125 and declared that such severe
corrosion      would result: in the barrier being "condemned". In view of this, I
recommend      that re-examlnation be carried out forthwith*

With the removal of the 3 barriers previously referred to, this completes the !
MSE's study at the cjxoUnd and* as far as we are concerned, the embargo placed
on Leppings Lane end can be lifted. Hcwever, for the reasons stated above,
this in no way implies HSE's acceptance of the state of the ground, this must
be dealt with by the appropriate authorities.

Yours sincerely

    Dear Mr Jones

    HlLESBGBCCXai INQUIRE - SOEMISSICNS CN BEHALF OF ER EASTWOOD

    Vfy comments on the above document are as follows:

                     8 and 9: This submission contains no mention of corrosion, or
    its Assessment, which should have formed part of the inspection procedure.
    Dr Eastwood agreed in his evidence (day 26 pl09) that barriers which contained
    corroded holes would have been condemned. The collapsed barrier contained
    corr6ded holes (HSE Report para 3.4) which would have been visible at the 1988
    inspection.

    Paragraph 10: Since deflections were not measured on each span (day 26 pll3
    Collins/Eastwood) how can it be said that both spans passed?

    Paragraph 11: Dr Eastwood stated (day 26 pll3) that "there has been an error
    in testing" and hence this paragraph is confusing.

    Paragraph 12: It was accepted eventually by Dr Eastwood that deflections could
    get larger with successive load applications(day26 pll7) and hence it is by
    no means certain that the span requiring a re-test would have passed • 'sti, *

    Paragraph 13: It has not been proved that barriers 128 and 137 were deformed
    cm or before 15/4/89. Hie test results supplied to HSE by Dr Eastwood
    (covering letter Eastwood/James dated 1/6/89) state that for barrier 128 the
    "first load application, up to 1.4 tonnes resulted in a 75% recovery after
    release of load" which suggests that, for this barrier, plastic deformation
    occurred at less than 1.2 times the design load for a new barrier (5kN/m).
    Eastwood's data require explanation.

    Recent HSE results (hot available when the report was issued) indicate that the
    crowd density Was similar in pens 3 and 4 and hence "crush pressure" would
    have been similar in the two pens.

    Paragraph 14: The Green Guide (toes not quantify "crowd pressure" and hence
    this statement could be challenged.

    Paragraph 16: A definition of "sicmificantlyM is required here. Certainlv
    barriers which were as much as 18% below the minimum recommended hei^it were
    not replaced (eg barrier 136 pen 3)
Paragraph 18: Most barriers at the Leppings Lane End had been positioned so as
to prevent spectators standing on the same step as the barrier. The examples
chosen by Dr Eastwood were not typical (day 27 p61).

Paragraph 20: Some spectators have stated that they were pressed over the
barriers, thus ccnpressing those an the lower side. The height of the barriers
is therefore very relevant.

Paragraph 22: The alignment of gaps in successive rows of barriers is
specified in the Green Guide. This does not appear to have been considered by
Dr Eastwood* Same of the gaps in the lines of barriers were well in excess of
the Guide reconmendations. For example, the gap between barriers 136 and 136A,
immediately above the collapsed spans of 124A, was 57% larger than the Guide
maximum.

Paragraph 33: I do not agree with this statement. In the absence of radial
fences, spectators would have spread more uniformly along the lappings lane
Terrace, thus reducing crcwd density in the central area.

Paragraph 42: In Pen 3, a configuration of barriers complying with the Green
Guide would have led to a reduction in pressure on specific barriers
(particularly 124A) and hence barrier collapse may have been averted, crushing
injuries may still have occurred but the death toll would, in ray opinion, have
been reduced substantially. The situation in Pen 4, where the barrier
configuration was better, and the crcfed density Was similar, supports this
view.

Paragraphs 45. 47. 48 and 50: The capacity of Pens 3 and 4 is not given,
although that of Spion Kqp is! It is not credible that "a loss in capacity"
(para 47) or "the effect an capacity" (para 48) could be quantified or
discussed unless the original capacities had been calculated already. Likewise
the only sensible way of allocating spectators to a particular pen would be on
the basis of a known and agreed capacity. The term "visibly full" (para 50) is
meaningless in this context.


Do not hesitate to contact me if you require clarification of any of the above
points* I expect to attend the Inquiry tomorrow (14th) frcm 9.30am onwards.

YoUrs sincerely

 SUBJECT:          HOLMES Material:Disclosure; Contract with Unisys

 I have discussed the position with Hammond Suddards.

 There are three points to make at this stage:

 So far as page 1 of the Agreement is concerned it is suggested that Sections I and II should be
 completed even if paragraph H has a ‘nil’ entry.

 !t is noted that there is no actual cash estimate in Section 111.

 So far as the special conditions are concerned Quaere whether the Confidentiality Agreement
 referred to at 2(b) is in fact intended to protect the commercial confidentiality of Unisys codes and/or
 software. If so, it is suggested that it is a matter for Unisys to provide a draft, which can be sent to
 Ms Ann Adlington for approval.

 Hammond Suddards further indicate that we should seek a letter from Ms Adlington on behalf of the
 HFSG accepting that any material provided will be subject to the undertaking given and recorded in
 the High Court Order of the I4 thSeptember 1999 of Mr Justice Hooper.

 The HOLMES material was never the subject of an Order. The Judge merely indicated that he was
 prepared to consider an application if the parties could not reach agreement.

 I should be grateful if you would liase with Unisys to ascertain what specific requirements Unisys
 have by way of commercial confidentiality or otherwise (above). We would then intend that
 Hammond Suddards approach the HFSG solicitor Ann Adlington in order to agree the necessary
 wording.

I refer to your letters of 29 November 1999 and 1 December 1999. Please find enclosed copies of
the statements made by the following persons:-

Former PC                           S3718 A; Trevor Hicks S317 A B C D F and QSL. Please note
there is no statement S317E by Trevor Hicks as S317D was registered twice. The only copy of
S317B I can presently locate in the archive is not an original.

I have had no success in locating a copy of the letter referred to in the HSE letter of 7 July 1989, to
ACC Jones. Neither can I find any reference to the notification referred to by Mr Collins in the
transcript from the LJT inquiry of 23 May 1989. I have previously supplied you with copies of all
the "Salmon” letters indexed on HOLMES and I am unable to find any others.

    Dear

    SYP.Archive


    I thank you for your letter o f 19thNovember.

    Could you please provide me with copy statements S3718 and S3718A made by former PC


    Further, have you been able to locate copy letter referred to to in letter o f 7* July 1989 from
    HSE to ACC Jones?

    I note your remarks concerning the Index o f Actions from HOLMES. The preliminary advice
    from Alun Jones QC is to apply for a Witness Summons for production o f same. I will, of
    course, notify you prior to an application being made.

    Finally, please find enclosed copy extract from Taylor (23*1May pm). Do you have a copy of
    the notification referred to by Mr Collins at p85, D-E. I have studied the HOLMES
    Document Index but can find no express reference to this document.

    I thank you tor your assistance.

    Yours sincerely

                       Q. Just the odd incident or not? - a . That was the only incident
                          I saw.

                       Q. What was it you did see? - A. There was a group of about 6
                          Liverpool supporters near to Dykes Lane, shouting swearing,
                          generally what would ,be considered a drunk and disorderly
                          offence,
               B
                       0. And what sort of time would that be? - A. Roughly between
                          helf-past-i and quarter-to-2.

                       q   , I think later that day you in fact went out to assist a
                             colleague because you sensed there might be trouble after the
                             incident? - a . Yes.

                       Q. And I think subsequently you had one of the more harrowing
                          tasks of the whole Inquiry? - a . Yea.

                                 MR. COLLINS;   Sir, we have got through the list of
                            witnesses rather more quickly than was anticipated.   I aw not
                            sure if Chief Superintendent Mole is actually hare yet.   If he
               D            is not he is on his way.   If he is not quite yet here 2 ask
                            now, and I don't get any ‘response, perhaps I could ask for a
                            minute or two while he arrives?

                                  LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        Certainly.         We will take a      break.


                                  HR. COLLINS:        He will be the next witness.

                                  LORD JUSTICE T A Y L O R ; Mr. Collins. I d o n ’t think there
                             is any need to put those photographs in.      Just for anybody's
                             information. I think they were marked as being photographs
                             taken at a match in i§87, so they are not directly relevant.



                                  MR. WOODWARD:    Sir, before my learned friend calls Mr.
                             Mole to give evidence, may I make a point and ask for some
                             assistance, please.   We have proceeded with some pace to date,
                             and that has been secured by the endeavours of many people who
                             have worked many, many hours since this Inquiry began.   We ere
                             now proceeding into the Police evidence.   The first witness,
                             it is to be noted, is a witness wh<* does not even appear on
                             today's list.   That is a mark of the expedition which hae been
                             procured.  Sir, may we ask, however, for the future the pace
                             be watched rather carefully lest it prejudices the fair
                             investigation and consideration of matters, because insofar •
                             for example as there may be points to be made against
                             individual Officers it would be appropriate in our submission
                             that those Officers should have notice of those points
                             specifically, and the opportunity should be given to them
                             before they give evidence for them to have their minds
                   H         put at rest or to have those matters considered.

                                  Sir,   to facilitate that and to endeavour for those who

           A
                   have to do it to give sensible and coherent direction and
                   control, would it be possible to have some order and
                   indication, not simply day to day from about half-past-5
                   for the next day, but an indication of what witnesses are
                   likely to be called some two or three day* in advance.
                   It is appreciated, sir. th^t say have to be a sort of
                   rolling list because we may proceed more quickly or more
               B   slowly from day to day, but we fear unless that is done
                   there may be prejudice and there certainly will be
                   difficulty and there may be problems in the smooth
                   flowing of this Inquiry.

                         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Yes.     Hr. Woodward, I of course
                   appreciate all you have said, not least the immense amount of
                   work and goodwill that has gone in to making the progress we
               C   have.   I hope that nothing I have said or done has suggested
                   that I am trying to rattle this Inquiry along faster than it
                   ought to do, but obviously one wants to make as much
                   progress as quickly as one can.     I am perfectly prepared to
                   leave it to counsel to judge the pace at which it f o e a ,
                   unless I feel strongly that it is either going too fast or
                   too slow. Either of those 1 would intervene on.       U p to now I
                   have felt we have not in any way stretched it by proceeding
               D   at the pace we have.   I accept w h « n we get into t h e details
                   of orders that were giveVi and inter-relation between
                   Officers in the same Force we will h a v e to look at it in a
                   little more detail, and it is bound to take e little longer,
                   gut I am sympathetic to your suggestion as far as it can be
                   complied with.   It is really a matter for you and Mr.
                   Collins to liaise about this. I think you know and 1 think 1
                   know the general order in which he wishes to proceed in
               E   going through the Police evidence, and no doubt you can be
                   given an indication of which witnesses it is intended to
                   call and roughly in what order,


#                       As far as specific points of criticism, if there are any
                   are concerned, this is not a civil case in which every
                   allegation has to be pleaded.  The general nature I think of
               F   the expected points of possible criticism has already been
                   indicated in letters which have been written by Counsel for
                   the Inquiry.  Insofar as it is possible to be more specific at
                   any stage no doubt that can be done between counsel, and if in
                   the last resort something crops up during the course of the
                   evidence of a witness, or indeed after he has finished which
                   wakes it desirable he should be recalled to have an
                   opportunity of dealing with it, that w i n be done. That is, I
               G   hope, the best uay we can proceed.

                        MR. WOODWARD:   Thank you, sir.  I was aware of the
                   recommendations of the Royal Commission at one stage some time
                   ago.

                        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Yes,  Of course, this is not
                   strictly a 1921 Act Tribunal, but nevertheless we have tried
               H   to approach the matter in the sane way as a matter of
                   fairness.

               A
                            MR. WOODWARD j  Sir, it may be right whenever any Inquiry
                       takes place it has to take place according to all the
                       circumstances, and that demands some flexibility, but if a
                       witness is to be called against whoa allegations are likely to
                       be made, then in all fairness we would submit it is fair to
                       hin at least to have.some notice and the opportunity to
                       consider it.  Thank you, sir.
                   B
                            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR;   I think really to a large extent
                       the evidence we have had in the first week has probably to
                       counsel of your experience indicated the likely areas of
                       criticism.

                            MR. WOODWARD:   But. sir, our anticipation nay be right,
                       it may be misconstrued, it may be wrong*headed. To know
                   C   particularly is the point, rather than to just guess.

                            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR;       So be it.

                            MR. COLLINS:      If it helps, I am sympathetic to the
                       request by Mr. Woodward.     All 1 can say is I will do ay best
                       to comply with it.     On the whole the allegations are covered
                       by the general allegations in the Salmon letter that has
                   D   already been sent.     It    only if there is something specific
                       against a particular Officer that I will give formal
                       notification in wring,     I have already told my learned friend
                       I have done that exercise, and he will receive specific
                       matters in relation to Chief Superintendent Duckinfield.        At
                       the moment I h a v e not done it in respect of any other O f f i c e r.
                       but since Mr. Duckinfield is intended to be either next or
                   E   neat but one and will probably take a considerable time, he
                       way have a slight breathing space.     But I will do the best I
                       can.

                            MR. WOODWARD;      Sir, we are grateful for that.         Sir, it
                       is not the good intentions that concern us, and the bona fides
                       is understood to be there, but for example today we know that
                       Mr. Duckinfield is going to be called tomorrow, and we have
                   F   not yet received the particular details, apart from the
                       generality which has been identified, concerning him.   I make
                       the point.  I don't seek to debate and argue it.  It does and
                       may cause difficulty.

                            MR. COLLINS;      Chief Superintendent Mole, please.

I thank you for your letter o f 19thNovember.

Could you please provide me with copy statements S3718 and S3718A made by former PC


Further, have you been able to locate copy letter referred to to in letter o f 7th July 1989 from
HSE to ACC Jones?

I note your remarks concerning the Index o f Actions from HOLMES. The preliminary advice
from Alun Jones QC is to apply for a Witness Summons for production o f same. I will, o f
course, notify you prior to an application being made.

Finally, please find enclosed copy extract from Taylor (23rdMay pm). Do you have a copy o f
the notification referred to by Mr Collins at p85, D-E. I have studied the HOLMES

                  O. Just the odd incident or not? - a . That was the only incident
                     I saw.

                  Q. What was it you did see? - A, There was a group of about S'
                     Liverpool supporters near to Dykes Lane, shouting swearing,
                     generally what would .be considered a drunk and disorderly
                     offence.
              B
                  0. And what sort of time would that be? - A. Roughly between
                     half-past-i and q u a r t e r - t o - 2 .

                  G. I think later that day you in fact went out to assist a
                     colleague because you sensed there might be trouble after the
                     incident? - A, Yes.

                  0. And I think subsequently you had one of the more harrowing
                     tasks of the whole Inquiry? - A. Yes.

                     (No Questions.)

                          MR. COLLINS;   Sir, we have got through the list of
                     witnesses rather more quickly than was anticipated.             I am n o t
                     sure if Chief Superintendent Hole is actually here yet.             If h
              D      is not he is on his way.      If he is not quite yet here I ask
                     now, and I don't get a n y ’r e s p o n s e , perhaps I could ask for a
                     minute or two while he arrives?

                           LORD JUSTICE      TAYLOR: Certainly,       We will take a   break.

                           MR. COLLINS:       He will be the next witness.

                          LORD JUSTICE   TAYLOR: Mr. Collins. I         d o n ’t think there
                     is any need to put those photographs in.           Just for anybody's
                     information.  I think they were marked as          being photographs
                     taken at a match in 1987, so they are not          directly relevant.

                                              (Shari.. Adjournment)

                          MR. WOODWARD:   Sir, before my learned friend calls Mr.
                     Mole to give evidence, may I make a point and ask for some
                     assistance, please.  We have proceeded with some pace to date
                     and that has been secured by the endeavours of many people wh
                     have worked many, many hours since this Inquiry began.  We ar
                     now proceeding into the Police evidence.  The first witness,
                     it is to be noted, is a witness who does not even appear on
                     today's list.  That is a mark of the expedition which has bee
                     procured.  Sir, may we ask, however, for the future the pace
                     be watched rather carefully lest it prejudices the fair
                     investigation and consideration of matters, because insofar *
                     for example as there may be points to be made against
                     individual Officers it would be appropriate in our submission
                     that those Officers should have notice of those points
                     specifically, and the opportunity should be given to them
                     before they give evidence for them to have their minds
              H      put at rest or to have those matters considered.

                           Sir,   to facilitate that and to endeavour for those who
J . L,   Ud
                                                    (3

have to do it to give sensible and coherent direction and
control, would it be possible to have some order and
indication, not simply day to day from about half-past-5
for the next day, but an indication of what witnesses are
likely to be called some two or three days in advance.
It is appreciated, sir, th^t may have to be a sort of
rolling list because* we may proceed more quickly or wore
slowly from day to day, but we fear unless that is done
there may be prejudice and there certainly will be
difficulty and there may be problems in the smooth    ,
flowing of this Inquiry.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:            Yes.  Mr. Woodward, I of course
appreciate all you have Scid, not least the immense amount oi
work and goodwill that has gone in to making the progress we
have.   I hope that nothing I have said or done has suggested
that I am trying to rattle this Inquiry along faster than it
ought to do, but obviously one wants to make as much
progress as quickly as one can.            I am perfectly prepared to
leave it to counsel to judge the pace at which it goes,
unless I feel strongly that it is either going too fast or
too slow. Either of those I would intervene on.            Up to now I
have felt we have not in any way stretched it by proceeding
at the pace we have.            I accept when we get into the details
of orders that were giveYs and inter-relation between
Officers in the same Force we will have to look at it in a
little more detail, and it is bound to take a little longer.
But I am s y m p a t h e t i c to your suggestion as far as it can be
complied with.         It is really a matter for you and Mr,
Collins to liaise about this. I think you know and I think 2
know the general order in which he wishes to proceed in
going through the Police evidence, and no doubt you can be
given an indication of which witnesses it is intended to
call and roughly in what order.

     As far as specific points of criticism, if there are ani,
are concerned, this is not a civil case in which every
allegation has to be pleaded.  The general nature I think of
the expected points of possible criticism has already been
indicated in letters which have been written by Counsel for
the Inquiry.  Insofar as it is possible to be more specific a
any stage no doubt that can be done between counsel, and if i
the last resort something crops up during the course of the
evidence of a witness, or indeed after he has finished, whicf*
makes it desirable he should be redalled to have an
opportunity of dealing with it, that will be done.  That is,
hope, the best way we can proceed.

     MR. WOODWARD;   Thank you, sir.  I was aware of the
recommendations of the Royal Commission at one stage some tim
ago.

     LORD JUSTICE T A Y L O R :    Yes.   Of course, this is not
strictly a 1921 Act T r i b u n a l , but nevertheless we have tried
to approach the natter in the sane way as a matter of
fairness.

                                                DI S CUSSION




     MR. WOODWARD:   Sir, it may be right whenever any Inquii
takes place it has to take place according to all the
circumstances, and that deaands some flexibility, but if a
witness is to be called against whoa allegations are likely t
be made, then in all fairness we would submit it is fair to
hia at least to have.some notice and the opportunity to
consider it.  Thank you, sir.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR;   X think really to a large extent
the evidence we have had in the first week has probably to
counsel of your experience indicated the likely areas of
criticism.

     MR. WOODWARD;             But, sir, our anticipation aay be right,
it may be m i s c o n s t r u e d , it may be wrong-headed. To know
particularly is the point, rather than to just guess.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR;        So be it.

     MR. COLLINS;   If it helps, I am sympathetic to the
request by Mr. Woodward.   All I can say is I will do my best
to comply with it.  On the whole the allegations are covered
by the general allegations in the Salmon letter that has
already been sent.  It i| only if there is something specific
against a particular Officer that I will give formal
notification in wring.   I have already told my learned friend
I have done that exercise, and he will receive specific
matters in relation to Chief Superintendent Duckinfield.   At
the moment I have not done it in respect of any other Officer
but since Mr. Duckinfield is intended to be either next or
next but one and will probably take a considerable time, he
may have a slight breathing space.   But I will do the best I
can.

     MR. WOODWARD:    Sir, we are grateful for that.   Sir, it
is not the good intentions that concern us, and the bona fide?
is understood to be there, but for example today we know that!
Mr. Duckinfield is going to be called tomorrow, and we have
not yet received the particular details, apart from the
generality which has been identified, concerning him.    I make
the point.  I don't seek to debate and argue it.    It does and
may cause difficulty.

     MR. COLLINS:      Chief Superintendent Mole,      please.

Dear Ms Adlington

PROVISION OF HILLSBOROUGH STATEMENTS ON CD

I refer to your letter of 29 December 1999 and my telephone conversation with           y in your
office at 1405 on Tuesday 4 January 2000, regarding the 27 statements registered on HOLMES,
but not typed on the system and therefore, not reproduced on the CD. The simple explanation for
the majority of these 27 statements (26 out the 27) is that they were entered on HOLMES in error.
The statements do not exist and they are not held in the archive as asserted in the second
paragraph of your letter.

The exception to the above is the first statement on the list, S77 by                This statement
was taken and registered on HOLMES, but not typed on because i was unsigned. The statement
was returned for signature and lost in transit. A decision was taken not to retake the statement as
               lad completed a QSL (Questionnaire Supporter - Liverpool). This is endorsed on
the HOLMES system.

Of the remaining 26 statements all are supplementary statements and the original statement and
in some cases, supplementary statements are all contained on the CDs supplied to you. 23 out of
the 26 statements have an endorsement on HOLMES that the number has been used in error.
An example of this from the list is S317E by Trevor Hicks, which you and I have previously
discussed together and established that one of Mr Hicks’ statements was actually registered twice.

The 3 statements which have no endorsement against them on HOLMES are:

S1981

S2628

S2657




                                                 The person dealing with this correspondence is:
                                                 Mr A M Hepworth
                                                 (0114) 296 3084
                                                 2




I have carried out a physical check of the original statements in the archive and none of these
three actually exist. My presumption is, therefore that they were entered in e rror also. In all 3
cases the original statements and the supplementary statement by           and              are in
the archive and you will have copies on the CD.

Finally, may I apologise for the delay in responding to your letter in writing, but after speaking to
             bn 4 January I was struck down by the influenza bug and was unable to work for the
last 2 weeks

Yours sincerely

Dear Ms Adlington

SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE ARCHIVE

I refer to your faxed letter of 15 November 1999, our telephone conversation and my fax of
16 November 1999. Please find enclosed a schedule of the documents, statements, photographs
and indexes disclosed and copied to you, between 17 September and 2 November 1999.

Moving on to the other points in your letter, whilst I disclosed to you on 16 September 1999 two
statements, S3718 and S3718A, made by former P C | ^ n d again, on 17 September 1999,
together with a Police Officers’ Questionnaire (QPO) completed by             you did not request and
I did not supply you with copies of these statements.

I am unsure of and cannot identify the relevance of the Index of Actions from HOLMES to the
Prosecution in the case of Adlington - V - Duckenfield and Murray. Nor can I find anything in the
order in respect of material held by the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police in the
“Hillsborough Archive” made by the Honourable Mr Justice Hooper in the High Court, on 3
September 1999, that required disclosure of this index. I have discussed this with Mr George
Croston of the Crown Prosecution Service and am declining to disclose the index. Having said
this, I would point out that there are 8,678 actions on the index and I estimate that it would take
over three hours just to print it, providing the equipment could function correctly over this period.

Finally, I am presently unable to ascertain the whereabouts of the photographs which should have
been in the file marked Hicks. A search of likely places in the archive has not revealed them, but I
will continue to look for them as and when I am working in there.




                                                                                                       2 2 NOV 1999

    Re: your fax - copy correspondence HFSG

    Unfortunately, I am not able to assist as Discipline & Complaints do not deal with
    these matters.

    It might be appropriate to send a letter to Ann Adlington informing her that both Ian
    Daines and Alan Hepworth are currently on annual leave.

    The correspondence has been filed for attention and information, pending
0   return from annual leave.

            Dear Ms Adlin jton

            SOUTH'YORf SHIRE POLICE ARCHIVE

            I refer to your1axed letter of 1S November 1999, our telephone conversation and my fax of
            16 November I999. Please find enclosed a schedule of the documents, statements, photographs
            and indexes d sclosed and copied to you, between 17 September and 2 November 1999.

            Moving on to tie other points in your letter, whilst I disclosed to you on 16 September 1999 two
            statements, S: i718 and S3718A, made by former PC               and again, on 17 September 1999,
            together with a Police Officers' Questionnaire (QPO) completed by             you did not request and
            I did not supply you with copies of these statements.

             I am unsure o- and cannot identify the relevance of the Index of Actions from HOLMES to the
             Prosecution in the case of Adlington - V - Duckenfield and Murray. Nor can I find anything in the
             order in respeit of material held by the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police in the
               Hillsborough ^rchive" made by the Honourable Mr Justice Hooper in the High Court, on 3
             September 19 39, that required disclosure of this index. I have discussed this with Mr George
             Croston of the Grown Prosecution Service and am declining to disclose the index. Having said
             this, I would pfmt out that there are 8,678 actions on the index and I estimate that it would take
             over three hoi rs just to print it, providing the equipment could function correctly over this period.

             Finally, I am p ‘esently unable to ascertain the whereabouts of the photographs which should have
             been in the file marked Hicks. A search of likely places in the archive has not revealed them, but I
             will continue     look for them as and when I am working in there.

Dear Ms Adlington,

Private Prosecution of Mr D. Duckenfield and Mr B. Murray

I refer to your letter of 11 February 2000 on the above subject. I read your letter when I
returned from leave today. I have been informed that Mr. Justice Hooper has ruled that the
prosecutions may continue.

You refer to applying for a witness summons to require me to produce documents; please let
me know the result of that application.

You ask for the addresses of six police officers and give me their surnames only. As there
were about 1,000 officers on duty on the day of the disaster, there may be more than one
officer with the surname of W HITE, likewise JACKSON. It will help me to assist you if you
can give me the full name of each of the people concerned.

Some months ago you asked me for the home addresses of serving and retired police
officers so that you could contact them. For reasons of confidentiality I declined to give you
their addresses. Instead, I forwarded to each of the officers a letter from you. I propose to
use the same procedure on this occasion.

Yours sincerely,

Dear Ms Adlington

Private Prosecution: Hillsborough Stadium Disaster 1989

I am writing this letter in identical terms to Richard Manning, Walker Morris Solicitors and
Simon Eastwood, Winckworth Sherwood Solicitors.

Following the decision of Mr Justice Hooper on Wednesday 16 February 2000 to allow the
private prosecution to continue to trial I anticipate that I will receive requests from the
defence and the prosecution for access to witnesses and documents. In order to be as even
handed as possible I suggest that any correspondence that I receive from one party should
be copied to the other two parties. Likewise I suggest that any reply I send to one party I will
copy to the other two parties. Unless I hear from you to the contrary I will take it that you
have no objection to this even handed approach.

Yours sincerely

      R ceina v- David Godfrey Duckenfield and Bernard Dean Murray

      The Crow n is considering w hether to call officers who w ere connected w ith the H illsborough
      disaster to give evidence at the forthcom ing trial o f the above nam ed for m anslaughter and
      m isfeasance at the Leeds Crow n Court beginning on 6th June.

      Previously, w e had considered, in the exercise o f our public duties, that it w ould be
      inappropriate to call any such w itnesses, but we have been pressed by the lawyers acting for
      the defcnce t o reconsider. M r W illiam C legg QC in particular has argued that w e ought to
      call som e o f those officers in the interests o f fairness.

      A ccordingly w e are looking at this again. W e would request you to attend our offices here
      for interview, to answ er further questions, and if appropriate to sign a fresh witness
      statem ent. This is obviously the best place for such an interview, because w e have all the
      papers here.' W e shall pay reasonable travelling expenses.

      We are approaching you at this stage because the judge rejected last w eek the application
      m ade by the defendants that the case should be dismissed on the ground o f abuse o f process.
      It m ight have been a w aste o f tim e to have interviewed you before.

       We w ish to serve all outstanding evidence on the defence by 15* M arch, as directed by the
      judge, M r Justice Hooper. I should therefore be grateful if you could respond at your earliest
      convenience so that we can m ake an appointment.

      W ould you please let m e know w hether, if you are called as a witness, you w ould require to
      be served w ith a witness summons.

      Yours sincerely

I refer to your fax of 12.45, 28 February 2000.

I previously said that I would accept service of the witness summons by post.            Fax
transmission is not postal service. Please send the summons by post.

You make no reference to the payment of my witness expenses. The date is not recorded at
the head of the summons. The summons does not show the time and date I am required to
produce the documents. When you make postal service of the summons please address the
issues. I am considering whether to apply to have the summons set aside after it has been
properly served.

Yours sincerely

Dear Ms Adlington

Private Prosecution of Mr David Duckenfield and Mr Bernard Murray

Thank you for your letter of 3 March 2000. I have discussed the letter with Hammond
Suddards (Solicitors). I have also discussed your letter with Mr Alan Hepworth, Hillsborough
Archivist, and Detective Superintendent Phil Jones. Detective Superintendent Jones is a
very experienced detective officer who has lead a number of major enquiries and is,
therefore, familiar with the normal practices regarding disclosure. He is also the South
Yorkshire Police expert in the use of the HOLMES computer system (previous generation
and new generation).

I raise the issue of witness expenses on this occasion in the same way as I did before
committal. If you are to seek a series of witness summonses requiring me to attend court to
produce documents on a number of occasions then I would have to ask for the expenses I
incur. However, if you can give me your assurance that you do not foresee any more
requirements than the current one then I will not insist upon expenses. Can you give me that
assurance?

I am advised the summons is invalid because it does not give a time or date on which I am
required to attend the Crown Court at Leeds to produce the documents specified in the
schedule. However I will work on the premise that we will try to resolve this by co-operation.
If we cannot, I think the onus will be upon you to apply to the judge for a summons with a
date on it so that I can then consider applying to have it set aside.

I am advised by Detective Superintendent Jones that the production of an electronic disc
containing the index of the actions on the HOLMES system would require us to commission
Unisys to produce that disc. Unisys are the computer company who made the HOLMES
system. I am conscious of the timetable to which you are working and it would have helped
me greatly if you had formally notified me of this request at an earlier date,
bearing in mind that you began this prosecution in April 1998 (23 months ago). It will take
some weeks for Unisys to be booked to do this work and to complete it. They will need to be

paid for that service and I wonder if you would be prepared to meet that cost. However I can
produce a paper print out of the index fairly soon. As there are about 8,000 entries on the
index this will be quite a bulky document so I will arrange for it to be delivered to you by hand
as soon as it is ready.

I am advised by Detective Superintendent Jones that your request for the disc containing the
reports, statements, et al, would be technically extremely difficulty and time consuming. It
would also be outside of normal practice in relation to disclosure. For that reason I am not
inclined to agree to that request. However, if you identify from the index individual actions
which are relevant to the prosecution then I can consider printing off the report or statement
that flows from that heading.

Yours sincerely

Dear Sir


R v Duckenfield.and M urray


I am disappointed by the unhelpful attitude, displayed in your letter o f 2nd March, to the order
o f the court. You will by now, I hope, have received by post as you insisted the order o f the
court sent to you previously by fax.. On 11th February 2 0 0 0 1 invited you by letter sent by fax
to be represented at the hearing on 16th February when I hoped time would be available for
the matter to be discussed. I received a reply on 16th February that you had not received the
letter because you had been on holiday.

Time did not allow the matter to be dealt with after Mr Justice Hooper had delivered his
ruling and had considered the venue for the trial, and the matter was therefore the subject o f a
written application. Mr Justice Hooper has dealt with this matter in the same way that he
dealt with our application for discovery o f statements and relevant exhibits on 3rd September
1999.

On that occasion, we asked the judge to make a witness summons. Mr Justice Hooper, in his
capacity as the trial judge simply made an order, in similar terms to that which he has just
issued. Neither counsel instructed on your behalf, nor Mr Peter M etcalf o f Hammond
Suddards, who has extensive experience o f these matters, objected to this efficient way o f
proceeding. I think the judge expected then, as he expects now, that there will be sensible co­
operation in these matters, rather than a pedantic insistence on form and technicality. I do not
remember that you insisted on your travelling expenses in September, nor that the judge
made any provision in that regard. I invite you to say why you have now adopted a different
approach to the judge’s order.

The documents sought, as a matter o f elementary constitutional theory, are requested in a
prosecution conducted by the Hillsborough Family Support Group in the name o f the Crown.
The documents are unquestionably relevant to the subject-matter o f the trial. One o f the
duties the Crown has, is to provide the defence with all relevant material known to us to be in
the possession o f “the total apparatus o f the Crown”, which includes the South Yorkshire
police force.

The disclosure w ill therefore be available to both prosecution, and to the defence . I invite
you to respond positively and without delay. It has been ruled by the trial judge that the trial
is not an abuse o f process, and the magistrate has ruled that there is a case to answer.

This is a bona fide, soundly based prosecution, and your early cooperation w ill be gratefully
appreciated. The trial is due to start in three months’ time.

Yours sincerely,



Ann Adlington

Dear Sir

Regina v. David Godfrey Duckenfield and Bernard Dean M urray

Thank you for your letter o f today’s date.

At the moment I cannot foresee any need to seek a series o f witness summonses. As pointed
out in my letter o f 3 March it is obvious that Mr Justice Hooper expects matters to be
resolved by co-operation between parties. I will need to see a number o f original witness
statements but this can be done by visiting the archive. I will o f course provide Mr Hepworth
with a list o f those statements in advance and make the necessary arrangements through him.

I am surprised at your suggestion that my current request should have been made at an earlier
stage given your attitude towards production in the Leeds Magistrates’ Court and indeed,
before Mr Justice Hooper on 3 September. Further the application made on 21st February sets
outside the reasons for the application being made at this juncture in time.


I am very anxious at the time which has already elapsed since Mr Justice Hooper made his
order on 24thFebruary. I trust that in the light o f your offer to supply an index fairly soon,
that the information contained within the index would enable me to identify various reports
etc. Can you please confirm that this is the case by tomorrow morning. If such confirmation
is forthcoming, I would be prepared to pay courier charges for the material to be delivered to
these officers by close o f business on Friday 10thMarch. You must understand, that in the
absence o f co-operation from yourself, we will have full recourse to all legal rights available to
us.

Yours faithfully

Dear Ms Adlington

Private Prosecution of Mr David Duckenfield and Mr Bernard Murray


Thank you for your fax of 5.24 pm, Wednesday 8 March 2000.

I am grateful to you for indicating that you do envisage making other applications for witness
summonses. You appear to accept my contention that the document signed by Mr Justice
Hooper is not a witness summons. Therefore, I do not, indeed cannot, ask for witness
expenses in connection with it.

I have made arrangements for the index of actions to be printed and delivered to your office
soon.

Yours sincerely




Ian Daines

     Dear Sir

     Regina v. David Godfrey Duckeafield and Bernard PeflflMortaY

     Thank you for your letter o f today’s date.

     At the moment I cannot foresee any need to seek a series o f witness summonses. As pointed
     out in my letter o f 3 March it is obvious that Mr Justice Hooper expects matters to be
     resolved by co-operation between parties. I will need to see a number o f original witness
     statements but this can be done by visiting the archive, 1 will o f course provide Mr Hepworth
     with a list o f those statements in advance and make the necessary arrangements through him.

     1 am surprised at your suggestion that my current request should have been made at an earlier
     stage given your attitude towards production in the Leeds Magistrates’ Court and indeed,
     before Mr Justice Hooper on 3 September. Further the application made on 21"' February sets
     outside the reasons for the application being made at this juncture in time


     I am very anxious at the time which has already elapsed since Mr Justice Hooper made his
     order on 24th February. 1 trust that in the light o f your offer to supply an index fairly soon,
     that the information contained within the index would enable me to identify various reports
     etc. Can you please confirm that this is the case by tomonrow morning. ITsuch confirmation
     is forthcoming, I would be prepared to pay courier charges for the material to be delivered to
     these officers by close o f business on Friday 10® March. You must understand, that in the
     absence o f co-operation from yourself; we will have full recourse to all legal rights available to
     us.

     Yours faithfully

    Dear Mr Marshall

®   Regina v David Godfrey Duckenfield and Bernard Dean Murray

    The Crown is considering whether to call senior officers who were connected with the
    Hillsborough disaster to give evidence at the forthcoming trial o f the above named for
    manslaughter and misfeasance at the Leeds Crown Court beginning on 6th June.

    Previously, w e had considered, in the exercise o f our public duties, that it would be
    inappropriate to call any such witnesses, but we have been pressed by the lawyers acting for
    the defence to reconsider. Mr William Clegg QC in particular has argued that w e ought to call
    some o f those officers in the interests o f fairness.

    Accordingly w e are looking at this again. We would request you to attend our offices here for
    interview, to aftswer further questions, and if appropriate to sign a fresh witness statement.
    This is obviously the best place for such an interview, because we have all the papers here.
    We shall pay reasonable travelling expenses.

    We are approaching you at this stage because the judge has recently rejected the application
    made by the defendants that the case should be dismissed on the ground o f abuse o f process. It
    might have been a waste o f time to have interviewed you before.

    I should be grateful if you could respond at your earliest convenience so that we can make an
    appointment.

    Would you please let me know whether, if you are called as a witness, you would require to
    be served with a witness summons.

    Yours sincerely

M rW W W Jackson
c/o South Yorkshire Police

Dear Mr Jackson

R v. Duckenfield and Murray

I am disappointed to read your response to my letter o f 22 February, asking you to assist
further in the prosecution. I had hoped that you would consider it a public duty to assist the
Crown.

I enclose for your information a copy o f the indictment. I should perhaps explain that the case
was committed for trial by a stipendiary magistrate in July 1999 on charges o f manslaughter
and misfeasance. A submission o f no case to answer was rejected. Until the committal, it
was a private prosecution following information laid by me before the Magistrates Court in
July 1998. Now, o f course, as a trial on indictment, it is conducted in the name o f the Crown.

Various unsuccessful attempts have been made to quash the proceedings. An application was
made by the defence in July 1998 to the Crown Prosecution Service to take over and
discontinue the prosecution. It was rejected in December 1998. An application was made to
the Divisional Court seeking judicial review o f that decision. It failed in March 1999, except
for a charge o f attempting to pervert the course o f justice, which the Divisional Court asked
the CPS to reconsider.

The magistrate rejected a submission that the prosecution was oppressive and an abuse o f
process o f the court, as did Mr Justice Hooper at the Leeds Crown Court in February 2000.
Count 4, which has been deleted from the indictment, was an allegation o f attempting to
pervert the course o f justice in respect o f which the Attorney-General has issued a nolle
prosequi.

Count 5 refers to the alleged lies told by Mr Duckenfield to a number o f parties at the match
that the crush had been caused by spectators breaking down the exit gates. That count has
been added since committal, and we understand that there will be an application to quash it at
the outset o f the trial. However, even if it is quashed, the alleged lies will be relied on in
support o f the other charges.

The case is founded on a number o f spectators present at the match, videos, documentary
material such as operational orders, and the oral and written evidence o f the defendants given
to the Taylor inquiry, and the oral evidence given by them to the Coroner.

                                               -   1
                                                   -

               1st Floor Central Buildings 41 North John Street Liverpool L2 6RR
The areas which we wish to question you about are principally these;

      your knowledge, if any, o f crushing at previous semi-finals, particularly 1987 and 88;

      your knowledge as to why manpower levels were reduced from the 1988 semi finals to
      the 1989 semi-final;

      whether you were concerned with the change o f senior ranks involved with the
      Hillsborough disaster;

      the origins, purpose and composition o f the Operational Order for 15/4/89;

      the extent o f your personal involvement in the construction o f the Operational Order
      for 1989.

      whether Mr Duckenfield contacted you with a request for additional resources before
      operational order was finalised. If so, what resources were requested and what was
      your response;

      the origins o f and justification o f the “find your own level policy” for filling the
      terraces;

      your knowledge o f relations between the South Yorkshire police and the football club,
      and their respective responsibilities for ensuring the safety o f spectators;

      your knowledge o f the briefing given to stewards by former Insp White;

      your movements between 12-3pm on 15th April 1989. In particular, did you visit the
      Niagara club during this period;

      what practices existed for closing off the tunnel under the west stand when the central
      pens were closed;

      what you told James Sharpies, the former Chief Constable o f Merseyside, in the
      corridor leading to the directors’ rooms at approximately 3.30 pm on the day o f the
      disaster;

      the causes o f the disaster from your expert perspective;

      whether you made contemporary notes after the disaster;

      when you made your first statement in writing about this;

      whether your statement was edited or vetted before it was finalised; if so, why and by
      whom;




                                               -2-
       what you heard on 15* April 1989 o f the allegation that supporters had broken down
       the gates;


       what Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray said about this allegation in internal South
       Yorkshire meetings after the disaster.

You will be aware that you did not deal with many o f these matters in your original statement
and evidence.

We are engaged upon wholly normal investigative activities As I said before, the defence have
positively asked us to call senior officers from the force, and we are now taking the
conventional course o f interviewing them about relevant matters and preparing the evidence
for trial.

I invite you again to attend for an interview. If you decline please deal with these matters in
writing as a matter o f urgency. I note that although your response to my letter o f 22 February
was dated 2ndMarch, it was not posted until 7thMarch at Sheffield, reaching this office on 8th
March. I cannot emphasise too strongly the tight timescale to which the prosecution is
working.

Would you please provide me with your address so that I can communicate with you directly.
I undertake not to disclose your address beyond the prosecution team.

Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Daines

Private Prosecution: Mr D G Duckenfield
                     Mr B D Murray

I refer to your letter of 21 March 2000, concerning the above matter. I am
sorry for not replying earlier. My wife and I only returned to the UK yesterday
evening.

I have read the sealed letter from their solicitors conducting the private
prosecution. I am returning it to you along with the stamped envelope. This is
the first intimation I have received that I may be called to give evidence.

I would be grateful if you could inform the solicitors that I do not wish to be
interviewed by them. All parties will be aware that I gave evidence at every
stage of the previous enquiries and this is a matter of public record. The
p assa g e of time has blurred my memory of the finer detail of events in any
ca se.

Perhaps it could also be noted that I shall be abroad with my wife between
W ednesday 24 May and Monday 10 July 2000. T hese travel arrangements
were made long before the commencement date of the trial w as known.

I would be grateful if I could be given a firm indication a s soon a s possible as
to whether I am to be called a s a witness so that I may make appropriate
arrangements with the travel companies with whom I have contractual
agreem ents.

I have no objection to you copying this letter to interested parties subject to
my home address and telephone number remaining discreet.

Yours sincerely




Roger Marshall

  Dear Ian

  PRIVATE PROSECUTION OF MR DAVIP DU CKENFEELD and MR BERNARD
  MURRAY

  Thank you for your faxes o f 21 March 2000 the contents of which are noted.

  As you are aware, the HFSG is chasing, amongst other people, Walter Jackson, for a statement. Mr
  Jackson has sought the advice of Messrs Crutes who have written to us recently seeking assistance
  in relation to numerous points raised by the HFSG. In particular they wish to question him on his
  involvement in the Operational Order and also in relation to compilation of, and any amendment to,
  statements provided by him.

  Messrs Crutes would now like to see a copy of the signed and dated Operational Order and also
  would like assistance in relation to the statements.

  As regards to the Operational Order, I cannot release that without your permission but my advice
  would be that a copy should be released to Mr Jackson.

  As regards to the second request, obviously this is directed in reality to Peter. We have discussed
  the matter and we think to save potential future problems the response should come from myself on
  behalf of this firm stating that we cannot answer from recollection, but that we can assist by way of
  reference to the file note of the meeting on 2 May 1989 with Mr Jackson when statements were
  discussed. HFSG have already seen a copy of that file note as it was passed to Stuart Smith LJ.

  I look forward to your instructions.




                      HILLS                                                                                                              chi.057-0009.let.1004.asah

    Dear Ms Adlington

    R v DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

    I refer to our telephone conversation of today about the RACAL 40 track tape, which recorded the
    telephone and radio conversations/transmissions within the Operations Room at South Yorkshire
    Police Headquarters on Saturday 15 April 1989. I confirm that I have located copy tape cassettes of
    the detail recorded on 25 of the tracks for the 24 hour period of the tape.

    I have also located a report, the author of which is unknown, that describes the RACAL recording
    system and details the source from which each of the 25 tracks (tape channels) in use records its
    material. I enclose a copy of this report for your information and hopefully greater clarity.

    Yours sincerely

Dear Ms Adlington

RE: SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE INITIAL SUBMISSIONS TO TAYLOR

I refer to your faxed note of 9 May 2000 and our telephone conversation earlier that day regarding the
above. When we were speaking on the telephone I thought I knew of the document to which you
were referring and that I had seen it in the archive, hence my uncertainty in responding to your
request to trace it.

A check of my records reveals that I disclosed the document to you on Thursday 14 October 1999, at
the same time as I disclosed the original submissions of Treasury Counsel, Sheffield City Council,
HSE, Eastwoods, South Yorkshire Fire Service and South Yorkshire Ambulance Service.
I supplied you with all these documents again on your next visit to the archive at Heeley, on
Tuesday 19 October 1999. It was on this date that you asked for a copy of the FA original submission
to LJT and I was unable to supply, let alone confirm it existed.

The original submissions referred to above were again provided to you on Wednesday
20 October 1999, with the exception of the South Yorkshire Fire Service one which had been copied
to you the previous day. This was the last day on which you had possession of the South Yorkshire
Police original submission and you did not request a copy of it.

Yours sincerely

Dear Ms Adlington

HILLSBOROUGH DOCUMENTATION

I refer to the final paragraph of your faxed letter dated 4 May 2000, regarding the production to the
court of some or all of the original witness statements, if required by the Trial Judge. I also refer to
our telephone conversation which clarified that the number of statements to which you were referring
was restricted to those original statements, which I have copied to you. On this basis I am please to
confirm that someone from South Yorkshire Police will produce these statements to the court if
directed to do so, by Mr Justice Hooper.

It would be helpful to me if you could furnish a list of all the statements which fall into the above
category by the commencement of the trial, in order that I can have them ready for production if this
proves necessary.

Yours sincerely

Dear Ms Adlington

RE: SCHEDULE 2 OF YOUR LETTER DATED 4 MAY 2000

I refer to the above and mv initial reply dated 12 May 2000. Enquiries with the West Midlands Police
reveal that both                           and Michael G Long (MGL 3/12) are still employed in the
Photographic Department of that force.                                                         is no
longer employed by them and now lives in the United States of America.

I am still unable to identify the photographer of WM 2/39, but Mick Long will try to assist you if write to
him at Mr M G Long, Photographic Department, West Midlands Police, Lloyd House, PO Box 52,
Colmore Circus, Queensway, Birmingham B4 6 NQ, enclosing a copy (a light photocopy will suffice) of
WM 2/39.

At the present time they are unable to trace any statement they may have made relating to the taking
of photographs and while             Relieves he did make a statement, Mr Long cannot recall whether
he did or not.

Yours sincerely

Dear Ms Adlington

RE: SCHEDULE 2 OF YOUR LETTER DATED 4 MAY 2000

Research in the Hillsborough Archive has enable me to identify the photographer of 18 out of the 19
pictures on your schedule. The only one where I have been unsuccessful to date is number 2, with
the exhibit reference WM2/39.

Number 1, exhibit number CC1/1 was taken by                >f West Midlands Police.

Numbers 3, 4, 6 , 7, 8 and 9, exhibit numbers WM1/3, WM1/4 etc are identical to the same numbered
photographs in an album bearing the reference RAH/HILL 2-B. Numbers 18 and 19, exhibit numbers
WMP51 and WMP52 are identical to the same numbered photographs in an album bearing the
reference RAH/HILL/1-T. Numbers 5. 10, 12, 13, 14, 16 and 17 also bear the RAH reference and all
were taken by_____________________ of West Midlands Police. Number 15, exhibit number
MGL3/12 was taken by Michael Long, also of West Midlands Police.

None of the above photographers are recorded on HOLMES and therefore, there is nothing to
indicate that they made statements regarding the taking of the photographs.

Finally number 11, exhibit number VST22/31, this album originally bore the number UST22 and for
some reason unknown to me the U has been overwritten with a V. The photographer of album
UST22 was PC 904 Phillip GARNER of South Yorkshire Police. In anticipation of your next request I
enclose a copy of his original and only statement.




                                                        The person dealing with this correspondence is:

                                                        Mr A M Hepworth

                                                        0114 296 3084
                                              2




I am in touch with the Photographic Department of West Midlands Police to try and identify the
photographer of WM2/39 and to ascertain if any statements were made by their photographers
named above.

Yours sincerely

                     SUBJECT:                  F#A# c u p   FINAL#




                    On Saturday 15th. April 1989 I commenced duty at 0900 to be at Hillsborough
                    Football Ground for 10.00 for briefing' re duties.


                    I was the driver of a Ford Transit for serial 61, commanded by P.S
                                                                                     . CHAPMAN
                    H.Q. Training patolling the Fir Vale area. There were no incidents
                    of any significance.


                    Aboat 15.00 whilst travelling towards the ground to take up phase 2
                    duties there was a 10/9 call for all units to attend the ground. As we
                   arrived and parked in Penistone Road OPERATION SUPPORT was called and
                    we attended the rear of the .vest stand to await deployment as directed,

                   A short time later we were instructed to form a cordon along the front
                    of the KOP on the perimeter track to prevent pitch invasion.
                   As the incident developed an increasing number of Liverpool supporters
                   came down the pitch and inflammed the situation.            Others ripped down
                   hoardings whom we assisted.
                   As the situation on the pitch deteriated we instructed by Ch. Supt. NESBITT
                    to form a cordon across the half way line. I became seperated from my unit
                   and joined P.S. HALLETT when instructed to go into Leppings Lane,


                   There was a number of dead layed on one side and injured on the other.
                   We took up positions which masked the dead from view of the crowd and
                   pedestrians.


                   I was instructed to fetch the van I had been driving to convey injured to
                   hospital, but on returning tr Lepping Lane was used by Insp. DELANEY
                    to transport his C & V to a number of 10/9 calls and reports of fighting
                    in the Wadsley Lane and Middlewood Road areas.


                    I then returned to Penistone where after a period of inactivity I returned
                    to the police room for redeployment.        Togehter with Insp. EGGELSTONE and
                    other members of the Underwater Search Unit I attended the West Stand and
                    Le-o-oinss lane terrace and took nhotosra/ohs of the scene.

                    The negatives were taken to Headquarters and at 22.00 I went off duty.

We are still working on your Schedule 2 in an attempt to identify the photographers and I will reply to
you separately about these.

I have been unable to locate any handwritten briefing notes by Mr Duckenfield. There is nothing
registered on HOLMES to suggest that such notes exist, let alone that they are in the archive, nor
have I come across them whilst working in the archive searching for other documents.

I have arranged for 6 copies to be made of VRM1 and VRM3 and am arranging for DRG9 and DRG10
to be laser copied as the dots on the originals are in colour. I have presumed that you require 6
copies of these also. These items will also be forwarded separately.

I have forwarded a copy of your letter to Assistant Chief Constable Ian Daines as I believe that he
should respond to your final paragraph.

Yours sincerely

   Dear Mr Hepworth

   Hillsborough.DQCumsntation

   I write further to our telephone conversation earlier today. In anticipation of the Defence
   raisingjeg$l argum^ts rda$i^ to the admissibility o f various documentary and visual
                                               provide me with copies of all original signed
   statements o f those persomli^ed in the attached schedule 1 Where possible, the relevant
   statement number is shown

   In the ease o f some photographicevidence, I have been unable to identify the person who
   took/produced the photograph, Therefore, I am only able to provide you with a reference.
   These references and a description o f the photograph appear on the attached schedule 2. 1
   would appreciate it if you couldassist me in identifying these people.

   Further^in a generalhousekeeping«xercise, I am reminded that you said you would try to
   locate Mr Duckenfield’s handwritten briefing notes which were referred to at the Taylor
   Inquiry. Have you been able to locate these?

   Finallyj as there is to be some argument regarding the admissibility o f the compilation video, I
   will now require 6 copies o f videotapes Ref: VRM1 and VRM3 together with c o p y plans Ref:
   DRG9 and DRG10

   In conclusion* I                                  Justice Hooper may require production to the
   Court of s ^ e or all o f t ^ o ^ fla t ^ n e s s statements which you have copied to me. Could
   you kindly provide                                          somebody from South Yorkshire Police
   will be available to deal withthisif necessary

   Dear Mr Hepworth

   Hillsborough Documentation

   I write further to our telephone conversation earlier today. In anticipation of the Defence
   raising legal arguments relating to the admissibility of various documentary and visual
   evidence, I should be grateful if you would provide me with copies of all original signed
   statements of those personR listed in the attached schedule 1 Where possible, the relevant
   statement number is shown.

   In the case of some photographic evidence, I have been unable to identify the person who
   took/produced the photograph. Therefore, I am only able to provide you with a reference
   These references and a description of the photograph appeal on the attached schedule 2. 1
   would appreciate it if you could assist me in identifying these people.

   Further, in a general housekeeping exercise, I am reminded that you said you would try to
   locate Mr Duckenfield’s handwritten briefing notes which were referred to at the Taylor
   Inquiry. Have you been able to locate these?

   Finally, as there is to be some argument regarding the admissibility o f the compilation video, 1
   will now require 6 copies of videotapes Ref: VRM1 and VRM3 together with copy plans Ref:
   DRG9 and DRG10

   In conclusion, I would remind you that Mr Justice Hooper may require production to the
   Court of some or all of the original witness statements which you have copied to me. Could
   you kindly provide me with written confirmation that somebody from South Yorkshire Police
   will be available to deal with this if necessary

   Yours sincerely

Dear Ms Adlington

PROVISION OF COPY PHOTOGRAPHS

I refer to your faxed letter of 2 2 May 2000 in which you requested that I provide you with a single copy
of a number of photographs listed on a schedule to the letter. May I firstly draw your attention to the
second photograph on the schedule, DB29. This is not a recognisable photographic reference and I
would suggest that it is actually DB16.29. Following on from this I would point out that items 1 , 2 , 12
and the final item on the schedule all have the reference D B 16.29 and would appear to be identical. I
have therefore only enclosed one copy of this print. W here you have indicated times on the schedule,
they would appear to be one minute before the actual time on the photographic print.

The copies of the photographs taken by                      preferred to in your letter under Coroner’s
reference (C 327-C 330) appear to have deteriorated with age. I can only supply you with laser copies
and therefore, the quality is still suspect.

Finally, where possible I have supplied you with a photographic print. W here this has not been
possible I am afraid a laser copy will have to suffice. Please find the said copies enclosed.

Yours sincerely

     Dear Mr Hepworth

     K v Dttcktmfield and Murray

     1 thank you for your letters of 4(h, 8th, 12* and 16thMay and various enclosures.

     Further to our telephone conversation o f 19* May I confirm my request for 6 copies of video

     Could you also provide me with a single copy of ail photographs listed in the attached

     Magistrates Court by Mr Daines last May. Given his anxiety that the Hillsborough archive be
     preserved I think it preferable that you provide me with copy photographs rather than me
     removing from the Court those deposited by Mr Daines,

     Finally^ the Coroner has provided me with copy photographs taken by
     (C327-C330), Unfortunately.they are o f very poor quality, I should be grateful if you would
     also provide me with a copy o f these.

D ear Ms Adlington

RE: ADLINGTON - V - DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

I refer to your fax messages of 31 May 2000, 1, 2 and 5 June 2000. The position regarding your
queries is as discussed in our telephone conversations of 2 and 7 June 2000, as follows.

a)    Enclosures to the South Yorkshire Police Initial Submission to Lord Justice Taylor’s Inquiry.

     I am unable to identify the documents you require from your description of them as TABS 11,
     12, 14, 15 and 24. I am sure that the TAB numbers do not coincide with the submission
     Appendices Numbers. For exam ple, Appendix 12 is the Shortt Report 1924 on Crowds at
     Sports Stadia, Appendix 14 the Moelwyn Hughes' Report 1946 into the Bolton W anderers
     Football Ground Disaster and Appendix 15 is the Police Act 1964, Chapter 48.

      Could you therefore please be more descriptive of the five documents you wish me to copy to
      you, in order that I can try to locate them.

b)    DPP Document 189 is the computer print out from the turnstiles at Sheffield W ednesday
      Football Club. The best copy we have of this document was produced to Leeds Magistrates’
      Court in M ay 1999.

c)    Tape recording of telephone conversation between Chief Inspector Edmundson and Susan
      Elizabeth Davies.

      I have checked the transcripts of the South Yorkshire Police Control Room tapes for 1513 hours
      on 15 April 1989 and cannot find any record of the above conversation. It appears to me that
      the transcript attached to the statem ent of Susan Elizabeth Davies is from the Fire Service
      m aster tape, not the police one. I also believe that the initial telephone call was originated by
      Davies to inform the police control of a fire that they were attending and that the request for
      cutting gear w as then m ade whilst Davies was on the line.

            I have located the original Fire Service master tape in the Hillsborough Archive. It is a large
            reel-to-reel type, 1
                               /4 inch wide, multi-track tape, similar to the Police RACAL tape. Once again I
            do not have any equipment on which it can be played, nor I have been unable to find any copies
            taken from this tape on standard cassettes.

d)          Copy of witness                   •natch ticket.

            To date I have not been able to locate the original of the above ticket in the archive. The only
            copy that I can find is a photocopy of the front only, which is attached to his original statement.

D ear Ms Adlington

RE: ADLINGTON - V - DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

Thank you for your faxed letter of yesterday afternoon, referring to the telephone conversation which I
had with Ms Durham yesterday morning in which she requested, on your behalf that I provide you with
the original operational order and the original video tape, TB2.

Dealing firstly with the operational order, as I have told you before there is no original copy of this in
the Hillsborough Archive and I do not know where the original is, nor if it still exists. As far as an audit
trail is concerned HO LM ES database provides the only index to documentation in the archive.
Individual documents would then need to be exam ined to try to determine how and when they came
into the possession of W est Midlands Police.

In relation to video tape reference TB 2 I would respectfully point out to you that you are wrong when
you describe the tape provided to Leeds Magistrates’ Court by AC C M r Daines on 24 May 1999 as a
copy. Schedule 4 of the witness summons, for which you w ere the informant and which was issued at
Leeds Magistrates’ Court on 26 April 1999 required M r Daines to produce the originals of video tapes
TB1, 2, 3 and 4 and he did so. I have no idea w hat happened to the original tapes once they w ere
handed over to the safe custody of the officials at Leeds Magistrates’ Court.

Finally, you refer to the statements of Brian Leonard Mole. I have no knowledge of w hat Mr Harrison
Q C produced to Mr Justice Hooper and I will respond to this part of your letter once I have carried out
further research.

Yours sincerely________________

             Dear M r Hepworth

             R v Duckenfield and M urray

             1 refer to your conversation this morning w ith Ms Durham when, on my behalf, she
             requested that you provide us w ith the original Operational Order and the original
             videotape R ef TB2.

             I understand from Ms Durham's conversation w ith you that South Yorkshire Police
             do not have the original order. Can you please confirm this in w riting, Are you able
             to say whether an audit trail exists in relation to original documents relevant to the
             Hillsborough disaster? Have you any idea where the original Operational Order
             m ight be?

             In relation to videotape R efTB 2,1 would inform you that the copy provided to Leeds
             Magistrates’ Court last year by M r Daines, contains some extracts which, when
             played, depict images at a fast-forward speed. I am informed that the reason fo r this
             is that the original footage which was recorded in tim e lapse mode has been copied
             onto a standard VHS cassette on a normal play recorder. It is this copy which we
             now have in our possession Again, would you please confirm in w riting that South
             Yorkshire Police do not have the original footage. Do you know where it could
             possibly have got to?

             Finally, last week M r Harrison QC produced to M r Justice Hooper, at least 4
             statements o f Brian Leonard M ole. 1 have only ever been provided w ith 2 statements
             - S 1134 and S1134A. Can you please provide me w ith any other statements made by
             M r M ole indicating when and to whom they were made.

Dear Ms Adlington

RE: ADLINGTON - V - DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

Thank you for your faxed letter of yesterday afternoon, referring to the telephone conversation which I
had with Ms Durham yesterday morning in which she requested, on your behalf that I provide you with
the original operational order and the original video tape, TB2.

Dealing firstly with the operational order, as I have told you before there is no original copy of this in
the Hillsborough Archive and I do not know where the original is, nor if it still exists. As far as an audit
trail is concerned HOLMES database provides the only index to documentation in the archive.
Individual documents would then need to be examined to try to determine how and when they came
into the possession of West Midlands Police.

In relation to video tape reference TB2 I would respectfully point out to you that you are wrong when
you describe the tape provided to Leeds Magistrates’ Court by ACC Mr Daines on 24 May 1999 as a
copy. Schedule 4 of the witness summons, for which you were the informant and which was issued at
Leeds Magistrates’ Court on 26 April 1999 required Mr Daines to produce the originals of video tapes
TB1, 2, 3 and 4 and he did so. I have no idea what happened to the original tapes once they were
handed over to the safe custody of the officials at Leeds Magistrates’ Court.

Finally, you refer to the statements of Brian Leonard Mole. I have no knowledge of what Mr Harrison
QC produced to Mr Justice Hooper and I will respond to this part of your letter once I have carried out
further research.

Yours sincerely




A M Hepworth
Hillsborough Archivist

                                              e for crowd control etc.



                                             itment   of a safety officer and

                                               presume that 'the safety office r i s

                                   ......    ever heard him designated as such,

and this should     he   clarified with the club.          Furthermore,    in the

discussion of a central       control       point being designated   (other than

then police    control),    one would assume that the central            control    point

designated in respect of the Sheffield Wednesday Ground would be the

video viewing    room in the south stand.



Paragraph 43 relates to records of tests kept and examination of the

ground.     I am not aware that these are kept by the club.



Paragraph 199 relates to exercises of stewards               regarding emergency

procedures and I am not aware that the club have ever carried out

exercises    in this    respect.



In conclusion,    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club have complied with

the guide to a very large extent,            more so I would suspect,       than the

majorty of clubs       in 'the country,     and   it is only on minor     points as

Dear Ms Adlington

RE: STATEMENTS OF BRIAN LEONARD MOLE

I refer to your letter of 20 June 2000 in which you mention in your final paragraph the statements of
Brian Leonard Mole, produced to Mr Justice Hooper by Mr Harrison QC. I reiterate what I said in my
response to you dated 21 June 2000, that I have no knowledge of what Mr Harrison QC produced.

I have carried out a check of the HOLMES databases and in the Hillsborough Archive. The originals
of S1134 and S1134a, of which you have copies are in the archive as is an exact duplicate of S1134,
indexed as R308. In addition to R308 there are two HOLMES generated statements, indexed as
R308A and R308B. I am unable to locate the originals of these, but I enclose copies of the HOLMES
print in order to comply with your request to provide you with any further statements made by
Mr Mole. As I do not have originals I am unable to say who the statements were made to, or when
they were made.

Yours sincerely




Hillsborough Archivist

Dear Ms Adlington

RE: BRIEFING NOTES

I refer to my telephone conversations of 21 and 23 June 2000 with your assistant, Ms Kathy Durham
regarding the briefing notes issued by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield, on 14 April 1989 and
15 April 1989 and those used by Superintendent Murray and her request, on your behalf that I supply
you with a copies of them.

I write to confirm that the only copies of Chief Superintendent Duckenfield’s briefing notes, under the
reference D246 for 14 April 1989 and D247 for 15 April 1989, were handed over to Leeds Magistrates’
Court by ACC Mr Daines on 24 May 1999, in response to a witness summons dated 26 April 1999, for
which you were the informant. Likewise, the briefing notes of Superintendent Murray under the
reference D231 were also handed to the Magistrates’ Court that same day. Unfortunately a copy of
these notes was not taken and kept in the archive.

A further set of briefing notes, under the reference D243 and attributed to Superintendent Murray
were disclosed and copied to you on 5 October 1999.

I am sorry I am unable to assist you further.

Yours sincerely




Hillsborough Archivist

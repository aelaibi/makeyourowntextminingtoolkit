,     Dear Sir/Madam,


                          Re: Hillsborough Assistance Unit

           The Leader of the Council has asked me to pass his thanks to your Members for
      their attendance at the meeting in Liverpool on 6th Septemberi

           The meeting considered a progress report prepared by officers and various options
      for the future funding of the Hillsborough Assistance Unit.   There was unanimous,
      agreement that the work of the Unit should be continued and the finance-.underwritten
      by the participating authorities until 31st March, 1991..

           The provisional costings have been reduced from the original proposal considered
      on 29th April and were set at around £125,000 for 1989/91 and £233,000 for 1990/91.
      Alternative sources of funding were discussed and the underwriting, reduced by any
      grants obtained, would be divided between the participating authorities.   I can
      confirm that the Hillsborough Trust Fund Manager has confirmed to the Director of Social
      Services (Liverpool) that the Trustees would make up to £100,000 available for the period
    I t0 31st March* 1991 to assist in the provision of the Helpline.   This offer is being
      progressed.                          '

           Officers were instructed to produce a further report setting out the financial
      requirement and the grants available to be presented to a further meeting. When the
      report is to hand a further meeting will be convened when, hopefully, the Hillsborough
      Assistance Unit can be formally agreed and the finance committed by participating
      local authorities.

                                        Yours faithfully,




                                        City Solicitor, Secretary to the Council.

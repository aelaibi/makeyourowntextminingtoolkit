                                  TUESDAY,     30th HAY,      1989

                                      (HORNING      SESSION)

                 ASS*T.   CHIEF .CONSTABLE WALTER            3ACK50N,   re-called

                            Exami ned    by HR.     COLLINS,      (Cont.)

    Q.   Hr. Jackson, we were about to turn to the events of 15th
         April when we a d jou rned last Friday.   Before I come on to
         that, may I just ask you about one other matter.            Were
         you aware of an Inquiry held by the Footb a l l A s s o c i a t i o n
         into an incident which occurred at York City 1s ground in
         Harch, 1988?    A.    Can you tell me what that was about,
         please?

    Q.   Yes, it was an incident where there had been some problems
         at a gate and the need to open a gate because of crushing
         of crowds arriving at the ground-   A.   I don't recollect,
         it, sir.

    Q.   The only reason I ask you whether you knew about it is
         this, that it so h a p pened that the decis i o n of the F.A.
         D i sc i p l i n a r y Com m i t t e e was given at H i l l s b o r o u g h Ground
         and I wonde r e d whether that had come to the a t tention
         of the Police at all, the reason being that it was an
         incident of crowd b u i ld-up at a gate which had led to the
         need to open a gate.                   A.   No, I didn't realise that,
         sir .

    Q.   You had heard nothing          of that at all?            A.     No,   sir.

                LORD JUSTICE       TAYLOR:      The date      of that?

              HR. COLLINS:            The date of the incident            was said     to be
         26th Harch, 1988.

                LORD JUSTICE       TAYLOR:         And   it was   York City's     ground.

              HR. COLLINS:   I tell you the source of the in f o r m a t i o n
         was, in fact, last week's "Private Eye" which on this
         occasion appears to have been relat i v e l y accurate.

                LORD JUSTICE       TAYLOR:         Against    Sunderland?

    Q.         HR. COLLINS:    It was a match - York -v- Sunderland.
         As I u n derstand it, the hearing into what had h a p p e n e d took
         place at York but the decision was given at Hillsborough,
         no doubt for practical reasons, but you say that it did
         not come to the Police a t tention and there is no parti c u l a r
         reason why it should have.     I just wonde r e d whether it
         h appened to have been something which the Club perhaps had
         fed in to the Police?     A.   It certainly was s o mething I
         didn't know about, sir.

                                                           W. J A C K S O N


              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   There was, I remember, amongst
         hundreds of letters, a letter fromsomeone r e ferring to
         having been there.

                HR.     COLLINS:    Yes,   I recollect     that,     too,     sir.

    Q.   Let us come to 15th April.   Hr. Jackson you were on
         that day, I gather, not in uniform when you were at the
         ground.   A.   That is correct.

    Q    Does that mean that you were off duty or on duty?
         A.    I was on what is called Force Call-Out, or     Force
         Cover, so if anyth i n g occurred in the Force I was readily
         available to attend it.

    Q.   I see.      But so far as dealing with the routine of the
         policing at the ground, that was a matter, was it, for
         Hr. D uc ki nf ie ld ? A.  Yes.

    Q.   And he would not expect to come   to you except                in an
         e m ergency? A.   That is correct.

    Q.    I think you came in to work as normal at Police H e a d q u a r t e r s
         on that Saturday morning, being on week e n d cover as you
         have indicated.    A.   Yes, I did.

    Q.   I think      it was at about 1 o'clock, was it,           that you were
         picked       up in order to go to the ground?             A.   About
         1 .30.

    Q.   Did you have words with Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Nesbit . who
         was in charge, I think, of the traffic o p e r a t i o n ?
         A.   Yes, sir.            I had spoken to Hr. Nesbit           earlier on
         and I had also spoken to the Extended Incident Team at
         Force H ea dq u a r t e r s earlier on and e v e r y t h i n g seemed to
         be going to plan.           Traffic was busy, as expected on a
         big occasion like the Semi-Final.

    Q.   I think you in fact went with Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Nesbit^
         is that correct, to the ground, setting off at about half
         past one?    A.   I did.

    Q.   Did he drop you off at the Directors'            Car Park       e n t rance   on
         Penistone Road?   A.  He did.

    Q.   When   you got into the ground, where did you go                 first?
         A.      I went to the Police Control Room.

         And who was there?     A.   In the Control Room at that
         time were Hr. HacRobbie, the Chief Inspector, the Sergeant
         C o ntroller and the Video Recorder.

         So   Hr. D uc ki n f i e l d was not there at that time?             A.    No,
         hearrived almost i m m e d iately coming up from the                 terraces
         having been to see the Referee.

                                                                     W. J A C K S O N


             Q.   Was that with Mr.      Hurray?          A.   With Mr.        Hurray.

             Q ' By now we have reached what sort of time?                         A.     I think
                  it was   just shortly    after        2 o'clock.

             Q.   Did you have any discu s s i o n with Hr. D u c k e n f i e l d about
                  how things were going?           A.   I had a general d i s c u s s i o n
                  with Mr. D u c k e n fi el d and he was happy with the way things
                  were going.

             Q    Did you discuss anyth i n g that you can now recall in
                  particular?    A.   No, I did make a comment at that
                  p articular time that most of the N o t t i n g h a m Forest fans
                  were in but there were still a number of Liverpool fans
                  to come as yet.

             Q    This was at 2 o'clock?            A.     This was       just shortly          after
                  2 o'clock.

             Q    Virtually   an hour    before     kick-off?         A       Yes.

             Q    So the Kop end was virtually             full by then,        was      it?
                  A.   Fairly full, yes.

             Q.   Can you recall now what the state of the West Terraces was
                  in p a r t i c u l a r ? A. It is d i fficult to recall but I think
                  the Stand was fairly full and the Terraces were filling
                  up .

             Q.   Can you recall at this stage whether there a p p e a r e d to be
                  any sort of i m b alance in the filling of the Terraces?
                  A.   I think gen e r a l l y people were gathered round the middle
                  in the Terraces.

             Q.   But that,   I suppose,    is not unexp e c t e d            A.        No,    it isn't.

             Q.   At that stage.   Anyway, that, you would                  say, was shortly
                  after 2.  Did you then leave the Control                  Room?   A.  I
                  did.

             Q.   And where did you go?            A.      I went    down the back way             to
                  the Directors' Lobby.

             Q.   That is under n e a t h the South       Stand?       A.     About       half way
                  u nderneath the South Stand.

             Q.   And how long did you stay there?   A.  Probably about --
                  I browsed around in the Directors' Lobby, p r o b a b l y about
                  five minutes or so, five, six, seven minutes.

             Q.   Did you event u a l l y go to your place on the South Stand?
                  A.   Yes.   I then went to the Directors' Box and sat in
                  there.

             Q.   Which is roughly in the middle, as I recall,                     of the South
                  Stand, is it not?   A.   Yes, it is.

                                                           W. J A C K S O N


Q.   Sort of roughly    above the players'        tunnel?          A.     Yes.

Q    And when you got to your seat, can you help us as to what
     time we have reached, roughly?    A.   I would think about
     that time it would probably be about twenty-five to or
     twenty to t h ree-ish time. I am not quite sure.

Q.   Were you on your own? By that I mean did you have    any
     other Police Officers with you or were you the only Police
     O fficer there?  A.   No, there was nobody in the Directors'
     Box at all when I sat there.

Q.   So you vere li t e r a l l y on your own. A. I was on my own,
     yes.   There was nobody in the Directors' Box at all .

Q.    Did you keep a general eye on      the ground and how things
     were p r o gr es si ng ?  A.   Yes.   I think I was mainly interested
     in the North Stand because the West seemed to be filling up
     and that gra d u a l l y filled up.

Q.    The North Stand being the one d i r ectly         o p posite?
     A.    The one directly opposite.

Q.    Why were you p ar t i c u l a r l y inte r e s t e d in that one?
     A.    I think beca u s e initially when I went into the
     Control Box there weren't a lot of people in the North
     Stand.

Q.   Did you look at the West         Terracing   at any stage p a r t i c u l a r l y ?
     A.   Not in particular.

Q.   Did you notice a n y thing about it before we started having
     mo vement out of it?     A.   No, I didn't notice anything
     untoward.

Q.    Did it occur to you at any stage, again before people started
     cl imbing out when the game was about  to start or when it had
     started, did you notice anything untoward about the filling
     up, about the number of people in it?     A.    No, I didn't.

                                       W. JACKSON


Q. Now what was it that first made you aware that something was
   wrong? - A. I think after the game started I was watching
   the flow of the game and then when the ball went up towards
   the west side I noticed people coming out of one of the
   gates and then shortly after that a lot of people started
   climbing over the fence. More and more people came over
   the fence right up to the goal line.

Q. What was your immediate reaction as to the cause of it?
   - A. I think generally, probably like everybody in the
   ground, I thought there had been some sort of crowd problem,
   pitch invasion.

Q. The two are not necessarily the same thing. I want to see
   exactly what you mean. Do you mean a pitch invasion caused
   by crowd trouble, i.e. people getting out of the way of some
   difficulty in the stands or do you mean a pitch invasion
   in the sense of people coming over in order to invade the
   pitch? - A. Well I was not really quite sure. I could see
   all of these people up to the goal line. I could not fathom
   out what had happened other than perhaps there had been some
   problem or perhaps some form of hooliganism which resulted
   in people coming over the top of the fences.

Q. So you were thinking in terms of hooliganism, were you, your
   immediate reaction? - A. Yes, it was.

Q. Incidentally I should have asked you this: had you been
   aware of any messages over the Tannoy at any stage while
   you were sitting waiting? - A. No, I wasn't.

Q. Do you mean that you cannot recall the Tannoy being used
   for any message or there might have been a message and you
   did not take it in or what? - A. I don't recall anything
   coming over the Tannoy at that particular time.

Q. This would be between about 25-to or so and the time when
   you noticed people coming over shortly after kick-off?
   - A. Yes.

Q. Seeing what was happening what did you deeide to do?
   - A. I decided then to go to the Control Room and see
   Mr. Duckenfield.

Q. And did you go there? - A. I did.

Q. Can you recall whether the game had stopped by the time you
   went to the Control Room? - A. I have tried to think back
   and I can't remember whether in fact the game had stopped
   before I went but certainly when I got there I recollected
   it had been stopped.

Q. When you get to the Control Room how did you go? - A. I
   went out through the main entrance.

Q. Would that be at the back? - A. To the back; went up towards
   the Kop end and through the main gates.

                                                   W. JACKSON


         Q. And then you come in along the front, do you? - A. No, I
            came in at the back of the Control Room.

         Q. I am sorry, you said the Kop end. Did you mean that? - A.
            I went out of the Directors' Box into the Directors' car
            park, turned right and went up towards the Control Room
            and there are big blue gates there. The Police Officer
            I think was going through the gates and I followed him
            through and up to the Control Room.

         Q. So in fact not the Kop end but the other end? - A. Sorry,
            the other end.

         Q-/I   And when you arrived up in the Control Room can you recall
                who was there? - A. Yes, I remember Mr. Duckenfield was
                there. The Sergeant Controller and the Video Operator
                and Mr. McGrobbie was not there and neither was Mr. Murray.

         Q. Incidentally Mr. McGrobbie we have heard was in plain
            clothes? - A. Yes.

         Q. What were his duties? - A. Well I understood afterwards,
            speaking to Mr. Duckenfield, that he was only on a watching
            brief on that particular day.

         Q. I see, he had no operational part to play? - A. No.

         Q. When you arrived there did you ask for information? - A.
            Yes, I asked Mr. Duckenfield what the problem was.

         Q. What was his answer? - A. He was at that time very pre-
          coccupied by what was going on on the pitch and said he
            was unsure of what had Actually transpired.

         Q. Was anything said to you by Mr. Duckenfield about a gate
            opening whether by the fans or by him? - A. No.

         Q. When was the first that you learnt, can you help us, that
            Mr. Duckenfield had agreed that the gates should be opened?
            - A. I think basically, and you will probably remember from
            seeing the video, that everything happened very quickly from
            that moment on.

         Q. Certainly. - A. In fact I think roughly about 3.34 we had
            the casualties clear. We had gone to see the Directors;
            we had come back.  I had a call to speak to the Chief
            Constable, so I asked for the Ground Commander Mr. Marshall
            to attend the Control Room so that I could speak to all
            the Officers concerned and I think it was at that time was
            the first time that I realised fully what had transpired.

         Q. This would be what sort of time? - A. I think we would be
            talking about 4.15 ish.

         Q. So effectively after everyone had been told that the game
            was cancelled and people had begun to leave the Stadium?

                                             W. JACKSON


        - A. That is right, but I have a vague recollection that it
        is sometime during all the melUe and I think you will
        appreciate there was a lot of stress in dealing with the
        problem.  I have a feeling that somebody mentioned something
        about storming the gates.

Q.       It may be that we can help you about that. We have heard
        some evidence, or rather it has been put, that you were
        present when Mr. Duckenfield spoke to Mr. Kelly and I think
        a Mr. Kirton from the F.A. and Mr. Mackrell, the Secretary
        of the Club. Do you recall a meeting at which those three
        were present, together with you and Mr. Duckenfield? - A.
        Is that the one in the boardroom?

Q.      Well I am not sure whether it was in the Boardroom or the
        Control Room.   I think it was in the Control Room? - A. Yes,
        there were a lot of people came to the Control Room that
        day and I remember Mr. Mackrell being in there, so probably
        Mr. Kelly was in there as well.

Q. Because it has been suggested, and I think Mr. Duckenfield
   has actually accepted this, that he certainly conveyed the
   impression, whatever precise words he may have used, that
   fans had broken a gate down and that that had led to the
   trouble? - A. I don't remember what the actual conversation
   was.  I remember Mr. Mackrell saying something about "What
   was the plan?" Certainly I briefly said we were trying to
   get the people out who had been injured.

Q. But you said that you had some vague recollection that at
   some stage someone said something about "storming the
   gates"? - A. Yes, I do.
Q. Could that in fact be the occasion which has been spoken to
   by Mr. Duckenfield? - A. It could have been.

q   .   js your recollection that whoever said something about
        storming the gates was someone who was official, if I may
        put it that way? - A. Oh yes, yes.

Q. So it was not a sort of mere rumour? - A. No, No, I have
   got a feeling it was somebody in the Box that said that.
   In fact I think it may have been Mr. Duckenfield.

              MR. COLLINS:   I am obliged.

Q.            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: But when you said it was only
        about 4.15 that you heard what had actually happened, do
        I understand that is when you had called Mr. Marshall?
        - A. Yes.
Q. Was it from him that you heard that the gate had been
   opened? - A. Yes, my Lord, during that period, as every­
   body appreciates, we were extremely busy and trying to
   make sure that the areas were sterile, that doctors had
   been called and all the necessary things were being done

                                                   W. JACKSON


                that should have been done. That was what I was concentrating
                on. I received a call to speak to the Chief Constable. By
                that time we had all the injured away.  I asked for Mr. Marshall
                to come to the Control Box because he was a Ground Commander
                at Leppings Lane and we had a discussion at that time and it
                was then I learnt what actually had taken place.

        q   .         mr. COLLINS: You say he was the Ground Commander.   In
                fact I think Mr. Marshall was the Commander outside? - A. When
                I say Ground Commander I mean all of the Officers engaged
                were Ground Commanders in certain respects. He was Ground
                Compander in respect of Leppings Lane.

        q   .   xt depends how one uses the word "ground".  I have been thinking
                in terms of the stadium.  It simply means Commander on the
                ground of some specified area? - A. Yes, in a certain specified
                area.
        Q. And it was your understanding that Superintendent Marshall's
           remit included effectively everything outside the turnstiles.
           Is that right? - A. That is right.

        Q.       in fact he was not, as we know, responsible for the Serials
                on duty at the turnstiles, that is to say both outside and
                inside. Were you aware of that? - A. Yes, I think this was
                an overlap but one which he accepted responsibility for.

        Q.       Your understanding was that he did it, notwithstanding that
                they were nominally under Mr. Greenwood's control as being
                the Commander inside.   In fact Mr. Marshall would accept
                responsibility for dealing with them? ~ A. Yes.

        Q. That is not what the order says, of course, is it? - A. I
           appreciate that.
        Q. How did you think that this understanding existed? - A. Well
           I have spoken to Mr. Marshall and Mr. Duckenfield and they
           have both told me that that is what the understanding was.

        Q. You are sure about that are you, Mr. Jackson? - A. Yes.

        Q. The only reason that I ....   A. Yes, I know it does not
           say in the Operational Order.

            Q. Well it not only does not say in the Operational Order but
               I think it is right that I should put this to you, that in
               his statement, and we have not of course heard from him
               yet, Mr. Marshall does not appear to believe that he was
               directly responsible for the Serials employed on turnstile
               duties.  In fact he says in terms, it is at the bottom
               of page 3 of his statement if anyone wants to look it up:

                       "I was not actually in charge of the Serials
                       of Police Officers employed on turnstile
                       duties at Leppings Lane. These were part of
                       the Ground Commanders, Superintendent Greenwood s
                       responsibilities but it was always my intention
                       to be in the area of the Leppings Lane turnstiles

             as the crowds built up."

       Obviously I cannot forecast what he is going to say, but I
       think it is right in the light of those answers you have
       just given I should put that to you, because it does not
       appear from that that he believed he was responsible for
       this? - A. I think what he is saying there is he would
       keep an eye on those turnstiles because I think there is
       an overlap here between the Ground Commander inside and the
       Ground Commander outside, so in fact they would both bave
       some sort of responsibility but I understood, and no doubt
       Mr. Marshall will tell us, that in discussions he normally
       accepted responsibility certainly for the turnstiles outside.

     Q. Do you think this overlap of responsibility at the turnstiles
        may have given rise to some confusion? - A. No, I don't,
        because both are very experienced men and have worked at
        the ground on many occasions.

     Q. Indeed as I think has already been in evidence, the year
        before Superintendent Greenwood and Superintendent Marshall
        had reverse roles? - A. That is correct.




                                        /Q. Anyway, let me
                                10                                      W. JACKSON




Anyway, let me com e back to the cont r o l box.                       Yo u a s k e d
Hr. D u c k e n f i e l d what had h a p p e n e d a n d he was not able, he
said, to give you an y ans w e r at that stage, so what did
yo u d e c i d e to do? - A. I w ent down to the p itch a n d I
spoke to Hr. G r e e n w o o d there a n d it was o b v i o u s then that
we ha d a problem.             Hr. G r e e n w o o d s a i d that we had got, I
think it was ei t h e r injuries or casualties.                      I looked
about me.          I c o u l d see a lot of pe o p l e on the pitch at
that time, a numbe r of p e o p l e lying down.                   I looked
to wards the fence.             I c o u l d see that people were o b v i o u s l y
in a d i s t r e s s e d condition.          I c o u l d see a n u m b e r of P olice
Of f i c e r s r o u n d the gate, w h i c h were open.           I c o u l d see
Police O f f i c e r s c o m i n g from the back of L e p p i n g s Lane
terrace, o b v i o u s l y in a r e s c u e attempt, and at that stage
I jient bac k up to the cont r o l r o o m to gain ac c e s s to
commun icat ions.

To do w h a t ? - A. The first t h i n g in my m ind was to ensure
that s u f f i c i e n t a m b u l a n c e s had been c a l l e d an d also it was
c l e a r l y a n e c e s s i t y to i m p lement the major incident
procedure.

Mho was now in ch a r g e at the g r o u n d ? - A. I di d not at any
time s a y to Hr. Duckenfield, "You are not in c h a r g e , " but
ce rtainly, as se n i o r O f f i c e r there, o s t e n s i b l y I w o u l d be
there at his side, a s s i s t i n g an d m a k i n g sure that
e v e r y t h i n g was done that p o s s i b l y c o u l d have been done.

Now, we have h e a r d some e v i d e n c e about the t imes at which
r e q u e s t s were made for the v a r i o u s services.      I th in k the
fleet of a m b u l a n c e s were s u m m o n e d ? - A. 3.07.

At 3.07, yes.        If we look at - I t hink we have all got
these, have we not - the e x t r a c t s from the logs?     If one
follows the times - I am a f r a i d I c a n n o t give you a page,
sir, b e c a u s e mine is not paginated.

       LORD JUSTICE        TAYLOR:        Give me a time.

     HR. COLLINS:  At the to p it has got                   15 04 89, 1758,

       LORD JUSTICE        TAYLOR:        It starts at 3.07.

t h r o u g h the Force C o m m a n d e r Co ntrol S y s t e m - is that right
- or an e x t r a c t from it? - A. Yes, sir.

And, looking at the page that I ha d it open at, page 10,
1507 there is a r e c o r d "From g r o u n d control, O p e r a t i o n

been h i g h l i g h t e d so it is almost....

        LOR D J U S T I C E TAYLOR:         Is it     "please"?

        HR.   COLLINS:          "Please",      yes,    I am obliged:

"Operation S u p p o r t to Hills b o r o u g h , please.                    Repeat

Yes, it is.

Setting       in train the major          i n c i d e n t ? - A.   Yes.

As we can see, t i m e d at 3.07, and then we have, at 3.10,
"Author i s a t i o n for OP S u p p o r t from A C C . " That is y o u ? -
A.  That is me, yes.

And what is O P S u p p o r t ? - A. That is O p e r a t i o n Support.
It is a s y s t e m we have for t u r n i n g out a nu m b e r of
Of f i c e r s w h e r e we have a major incident.

That, of course, w o u l d be O f f i c e r s who were not at the

And did that give rise to the mess a g e w hich a nu m b e r of

H a m m e r t o n R o a d Po l i c e S t a t i o n ? - A. Yes, it was.

I think S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Hole t o l d us that he h e a r d that
when he was - I forget where, but anyway, he h e a r d a call
to attend.            Then, at 3.10, A m b u l a n c e S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Clark

A m b u l a n c e s a y i n g t h e y are responding.      Is that r i g h t ? - A.
That is correct.

Then we have CY01, w h a t e v e r that maybe, t r a v e l l i n g to

A. I am sorry, I am not sure what that is.

         HR. COLLINS:            I think the o ther r e l e v a n t mess a g e
that we might look at is over the page, on pag e 12.                         At
3. 19 t here is a r e f e r e n c e to c u t t i n g equipment.       "GC21

Po l i c e r e f e r e n c e ? - A. Can y o u just tell me w h e r e that one
is?

I am sorry, it is on page 12.          It is the next page from
one we were just looking at a bout RHH.             Have you got it?
It is 3.19, a bout four lines down.         "GC21 with c u t t i n g
e q u i p m e n t to scene?" - A. Yes, that w o u l d be a Police
vehicle.

B e c a u s e I t hink we h e a r d from Hr. D u c k e n f i e l d that the

Yes, I h e a r d hi m sa y i n g that.

And is GC21 a Po l i c e g a r a g e or s o m e o n e from a Police
ga r a g e or is it just a P o l i c e c ar? - A. I think that w o u l d
be a Po l i c e car - the P o l i c e car with this equipment.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Was any cutting equipment brought
     to bear upon these fences that afternoon? - A. No, I think
     what happened, my Lord, was that when we implemented the Major
     Incident Plant the Force Operations room have certain
     responsibilities.   In those responsibilities they turn out the
     essential services, the ambulances and the Fire Brigade.   I
     think on this occasion, having reviewed the situation, the
     Force Control room did not immediately ask for the Fire
     Brigade.  I think we had another call for the Fire Brigade and
     we asked again.   That was how the calls went out.

Q.         MR. COLLINS:   I think the Fire Brigade was not in fact
     summoned until... - A. 15.13.

Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I am sorry, that did not quite
     answer my question, which was, and I put it more specifically,
     didany cutting equipmentever get to bear on these fences?    -
     A. Other than the Fire Brigade, no, my Lord.

Q.           MR. COLLINS: I don't think the Fire Brigade did,       in
     fact?

Q.           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Did any?

Q.         MR. COLLINS:   It had already been kicked in bythen as
     far as it could be. Were you were - you could see, no doubt;
     you were up in the control room - Police Officers and others,
     and fans, trying to kick the wire in? - A. Yes, I could.   I
     was not quite sure when the Fire Brigade had arrived because
     of the crowd whether they had still used some of their
     equipment.

Q. Yes, I follow.  Effectively, whatever could have been achieved
   by getting the fencing out of the way had been achieved before
   the Fire Brigade came, as I understand? - A. Yes, that is
   correct.

             LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     They were sent for at 3.13?

          MR. COLLINS:   3.13 or 3.14, and they arrived at 3.17, I
     think, the first fire tender.

             MR. MULLER:    3.22.

             MR. COLLINS:     3.22.   I am obliged:

Q. Mr. Jackson, did you remain in the control room during this
   stage when we have been looking through these various
   messages? Were you in the control room all this time? - A.
   Y es, I d i d . I went down to the pitch a little later on to
   speak to Mr. Nesbit.

Q. That was when you saw him arriving on the pitch, was it, and
   obviously taking charge on the pitch? -A. It was a little
   bit after that.

Q. Were you aware of him taking charge? -A. Yes, sir.

          Q. That was quite clearly seen on the video we saw on Friday? -A.
             Yes, that is correct.

          Q. My recollection is, and I am speaking entirely from memory,
             that that was some time about 3.18, 3.19, 3.20, that sort of
             time? -A. Yes.  I thought Mr. Nesbit, my recollection is he
             was on the seen a bit sooner than that.  I thought it was
             about 15.12, 15.13, roughly.

          Q. You may be right.   I am speaking entirely from memory.   But
             until he came on the scene would it be fair to say there was
             a degree of chaos, people getting in each other’s way,
             obviously desperately trying to effect a rescue, but not
             achieving a great deal? - A. Well, I did not think so.    I
             thought Roger Marshall, the Superintendent, had that in hand.
             He had in fact tried to get people to move back. He had in
             fact organised Officers to get in at the gates to get people
             out, and bear in mind, there is a small entrance there, I
             think Police Officers were doing everything they could, and I
             think Police Officers were coming down from the back in the
             terraces to do as much as they could.   But I think quite
             clearly in the initial stages obviously there was confusion,
             as I said yesterday, between the fans, the press, the Police
             and everybody else in terms of what actually was going on.

          Q. I suppose the scale of it was much, much greater than really
             had been anticipated as a possibility? - A. Yes, it was.

          Q. Mr. Jackson, you have obviously thought about this enormously
             since it occurred? - A. Yes, I have.

          Q. Insofar as the organisation after it had blown up was
             concerned - that is what I want you to concentrate on, and you
             will tell me if you think this is an unfair question for you
             to have to answer - is there anything you can think of that
             springs to your mind that ought perhaps to have been done
             differently or would in the future be done differently? - A. I
             think looking back in hindsight there are several things I
             would like to see. One, I would like to see a combined
             control room, and this is in retrospect, which would house
             Ambulance, Fire Service and the club all being together,
             because I think that type of co-ordination would make for a
             better rescue.  So that is one thing I would like to see.

          Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Can I just follow through what you
               have in mind.  In the club room you would have a
               representative of the Ambulance Service, a representative of
               the Fire Service, as well as the club’s officials? - A. Yes,
               sir.  I would like to see a combined control room, my Lord.

          Q. That is where you would have it, in the club room or where? -
             A. No, probably where the Police control room is, only an
             extended one.

          Q. Because that is very small, is not it? - A. It is too small
             for that particular purpose, but it has a good view of the
                             15

                                                   W. JACKSON


     ground.  I would like to see that extended so people were
     working hand in hand.  The club have a control room
     downstairs, but it is in a way separate.

Q.        MR. COLLINS:   I suppose one thing that is perhaps
     fairly clear is if you are going to have perimeter fences
     there must be some means of very quickly removing them if at
     all possible in order to get people out of the terraces? -
     A.That is right, and that is a difficult one inasmuch as if
     you have perimeter fences to keep people in, if they come up
     against them then if you have ones that are easily
     displaceable they would fall over, but I think quite clearly
     in my view the gates are too small and we need much larger
     gates to get people out if there is a need for perimeter
     fences.

          There are other ways of looking at fences in the Green
     Guide, and that is the stone wall and then a walkway, and then
     a sort of passageway for Police Officers.  Having seen what
     had happened I would have preferred if people behaved
     themselves, not to have those type of perimeter fences.

Q. When you say "those type", you mean the type we have got here?
   - The type we have got here.

Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     I am sorry, I had not quite
     followed what your other suggestion was. You are suggesting
     instead of having the type of fencing that was here you would
     prefer to see what? - A. I would prefer to see a perimeter
     wall as outlined in the Green Guide.    I think it is probably
     about one-and-a-third metres high, and then behind that space
     at the back before the terraces begin, and probably some small
     fence dividing that so if there was a problem people could
     jump over.   That space you could have for stewards and Police
     Officers to walk round to make sure       that people were behaving
     themselves.   It still   runs the risk    if you havea serious
     crowd problem and hooliganism of people still getting over the
     t op, though.

Q. I follow you say a wall. What would the object of the wall
   one-and-a-third metres high? It would just make it more
   difficult for people to get over, but not impossible? -A. Not
   impossible but just a bit more difficult.

Q. And behind that you suggest a walkway for supervising stewards
   and Police? - A. Yes.

Q. And then some sort of      fence? - Some sort of barrier probably
   all the way round.

Q. A crush barrier, that sort of thing? - A. A crush barrier all
   the way round.  I think in those circumstances where there is
   overcrowding then there is more likelihood of people getting
   out safely.

Q.        MR. COLLINS:   Can I ask you this, and again I want you
     to concentrate on the arrangements that were made and what
                          16

                                               W. JACKSON


   happened once the incident had blown up. Have you been able
   to identify any deficiencies as far as you can see it in the
   arrangements that were made either by the Police or by anyone
   else for that matter, for coping with the problem when it
   arose? -A. I think one of the big problems is in relation to
   an incident like this is the human element, and certainly the
   people that I saw on that day were extremely stressed, were
   extremely concerned.  When I went on to the pitch we talked
   about fans being on the pitch and the possibility of the
   Police taking them off. That really was not an option,
   because the people I saw there were extremely concerned and
   did not know what they were doing.  So really, the human
   element is the thing that causes most concerned in a rescue
   attempt like that.

       In terms of deficiencies I would say in hindsight we
  should look at the improvements you can make such as I have
  suggested, the combined control room, different types of
  fences, perhaps in the control room we could have some sort
  of system where you press the button and it goes straight
  through to the Ambulance Service, straight through to the
  Fire Brigade.  So those are issues I feel we could
  consider, but in terms of on the day my view is that
  everybody was doing what they possibly could under
  tremendous stress, under tremendous strain, under a great
  deal of confusion.

Q. Can I ask you this.  It has been suggested that the Tannoy
   ought to have been used in a more positive fashion than it
   was? - A. Yes.

Q. What do you say about that? - A. I listened to Mr. Duckenfield
   regarding that, and I do agree with him it is a very, very
   difficult one, because if you start announcing over the Tannoy
   you have injuries or fatalities, etc., then you could very
   likely cause a problem and people may panic, and therefore
   it is a case of trying to do it as calmly and as
   professionally as possible, and I agree with that
   decision.

Q. In fact, nothing was said, was it, at least nothing to explain
   what was happening or why it was happening? - A. No.

Q. The result is that certainly the Nottingham Forest fans at the
   other end, some of them anyway, were getting rather impatient
   with the Liverpool fans, because caused its own problems? - A.
   Yes, but I think that probably would be nothing like the
   problems that may have been caused if he did go over the air
   and he did say, "We have fatalities, injuries", we may have
   caused panic.   So I think that option was probably the most
   preferable one.

Q. Did you think of it yourself as to whether or not you should
   use the Tannoy more, or was that something that was just left
   to Mr. Duckenfield? - A. The Tannoy was being used ;asking
   people to keep calm.

          Q. Yes, but that was at a   rather later stage, was not it, when
             Mr. Dalglish was asked   or did send out a message, and that was
             about 3.56, I think? -   A. I had a feeling the Tannoy was being
             used at some stage to    tell people to keep calm.

          Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:Mr. Jackson, I am not doubting
               what you say aboutthat, but I just don't quite   follow why
               there would be panic. Obviously if you said there was a bomb
               scare or something of that sort I can see that people might
               panic, but to tell the people at the other end of the ground
               or other parts of the ground that there had been some injuries
               at the terracing at the west end, some quite serious injuries,
               why would that cause people to panic do you think at the other
               end? - A. I think basically at the time, my Lord, we did what
               we thought was appropriate, and certainly in relation to that
               that was not thought about.

          Q. You did just say you thought it might cause people to panic.
             I am wondering whether an announcement to that effect would
             for any reason make people panic? -A. I don't know.  In
             hindsight it may not have done.

          Q.        MR. COLLINS:    Surely it is more likely to cause trouble
               if you say nothing, and as indeed happened let the Nottingham
               Forest fans continue in the belief that the Liverpool fans
               were misbehaving themselves? - A. I think a bit later on when
               I went down to the pitch and spoke to Mr. Nesbit we then
               decided to make an announcement, but certainly during the
               rescue attempt we certainly did not think in doing that, and
               perhaps in hindsight in a wash up situation, it may have been
               advisable to do it.




                                                                                r

          Q.   In fact, when you did make the anno u n c e m e n t the N o t t i n g h a m
               Forest fans behaved as one would have hoped they would have
               behaved initially, namely very well, did they not?
               A.   Yes, they did.

          Q.   Do you think perhaps there may have been an attitude that
               football fans will not act r easonably ih the decision
               that was made?      A.      I think if we look back at the
               history of football, you know, there are t r e m e n d o u s problems
               with it and som e t i m e s these react on the indi v i d u a l in
               terms of what they should and should not say, and all I can
               say is that d e cisions were made in the best in t e r e s t s of
               everybody concerned.

          Q.   I am sure but do you think there is, perhaps, in the Police
               a s ub -c on s c i o u s even thought that football fans cannot be
               trusted to behave r e asonably and the r e f o r e one a p proaches
               it on that basis?            A.   Well, I think I make it quite
               clear in my s t a nding order that we are talking about a
               minority;        we are not talking about the total football
               fa n s .

          Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   But in r e l ation                   to that
               minority, do you accept what counsel says?                        A.   Yes.

          Q.        MR. COLLINS:   Now, we have really brought you up
               to about quarter past four.    You were then talking or
               about then talked to the C hief Constable.   A.  Yes,
               sir, I did.

          Q.   How much longer did you stay at the ground?             A.   Chief
               S u p e r i n te nd en t Mole arrived, I think it would be round
               about quarter to five time, and I then briefed him, told
               him to take control of the ground and to c o - o r d i n a t e
               matters.            I briefed him as to what had hapened and
               told him that I was going to Police Headquarters.

          Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    So you really had taken over
               control then, had you?    I mean, if you were putt i n g Mr.
               Mole in charge, that was really acting over and above
               Mr. Duckenfield.  A.   Yes, sir, I would say oste n s i b l y
               I was in control then.

          Q.            MR. COLLINS:         And you ;were re s p o n s i b l e for the
               a rr a n g e m e n t s about the t e m porary mortuary in the gymnasium,
               is that right?             A.    Yes.      What I did - I asked the
               Chief S u pe ri nt en de nt ^ D e t e c t i v e C hief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t - to
               contact me and he c on t a c t e d me about 3.35 p.m. on that day.
               I briefed him and asked him to come to the ground.                                I
               saw him there about 4 o'clock.                  I told him to take charge
               of the t e mporary mortuary, to set that up.                       I also told
               him to link up with Casualty Bureau and I told him to set
               up what we call our Home system for major i n v e s t i g a t i o n s
               so that all the s ta t e m e n t s could be c o l lated reg a r d i n g the
               incident because quite clearly there would be need to
               collect the e v i dence for the Coroner's Inquiry;
                                                  W. J A C K S O N


 And you then left, as you told                 us,   Mr.   Mole in charge   when
 you left.     A. Yes, sir.

 With I think   is it Mr. Addiss, who was in charge of the
 m o r tuary?    A.Yes, Det e c t i v e Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Addis*.

 And I think you in fact e v entually went off duty at about
 2.45 in the early hours of the following morning.
 A.   That is correct.

                  Cr o s s - e x a m i n e d   by MR.   HYTNER:

 Mr. Jackson, if you feel that you are the wrong person to
 answer some of my q u e stions would you say so, beca u s e the
 last thing I want to be doing is chasing the wrong hare.
 A.   Yes.

 But you are, I think, the Senior Officer who is going to
 give e v i dence and there are certain matters that ought
 to be put to somebody.      Can I go back to the very beginning
 and just look at what the Police ope r a t i o n was dealing
 with.    When the Police are asked to mount an o p e r a t i o n of
 this sort, of course, they are dealing with facts on the
 ground that cannot be altered, like the nature of a stadium,
 where it is sited and so forth.      A.  Yes.

 The first thing is that just looking at L e p pings Lane and
 the entrance to the ground from Leppings Lane, it does
 not take very much i n t e l l i g e n c e or experience, or even a
 Police Officer, to see that if there is a crowd coming down
 Leppings Lane and a nother crowd over the bridge, there is
 a danger of a b o t t le -n ec k causing a mass of people within
 the t u rnstile area.       A.    The only tning I can say about that,
 sir, is that we have policed H i l l s b o r o u g h for years, we
 have policed two S em i - F i n a l s there and not had a problem.

  What I suggest is this, Mr. Jackson, that you have not had
  a problem because of a c o m b i n a t i o n of very fine policing
  and very good luck.           Looking at it on the ground, there
M is a p o tential for danger in the very lay-out of the
  turnstile area in Leppings Lane, is there not?
  A.   All I can say in relation to that is that the Working
  Group, who are r e s p o n s i b l e for the safety of the ground,
  have not i de n t i f i e d that as to be a problem.

 Well, that is what I am going to put to you.           Whether
 s omebody else has iden t i f i e d it or not, I am asking you
 to look at that p ar t i c u l a r area and I am asking you whether
 there is not an obvious pot e n t i a l for danger if crowds
 coming down Leppings Lane and over the bridge are not
 properly c o n t r ol le d and filtered before they enter the
 t urnstile area?         A.    I can only say in relat i o n to all
 of our Police o pe r a t i o n s there, that it has worked in
 the past and the r e f o r e I have not looked at that as a
 problem.

Q.   I am asking you now to look at it as a problem.         Since
     you have not seen it before, can I take you through it
     in a little more detail.         Clearly if the area between
     the turn s t i l e s and the gates - the blue railing gates -
     which I call the t u rnstile area is filled to capacity,
     there is an obvious problem, is there not?         A.   In
     those circums t a n c e s , yes.

Q.   The obvious prob l e m is that, first of all because of the
     jostling and the crush, entry through the turns t i l e s will
     be slower than it should be.      A.   If you have c i r c u m ­
     stances like that, yes.

Q.   The second     prob l e m    is ---

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR;    I am sorry, just before you
     go on, I would like to under s t a n d the mec h a n i c s of that.

Q.    What creates the problem, that people get s q u e e z e d - squashed                  -
     in the e n t rance to the turnstile, or what?         A.   If we
     have c i r c u ms ta nc es like we had, my Lord, where there are
     lots of people in at the turnstiles, then p r o blems will be
     caused in trying to get through the turnstiles.

Q.   People will be jammed up against -----                    A. People will       be
     jammed ip against the wall a n d ---

Q.    And the gates will         not turn as they should or what?
     A. And the gates            will not turn as they should.

            LORD JUSTICE         TAYLOR:      I am sorry.

            MR.   HYTNER:        No,   sir,   I am   grateful.

Q.    The second prob l e m is this, that once the t u r nstile area
     is full there is no question of any queues being capable
     of being formed.        A.   In those c i r c u m s t a n c e s ?

Q.   In those     circums t a n c e s . A. I think            in those        exceptional
     c i r cumstances, this is what happened.

Q.   And, third, once that area becomes full it is i m p o s s i b l e
     for Police O f f icers within the area to control the crowd.
     A.      I think we are talking about e x c e p t i o n a l c i r c u m s t a n c e s
     h e r e ---

Q.   I ara only talking about the po s t u l a t e that that area becomes
     full;   whether it is e x c e p t i o n a l or not is another matter.
     If that area is full, Police O f f icers would find it impos s i b l e
     to control that area from within.              A.   I think in these
     circumstances, that is exactly what happened.              Now, if
     people come to the ground in plenty of time, if they are
     prepared to form queues, but as I u n d e r s t a n d it on this
     occasion the mounted Police O f f icers were put under c o n s i d e r a b l e
     pressure which resu lted in the c o n g e s t i o n at the turnstiles.
     Now, that could happen anywhere.

Q.   Mr. Jackson,    for the moment I am not doing any criticising;
     I am looking    at the problems that faced the Police.   Do
     you follow?      A.   Yes.

Q.   If you look at that turnstile area, you will see i mmediately
     that you cannot p o s s i b l y form queues at the turnstile, other
     than very short queues indeed, can you?          Would you just
     look where the Usher is pointing.          In both areas, in fact,
     both the Terrace area and the Stand area.          A.    Well, I
     have    not looked at it in those -- you know, in such close
     s crutiny before and I am quite sure that Mr. Mole would
     tell you that queues could be formed.

Q.   Can we  just look at it logi c a l l y ?    If   you are forming more
     than one queue, then in order for           the queue to be a long
     queue,   the two queues or three or         four or five queues have
     got to   be p a r allel to each other,      have they not?   A.  Yes,
     I would think so.

Q.    If you have a straight wall and 20 t u r n s t i l e s in the straight
     wall, then 20 queues can go back as far as there is space.
     If the t ur n s t i l e s are in an arc or semi-circle, the queues
     e vent u a l l y merge with each other and that is the p o s i t i o n in
     both those areas at Leppings Lane;             is that c o r rect?
     A.        Well, as I under s t a n d it, people can form queues there.
     Now,      I don't go to the matches r e g ularly but I u n d e r s t a n d that
     they can form queues.

Q.    Well, of course they can, but there is a limit to the length
     of the queues that can be formed.    A.   I would say probably
     there is a limit, yes.

Q.   And you have    talked   of Maine     Road being    within      your     patch
     at one time.      A.     Yes.

Q.   And you know that there, p a r t i c u l a r l y on the Maine Road side
     of the ground, there is one vast s t r aight c o n c o u r s e with
     t u rnstiles all along and you can simply have p a r allel queues
     at each turnstile.    A.   What I can say is that if you look
     at the design there, it probably could be better designed.
     Is that h e l pful?

Q.   I am coming to that, yes, but the design at the moment
     prevents m ea ni n g f u l queues forming if there is a big crowd.
     A.   I can only say in terms of getting people in through
     the turns t i l e s the Police have been polic i n g it for years
     and have not had a problem.

Q.   That is what you say and that is what I keep on putting
     to you may be the result of very fine p o l icing and very
     good luck but I am trying to see the p r o blems as they can
     be seen in advance by looking at the area on the ground.
     Is it t h e refore essential, now that you can see that area,
     that control of the crowd should be such from outside the
     turnstile area that that area should never become full.
     A.   That is what the Police tried to do on the day.

Q.   Well,   that is what     ought    to be done.      A.      What       I am
                                               W. J A C K S O N


saying is, that is what the Police tried to do on the day.
As I under s t a n d it, the mounted Police O f f icers took a
p osition outside the gates to prevent people going in there.

At one stage we know the mounted Police were inside the
gates which, of course, when the crowd became c o n g e s t e d was
useless, was it not?   A.   Well, I d o n ’t know.

Well, you must know.         If you have got a throng - a crushing
throng - within the t u r nstile area Police horses within that
area are not going to do much good, are they?          A.   Well,
I am not sure how the Police horses o p e r a t e d on the day in
question.   I know that they were outside the gates at
one stage and as a result of pressure the fans came through
the gates, as I u nd e r s t a n d it.

Let us, first of all, see how the area could be improved,
b ecause you have su g g e s t e d there might be an improved lay-out
The whole of the area within the blue r a i lings is Sheffield
W e d nesday property.      That is right, is it not?      A.   As
far as I am aware, yes.

They can put their gates and their walls w h e r e v e r they want.
Now, if they removed those two s e m i - c i r c u l a r groups of
t urn s t i l e s and if they put a new wall further back,
parallel to the W e s t      Stand, there would then be a very
long line, s t r aight line of turnstiles, would there not?
A.      Do you mean the wall coming from there down to that ----?

That is where.      The Usher has got it a b s o l u t e l y spot on.
A.   Yes.  Pro v i d i n g you had plenty of room at the back to
extend your queues.

There are o b viously going to be p r o blems and s o m ebody may
say that you are going to reduce the area wi t h i n the walls,
which may not be very satisfactory, but the main prob l e m
with the Leppings Lane end is not lack of room within the
walls, it is lack of room outside the tur n s t i l e area, is
it not?   A.     In that area?   All I can say in relation
to that is we have a Working Group whose r e s p o n s i b i l i t y is
looking at the safety of the ground and that is what they
give us to work in.

         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        Tell me about the Working
Group.         That consists of Police, Club, is it?
A.       Yes, the Working Group, my Lord, c o n s i s t s of the
r e p r es en ta ti ve s from the Local Authority, the Police,
Fire, Amb u l a n c e Service and they examine the ---

And the Club?   A.   And the Clubs t h e m s e l v e s and they
examine the ground to decide on all the safety aspects,
the exits, entrances, turnstiles, etc., and to make
decisions upon which is the best way forward.


                                   /MR.   HYTNER:     Mr.    Jackson,   I
                                    W. JACKSON


      MR. HYTNER: Mr. Jackson, I have to put this to you
you see because this is one of the great problems when
disasters occur.  If everybody sitting down in a Working
Group says*  "Well we have never had problems in the past,
therefore we will not have problems in the future" it really,
that sort of approach is a hindrance to improving what you
have got because you have failed then to look at potential
dangers.  Isn't that right? - A. Well I can only say that
I am quite sure that every effort would be made by that
group to ensure the safety of everybody concerned.

Well there are two possibilities which may hinder that
optimistic approach. The first is the complacency of an
attitude that says:  "We have never had problems in the past
so there isn't a problem to be considered" and the second
obstacle of course is cost because it may cost money to
alter the layout of the ground and that expenditure does
not necessarily improve the performance of the football
team.
       Can I put it to you in a friendlier fashion. If the
 Leppings Lane end were altered in a fashion similar to
 that which I put to you, wouldn't it make policing of that
 end a very great deal easier? - A. I think that is a
 difficult decision to make in isolation and I think the
 only way that you can make such decisions is with the
 Working Group themselves to look at it, to examine it.
 I am not really an expert on that sort of safety aspect.

 No, you are not an expert on that and it may be that there
 are all sorts of objections to the plan that I have just
 put forward to you.
       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: You are still not going to
 be able to get your parallel queues, are you? You are
 stuck with a wedge shape.
       MR. HYTNER: You would have parallel queues up to
 a much greater distance.
       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: You would get them a bit longer
 but you have still got a wedge?
       MR. HYTNER:   Yes, you have still got the wedge.

. What you can say as a Police Officer is what circumstances
  make for easier policing and if you had a long straight
  line which included more turnstiles obviously than you have
  got at present and a greater area outside the turnstiles
 Ibefore you reach Leppings Lane, that would make policing
 [of the crowd, controlling the crowd a great deal easier?
  _ ^ Yes, I agree. You know a better designed stadium
  always makes it easier for policing.

. And there is another suggestion.  If you actually own the
  property outside the turnstiles you can then put in a
                                  w. JACKSON


rail, a single guide rail or two twin guide rails taking
perhaps two abreast up to each turnstile and you therefore
qet a controlled queue up to each turnstile. That is right,
isn't it? - A. Can I say that you know I am not an expert
on safety and I would take the advice of the people who are
concerned with that issue.
Well again if there are safety experts who say that that is
unsafe that is another consideration.  I am just looking
at it for the moment with you because you are a Police
Officer of great experience as to what would actually
enable better crowd control? - A. Well I would like to
see greenfield sites.  I would like to see an oval stad*™J
and I would like to see queues extending as far as practicable
so there is no possibility, as we have been discussing earlier
my Lord, in a wedge shape or anything else, so there is a
deflection away from the ground all the time, but I know
that commercially that would probably not be on because you
would have to improve all the stadiums in the country.

It may or may not be. I think most people would agree with
you anyway.  I am more modestly trying to deal with the
Sheffield Wednesday ground as it is, and again what I am
putting to you is no great innovation, I think you see
such guide rails at most Totalisator windows at racecourses?

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I must say, perhaps you would
like to deal with this, I am puzzled that you have never
had trouble before because what we have got is this, isn t
it, some 58 turnstiles for 29,000 people at the Nottingham
Forest end which is roughly, what is it, a couple of
thousand to a turnstile, and here we have got about half
the accommodation, 23 turnstiles for 24,000 people. My
arithmetic is wrong but the principle is right, I thinK.
You have got half the capacity to cope at the Leppings Lane
end that you have got for the other end of the ground, quite
apart from the inconvenience of the layout, just on the
sheer numbers. You have got to get twice as many people
through the turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end as you are
trying to get at the other and it seems just on numbers
that that might cause trouble? - A. I think in the number
of turnstiles, my Lord, that is right.    I think there
 23 turnstiles here on the day and perhaps there should have
 been more turnstiles available to get people in.

 But it was the same the year before? - A. Yes sir, as far
 as I am aware it was exactly the same the year before
 but the problem with this particular year I think they
 all came in the last 15/20 minutes or so.
       MR. HYTNER: You see the difficulty with saying that,
 Mr. Jackson, is that we know that at 2.30 there were^
 crowds within that turnstile area. Now that is not late­
 comers, is it, half-an-hour before the game? - A. No,
 half-an-hour before the game would not be classed as
 "latecomers", but can I say what we actually did to
                          25

                                     W. JACKSON


  encourage people to come early? We actually wrote to the
  people who have the match programmes; we wrote to Chief
  Officers of Police; we went on the media; we asked people
  to come early so that they could get into the ground in
  plenty of time.
Q. Now, Mr. Jackson, a Police operation has got to deal with
   things as they develop. We have heard much of this from
   Mr. Duckenfield about assessing the developing situation.
   By 2.30 it looks from the videos as though there were
   pretty crushed crowds within the turnstile area and
   arriving at the perimeter outside the railings.

         Can I now deal with how that perhaps should have been
   controlled. You agree that the first essential is not
   to allow the turnstile area to be full? - A. Yes.

Q. You therefore need a cordon of some sort or a filtering
   system outside the turnstile area and at Leppings Lane
   the one advantage is that you have got the railings to
   enable you to filter.  Is that right? - A. Yes.

Q. But in addition you need control of the crowd down Leppings
   Lane. That is right, isn't it? - A. Well we had sufficient
   Police Officers on duty to take account of matters like
   that.
Q. Well that may be. What I want to deal with is what can
   be done. Whether it was done on this occasion is another
   matter, but let's see what can be done.

         Both from the point of view of traffic control,
   that is enabling traffic to pass and repass along Leppings
   Lane and over the bridge, and from the point of view of
   controlling the crowd arriving at the railings, all you
   need do is what is done on match days in stadium after
   stadium up and down the country, that is a controlled
   crocodile may be six, may be seven, may be four or five
   deep, but a controlled crocodile walking on the pavement
   down Leppings Lane controlled by mounted     Police?   - A.Well
   I think that is what the mounted Police Officers were
   trying to do.
Q. Well whether they did or did not is again another matter,
   Mr. Jackson. All I am asking from you is an acknowledgement
   that there are means of controlling a crowd arriving at
   a stadium whether late or early? - A. Yes, I accept that.

Q. So if the control of the crowd, whether they had arrived
   at 2.15 or 2.30 or 2.45, whenever the bulk of them had
   arrived, if they had been escorted down Leppings Lane
   — as we can see very clearly in photographs which I think
   were taken last year - escorted down in a crocodile and
   then only allowed into the turnstile area through the
   gates when there was room within the area, there would have
   been no crushing? ~ A. I think that is what the Police
   Officers were trying to do.
^                               26

                                            W. JACKSON


    Q.   Well no doubt they did, but that is what should have been
         done? - A. That is what they tried to do as I understand it.

    Q.   Well whether they tried or not, whether they succeeded if
         they tried, that at any rate can be done and should be done?
         - A. Yes, that can be done.

    Q. Now I want to come to the pens. There may be an argument,
       which I am certainly not going to ask you to take part in
       because you are a Police Officer not a lawyer, as to what
       is the meaning in the Green Guide of a "section", but
       dealing with Leppings Lane this is plain, isn't it, that
       once you have pens, separate pens divided by lateral
       fencing or radial fencing as it is called and each of those
       pens has a designated capacity, the possibility of monitoring
       those pens by computer is absolutely destroyed if you have
       the same turnstiles for all five pens? - A. Yes sir, I should
       imagine that is right.

    Q. If separate turnstiles had been used for Pen 3, Pen 4, Pen 1,
       Pen 2 and Pen 5, then you could monitor, as the Green Guide
       anticipates, the crowd in each pen or section by means of
       the turnstile and the computer? - A. Yes.

    Q. On this occasion, well not on this occasion but on all
       occasions at Sheffield Wednesday, neither the Police nor
       the Club were able to take advantage of the computer
       to assess the capacity of each pen? - A. No, that could
       only be done visually.

    Q. Once visually a pen was seen to be overcrowded or crowding
       near capacity, you have to have an operation which enables
       that pen to be closed off, or entry to the pen to be closed
       off.  Is that right? - A. Yes, I am not familiar with the
       procedure but I would accept that.

    Q. Well you may not be familiar with the procedure,Mr. Jackson,
       because one wonders in fact what the procedure was in the
       combined Police/Sheffield Wednesday operation. Do you know
       of anything in the plan, the Operational Plan either for
       1989 or 1988 which dealt with the problem of closing off
       entry to any of the pens if they were seen to be filling
       to capacity? - A. Well I should imagine that is a matter
       for the Stewards.




                                     /Q. You as a Police Officer

You, as a P o l i c e Officer, w o u l d e x p e c t the c l u b to deal
with that p r o b l e m ? - A. Yes.

But it is a p r o b l e m that has to be d ea lt with a n d in
r e s p e c t of w h ic h t her e have to be c l e ar i n s t r u c t i o n s to
s o m e b o d y b e f o r e the game b e g i n s ? - A. Well, I w o u l d
imagine that that is done in the b r i e f i n g of the
stewards.

If the s y s t e m or the plan is that the p e r i m e t e r f ence is
to be g u a r d e d by P ol ic e O f f i c e r s r a t h e r t ha n stewards,
o ught the P o l i c e at least to p l a y a part in that
o p e r a t i o n ? - A.     Well, c e r t a i n l y in the g u i d e l i n e s of my
S t a n d i n g O rder I m ake it q u i te c le ar that, y ou know, that
is a r e s p o n s i b i l i t y for the s tewards, but can I s ay that,
if a P ol ic e O f f i c e r i d e nt if i es a problem, he s h o u l d deal
with it.

Y ou see, visually, it can be done by the P o l i c e O f f i c e r s
on the ground, on the p e r i m e t e r fence;            by the s t e w a r d s up
in the West S t a n d a n d the P o l i c e O f f i c e r s in the West
Stand;   but, most of all, it can be done on the monitors.
Is that r i g h t ? - A. Yes, I s h o u l d imagine it could.

Y ou w o u l d expect, w o u l d y ou not, e x p e r i e n c e d c on tr o ll e rs ,
w he t h e r t h e y be s t e w a r d s or P o l i c e O fficers, to be able to

if that is, in fact, the o n l y w ay of t e s t i n g w h e t h e r it is
o v e r - c r o w d e d ? - A. Well, I am t o l d t ha t t h e y f in d t he ir
own level in the               terraces, the fans.

Y ou see, what we              have been t o l d over a nd over a g ai n is
that, t a k i n g A n f i e l d as an example, the K op at A n f i e l d
and, indeed, I t hink the K o p at S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y finds
its own level g r a d u a l l y and, of course, w h e t h e r the e nt ir e
t er r a c e is o v e r - c r o w d e d is c o n t r o l l e d by c omputer. Do y ou
f ol l o w ? - A.     Yes.

So if a p a r t i c u l a r terrace, w h e t h e r at A n f i e l d or
S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y or e l se wh er e, has a c a p a c i t y of

but the c o m p u t e r            w a rn s the c l u b w he n 15,000 are in the

       t r o u b l e w i t h i n the crowd, but t h o u g h t t h e re was a p it ch

Q.     The o p e r a t i o n a l o rd e r s were t ha t the g at es in the fence
       were not to be opened, save as a r e su l t of the o r d er of a

   s o m e t h i n g ? - A. I t hink it says he can open t h e m of his
   own a c c o r d if t here is a injury.

Q.    If t here is an injury, yes.                       W it h the b e n e f i t of
      hindsight, it is f airly clear, is not it, that the whole
      t enor of the i ns t r u c t i o n s g i ve n to the s e r i a l s - that is,
      o r d i n a r y P o l i c e C o n s t a b l e s a nd w om en P o li c e C o n s t a b l e s -
      the t enor of the i ns t r u c t i o n s was a n y b o d y c o m i n g over the
      fence, it will be a c r o w d i nva si on and a p i t ch inva si on
      a nd the g a te s are not to be o p e n e d ? - A. I am t o l d that
      when Hr, D u c k e n f ield did his briefing, he ensured that
      the s a f e t y a sp ec t was included.

Q, Safety in the sense thai, if ihere was a koib scare or a
      fire or s o m e t h i n g of that sort, the g at es were to be
      opened?     - A. Well, he c o u l d b es t a n s w e r that.           I took it
      to be s a f e t y to include an a l l - e n c o m p a s s i n g e x pl a na t io n .

Q.     You see, one of the c o m p l a i n t s b e i n g m ad e by the f am i li e s
       of the b e r e a v e d and also by t h o se who are, m er ci f ul l y,

       that one m a jo r factor in that was, not t ha t t h e y are

Q.    If it is not that, it looks as t h o u g h t h e y were r a t h e r too

t ho se Officers.

       MR.   HYTNER:        Yes:

The next t h i n g is this:              that, a g ai n g o i n g from the
e v i d e n c e so far g iven by fans who got on to the p i t ch and
the e v i d e n c e of our own eyes on the video, it w o u l d a p pe a r
that some P ol ic e Officers, when fans were a l r e a d y pullirfg
i nj ured p e o p l e o ver the f ences and, indeed, when P o li c e
O f f i c e r s were p u l l i n g p eo p le over the fences and when
i njured men and women were l ying a r o u n d the pitch, that a
n umber of P ol ic e O f f i c e r s d id not r e s p o n d a nd were
s t a n d i n g a r o u n d d o i n g nothing.   H av e you seen that on the

                                             /Q.   Now,   in fairness.

                                               W. JACKSON


Q. Now, in fairness I should say this. Many of my clients
   initially have put that down to indifference on the part of
   the Police, but it now seems that two causes operated, and I
   put this in the form of a question to you.   Firstly, was there
   not some inactivity by Police Officers due to lack of
   leadership until Mr. Nesbit came on the scene, and secondly,
   was not some of it due to younger Police Officers freezing
   from shock? - A. All of our Police Officers are trained to act
   either individually or collectively in terms of saving life.
   In terms of the efforts going round the gates, the gates are
   narrow.   I have said already Police Officers were coming down
   the back in Leppings Lane. Police Officers were round the
   gate.   There were Police Officers hanging about in the
   background, as it were, who couldn't get themselves involved.

Q. Do you accept the evidence given by a number of people that a
   lot of Police Officers suffered from shock? -A. Yes, I would
   accept that.

Q. And froze.  In other words, their inactivity was simply due to
   being frozen with shock? - A. I think if I could make a
   broader statement in relation to that, I think probably most
   people in the stadium were shocked at some stage.

Q. The only reason I am putting this to you is that a large
   number of my clients, now that they appreciate rather more
   clearly what did happen, have expressed surprise, and I have
   to say a little anger, that Police Officers were frozen when
   fans were taking initiatives.  In other words, when fans were
   a little more active, and they have asked and I ask as a
   result whether Police Officers are given any or if so adequate
   training to enable them to overcome the horrors that occurred
   on this occasion? - A. I think as much training as is
   practicable is given to Police Officers.

Q. I don't think I can take that further.  The other thing
   obviously which I am instructed to ask you, which I do, is why
   Police Officers, and I am not now dealing with the situation
   that arose after some Liverpool fans very foolishly advanced
   on the Nottingham Forest end, when we know a cordon was put
   across the pitch, but why, before that, a cordon of Police was
   drawn up parallel to the terraces instead of those Police
   Officers being utilised in rescue? -A. I think as I have
   already mentioned to you only a certain number of Police
   Officers could be used in the rescue situation.  You could not
   use all of the Police Officers.

Q. That is a fair answer.  I have asked you and that is your
   answer. Coming to the Tannoy, nobody so far as I know has
   suggested that the Tannoy could have been used or should
   have been used to announce that there had been a disaster,
   but I want to take the questions of Lord Justice Taylor a
   little further.  The Tannoy could have been used not only
   to pacify the Nottingham Forest fans by explaining there
   had been overcrowding and some injuries, and would they
   please be patient, but also to give the vital message to
   the Liverpool fans at the back of pens 3 and 4 to move

             back, to go back through the tunnel, because that Is what
             a number of Police Officers in the second stage as it were
             of the emergency were attempting to do from the front of
             the perimeter fence? - A. Well, certainly Mr. Greenwood
             who was down there was trying to achieve that at close
             level.

        Q. That is the problem, because he was doing it from the pitch? -
           A. He was.

        Q. And he was trying to get people to push back, but of course
           people at the front were not the people to be talking to
           because they could not push back because of the pressure at
           the back.  The Tannoy could have been used effectively to get
           the people at the back of the pens to move out of the tunnel
           and thus relieve the pressure on those at the front who were
           probably not only being crushed but were also probably
           panicking? - A. I think at that stage there was a lot of
           people on the ground and the pressure certainly in that
           respect had been released.

        Q. I am also asked to make some enquiries into the alleged
           confusion, because my clients allege a great deal of
           confusion, in the situation after the bodies had been taken to
           the gymnasium, but do I take it you are not really the person
           to ask about that? - A. No, that would be Detective Chief
           Superintendent Addis.

                          Cross-Examined bv MR. JACKSON:

        Q. Mr. Jackson, may I adopt most of the matters put by my learned
           friend, Mr. Hytner, to you about the events of the day. May I
           go back, and I hope not to be personal, to this ridiculous
           suggestion that fans should be expected to level themselves
           out. May I say that is against the spirit....

                  LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    You are not making a speech, Mr.
             Jackson.  Would you ask questions, please.

        Q.        MR. JACKSON:   Is that not against the spirit of
             everything you thought when you planned your operation for the
             day? - A. I said it twofold.  I said, (1) you would expect the
             fans, or hopefully the fans would find their own level, and
             secondly, the stewards have the responsibility in that
             respect.

        Q. May I take the second part first.  May I suggest that rightly
           or wrongly the Police have in this case given the stewards of
           Sheffield Wednesday the task of planning the packing of the
           ground? - A. I am not quite sure what you mean there.

        Q. May I suggest it is quite clear that everyone knew and has
           known for years that it is proper that someone should oversee
           the packing and loading of the ground? May I suggest in this
           case that rightly or wrongly the Police gave that task to the
           Sheffield Wednesday stewards? - A. Yes, I would accept that.

     Q. May I go back and look at the duties that you would perforin,
        not necessarily as a football expert or as a safety expert,
        but as the Assistant Chief Constable who had to give the plan
        the go-ahead.  First of all, you were aware, were you not,
        that the Police had always been aware of the crushing problems
        at Leppings Lane? - A. i was not aware.

     Q. Were you not aware that your predecessor, Mr. Gosden, had in
        fact.... - A. I am sorry, you mean the 1981 incident?

     Q. Yes. - A. I am thinking of the turnstiles outside.

     Q. I am going back to the plan, because it would be my suggestion
        to you that you well knew and had recorded and minuted all the
        problems that in fact did show themselves on this day. You
        see, it has been suggested you had never had trouble before,
        you didn't foresee it, a phrase used by Chief Superintendent
        Duckenfield, "If it had not hit me in the face I had not
        recognised it".   In 1981 there was a problem at Leppings
        Lane? -A. Yes.

     Q. That was a crushing problem? - A. Yes.

     Q. And indeed, the Police as we have seen and I will draw your
        attention to it if necessary, had made it quite clear that
        they thought the stewards ought to ensure the proper
        dispersal of the crowd on Leppings Lane in the different pens?
        - A. The 1981 problem was addressed in 1981, and I think
        resulted in the alteration of Leppings Lane. So that problem
        had been addressed.

     Q. Mr. Jackson, that exactly the point I am making.  You were
        aware of the problem and had taken steps you thought were
        adequate? - A. I think the club are responsible for taking
        adequate steps.

     Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   That is what led to the pens? - A.
          That is what led to the pens being altered.  So that problem
          was addressed.

     Q.        MR. JACKSON:   And would you look, please, at your
          Standing Instructions at Tab 11 page 42. Tab 11 is Standing
          Instructions to Policing Football Matches, South Yorkshire
          Police:

               "Specific duties of stewards:   Specific duties to be
               undertaken by stewards include preventing overcrowding,
               ensuring that crowd limits in various parts of the ground
               are complied with and that gangways and exits are kept
               clear"?

          - A. Yes.

     Q. Was there any discussion as far as you knew as to how that was
        to be carried out? - A . Not as far as I knew.

     Q. Unless we use the word "crushing" in the word "safety", there

            is, is there not, not a single observation in any of the
            Standing Orders or the daily briefings about crushing? - A.
            Not to my knowledge.

       Q. May we on the same matter turn now to Tab 12. This is "The
          Guide to Policing Football", ACPO, and look at 1.44:

                 "All ticket matches also need turnstile control as
                 supporters in possession of tickets for a particular
                 section of the ground may seek to gain entry to another
                 section of the ground which could result in some sections
                 of the ground exceeding the limit specified in the Safety
                 Certificate"?

            - A. Yes.

       Q.        "Where limits are critical Police should make
                 arrangements to monitor turnstile counts".

            - A. Yes.

f


                                         36


                                                            W.   JACKSON


    Q.   Are you aware of any such a r r a n g e m e n t having been made?
         A.   The only a rr an g e m e n t I know that would be made at
         Sheffield Wed n e s d a y would be through their o p eration -
         their tur n s t i l e operation.

    Q.   No, Mr. Jackson, in fairness to you we may hear, we may
         not hear - one of the d i f f i c u l t i e s in this Inquiry is that
         we are not sure what evidence is going to be given by
         anyone days in advance.       I merely ask you, did you know
         of any?   If the answer is, "No", I will pursue it.
         A.   I think that would be a matter made locally and I
         would be unaware of that.

    Q.   Can we turn to 1.49, over the page.                Here a g a i n , *•11. i s
         emphasised that stewards should ensure that all sections
         of Terraces and Stands are filled to c a p acity before
         allowing access to further sections where possible.
         This will require m on i t o r i n g turnstile total i s e r s and
         the use of public address systems in some instances.
         This o pe ra t i o n is g reatly assisted by the c o m p a r t m e n t a l i s a t i o n
         of grounds, each co m p a r t m e n t being filled in s e quence."
         In fact, we do not use the seque n c e in She f f i e l d but the
         idea is quite clearly there, is it not* with turnstiles,
         with m o n i t o r i ng and with stewards?         They do not level
         themselves.           The ope r a t i o n by Police and by steward ensures
         proper packing.           Is that not the case, sir?             A.     What
         I said earlier on, it would be a combi n e d thing, that is
         the stewards o pe ra t i n g and the fans finding their own level.

    Q.   I now turn to the overall p o s ition of loading and unloading
         a ground.    You have already had your att e n t i o n drawn
         to the rather u n f or tu na t e effect of s e g r e g a t i o n and the l a y ­
         out of this ground, but the loading was going to be quite
         different for the Notts Forest and Liv e r p o o l fans.               Indeed,
         if we use just the Spion Kop and Leppings Lane, we find
         that the figures are something like 1,443 per t u rnstile
         on Leppings Lane, 522 on the Spion Kop.               Had you realised
         that before the day?         A.   No, I didn't know what the
         figures were.

    Q.   No, Mr. Jackson, I am not        exp e c t i n g you to remember the
         figures but I am a little        sur p r i s e d to find you had not
         realised that 1,443 people were due to use each of the
         L eppings Lane turns t i l e s for the terraces and this is why
         I asked you.    If you allow loading way in excess of the
         Green Guide, it is a matter for careful assessment, is it
         not?    A.   I can only say I would have assumed that the
         Club would have made the a p p r o p r i a t e arrangements.

    Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    I think what counsel is asking
         you is, never mind the precise figures but did you a p p r e c i a t e
         that the ingress at the Leppings Lane end involved twice as
         many people, roughly, going through each t u rnstile as at
         the other end?    A.   No, I didn't, my Lord.

    Q.        MR. JACKSON:          Mr. Jackson, I am not here as it were
         to cri t i c i s e an ind iv i d u a l but surely that is a very
                                         37


                                                                 W. J A C K S O N


     i m portant matter for this reason:        if it be that the
     Green Guide says that the maximum notional entry is about
     750 per hour, it would mean on these figures that unless
     the turns t i l e s were starting c l i cking at 1 o'clock and
     never stopping, they would never have filled the Leppings
     Lane end, people would not have got in.           A.   Yes.  I
     can only say that that would be a matter that would be
     dealt with locally and by the Club.

Q.   I then move forward to this position, that at quarter past
     two, when we know the entry to the turns t i l e s was full,
     anyone in the She f f i e l d W e d nesday control or the Police
     m oni t o r i n g it would have known the crowd could not have
     got in on time.         A.   Well, I think you would have to ask
     the person in charge that question.

Q. May I turn to the very last matter arising out of the
   same point as to whether it should have been seen.
   Would you look, please, at Tab 14, Serials 16, 17, 18
   and 19.   Mr. Jackson, Mr. Hytner, with q u e s t i o n s also
   from my Lord, has e st ab l i s h e d that if you do not have
   orderly queues your flow thorugh the t u r n s t i l e s will be
   reduced.   That is an accepted matter.           A.    Yes.

Q.   Therefore it would be quite clear, would it not,                               that   by
     twenty past, tw e n t y - f i v e past two, the flow into                      the
     ground would be being reduced.            A.   Yes.

Q.   If we look at S e rials 16, 17, 18, we see that each of
     them has as one of its tasks, "Maintain order and ensure
     orderly queues are formed," for 16, 17, 18 and 19.                  It
     is a very large number of Police Officers.              Would you
     look, please, at Com p o s i t e Album No. 1, P h o t o g r a p h No.
     MWL  f0/247\’
                 .   A.    What number is that?

Q.   C om p o s i t e Album    No.   1, Phot o g r a p h   MWL    20/24A.

             LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:          It is one of the ones with a
     blank    front.   Co m p o s i t e Album No. 1

Q.           MR. JACKSON:   MWL 10.   The two p h o t o g r a p h s I want
     you to look at are 20A and 24A.      If we look at those two
     p hotographs, it will be quite clear, will it not, that
     a l t hough there is a crush by this time at the t u r n s t i l e s ---
     A.      I am sorry, which number are we looking at?

Q. MWL 10/24A and 20A.           If you would just glance at the two
   of them.    Taken at - the first in time is 20A at 14.25.
   That is a p ho t o g r a p h of the Leppings Lane area, just
   o utside the turn s t i l e s and we see two moun t e d Officers,
   11 Police Offic e r s on the first.        A.  That is at 20^.

Q.   At 2 0 A .     A.        Yes.

Q.   Apparently, a l t hough there is o v e r - c r o w d i n g in the turnstile
     area and thereby reduced flow at this stage, beca u s e we have
     heard witness after witness, a p p a r e n t l y none of the Officers
                                                             W. J A C K S O N


there seem to feel the need to take any p o s itive action.
A happy crowd, c o nt en te d crowd, walking towards the ground.
A.   Yes.

14.27, three of them chatting together.                 The same crowd.
Mr. Jackson, I am co n c e r n e d at the s u g g e s t i o n that in any
way the crowd at the turnstiles, the crush at the turnstiles,
was caused by late-comers.           It appar e n t l y was not.
A ppa r e n t l y it was p eople arriv i n g at quarter past two,
nothing to do with arriving at quarter to three.                   A.   I
think we will hear from the mounted Police O f f icers that ---

Would    you look then ---

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:           Well, to be fair, if you look
at the one i mm ed i a t e l y before at 19A, which is - what is
that - 2.18, 2.17, 2.19 - I cannot read it.

        MR.   WOODWARD:      2.17,   sir.

        MR.   JACKSON:    Forgive me,       sir,    which?

        LORD JUSTICE      TAYLOR:     19A.

        MR.   JACKSON:     That   is at 2.17.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:             Yes.         It does    not    look too
bad there, does it?

     MR. JACKSON:           My Lord, with respect, it is rather
crowded inside the         far side of Leppings Lane.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:         C e rtainly there is not much
outside the per i m e t e r gates, is there?       Mr. Jackson,
I was not wanting to argue the toss with you.              All I
am saying is that I am not sure to what extent you can
say, by looking at 20A and 24A, was it, what the state
was inside the p er im e t e r gate at that time.       We do not
have anything   quite like that.           When we look on a bit
we can see that at 2.30 on 25A it is pretty jammed in there.
That is five minutes later.

     MR. JACKSON:   Perhaps if we look at 14.30, 25A, we
see - and this is the last q u e stion on this matter I
wanted to put to the Ass i s t a n t Chief Constable, would you
describe the crowd, as you see them at the t u r n s t i l e s at
14.30?   A.   On this one here?

Yes.   A.   I think, having           attended       lots of football
matches, nothing unusual.

It is interesting, you see, because every fan who has given
evide n c e has said the crowd at that time was uncomfo r t a b l e ;
they were being crushed;     they had never been in a crowd
like it.      It  may be they have higher s t a n d a r d s than they
need, or even higher expectations.

             LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        Mr. Jackson, what is the
     q u e stion?   I am sorry.        If you could try and make your
     q u e stions more concise.

           MR.   JACKSON:      Forgive me,     sir.

Q.   Mr. Jackson, I am s ugge s t i n g that the crush outside was
     caused by Police O f f icers not knowing what an orderly
     crowd was and taking no action to regulate the system.
     A.   I can only say that our Police Offic e r s are e x p e r ienced
     and would take any a pp r o p r i a t e action that they thought
     was necessary.

Q.   Would you agree that at 14.27 outside               they do not appear
     to be taking any action at all?   A.                 Which p h o t o g r a p h ?

Q.   I have only    shown you three.          One is at 14.27            - it is
     number          A.   25A.

Q.         LOFD JUSTICE     TAYLOR:    24A.      A.       24A.           I do not see
     a nything unusual      there.

Q.   MR. JACKSON:         Indeed.     We know that people have been
     saying at that time they were crushed at the turnstiles.
     You see, we have all these serials given the task of
     orga n i s i n g the t u rnstile crush.   They did not take any
     action at all.           A.   Well, I cannot help you on that.

Q.   In the sense of they do not appear to have taken any
     action?    A.   No.   I think we need to speak to the
     O fficer in charge of that part i c u l a r area, to pose the
     q uestion to him.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     I think that is right,                     Mr.
     Jackson;  it is pr obably better if you do ask the
     Officers who were on the ground.

Q.   Can I just ask    you,    before we go on,        though,       look at
     20A, will you.      A.      20A, sir.

Q.   That seems to show the Police a c t ivity there was to keep
     the crowd on the pavement and off the road.      A.   That's
     right, my Lord.

Q.   Would it have been a p ra c t i c a b l e Police o p e r a t i o n if a lot
     of people did come late - too many to get c o n v e n i e n t l y
     and safely into the p e r imeter gates - for, in effect,
     that stream coming down the pavement being c o n v e r t e d by
     the Officers into a s t a t i o n a r y queue and let the head         of
     the queue go through the perimeter gates at a c o n t r o l l e d
     rate - would that have been a feasible Police o p e r a t i o n ?
     A.   It would be - with a very, very large crowd such as
     has been described, it would be ext r e m e l y difficult, my Lord.

Q.   Why?   You would need more Officers or could not be done
     at all or what?   A.   Well, as has been d e s c r i b e d to me,
     we were talking about 4,000 or 5,000 people coming in a
                                      40


                                                             W. J A C K S O N


     lafige group ind I think it would be d i f ficult to control
     them in that way.    Certainly that would be the main effort
     behind the operation, to try and keep them in an orderly
     fashion along the footpath to try and control them at the
     turnstile so you let people beyond the blue gates to
     queue up at the turnstiles, so that would be the idea
     of the operation.

Q.   Yes, and with the serials that                  were deployed there and
     the mounted Police, would that                  have been in your view a feasible
     operation, if it had been done                  that way?   A.   Yes, it
     would have been.

Q.   The problem, I suppose, is, once you do not do that at the
     beginning and you have got a crush inside ---              A.   You
     are then in extreme d i f f i c u l t i e s once you get to that stage.

                      C r o s s- e x a m i n e d   by MR.   MULLER:

Q.   Mr. Jackson, you told us on Friday and I am sure you accept
     that the Police have ultimate r e s p o n s i b i l i t y for safety
     in a si t u a t i o n such as we have at football grounds.
     A.    Yes.        Perhaps I could clarify that?         What I really
     meant, what I meant to say is that when you have a sit u a t i o n
     that develops into an e m ergency s i t u a t i o n then the Police
     are r es po n s i b l e for the c o - ordination.

Q.   But they would not allow a p r o c e d u r e to exist for running
     a football crowd which includes, of course, stewards,
     which they regard as being unsafe.           A.   Yes.

Q.   Because it would ultim a t e l y put them in the p o s i t i o n which
     you have just described.        A.   That's right.

Q.   And, of course, as far as the Police ®ere concerned, they
     by the time that this match occur r e d - the d i s a s t e r match                     -
     had vast e xp e r i e n c e of the working of the ground.
     A.   Yes.

Q.   Both   with   very large crowds and smaller                 crowds.        A.     Yes,
     sir.

Q.   And perhaps specifically,             as far as we are c o n c e r n e d        here,
     with Semi - F i n a l crowds.         A.   Yes, sir.

Q.   Can you tell me this, were -yousVsatisfied that it was going
     to be p o s sible to control the number of people going into
     Pens 3 and 4?      A.   Well, yes.



                                               /Do   I take it
                                   W. JACKSON



Do I take it from that that nothing as far as you were
concerned was ever said to anybody that you felt otherwise?
- A. That is correct.

So at all times when you were concerned or as far as you
and the Police were concerned in policing the West Terrace,
they were satisfied that it was going to be possible to
control the numbers in those two pens? - A. Yes.

And that means, of course, in this particular instance,
taking about 1,000 eachpen, limiting it to a 1,000  in each
pen? - A. Well I am not sure of    the numbers.

Well just accept that for the moment? - A. Yes.

It is quite obvious isn't it, Mr. Jackson, that that could
not possibly be done by the crowd finding their own level?
- A. Well I would have thought it was possible, but can I
qualify that? What I have said it is a combination you know
of the fans finding their own levels, the Stewards packing
and where the Police spot a problem then they should deal
with it, so it is a combination of all three.

Just take it in stages.  As far    as finding theirownlevel
is concerned, how do the crowd feel that there are 1,000
people in either of those pens? - A. Well I would think if
you feel uncomfortable you move over.

But you do follow, don't you, that this is an area which
people are very keen to get into? - A. Yes, what I have
said, I have qualified that and I have qualified it on
several occasions, that I would expect the Stewards and I
would expect the Police Officers if they spotted a problem
to deal with it.
So I think what you are saying is you accept that the crowd
finding their own level on its own is not going to restrict
up to 1,000 people? - A. That might not generally work and
consequently the Stewards need to be active and certainly
if the Police spot a problem they should be dealing with it
as well.
We have been told by Mr. Mole who was of course very much
involved in the previous year?s semi-final, that it was
impractical to require Sheffield Wednesday's Stewards to go
into Pens 3 and 4 for the simple reason that they probably
would not be listened to. Now if that is right and he
regarded it therefore as a matter for the Police, that
means that the Stewards come out of the equation, don't
they? - A. Well that would be right. He was a local
Commander and he would make local decisions.

And so the position would therefore be for the Commander
in charge this year, he would have to say:. "How am I
going to make sure that not more than 1,000 people go into
each of those pens?" - A. Yes.

                                       W. JACKSON


Q. And it would be his responsibility? - A. Yes.

Q. Because   it clearly ___   A. Can I just come back to that?
   We keep   saying it is the Police responsibility.  I mean
   I think   it is a responsibility for everybody concerned who
   were at   the match on that particular day.

Q. But Mr. Jackson, if the Police Officer knows that the Steward
   can't do the job, it is a waste of time even contemplating
   it, isn't it? - A. Well that would be a conunonsense approach,
   yes.
Q. Therefore you can't say:  "Well the Stewards should be doing
   it". He has got to forget about that. He has got to say:
   "Can I do it?" meaning the Police? - A. Yes.

q)
 .   And that would mean, wouldn't it, that certainly at some
     stage when the pen is beginning to fill up, you have got to
     have Police Officers in the pen? - A. What I would say
     you don't need Police Officers in the pen. You have got
     Police Officers in the perimeter, you have got Police Officers
     all round the ground.  If the Ground Controller identifies
     a problem or the Officer in charge of that particular area,
     i.e. Superintendent Greenwood who was responsible for the
     ground itself spotted a problem, he would tell Ground
     Control who would then deal with the situation.

Q. You will be aware, painfully perhaps, that the Officers did
   not spot the problem whereas the people who were in the pen
   certainly did spot the problem. Does it not occur to you
   in those circumstances that there is a considerable advantage
   in having an Officer in the pen before you get to an extreme
   situation? - A. Well I don't think it is necessary.

Q. Well in the light of experience, namely that the people who
   were in the pens were feeling the difficulty, yet all the
   Officers watching apparently did not notice it, does that
   not indicate to you to you that it would at least in the
   future be desirable to have Officers in the pen? - A. I think
   if we look back and it is easy to look back in hindsight
   and say perhaps there should be Officers in the pen or
   perhaps there should be Stewards in the pen, I think it is
   a matter of discussing with the Club to make the appropriate
   decision bearing in mind the circumstances.

Q. I am coming back again to what I said.  If we know from
   experience that Stewards are not going to be any good, it
   is only a question of stationing   Police Officers, isn't
   it? - A. Can I just clarify something? Did Mr. Mole say
   that there should be Police Officers in the pen?

Q. I think he could see the advisability of it, certainly.
   You see what I am putting ....

           MR. COLilNS: I don't think in fairness he ever
     accepted that Police Officers need be in the pens. I think
                                  W. JACKSON


he did accept that someone should do something to monitor
but I think the evidence is clear that nothing was done
and this ground seems to be well trodden.

      MR. MULLER: The reason I ask the question about this
is you can appreciate that the crowd may think:  "It is
all right for us" because they are keen to be in that
position, whereas in fact they are already well above the
1,000 that should be in there. Do you follow? - A. Yes.

And that is why it is imperative to have somebody in there
I suggest moving people on, before the crowd realise the
necessity? - A. Well I can only say the Officer in charge
of the ground itself, that part of the ground Superintendent
Greenwood, he has a number of supervisorsunder his command;
he has perimeter ^patrols; the Ground Controllers overlooking
Leppings Lane, and if there were a problem then they would
deploy resources to it if they thought it was necessary.

So be it. Are you saying then because you were so satisfied
that the numbers could be controlled, you did not ask or
require any other means of controlling the numbers going
into those pens? - A. Having looked at the Operational
Plan I was satisfied that it had sufficient flexibility to
deal with the situation.

Are you aware - and I am not going to trouble you with the
precise details at the moment - are you aware that in 1985
a Plan was drawn up by the Club which would have effectively
provided separate turnstiles for the three different sections
of the terrace, that is to say the centre area and the two
sides? - A. No, I was not aware of that but the local
Commander would be.

It is right to say, to put it in its context, that in due
course the Club abandoned that Plan and substituted the Plan
that we have got here now? - A. I would accept that.

Of course it is right to say isn't it, or would you agree
with this, that if at the time when separate turnstiles have
been put forward, it is actually done I think for segre­
gation of fans, if at that time it was thought by the Police
it was a good idea or indeed essential from the point of
view of controlling numbers into Pens 3 and 4, presumably
the Police would have been pressing for those arrangements
to be put in place? - A. I wonder if I could ask the
barrister from the Club, was the 1985 Plan as a result of
segregation that was going on at that time in the West side
and perhaps that might be the reason for it rather than the
fact of separate turnstiles to take the crowd in. I am
not quite sure.
      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  I am not at all sure, Mr. Muller,
that you are asking the right person about this.

      MR. MULLER: The reason I am asking about this is to
establish as far as the Police were concerned they were
                                    w. JACKSON


pressing for this, as far as you know, because they were
quite satisfied with the existing means of control? - A. I
don't know about that situation, I am sorry.

Can I then ask you about another aspect. The perimeter fence
round the pitch, the track perimeter fence and the gates in
it, am I right in understanding that the Police never regarded
those gates as being a means through which the whole of the
pens would be evacuated? - A. I think the evacuation in
normal circumstances can be one of two ways depending on
the circumstances, whether on to the pitch or through the
various exits.
The exits being through the tunnel or through the gate in
the radial fences? - A. Yes.
Those would be the normal means of escape if there was an
emergency? - A. Yes.
Now as far as the perimeter fence is concerned and the gate
in that, that was only considered, am I right by the Police,
as being a means of taking out a few people if the need arose,
not a means of taking out the full 1,000 people? - A. I would
accept that.
        MR. COLLINS: Sir, I don't know whether it helps my
 learned friend and I am trying purely to help, we will be
 calling Mr. Calvert who is the Police Liaison Officer with
 the Ground between 1979 and 1987. He will be the Officer
 who can deal with all these matters in conjunction with
 the production of all the relevant Minutes of the Working
 Party.
       It would seem, as I understand it, that Mr. Jackson
 was not directly in charge of this in the sense that he was
 not directly involved and this was something which was
 clearly delegated to others and Mr. Calvert I think would
 be the right man to deal with this aspect of the matter.

       MR. MULLER:   I shall do it in that way.

 Then there is just one other matter I want to ask you about.
 Could you have a look please at the log to which you were
 referred to earlier on and particularly at page 12. Can
 you help me to interpret that. That is at 19-minutes~past-3,
 am I right, there is an entry in relation to cutting equip­
 ment? - A. Yes.
. Does that mean that that is when it has been called for
  or when it is actually on its way, or what does it mean?
  - A. I think that means when it is supposedly on its way.

. Would one expect to find in this log anywhere the request
  for such equipment.  I say that because I confess I canno
  find it? - A. If we call through the extended incident
                                  W. JACKSON


for it then it should be on here. The Operator at Force
Control should put it on the extended incident log.

So if it is not here we take it from that that it has not
been done by somebody at Force Control? - A. Well I think
we can take it as read it has either not been done or not
been entered on the extended log.

Again can you help me about this: we do know thst the Fire
Brigade was called actually at a few seconds before 14-
minutes-past-3. There is no indication on this log that
that happened? - A. What happens there is when we implement
a major incident plan if perhaps I could explain what the
system is, we have an extended incident system at Force
Control. Now they listen in to the radios that our super­
visors have at the ground and She Ground Controller, so
they know everything that is going on, and the reason for
that is they are able to react fairly quickly should we
have a problem, so when we call for the Major Incident
to be set off, that is then picked up by the Force Control
and they have a responsibility to send the various services;
to make sure that the hospitals are informed? to make sure
that there are motorcycles to take the ambulances to the
hospitals etc. and in terms of the Fire Brigade itself, they
should inform the Emergency Services.

      Now I know that the Ambulance Service was informed
at 15.07 and certainly they did not pick up the need, and
probably quite rightly so at that time, for the Fire Brigade.
They had not been specifically asked for, but despite that
fact we obviously asked at some stage for the Fire Brigade
to attend and that was at 15.14.

The matter I am getting at and specifically wanting to know
if you can help us about, was there anybody at the ground
who could actually see the situation itself who called for
cutting equipment? - A. Yes, I think you will find that
Superintendent Greenwood will tell you that, yes.


            Cross-Examined by MR. GIBSON-WATT:

Mr. Jackson, I would like to ask you one or two questions
about the state of your information about what had happened
in the hour or two after it happened.

      As I understand it you have said so far that you did
not - words to this effect - you did not appreciate that
the gates had been opened by Police Order until about 4.15 p.
when you spoke to Superintendent Marshall.  Is that correct?
- A. Yes, I think that was right.

         Q. Well, perhaps we shall see.

                 MR. KALLIPETIS:   We have asked for it, sir, and have
            been told something is being transcribed and will be
            supplied to us, but I was not aware that that message would
            have been recorded.  That is news to us.

                 MR. COLLINS:   Certainly if I may help, my understanding
            is that that message would not have been recorded because that
            was not sent out on the relevant radio frequency.  That was on
            the internal frequency to deal with I think channel 25.

                 LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     25, yes, and not 19 or 35.

                MR. COLLINS:   What appears on this, sir, if you look
           back to page 9 you will see that the preceding message is
           timed at 14.44, that is the one before 15.07, and is
           Superintendent Marshall’s request for a Tannoy to be sent, and
           we will hear the reason that appears is because....

                 LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Because he could not get through.

                MR. COLLINS:     He could not get through on channel 25 so
           he used the means of communicating with Headquarters and
           getting Headquarters to communicate with the ground.   That is
           why that appears there.   You have nothing then until the
           incident starts, as it were, the Operation Support starts, and
           thereafter most if not all messages relating to the incident
           appear on the log.  I think that is the sequence.   I will be
           corrected if I am wrong, but that certainly has been my
           understanding of the position.   There is no log or rather no
           tape anywhere of the messages on channel 25, so we don't have
           a print out of those.
                 LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     So is this log what actually was
            heard at Snig Hill?

                MR. COLLINS:   Exactly, and if you look before 14.44 you
           will see a lot of miscellaneous messages, some of which are
           connected with the traffic build up, and some were wholly
           separate incidents altogether.  As I say, that is my
           understanding of the position.  The other log we have annexed
           is simply the manual log which was started on the
           instructions I think of Mr. Duckenfield, kept by Mr. Murray,
           which ....

                 LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Up to a point.

                 MR. COLLINS:   Which was not kept after 2.21.

                 MR. KALLIPETIS:   Just that I understand so that I don't
            ask questions needlessly, I have read this extended log as in
            fact being a computer log into which information is put ;by
            the operator. It is not a recording of messages received,
            because if one reads at the top of page 9, quite clearly that
            must be reported speech rather a direct message.  The
            incident which is recorded at 10.41, for example.   I

         understood there was in fact a tape recording of all messages
         received by Snig Hill, and messages they then transmitted
         into to SYMAS headquarters.

              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   It looks as though the answer Mr.
         Collins gave is correct about anything transmitted on channel
         25 at the ground probably would not get back to Snig Hill, but
         if there is some log at Snig Hill in addition to what we have
         got here which records messages that did get through to there
         over the relevant period then perhaps we could have it at some
         stage.

              MR. WOODWARD:    Sir, all material has been handed to the
         West Midlands Police.   They are completely aware.

              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I see.  Well, it may be either it
         does not exist or that it has not yet been served up.

              MR. WOODWARD:    As far as there is a tape recording, sir,
         our understanding is that that does not begin until the major
         incident is declared.

              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I see.   Let us not waste time
         now. Perhaps if counsel could pursue that and see if there is
         anything else, and let me know later whether there is or there
         is no t .

    Q.        MR. KALLIPETIS:   Mr. Jackson, once you had declared a
         major incident for Operation Support you knew ambulance
         services would be converging upon the gymnasium area and the
         Penistone Road entrance.  Is that right? - A. That is correct.

    Q. Were any instructions given to clear that area to make access
       and egress by ambulances easier? - A. i know at that time
       we were on talk-through and our Officers were in position
       to deal with that situation.  The Force Control Room would
       also be in a position to make sure the escorts were laid on
       to deal with that.

    Q. Who would the Officer be in charge of the gymnasium area,
       particularly the roadway? - A. I can't recollect.

    Q. I will wait and see.    Thank you.

              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I think that might be a convenient
         moment to break.

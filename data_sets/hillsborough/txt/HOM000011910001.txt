    Thank you for your letter of 15 March in which you
informed me that the Football League and the Football
Association have agreed to adopt Lord Justice Taylor's
recommendation for the establishment of an Advisory Design
Council.

    This is a very positive step and I was delighted to see
that the two organisations have acted so quickly.

    I hope that the Football League will have been encouraged
by the Chancellor's announcement in his Budget speech on pools
betting tax.  Discussions are already in hand with the pools
promoters and the Football Trust and, if a binding agreement
can be secured between them for the transfer of the monies
saved by the 2.5% reduction, the arrangements will be put into
effect very quickly.

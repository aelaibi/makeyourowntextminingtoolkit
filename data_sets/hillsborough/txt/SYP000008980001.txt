                had been o b t ained and that                  the    coach w o u l d    pick us up at N u n e a t o n for

                the Liverpool            versus N o t t i ng ha m Forest         football        m atch on S a t u r d a y      15th

                April         1989.

                The      coach picked myse 1             and             up at the L i b r a r y       in N u n e a t o n at

                about         10.35am on Sulfur day        15th April          1989 there was another               14 people

                who also         got on at Nuneaton.

                          md     I sat on the offside                of the    coach about        half way along.              The

                coach was alre a d y            pretty full          I r e cognised some of the             people     by face

                as      regular       users of the Heart of E n g l a n d Club but                  I didn't       know their

                names                    was on the       coach and he gave me and                          our tickets

                which         cost £6 each and were             for the West End S t a n d Terracing                  entrance

                B   .
                The      coach stopped again at H i n k l e y and Le i c e s t e r when more                       supporters

                joined the            coach.    I c a n ’t say how man y got onto                the    coach or describe

                them      nor    can I say where          they sat on the           coach except           the one man who

                got on at Hinkles,                       who sat at the front                 he always     sits at the

                front         of the    coach and       is a regular          traveller.

                The      coach also          stopped at a junction on the M o t o r w a y when a regular

                traveller         called                 who has a black m o u s t a c h e          got o n , J     c a n ’t

                remember where he sat.
                                                                         Mjzrou
                I have         been told that        two brothe rs v C a r 1 'and Ni cholas Hewitt                  got on the

              the year       iD&Cape the Police          had not a l l o w e d one to        loiter

              outside       the turnstiles.

              En route and outside             the turnstiles          I heard a number            of    people asking

              other    people     if they had spare m atch tickets.                      1 didn't think the

              number       of people asking         for tickets was           excessij<« for the           nature    of

              the match.

              wasn't     searched.

              I didn't       see any gates        open other        than the t u rnstiles           nor did    1 see

              any    una u t h o r i s e d entrance    to the ground.

              I can't       recollect     seeing any stewards              having       entered through the

              turnstile,       I did see a number            of    programme      sellers,        I don't    remember

              seeing any       police     officers.

                      and    I walked down the tunnel with other                        supporters.       I didn't     see

          tunnel    I was s u rprised at the               large        number    of people who were a l r e a d y

          on the    centre       terracing and          in front         of the    tunnel       exit.

                  and    I     made our way to where             I intended to stand w M c h              was where

                  and    Ihad stood the year             before,        which      was in/Pen 3         almost at the

          rear,    ten or fifteen feet away to the                        right    of the tunnel          and about
5,0.6.
          five    feet away from the wall                 of the West         stand.      I didn't      see any

          police    of stewards at the end of the tunnel                           or    in the    pens of the
^6/s/3
          terracing.

          The    pen we were       in when we took up position at Z.IJfpm a p p e a r e d to be

          as full       as    it had been at 3.00 pm the                 previous ya'ar.

          As the minutes went             by more and more               people were       entering       the   pen and

          we were       being    pushed    closer and          closer together.            It was also getting

          hotter.       At some time       prior       to 3 . 0 0 p m    I m an a g e d w ith great d i f f i c u l t y

          because       of the    crowd crush to take my jumper                     off.    I told|             [several

          times    to take his jumper             off,     however        it a p p e a r e d to me as      if he

          couldn't.

          Although       I      could breath          (I am 6 feet       tall). The heat was            causing me

          great    concern       it was about 2.45pm.

          Whe n we had originally,               taken up our m atch              viewing       position    I saw

          there the side          standing       terracing at either               end of the West S t a n d was

          r el a t i v e l y empty.    However,        by 2 . 4 5 pm I noti c e d that those              terraces

          were    beginning       to fill       up.

          Fro m 2. 3 0 p m onwards        the    crowd      crush was        continuous and         I kept      thinking

          to myself          how am I going       to stand this,             i^e cause    of the heat and the

          discomfort.

e r r     There was a sudden            crowd surge just Jfefore kick off                        it was    in fact

          when the       players      came onto thej f o o / b a l 1 pitch,              that    is the Liverpool
 O   nI
          team.

          A l t h o u g h the surge was         forwards.       The      crowd e v e n t a u l l y returned to       its

          original       position      I was     part     of that surge as              I was    pushed sidewards.
                                                                                                                        PAGE

          There were          one or two minor             surges       following          this surge.       The    football

          match     then kicked off.               Two or three minutes                 into     the game Peter

          B e a r d s l y hit      the N ot ti n g h a m Forest         cross       bar.    I had noticed          prior       to

          this    peo pie         climbing    over       the f enci ng at           the f ront onto the f o o t b a l 1

          Howe v e r    on this occas i o n the             crowd d i d n ’t corne back to its original

          p o s itio n even so there w a s n ’t any                    room for       them to come back.             In

          retrospect          I can only think             that a number             of other      people must          have

          ente r e d the          pen at    the same       time as the          crowd surge.           In fact      the    front

            part of the            crowd surge didn't             or    couldn't move            backwards at all.

          I am more          or    less    certain that        there were            people on the           pitch prior            to

          Peter B e a r d s l y hitting            the    cross    bar.

          I was also aware                that a man       in his       late    teens       or early twenties who

          had m e d iu m      length ginger          hair wearing a denim shirt with the sleeves

          rolled up had climbed                into the fencing at the front,                          he was      facing       the

          crowd     in front          of me and he was            gesturing at             the   crowd to go back.

          I couldn't          see at this stage what was                      happening at the front                of the

          crowd,       a l th ou gh people we re a p pearing                  very    rapidly on the           pitch      in

          front     of us.         I can only       presume       that       there was a gate           open in the

          perimeter          fencing       because       of how quickly they^Tere appearing. I could
fVvyy3
OV££_     also    see the          police    officers       pul 1 i ng       pej^fle over        the   perimeter

          f encing      in front          of me,

          I saw the Police                officer    run M u o         the    pitch speak         to the referee           who

          stopped the game and the                   players       left       the    pitch.

          Pe o p l e were         still    gaining access          to the       pitch and         I thought the         crowd

          crush     I was         in w o u l d ease.     People were also              being      pulled up into           the

          stand above me.

          T h r ou gh o ut    I couldn't       see the entrance                to the       tunnel     and    1 couldn't
                                                                                                  PAGE        6

see    if any people           entered or left through the tunnel.

After     some time        1 realised that the         crush hadn't         eased at      all. I could

see    policemen a tt e m p t i n g     to resusitate        people.      I decided then to get

         to safety         into the seated stand *t&t>ve me.

I lifted                  up and   people    in the stand above           helped him up into the

stand,

A minute          or so    later a small      gap a p p e a r e d next    to me and a fellow

supporter          gave me a leg up and this enab l e d              people    in the     stand above

me to     pull me up          into the stand.

Having      got     into the stand above          I looked down I could             see then the

full    horror       of what had occurred.

I saw that          there     was a perimeter wall about             three     or feet     high on top

of w hi c h was       the     perimeter     f e n c a / /in front   of where    I   had been

standing          I saw bodies     lyino/ft      looked as     if they were stacked up

against      the wall        and x
                                 ao^raared to       reach the       top of the wall.        The    bodies

exten d e d for what a p p e a r e d about          eight yards.         It reminded me of a

col l a p s e d    rugby scrum I could see           two of the       faces, they were white

and a p p e ar ed to me to be o b v iously dead.

I n itially the           crowd e x t en ded to the     bodies,     but as time went         on the

crowd g ained more            room and moved        backwards away from the bodies.

As the      crowd on the terracing             below thinned out            I had a good view of

the terracing and             I c o u l d n ’t see any bodies       lying     on the terraces

other     than those         i mmediately     in front of the         walls.

I could also          see a large number          of bodies on        the    pitch some    of     which

were    being      carried off by m a k eshift          stretchers       I saw that       people

including Police             offices,   St.    Johns A m b u l a n c e and supporters

a tt em pt i n g   to carry out first aid on the               bodies.

I found              [wi t h i n two or three minutes          of getting       into the stand.           I

stopped          him from taking any more                   p h o t o g r a p h s ■ This was      in the        vicinity

of the       18 yard          line of the Liverpool                end of the        ground.

           and    I left the ground at about                      4 . 2 5 p m and made      our w a y back            to

the    coach.

A bout      twenty of our             coach     party had a l r e a d y        returned.       As      time went           on

other members                of the    party arrived.

At about 6 . 0 0 p m a Po l i c e Officer a p p r o a c h e d                               in my       presence           and

a sk e d    if everyone          had     returned                     infor m e d    him that          two    had not

returned.          The Police          officer       told                   ,hat whe n they            r e t urned the

Po l i c e w ould        look after         them and he s u g g e s t e d         that we start              home.

We all       e m b a r k e d on the        coach and        left.     I gathered         from the talk            that

two miss ing            passengers were             two who       had been      picked      up in L e icester.

F r om what        I could gather             no one on the           coach had seen them or knew

where       they w e re .O nc e we          had all      d i s p e r s e d after     leaving        the      coach on

the way to the                football      I had not seen a n y o n e who               had been on our

coach until             we    r e t urned to our        coach.Throughout             the time          I was     in

Sheffield          I d i d n ’t see any behaviour

w h i c h was      drunken       or disorderly.             Nor    did    I see a n y t h i n g     that      I could

consider          to be a criminal             offence.

I d i d n ’t receive any               injuries w h i c h were            physical,       however         the    effects

of what          I saw and what            I e xp er i e n c e d are      still     with me.

I d i d n ’t witn e s s a n y t hi ng          I consider was a factor                   in the        deaths     and

injuries          to    people,       apart    from the        perimeter        fences and the over

crowding          in the       pen.

A fter      the m a t c h was         s t o pp ed   it a p p e a r e d as    if there were             too m any

suppo r t e r s        on the    pitch,       who were       just w a n d e r i n g about         doing       nothing,

a l t h o u g h some a p p e a r e d to be           in a state          of shock.

I w o u ld       like    to bring        to the a t t e n t i o n of the Judicial                 Enquiry        the

f o llowing        suggestions;

             s u r r o u n d e d by narrow     streets where     tickets are      numbered and allocated

             to the various           parts    of the ground and a d e q u a t e medical      f a c i l i t i e s are

             a vailable.       In future       I w ould   like the   views    of the   c h a irman of the

             f ootball       clubs    involved to be listened to by the Police and also                      the

             chairman of the           supporters       club to be able      to give   his   views.    Thats

             the    person who        stands    on the terraces and such a person who                can

             express        himself    be he the       chairman or other      official.

             Also    I w ould    like to see a special           Police   Squad    to deal    with    large

             scale     public a t t e n d a nc es     to deal w ith football      matches,    pop festivals

             etc.

             When    I returned to the           coach I couldn't      remember     by face who       the    two

             m iss i n g    passengers were.

                             states:
1.   I was born on the 1st June 1953.
2.   Occupation - Qualified Ambulanceman - SYMAS.
3.   I have 16 years experience with the service.                    I have
     attended training courses and have attained the Miller
     standard.        I mainly work accident and emergency and this on
     occasion covers transfer and out patient work.            I am based
     at Parkway Station.            I work a set 23 week rota which covers
     the 24 hour, 7 day per week, emergency service.
4.   On Saturday 15th,         I arrived for duty shortlybefore 1400
     hours and signed in my shift ws 1400 hours 2200 hours.               I
     was on duty that shift with ambulanceman                   |.   Having
     booked in we checked the vehicle and equipment.           We had been
     allocated vehicle Sierra 208 which is an emergency vehicle.
     We were on domestic Channel 2 which is the usual Channel for
     accident emergency.
5.   We then waited for any calls.              Shortly after 1400 hours
     Control issued us with an admission to Northern General Ward
     8B.              was driving.      We arrived at Northern General at
     about 1502 hours.         We off loaded the patient and radioed
     Control to say that we were clear.
6.   At about 1512 hours we heard a message to another vehicle,
                 (T      ^P W t )
     Sierra 209/*sending them to Hillsborough Football Stadium.
     The message specified gymnasium entrance - Penistone Road.
                       cjt tsa 23    (A
     Having called clear/We were given the same instructions to
     go to the gymnasium entrance of the Football Ground at
     Penistone Road.
We proceeded on red at speed with lights and horn.    On route
to the ground I heard Control asking for vehicles to come
green as soon as possible and also heard reference to this
being a major incident and for them to turn to Emergency
Reserve Control Channel, Channel 1.     We therefore switched
to Channel 1.
We approached the Junction of Herries Road South and Herries
Road and were directed by a police officer to the right down
Herries Road.     We proceeded to the roundabout junction with
Penistone Road.    There were police on duty at the roundabout
and we were directed by an officer towards Leppings Lane.
The general indication seemed to be that there was an
incident down Leppings Lane.     As far as I can recall as we
passed Penistone Road was congested with vehicles.
We proceeded down Leppings Lane.     There were supporters on
foot, police cars and police officers.     There was nothing
out of the ordinary for a Saturday football crowd at that
time.
As we approached the gates there were a lot more supporters.
I saw a couple of fire appliances and I could see two SYMAS
ambulances inside the Leppings Lane entrance.         We were
ushered in by police.

            happened.           I spoke        to       ambulanceman                           and
            ambulancewoman                      They were working on casualties and
            I noticed two male bodies on the ground.                        I went to them and
            checked for signs of life.                   I could not find any signs of
            life and I Informed the police officer who was next to me of
            this fact.
      13.   At this stage more people began to appear from the West
            Stand direction (point AG on the plan).  I noticed oemo more

            the vehicle.
      14 . /At this point I was concerned that the incident was here at

            Leppings Lane and not at the gymnasium entrance as had been
            radioed.      I tried to contact Control to inform them of this
            and requested a senior officer.                     I was unable -to contact

          19.   Control did not specify an end of the ground as far as I can
                recall so we returned to the gymnasium entrance.                We arrived
                at the entrance and were met by Superintendent Dale. He told
                us to wait until ambulances loading had departed.                       An
                ambulance left and we reversed off Penistone Road into the
                entrance to the ground.              Another ambulance next to us loaded
                up and left.             A casualty was brought to us on a SYMAS
                stretcher.          We took off one of our cots and loaded the
                patient on to the vehicle.               The patient appeared to be in a
                serious condition and in addition to this we loaded two
                walking wounded.              From there we left for the Northern
                General casualty.
          20.   At Northern General we off loaded and their medical teams
                were assessing casualties.              We radioed clear to control. We
                returned to the ground via Herries Road and Leppings Lane.
          21.   There were a large number of supporters and we made our way
                near the entrance.            We were met by Mr David Jones, who told
us to go to Penistone Road gymnasium entrance. There were a
large number of people coming out of the ground.            We
proceeded down Leppings Lane, left onto Catch Bar Road and
left at Penistone Road.
On arrival by the gymnasium entrance there were two
ambulances parked in front of us.     We were parked further up
this time by the main police access entrance to the ground.
The two other vehicles departed and we were brought a
casualty.   The doctor with him was satisfied that his
condition was stable so we waited for further casualties.
After about 4 or 5 minutes the doctor became concerned and
asked us to leave for hospital.
I set off for Hallamshire as I then understood that Northern
General was too busy.     I drove to the roundabout at the end
of Penistone Road and then turned left into Leppings Lane.
We had a police bike escort and Leppings Lane was heavily
congested with supporters on foot. I would estimate it was
about 1615 or 1630 hours.    The crowd was especially dense by
the Leppings Lane entrance to the ground.     I continued down
Leppings Lane and on to the Hallamshire Hospital and off
loaded the casualty and the doctor.
We headed back towards the ground and on the radio we heard
vehicles being stood by.      I drove to Infirmary Road and
stood by and informed Control. We were stood by for about 30
minutes and then Control stood us down and told us to return
to Parkway station.     We returned to station I would guess
sometime after 1700 hours and carried on with our normal
     duties.

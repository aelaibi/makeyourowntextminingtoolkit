MONDAY 13 JULY 1992


Mr David Knox (Staffordshire Moorlands): To ask the Secretary of
State for National Heritage, what consultations he has had about
the implementation of the Taylor Report.




MR DAVID MELLOR


I completed on 3 July     a round of consultations with interested

parties   on proposals   to   re-examine   the   all-seating   requirement

for Football   League grounds.    [I announced the conclusions of my

re-examination last Friday,      in reply to a Question from my Hon.

Friend the Member for                 ].




                                                                         1
Background Note

1.    There   is   no   obvious   constituency   interest   behind   this
Question.

2.    It seems likely rather that Mr Knox, noting the Secretary of
State's intention to announce the conclusions of his "Taylor"
re- examination   before   the   summer  recess,  is probing for
information.




                                                                        1

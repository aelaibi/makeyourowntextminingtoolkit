3 1st March 1997

Tel call from a reporter from the Daily Mirror about a story they a running to morrow
in which it is claimed that despite the evidence at the inquest that camera 5 was not
working they have found evidence that there are pictures available.

I told him that after such a long time I could not remember the details of the evidence
and indeed he agreed that it would not be reasonable to expect me to do so.

I told him that I was not prepared to make any comment.

He asked my age and I told him 64 almost 65.

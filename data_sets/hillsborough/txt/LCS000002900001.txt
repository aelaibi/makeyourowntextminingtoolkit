                              MEMORANDUM

TO:        HONORARY OFFICERS
FROM:      CHIEF EXECUTIVE
DATE:      HILLSBOROUGH HELPLINE
SUBJECT:    12th. September, 1989




1.     Introduction
                        /

1.1    I have previously reported discussions about transferring
        the Help-Line to the voluntary sector.     A copy of my
      " original paper is appended.

1.2    The Trustees of the Disaster Fund have agreed to make funds
       available for the Helpline as follows


                                                  £
       1/10/89 to 31/3/90: Volunteer Expenses:  20,000
                           Telephone:          • 7,000
                           Admin:                6,000

       1/4/90 to 31/3/91;   Volunteer Expenses:       40,000
                            Telephone:                15,00.0.
                            Admin:                    12,000~

1.3   The original prop'osal was that we would act as a charitable
       conduit for these funds to pass them on to the South Sefton
       Health Authority in support of the Walton Hospital Relatives
       Support Group.

1.4   It is now proposed that we actually take on the management
       of the Helpline, using the funds from the Trustees to
       appoint a Co-ordinator, and p roviding an organisational
       framework for the service.

1.5   I am only prepared to respond to such a proposal if three
       conditions can be met.

       1.5.1.   Cast-iron assurances can be given as detailed at 2
                below.

       1.5.2.   It is clearly understood that our involvement is
                 temporary, with an independent charity established
                 as soon as possible to w h o m this work can be
                 devolved.

       1.5.3.   Some mechanism can be found by which the Council
                can be re-imbursed for the cost of my time
                involved in this exercise.

Organisation:
4.1   We need to prepare a trust deed for an independent
      Helpline and submit it as soon as p oss ible to the
      Commission.  Mersey RHA have prepared one for me to
      check.

4.2   We need to pull together a committee to oversee this
      work.    Suggested membership w o u l d be myself, Alan
      Chapman,    Steve Martin (Diocesan B o a r d of Social
      Responsibility),    Terry Gilvin       (Catholic Social
      Services) Carol W i l k i n s o n (Ass i s t a n t Director,
      Liverpool Social Services)        and someone       from the
      Relatives Support Group.          ^     ^       ‘  is already
      involved with the Group and w o u l d make a useful
      addition to the Committee, providing a link with the
      Executive Committee.      This group w o u l d eventually
      become the Trustees of Helpline.

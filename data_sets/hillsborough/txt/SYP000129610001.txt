    we have issued to the Club following the testing of a section
    of the crush barriers before the start of the season and a
    general inspection of the structures in the ground.
         Although all the barriers tested withstood the
    applied load several corroded clips and horizontal rails have
    been replaced.
         A copy of the results of the barrier tests have been
    sent to Don Sherriff and a list of maintenance items sent to
    the Club.

For the attention of Mr.

Dear Mr.          ,
            Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.
                    Barrier Testing 1981
     In July crush barriers 40, 41, 42, 47, 48, 49, 90, 55,
56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 68, 69, 70, 71, 85, 90, 114, 115,
116 and 118 (see the attached copy of our drawing 16I0/63A1
were tested in accordance with the procedure laid down in
the Guide to Safety at Football Grounds.
     Barriers   64, 67, 68 (span 1*2), 81, 82, 83, 119 and
120 could not   be tested because being towards the back of
the terrace a   suitable reaction point is not available
against which   to Jack.
     Three sections of barriers deflected excessively and
would not sustain the test load. In one instance a cnrroded
clip retaining the horizontal tube deformed.
     Remedial work was carried out on barrier 41 (one post)
and 115 (one post and one clip). These barriers were then
successfully retested on 9 September.
     Enclosedare single copies of our record sheets showing
the results of the barrier tests.
     As you are aware certain sections of the perimeter
fence round Spion Kop were tested. The 2.74 kH/m load was
applied, for rails parallel to the direction of flow.
     The sections tested at the top of Spion Kop withstood
the load without any signs of distress. Deflections were
surprisingly small.
     However the sections tested behind barriers 118, lid,
120 and above the exit in that corner deflected excessively.
Two corroded fence posts and four corroded fence post stays
have now been replaced to restore the rigidity to this
fencing.

                                 Yours sincerely,
                                                                   WE/KH/3113

Dear Mr. Vaughan,

                            Safety of Sports Grounds Act
                    I enclose a copy of a certificate I have issued to
the Club following the testing of a section of the crush
barriers during the summer and a general inspection of the
structures in the ground.              During the tests on the crush
barriers two of the posts were found to be incapable fef
sustaining the te$t load without deflection and a clip also
had to be replaced.             Following remedial works the relevant
sections of barrier were re-tested and were found to be
satisfactory.
                    We have also had certain lengths of boundary fence
tested and some remedial work has been carried out where the
strength had been reduced by corrosion.
                    I have sent a copy of the results of all the crush
barrier tests to                         at Sheffield Town Hall.     A list
of the maintenance items has been sent to the Club.

Dear Eric,

                       Safety Certificate
        I have only had a reply in the last few days to my
letter to the SYCC dated 18 June. You will remember thi,s
m s the letter telling them that we did not intend to monitor
the roof trusses in the South Stand and also that we did not
think a second monitoring device was needed on the batteries
for the public address system.
        As you will see from the .attached copy of David Vaughan*
letter he accepts the position with regard to the batteries.
He also suggests a visual inspection of the roof trusses after
any heavy fall of snow or any exceptional gale. We will
probably carry out this latter request by changing our
season tickets from the North Stand to the South Stand next
year.
        I have replied suitably to David Vaughan (copy
enclosed).

                              Your s sincerely,

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

You will recall that you raised certain points in your letter dated
18th June relating to the Hillsborough Stadium.

So far as the deflection of the roof trusses in the South Stand are concerned,
the Officer Working Party agree that the likely causes are somewhat
conjectural but equally it is possible that the situation could worsen in the
future.

Bearing in mind that an acceptable monitoring method would be inconvenient
and costly to the club, it is suggested that a visual inspection during the
customary visits, and possibly after exceptional gale or snow loading
conditions, would provide a practical monitoring system.

You also referred to the suggestion that a monitoring device to be sited
adjacent to the batteries providing the emergency power supply for the public
address system should be provided. This suggestion was originally made
following a visit by the County Fire Service to the ground having revealed
that the batteries were discharged and that none of the ground staff present
at that time knew anything about the system. Access to the public address
cubicle to check the monitoring light in there could not be gained.

However, the procedures since introduced would seem to overcome this problem.

                                                 Yours faithfully,

For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan


Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
       Mr. England has passed to me a copy of the note
written following your visit to the ground on 8 June 1981
and has asked roe to look into the two matters raised
in note 2a and 2e.
       The first paragraph of note 2a implies that there
had been an agreement to monitor deflection of the steel
roof trusses.    This I think is a misunderstanding.     I
personally had undertaken to look into the possibility
and the Club is not aware that it had entered into any
commitment.     I have looked at the roof again and have now
written a letter to the Building Surveyor,a copy of which
is enclosed.
       In the second paragraph of this note there is a
reference to a monitoring device to be sited adjacent
to the batteries providing the eeragency power supply for
the public address system.      Mr.        informs me that this
suggestion was certainly made at tbnmeeting on 7 April in the
course of discussing a number of matters but he was not under
the impression that the suggestion was being pnapessed.        fftam
There is already a warning light within the public address
cubicle together with very precise Instructions to the
operator.     The light is checkdd at every home match.
The batteries would take many weeks to run down following
any breakdown of the charging system so thafcprovided a
check is made a day or two before the start of the system,
there can be no question of the emergency power supply being
inpperable.     it would of course be possible to have another
warning light fitted adjacent to the batteries but it must
be kept in mind.that even simple matters such as this are
quite costly*,for example, the bill received for charging
the batteries when they were found to be flat a few months
ago was in excess of £100.      A similar sort of bill could
be expected if we were to fit a warning light system
alongside the batteries.       There obviously comes a time when
                   i                 s.
we have to resist belt and braces requests of this kind.
       Turning now to the two items raised in connection
with Spion Kqp, it is expected that further work may be
undertaken at the ground in the near future and the infilling
step at the top of the original exit will be concreted at
that time.                 ,
       The temporary barrier of scaffolding tubes and the
bottom of the new Kop exit will be replaced by a permanent
arrangement shortly.    We believe the responsibility lies
with the outside catering contractor and the matter will be
raised as soon as John Strange returns from holiday next week.


                                          Yours sincerely,

  Dear Sir,

  Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975.

  I attach for your use 4 copies of a Note of yesterday’s visit to the
  Hillsborough Stadium by the Officer Working Party (Sheffield District).

  Perhaps you would kindly arrange for Dr. Eastwood to advise the Building
  Authority of the progress of the monitoring of the apparent deflections
  in the steel trusses in the South Stand (paragraph 2(a) of the Note).




                                              Yours faithfully

For the attention of Mr. D. Sheriff


Dear Sir,
                   Hillsborough Football Ground
                Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
       I have                                        of David
Vaughan's minutes of your meeting at hirs Gitib on 8 June 1981.
In particular my attention has been drawn to the matter of the
steel trusses in the roof of the South stand.
       When we last talked about the trusses you will recall
that I said I was not worried by the misalignment but I
indicated that if some simple method of monitoring the situation
could be devised so that there was no great expense to the Club
I would make a recommendation that readings should be taken.
I promised to look into the matter and write to you again.
       I have made another inspection and it is clear that if
any meaningful readings were to be taken it would be quite a
costly exercise.      Access to the apex of the roof trusses is
difficult because of the seating below and I think it would be
necessary to erect scaffolding each time if the person taking
the readings was to work in reasonable safety.
       I am also now quite convinced that there is no element
of danger.      It seems highly likely that the trusses which are
out of line have been in that condition since they were erected
or possibly very shortly thereafter.      There is of' course
sane steel bracing between the trusses at the East end of
the stand at which location the trusses appear to be
vertical.presumably the erection bracing ensured that
this was so when the roof was first built.      Progressing
along the stand the trusses appear to gradually tilt and
then towards the West end they straighten up again.      The
trusses are joined to each other by timber purlins only
except on the line of the columns where the spacing of
the bottom chord of the truss is determined by the lattice
girders.   The bolted connection between the timber purlins
and the roof trusses is very adequate and it seems quite
likely that the trusses were pulled towards each fcfcher
at rafter level by shrinkage of the timber purlins.         It
seems reasonable to assume thatthhese timber purlins were fixed
immediately following erection of each truss.      If the
slaters then followed, working from the Eastern end,drying
out of the purlins would result in the deformation pattern
which is now apparent.
       This is of course only a hypothesis but even if there
is scaneother reason for the tilting of the trusses, the
plate action of the boarded roof will be such that there
can be no question of instability.
       It should also be kept in mind that if there were some
latent weakness, failure would occur under either extreme
snow loading or extreme wind loading.      The stand will not be
occupied by spectators under either of these conditions since
it would be Impossible for a football match to take place.
With this as background and bearing in mind the cost of
any monitoring exercise I have advised the Club that it is not
in my view necessary and the advice has been accepted.

                                     Yours faithfully,

            Note of a Visit to the Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield
                              on 7th April, 1981


PRESENT:   Representing the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club L t d .

           A. J. Clough (Messrs, Eastwood and Partners)
           E. England (Secretary)
           J. A. Strange (Messrs. Eastwood and Partners)

           K. Danks (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)
           F. Davis (South trkshire County Fire Service)

           D. Sheriff (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council)
           D.I. Vaughan ( South Yorkshire County Council)

1.     Purpose of Meeting

Bearing in mind the F.A. Cup Semi-Final which was to take place on Saturday,
11th April, 1981, it was felt it would be desirable for the Working Party to
visit the ground, especially as a small number of matters had arisen since the
last visit on 10th February, 1981.

2.     Inspection of Ground

(a)    South Stand

The previous comments relating to the roof structure and the exterior windows in
the Ladies' Toilets below the stand were still applicable.

The L.P.G. cylinders had been removed from beneath the Stand,and the batteries
supplying the emergency power supply for the police address had been enclosed in
a satisfactory fire resisting metal case. Whilst the provision of an automatic
battery charger would be a longer term solution, in the short term arrangements
had been made for the batteries to be charged before each game and for the public
address system to be checked relying only on the emergency battery supply. The
indicator for the batteries condition was presently in the Public Address Box.
It was suggested that it would be less likely to be overlooked if the indicator
was sited adjacent to the new metal case for the batteries.

(b)    West Stand

As previously agreed, the Club would round off the steel supports to the new
emergency exit (nearest to the South Stand) as soon, as a grinder was next present
at the ground.

The cracked brickwork at the rear of the stand which required pointing, the
apparent distress on the concrete pillar supporting the steps at the. rear of the
stand, the cracks in the concrete &t the top bo both sets of stajLr®, as well as
the currently slight corrosion in the base plate of the outer steel column
(nearest to the South Stand) ha,d all been included in the maintenance progrannne
and would be undertaken shortly.
                             \
(c)     North West Terrace

The cracking of the concreting had beetl attended to by injecting material from
the top. The results had been satisfactory, except in two small areas where
water seepage had obviously taken place and which would receive further
attention.

,(d)    North Stand

The expansion cracks which had appeared in the wall of the North Stand (nearest
to the Spion Kop) had been included in the maintenance schedule and would be
attended to shortly.

 (e)    Spion Kop

The infilling of the step adjacent to the handrail on the left of the original    j
exit at the top of the Kop would be given attention in the close season.

Whilst the brick built chip shop at the bottom of the new exit from the Kop had
been erected, it was not yet in use.  It was noted that the siting of the
chip shop had resulted in a possible danger to spectators in that a gap into
which spectators could be pushed, or possibly stumble because of the camber, had
been created. As regards the F.A. Cup Semi-Final,                             y
IT WAS AGREED -

that a temporary barrier of scaffolding tubes should be erected between the end
of the new Kop exit outer barriers and the concrete pillar of the lowest of the
Kop original exit steps.  In the longer term, the existing barriers would need
extending to fill thegap and ideally, the area between the bottom of the new Kop
exit staircase and the original Kop exit steps should be levelled off,

3.      Ground Evacuation Procedure

Whilst the Club had been supplied with a Schedule on "Fire Instruction and Drills
on 9th April, 1980, consultations between the County Fire Service and the South
Yorkshire Police had resulted in the production of an "Emergency Evacuation
Procedure".  The Club  undertook to circulate copies of the procedure to all
Stewards who would be on duty for the F.A. Cup Semi-Final.

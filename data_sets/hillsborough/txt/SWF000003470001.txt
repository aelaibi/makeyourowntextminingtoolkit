From: Chief Superintendent PEMBERTON                Station:

To:   Mr JONES                                      Date:      17 May 1989


SUBJECT:   COMMONICATIONS




I refer to your request in which you want a brief report for the attention
of Andrew Collins QC, with regard to "radio logs". There were two methods
of logs used by the South Yorkshire force on Saturday 15 April 1989.
Appendix "A" refers to an extended incident log which was created
throughout the whole force commander control system. This connects any
station with a commander control availability to make an entry on the
extended incident log which related to the semi final policing.   The
incident log was created by Superintendent MURRAY under the following
terms of reference.

Semi final - Liverpool versus Notts Forest,

This incident created a recording of all information/incidents relating to
the above fixture.  Groups to note its existance and use are required.
There is an entry timed at 0828 from Superintendent MURRAY indicating that
this message is to be left open as instructed and all messages to do with
the semi final to be entered on this message.  The document then is a
printout of the computerised entries made on the force commander control.
I draw to your attention to one entry dated 1444. This is an entry
inserted at that time from FI Hamilton Road Pplice Station by Pc BARNES.
(A statement from this officer is being obtained).  The message recorded
states "From Superintendent MARSHALL FI, request contact ground to tanoy a
request for people not to push at Leppings Lane entrance".  Passed to
Police Sergeant GODARD, ground control.  It is believed that difficulties
in radio communication on the ground control led to Superintendent
MARSHALL changing his radio channel to contact his local police station
for they in turn to contact the ground control by telephone means.

Appendix "B" refers to a second log. This is a ground control log created
again by Superintendent MURRAY and referred to in his statement.   As the
ground control commander he identified a weakness through a post match
briefing through the lack of a log during the 1988 semi final.   It was his
intention for this year to create a log which he did and which starts 0800
control operative PS 616 and PC 1035.  The log then relates to various
incidents throughout the morning and concludes at 1421 hours.  It is
believed that there is only one tape recording of any radio messages and
that related to the force control room and this is being transcribed at
this moment but is believed not to possess too much important evidence.
Neither the local sub divisional radio nor the ground control radio were
tape recorded and there are no sound recordings of the messages in that
box.

Actions are well advanced to obtain statements from the persons involved
in the ground control and should be on hand by Friday at the latest.

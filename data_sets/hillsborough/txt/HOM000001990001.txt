              On duty 9.30am Saturday 15 April              1989 at S V F C .

              Duty - serial        1 ic PS Chapman

              Deployed to cover perimeter           track.

              After briefing had packed lunch,              patrolled perimeter           track ic PC

              Marsden including behind Penistone Road                       turnstiles.

                At    2.10pm took meal.
                At    2.35pm took up position on perimeter                  track between Gates   1-2

                Leppings Lane end.

                At that t i m e    looking   round it appeared that the m a j o r i t y of the

                Nottingham    Forest f a n s were already in.

                Most of Liverpool       seats taken in South Stand but terraces and seats

                above Leppings Lane seemed only half full.

                At about 2.45pm chased 3 youths,             who had climbed the wall and fence

                between terrace 1 and South Stand,              disappeared into crowd.

                About 2.50pm the s a m e      three youths approached me asking to go into

                terraces,    had been sent back round by a PC on South Stand opened gate

                 and they went      in to terrace 1.

                 I    did not have a radio.
                 A    St. Johns man told me they       were going           todelay   match   - he had a

radi o .

The ter races were still        fairly empty.

Gates i~4 half full.

Fates 2-3 three quarters         full.

At 2.53pm (I looked at my watch).               At Gate 2 I let out a man and 5

kids they were sweating and distressed,                they asked to go in terrace 1

because     it was getting cramped in terrace 2.

Another PC then came and stood by Gate 2.                 I went   to Gate 1 and

opened it.      I turned round and saw half a dozen people                  had come out

of Gate 2.      I went    to Gate 2, I d i d n ’t know what was happening.

I looked through the open gate and saw a man's face in                      the middle,     it

showed terror,       I began to pull peole out fast.

A couple of fans were swearing and pushing me.

A club official       in a suit was trying to push people back in the gate

and shouting and swearing at the fans.

More people came on to the pitch.               Two P C ’s were with me at Gate 2

puliing people out.
 I went over to terrace        3.   There were now about half a dozen P C ’s

 standing around near end of pitch,             Gate   3 was open.

 I saw a girl pushed right up by the fence of No.                  3.   Someone was

 shouting " S h e ’s dead,    s h e ’s dead."

 I saw a man holding up a boy in terrace 3, he was                  limp.     I climbed

 fence and pulled him up and out, with help of another PC gave mouth

 to mouth and heart massage.             He was dead.      Body looked 12-14 years,

 male,     white,   light c u r l e y ginger hair,     freckles.

 Someone else dragged          a man out about 40 years, white,             clean shaven,

 very large man.         I began heart massage and a fan tried mouth to

 mouth.      He was dead.

  Stood up looked around people everywhere.

  Dead people all over pitch.
                                                                                      PAGE
                                                                                      R187

        I moved the two bodies with me out of the way as more bodies were

        still    being brought out.

        P C ’s giving r es uscitation all around me.

        An ambulance had arrived.            P C ’s were taking oxygen bottles out and

        trying to use them.

        Someone shouted get bolt cutters.            Firemen were arriving.

        Together with some fans,           I put two bodies on the advertising

        hoardings and ran across pitch to police room end.

        Vent back to terraces.            Someone hurled barrier pole over fence.

        One fan who was one of the first to be pulled out kept running around

^   '   swearing at PC's pushing and shoving.             PC's just kept pushing him out

        of the way.      Saw him again and again.

        Went to police room,        opened door of gym as two P C ’s were carrying a

        body,    looked in, bodies everywhere,          that many had not come from the

        pitch.
        Help c a r r y walking wounded to a transit ready to go to hospital.

        Got in an ambulance which had two badly hurt young men. Went to the

        Royal Ha 1lamshi r e , helping with giving oxygen in ambulance.

        Whilst t r a v e l l i n g down in ambulance,    saw a group of about f i v e fans

        walking    down Middlewood        Road with Police   jackets   and helmets.

        At hospital got lift back with a Police transit,               on the way back to t

         ground got diverted to a fight on Penistone Road.               Liverpool fans

         attacking Notts.      Forest.      They smelt strong of beer.

         On arrival at ground went to Police room.              People were crying.

         Helped    (tried)   to comfort a man who c o u l d n ’t find his son.

         At one point I r e m e m b e r   seeing a Liverpool    fan who had been let off

         of gate 2 run around pitch shouting and swearing sticking fingers up

         at Notts.      Forest fans.       The crowd reacted.

         Among the walking wounded a lot smelt strongly of beer.               2 -3 were ve

         I have worked   just about every major game at SWFC for the past five

         years when duties allow.

         Although I usually work South Stand I have worked the perimeter    track

         about five times before.

              Further to my last report,     I now wish to clarify the positions of the

              pens and gates.

              When I mentioned Gates 1-4 being half full,         I meant the South and

              North pens being half full.

              Gates 2-3 being three quarters full,        I meant the Central South and

              Central North pens being three quarters full.

              At 2.53 p.m.    I mentioned   letting out a man and five kids from Gate 2,

              this should be amended to Gate 3.        They asked to go into terrace 1,

              this should read the South pen.         They had come from terrace 2, which

              should read the Central South pen.

              The gate the Police Constable stood next to should also be amended

              from 2 to 3 Gate,    as with the gate that people were coming out of,

              this should read 3 gate.

              The gate I later went to was also 3 gate and not 2 gate.

              After pulling people out of gate 3, I went to terrace 3 which should

              read Central North Pen.

              The Police Constables were standing around gate 4 not gate 3.

              The girl I saw pushed up against the fence was in the Central North

               pen and the boy I pulled out came from the Central North pen.

*       The man who I tried to give heart massage to came out of gate 4 from

         the Centrel North pen.

         The fans that ran around the pitch shouting and swearing had been let

         out on to the pitch;     I mentioned through gate 2, this should be

         amended to gate 3.

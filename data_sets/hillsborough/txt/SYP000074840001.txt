            I am a Liverpool             footb/j        supporter and on Saturday 15th April                1989

            (150489)        I attended/the Hillsborough F oo tba l1 Ground to watch the F „A.

            Challenge Cup s &m i -fi nal .

            I brought my ticket for the match from Anfield Football Ground at a

            cost of £6.00 for the Leppinngs Ln standing area.

            I travelled to the game            coach with a company called Ambeo^ine     ibej^Tr

         We arrived in Sheffield at about orte o ’clock (1300) and I think the

         coach was parked in Parkside Rd about ten mi n u t e s ’ walk from the

         Ground.    We were given no directions or escort to the Ground by the

         Police and saw no disorder when walking from the coach to the Ground.

S.O.£-   I got to the entrance of the Ground at akfout two o ’clock                (1400),    there

         only a small number of people outsiii the gates and turnstiles.                        I saw

         no Police or stewards directing creople to their correct

         turnstiles.        I had no difficulty finding my entry point and I had no

         difficulty entering the Ground through the turnstile.

         I saw no other gates open or being opened, and I saw no unauthorised

         entry into the Ground

         I have retained my ticket which bears the jtfarkings Leppi.ngs Ln

         standi n g ,             LL1, £6.00.

         Once   inside the ground I saw no sign^f dii rpfti ng me to my match viewing

         point, and had difficulty due to / h i s          to find the side terracing

         standing area, although after qf short search I found it.                  I did not

         use the tunnel and I saw o n l ^ one Policeman,            no stewards    present at

         the tunnel entrance.           I   sat/ no disorder or other incidents      in the

         Ground and I saw no-one            drinking   in the Ground.

         I d i d n ’t see a barrier break in Pen 3.

         I took my match viewing position up at about ten past two                  0^410) a nd

         there was no crowd crush;          in fact where I stood on the yfde terracing,

         there was plenty of room.

         I stood on the terracing with my three friends mentioned earlier,

                            and

         At this time I looked around the Ground and wji>-''tfuite surprised to see

         the two centre pens at the Liverpool             ejpwJTlbehi nd the goal were quite

         crowded,       for this t ime.      They seajwlsd to be quite tight 1y packed.         At

         no time was I subjected            to c rjrfCd crush, I d i d n ’t witness any crowd

         crush and I w a s n ’t injured,

           I was looking      into the centre pens when I saw in Pen 4 a young woman

           or girl on top of people's heads.              I d o n ’t know how she got there, my

           first    impression was that she had fallen as I didn't see her being

           dragged out of the crowd.          I would describe her position in the crowd

           as centre of Pen 4, very close to the front fencing, and she was face

           down on top of the crowd.          She w a s n ’t being passed over the heads but

           she looked as if she was dragging herself over the crowd.                  All    I can

           describe the woman was the fact that she had a white top on.                     She was

           about ten feet away from the front fencing,               on the grid shown M 6 / 7 ,

           the crowd beneath her split and she fell to the floor between the

                                                                             The girl then

           disappeared into the crowd.           I lost sight of her and the crowd just

           engulfed the area she had been standing             in.

           I d i d n ’t assist any person who appeared to be inL*fred or dead.

           I think that some of the factors           in the i nju^Ees and deaths to the

           people were lack of stewards and Policenw'fT giving directions inside

           and outside the Ground.         The design         the Ground should be improved,

           with more signs giving better          i rywrmat ion of standing and where to
OfT
           view the match as the tunnel^fs the only visible sign of ent ry to the

c © H k £ t J T ter rac i ng as you ente r ti^T Ground.   There was too much side fencing in

           the terracing which created           far too much segregation for the fans.

           Too many people werjr allowed in          the centre pens. Also        people were

           allowed to buildVip outside           the terracing leading into      the tunnel,

           leaving no escjfpe route for          the fans to get o u t .

           I left the grfbund at about quarter to five               (1645) of my own accord.         I

           did not witness anything         I considered to be criminal.         With regard to

           my own views on how the incident was handled initially the amount of

           time to open the front fencing gates was far too slow.                  The Police
                                                                                        PAGE    4
                                                                                        S1910

         were very slow to react to the situation.                No early loud speaker

         announcement to inform people what was happening was given.                 The

         Police d i d n ’t seem to know what to do and in fact kept pushing the

         crowd back into the crowded pens.                When it had all finished at about

         16.30 hours     (1630)   the people were still         recovering on the pitch and

         the Police were trying to lead them out of the Ground back through the

         gates   into pens 3 and 4, where they had previously come from.

         When the crowd crush happened and people quite justifiably were

         reluctant to go back through those gates
                                          o   fr     -^ b o r      assoc        it i c »5113
         I think    in future the F.A.        ought to jxfnsider the allocation of tickets

         to the most supported teams aruj^The allocation o'f which part of the

         stand they view the m a t ^ j / f r o m .

         Better organisation is a must by everybody concerned and the re­

         designing of fences at the front of the apswtnds to be re-designed,

         I went to the semi-final at Hillstj^a^migh l ^ t            year and people were not

         allowed to congregate outs idjj^^he Groury^i n the road as the Police

         through the turnstils^f into the G r o u n d .

         This year it was too relaxed by the Police as people were allowed to

         congregate outside.

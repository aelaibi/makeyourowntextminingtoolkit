                    I am             a married man living at the above address.

                    On Saturday 15th April                      1989 (150489)              I yds   at Sheffield Wednesday

                    part time as a steward.

                    I have been employed by the club in this capacity for the past 24

                    years.

                    My job as a steward entails havi

                                                                                       o                 that   I was a normal

                    stand steward.

                    As the 15th April                   (150489) was the day Liverpool were due to play

                    Nottingham Forest                   in the semi final of the FA Cup I. started work at

                    0900 hours                   instead of the normal          starting time of 1300 hrs            (1300)   for

                    usual divisional matches.

         car park as it had been        Located to the BBC for            (King   their   vans




     4   While we were working at this post1 noticed people were parking

         and hire vans    in side roads near to           the car park. When

         of the vehicles 1 could see they were wearing scarves and hats with
                                                                                             cars

                                                                                  they got out



*>       either Liverpool    or Nottingham Forest        logos on them.

         I couldn't believe that they were arriving for the match as it was

         only 9.30 am (0930).      About    2 dozen in total of the fans came up to me

         and asked where      the nearest pub was and from their accents            I could

         tell the majority of them were from           Liverpool    from then     til   1100 am

         (1100)   I stayed at the car park and         as the morning went        on I saw that

         a steady flow of both Liverpool and F o r e s ^ f a n s    were arriving for the

         match. At 1100 am    (1100)   I then l e f t J m e   car park and walked along

         Leppings Ln and entered the g r o u T y r through the Leppings Ln g a t e ,

         having first shown the Police^rTy identity card and gaternan pass book.

         At this point I could see Imat there were a lot of Liverpool

         supporters milling xarougC the Leppings Ln gate,            I couldn't say whether

         they were drinking     arXiot and although they were         chanting     I

         wouldn't say they were disorderly.

         Having entered the ground I went to the placers entrance and signed

         in, from there    I went to my post, at D jt t r H, the pressmens entrance.

         I stayed at my post until aboutt 2.^g pm (14552 from there                I entered

         the South Stand intending to watch          the first half of l^ie match.          I

         only watch half      the matches as Door H has to be c o ^ r e d a ll through

         the match by either myself or my colleague                               , so during

         the match I was going to watch the first h a l ^ ^ h i 1st he covered the

         gate and then change over at h a l ^ t i m e .

         Having entered the south stajera to watch the game I sat on the steps

                The game was then started but was o n l y a X f e w minutes old when a Police

««•*            Inspector          ran on to the pitch a n d jjf e w   the referees attention to

                people spilling onto the pitcj^from the Leppings Ln end of the ground.

                I then looked towards j f e ns 1 -- 7 and saw that hundreds of fans were

                climbing over the frence and on              to pitch.

                I initially thAo^ht that the people climbing the fence were the worse

                for ware from drinking as some               just walked onto the pitch and

                collapsed.           I could also see people being pulled up from         the rear of

                the Leppings Ln end and into the West S t a n d .

                It was at this point that             I realised that something was terribly

                wrong,       so I went to H Door where                   was to see if he.knew exactly

                what was happening however he was unaware of anvthir                   wrong.    We stood

                there for about half an hour when my boss                              came up to us

                and said,          "It looks as if the match is going W o        be abandoned,   so open

                the gates."           By this time I could see that ambulances and fire engines

                had arrived at the ground.               I could also see that swarms of people

                were leaving the ground some through our door.                   I could hear some of

                “them talking and the general              comments were that     if this is football,

                I d o n ’t want to come no more."

                At this time I was still unaware of exactly what was going on.

                I remained at my post until about .4.30 pm (1630). when I made my way

                out of the ground together with

                Whilst                 stayed on the door just         pr/or to leaving the ground I

                could see about           15 ~ 20 bodies lying y h the ground near to a fence,           in

                Leppinqs Ln.           I assumed they were dread because their faces were

                covered with coats and blankets.                There were also people who were

                injured waiting for ambulances.

                We then made our way home,

                At no time did I hear the tannoy g/ving out the emergency coded

          I would like to say that whilst      I was at J tf\e   Door H I saw a lot of

          people run past me in the direction j g f Leppings Ln and a lot of them

         appeared to have been drinking a*r they were staggering a r o u n d .         Some

         of them even had to be hel pedralong by the i r f r ie n d s .

         A couple of dozen of themyrame to me to ask directions and could also

         smell al coho 1 on thei r ^breath,

         In my opinion,    I thijpi crowd control at Hillsborough which has been

         arranged by Chief Superintendent MOLE for the pa^n, five years without

         any problems and feel     that g iving control     o p /th e   game to a lesser

         experienced man a week before such a big/match was totally wrong a nd

         in my opinion this contributed to t^he/^di s a s t e r .

         I was shown a map of Hillsborough football          ground by

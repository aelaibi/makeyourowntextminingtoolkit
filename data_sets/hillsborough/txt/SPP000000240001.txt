Dear

re:         The Hillsborough Scrutiny
Thank you for your letter and its enclosures, which I have looked at. Hopefully, your
involvement with this whole sad saga is now drawing to a close. If I can help further, please
do let me know.

In the meantime, my best wishes to you and your family for Christmas and the New Year.

Yours sincerely,
WV -*>1 U   o t-

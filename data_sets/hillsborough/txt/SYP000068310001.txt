T he y were       there       for    some     time until       after         1 prn (1300)      when       they were

mo v e d o n by P o 1 i c e „

The y were        no trouble          apart      from shouting          and        laughing and           joking       with

each other,

I did n o t see w h e r e t h e y had b o u g h t t h e c i d e r f o rrn.

N ext    thing        I saw was about            1.13pm      (1313),         when    I saw a large              group of

s u pporters          had g a t h e r e d    on the    f o recourt      of the         ’P A R K ’ public          house



I had seen .them w a l k i n g               down Wads ley Ln from d i r e c t i o n of Wadsley.

F u r t h e r along W a d s l e y Ln,          in the     d i r ec t i o n    from w hich the             fans were

walking,         is an off          licence w hich w o u l d n o r m a l l y           have been          open at         thin

 time.

I know from            customers          of mine     that    in fact         the    off    licence was            open.

The     ’P A R K ’ pub was          not     open and had been           closed all morning.

About     100 s u pporters            had     c o n g r e g a t e d on the     pub forec/urt              at    this      time

I saw that a lot of                  them were        drinking       from      cider       pottles        and wine

bottles.

T he y were       there       until       about £pm      ( "i4 0 0 ) w h e n t h e p o 1 i c e c.a m a/ a n d m o v t

them     on because           by now they had been d r i nking                      c o n t i n u o u s l y and    they
                                                                                                  -/

were     shouting            and     swearing            l or dly.            Their       language          was        atrocious.

There       was     only a         few     drinking            from          cans       but    I did      see         a great        lot      of

the     supporters             having        to    fa© h e l d          up    by    their        friends          because        they         we

There       was    a     lot    of    shouting            from a             lot    of    these        supporters             and      also

loud     chanting.

After       2.30prn         <1430)        W a d s ley L n       cleared             a    great       deal        of    supporters.

All     morning          there       had     been        officers             on    f oot      in the       area        but    by      1pm

<1300)       the       number        of    police         in the             area       had    built      up      considerably.

C o n t r o 1 very          good     indeed        ro u n d     thi s a r aa ,

On    the    day       of    the     semi-final            the          police          again      were     very        good     and

t hey    wera      really          m a r v e 1 1 ous      i n mo v i ng            crowds        on a n d        pr o t e c t i ng     t he

I c a n ’t say a b o u t             nearer        the     ground,             as       I didn't         see      that      area.

I would          j ust      like     to    say     that        after          last       years       match        there       wa s     a   lot

of    trouble          with     supporters               in our          area,          running       about           and   stealing           a

being       a general           nuisance.

Apart       from       tha t    the       situation            at       last       years       match       in     relation           to    fan

behaviour          and       police        action         was       the       same       as    this     years          match.

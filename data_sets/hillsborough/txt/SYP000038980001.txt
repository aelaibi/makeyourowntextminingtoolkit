       up of supporters outside of the gates.


Kb)    He failed to control the movement of supporters
       subsequent to the opening of Gate ’C ’.


1(c)   He failed to respond to the developing tragedy and was
       slow to effect a rescue operation.




2(a)   That he failed to control and filter fans away from the
       immediate vicinity of the turnstiles even after 1417
       hours, when it was obvious he had lost control of the
       turnstile area.   In any event he should have acted by
       1430 hours at the latest.


2(b)   He gave no actual order to restrict the approach of those

       entering Leppings Lane.




3(a)   That he failed to prevent a build up of Liverpool
       supporters at the turnstiles in Leppings Lane by
       inadequate policing arrangements.


3(b)   He should not have requested Chief Superintendent
       DUCKENFIELD to open the gates under any circumstances and
       thereby giving unlimited and uncontrolled access into the
       football ground by supporters.




                                                                   5
                FOREWORD




 This report is submitted in the normal and accepted

 complaint format.       However, some explanation is

 required to assist the reader in identifying where to

 find certain statements and documents.




 In the margin of the report it will be seen that

Document numbers, Statement pages, Appendices and on

occasions Lord Justice Taylor's interim and final

report are referred to as well as to extracts from the

transcripts of his Public Inquiry.




Where a document number or statement is prefixed with a

part number this can be found within the seven volumes

(parts) of evidence submitted to the Director of Public

Prosecutions.




eg:        PART IV            or          PART IV

           Document No 6                  Statement

           Pages 44-52                    Pages 2331-2356




If a document number or statement is not prefixed with

a part number that particular item can be found within

this file.




Where reference is made to a video then each VHS tape

has been given a separate, Part III, document number.

Not only that but within the same Part III is a written

description/schedule of what the video contains.        For

example;
                    Part III (Documents)

                    Document No 115

                    (Video)

                    Pages 757




 identifies the VHS tape number as 115 and the schedule

page in the documents where the description can be

found.




A similar system is used to identify photographs which

also feature in Part III.     For example;




                   Part III (Documents)

                   Document No 150

                   Photo No 14




This easily identifies that this photograph can be

found in the Album marked Document Number 150 and

within each album the photographs are numbered

consecutively.




A reference to one of Lord Justice Taylor's reports

will be shown as follows;




                   LJT (interim) or (final)

                   Page

                   Paragraph
A reference to a transcript from the Public Inquiry

will be shown as follows;

CHIEF CONSTABLE

CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING COMPLAINTS



R1    On 15 April 1989 a Football Association Cup Semi

Final match was played between Liverpool and Nottingham

Forest Football Clubs at the neutral Sheffield

Wednesday ground at Hillsborough.   It is well

documented that shortly after 'kick-off* the match was

abandoned due to crushing in pens 3 and 4 of the

Leppings Lane/West Stand terraces, which resulted in

the death of 95 Liverpool Supporters and injuries to

many others.




R2    As a result of the tragedy Mr G J DEAR, QPM,

Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police was

appointed to investigate the disaster and to collate

evidence for H M Coroner and for a Judicial Inquiry

which was carried out by Lord Justice TAYLOR.     On 27

September 1989 following submission of the TAYLOR

Interim Report into the disaster to the Director of

Public Prosecutions Mr DEAR agreed to accept additional

responsibility for the criminal and disciplinary

aspects of the investigation.   On 1 April 1990, with

the retirement of Mr DEAR, these responsibilities were

transferred to Mr L SHARP, QPM, Chief Constable of

Cumbria.




R3    Trevor HICKS was the father of Sara Louise HICKS

(19 years - deceased) and Victoria Jane HICKS (15 years

- deceased) and attended the match with his wife

Jennifer HICKS and the two daughters.   Whilst he went
                   and stood on the West Terraces forming pens 1 and 2 and

                   his wife went to a seat in the North Stand, both girls

                   went into pen 3.   Hr HICKS makes a series of

                   complaints which relate to the lack of planning,

                   control and management of Liverpool supporters both

                   outside and inside the ground prior to and during the

                   match as well as to the organisation of the rescue

                   operation after it was abandoned.   These complaints by

                   Hr HICKS are against Superintendent HARSHALL and other

                   officers.




                  R4     Richard JONES (25 years - deceased) was the son

Part IV            of the complainant Hr Leslie JONES and attended the

Statement Pages   match with his sister Stephanie JONES and his

2368-2377         girlfriend Tracey COX.   Arising from his son’s death Hr

                  JONES makes complaints against Superintendent HARSHALL

                  relating to the lack of control and filtering of

                  Liverpool supporters and the failure to give orders to

                  restrict fans approaching the Leppings Lane turnstiles.




                  R5    John HcBRIEN (18 years - deceased)      attended the

Part IV           match and was the son of Joan HcBRIEN who has made

Statement Pages   complaints against Superintendent HARSHALL.     These

2432A-R           complaints relate to the failure to prevent a build up

                  of Liverpool supporters at the Leppings Lane turnstiles

                  and Superintendent MARSHALL’S request to Chief

                  Superintendent DUCKENFIELD to open the "Gates" giving

                  unlimited and uncontrolled access into the ground.
              DETAILS OF COMPT.ATWTS



              R6    Dealing with the complaints by Mr HICKS involving

              Superintendent MARSHALL, on 7 June 1989 Mr HICKS sent a

Document 1    letter to the Home Secretary Douglas HURD complaining

Pages 1-2     about another senior officer of the South Yorkshire

              Police.    The complaint was initially allocated to Mr

             Kenneth Philip Douglas COOPER, Assistant Chief

             Constable Northamptonshire Constabulary for

Document 2   investigation by letter dated 25 July 1989, with the

Page 3       Police Complaints Authority being formally requested to

Document 3    supervise the investigation in a further letter the

Page 4       same day.




             R7     On 4 August 1989 Mr SKITT, Deputy Chief

             Constable, Northamptonshire Constabulary agreed to the

             appointment of Mr COOPER as the Senior Investigating

             Officer on behalf of his Chief Constable.    This

Document 4   appointment was later ratified in a letter dated 4

Page 5       August 1989 from Captain TAYLOR of the Police

             Complaints Authority in which he confirms his

             supervision on behalf of the Authority to Mr HICKS.




             R8    Following his appointment, Mr COOPER saw Mr HICKS

             on 24 August and he made a formal statement of

             complaint outlining a series of new complaints against

             a number of officers including Superintendent MARSHALL




             R9    Subsequent to this interview Mr COOPER received a

Document 5   letter dated 5 September 1989 from Captain TAYLOR

Page 6       informing him that, the enquiry would be dealt with by

                                                                       1 1
                 another force.   On 27 September following protracted

                negotiations, responsibility for all criminal and

                disciplinary aspects of the investigation into the

                Hillsborough disaster, including the earlier complaints

                by Mr HICKS were passed to Mr DEAR for enquiries by

                West Midlands Police.




Document 6      RIO   On 19 October 1989 Mr JONES sent a letter to the

Pages 7-8       South Yorkshire Police Authority enclosing a schedule

                of specific complaints against individually named

                officers including Superintendent MARSHALL.     This was

                forwarded by Assistant Chief Constable Mr ANDERSON,

                South Yorkshire Police, on 23 October, together with a

Document 7      separate letter to Mr JONES, Assistant Chief Constable,

Page 9          West Midlands Police requesting Mr DEAR to undertake

                the investigation and indicating that Captain TAYLOR

                would supervise on behalf of the Authority.     This was

Documents 8-9   confirmed by letters from Captain TAYLOR on 25 October

Pages 10-11     and on 27 October Assistant Chief Constable Mr JONES

                accepted the investigation on behalf of Mr DEAR.




                Rll   As a result of receipt of the letter/schedule

                from Mr JONES, he was seen by Detective Chief

                Superintendent Michael Jon FOSTER on 2 November 1989,

                in company with his solicitor and he then made a formal

                statement of complaint.




                R12   Regarding the complaint by Mrs McBRIEN, on 7

Document 10     November 1989 she sent a letter to Mr DEAR (one of a

Pages 12-26     number of letters received from this lady who is
                  understandably still very distressed and having

                  difficulty coming to terms with the death of her son).

                  The letter was couched in such a way that it could be

                  regarded as a complaint against South Yorkshire Police,

                  consequently it was decided to obtain clarification.




                  R13   On 6 December 1989 Mrs McBRIEN was interviewed at

                  her home by Detective Superintendent TAYLOR and she

                  then confirmed her intention to complain.     She made a

                  formal statement of complaint against Superintendent

                  MARSHALL and another officer.



Documents 11-12   R14   Correspondence concerning the acceptance of that

Pages 27-28       investigation by Mr DEAR and from the Police Complaints

                  Authority confirming supervision by Captain TAYLOR are

                  produced.




Documents 13-14   R15   Letters dated 13 December 1989 and 24 January

Pages 29-30       1990 have since been received from Mrs McBRIEN

      31-32       concerning her complaint and enclosing respectively a

Document 15       newspaper cutting and a more detailed account of events

Page 33           as she saw them on 15 April 1989.     She considers these

Part IV           add to or clarify the details of her complaint.

Statement Pages

2432F-0           R16   These complaints raise allegations of both

                  criminal and disciplinary offences.    The file on the

                  criminal aspect of the investigation is already with

                  the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Police

                  Complaints Authority.   This report deals solely with

                  the disciplinary aspects.
•
    R17   The complaints made against Superintendent

    Roger MARSHALL can be dealt with in three

    categories   and relate to his duty and action;




           (a)    Outside Leppings Lane and the control

                 of the crowd.




          (b)    The opening of the gates and




                 the control of supporters subsequent to

                 the opening of Gate C and




          (c)    His response to the disaster and the

                 action he took at the time.




    R18   It is necessary therefore to permutate the

    specific allegations made by the complainants and

    deal with them in a chronological way as opposed to

    complainant by complainant.




    R19   The specific allegations made are now dealt

    with as described.




    (A)   OUTSIDE LEPPINGS T.ATTR




    1.    Failed to prevent a dangerous build up of

          supporters outside of the gates.

Part IV                   This specific complaint is made by Mr HICKS

Statement Pages          who can have no personal eyewitness knowledge

2331-2356                 of what occurred outside Leppings Lane

                          turnstiles other than at about 2 pm when he

                          entered the ground and the scene was calm.

                         Thus the evidence to consider centres mainly

Part IV                  on many of the statements from supporters who

Statement Pages          actually found themselves in the build up and

1731-1741                eventually the crush outside the turnstiles.

1742-1750                He has levelled the same complaint against

1751-1757                other officers, including Chief

1758-1763                Superintendent DUCKENFIELD and Superintendent

                         MURRAY as well as Superintendent GREENWOOD.




Part IV           2.     A similar complaint is made by Mr JONES.

Statement Pages          but is more specific in its wording and   that

2368-2377                iS:-




                  (i)    Superintendent MARSHALL failed to control and

                         filter fans away from the immediate vicinity

                         of the turnstiles even after 1417 hours, when

                         it was obvious he had lost control of the

                         turnstile area.   In any event he should have

                         acted by 1430 hours at the latest.




                  (ii)   He gave no actual order to restrict the

                         approach of those fans, or after 1430 hours

                         to actually stop the fans entering Leppings

                         Lane.




                                                                          15
      Mr JONES was not present at the disaster but

      lost his son.




3.    Mrs McBRIEN reinforces these complaints,

      specifically alleging the following:-




      Superintendent MARSHALL failed to prevent a

      build up of Liverpool supporters at the

      turnstiles in Leppings Lane by inadequate

      policing arrangements.




      Mrs McBRIEN was not present at the disaster

      but lost her son.




R20   In relation to Superintendent MARSHALL and

his particular duty outside the Hillsborough

Stadium it is felt the ingredients of the

complaints made by Mr HICKS, Mr JONES and Mrs

McBRIEN are sufficiently linked to consider this as

one disciplinary offence namelyj-




      NEGLECT OF DUTY




      Without good and sufficient cause he

      neglected or omitted to attend to or carry

      out with due promptitude and diligence




                                                     16
                           anything which it was his duty as a member of

                           a police force to attend to or carry out,

                          viz, he failed to control the build up of

                           supporters outside Leppings Lane gates at

                          Hillsborough Stadium on 15 April 1989.




                          Contrary to Police (Discipline) Regulations

                          1985 Schedule 1. Regulation 4 (i). Paragraph

                          4 a




                    R21   In consideration of this disciplinary aspect

                    account must be taken of the methods employed by

                    South Yorkshire Police, Chief Superintendent MOLE

                    and latterly Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD, in

                    organising the event.

Part V

Statement Pages     R22   Chief Superintendent DtlCKENFTKI.n in his

2457-2469           Operation Order for 1989 had ensured that the

Document 194        reduction in manpower did not affect the Leppings

Pages 1128-1210     Lane turnstile area and 53 police officers were

                    deployed there.



Part IV             R23   He had also taken steps to encourage the

Documents 185-186   supporters to arrive at the ground early.   Some

Pages 929-931       turns.tiles were open from 1130 hours and all were

                    open by 12 noon.
•
                      R24   Although supporters arrived in considerable

                      numbers by the time the turnstiles were opened,

                      many of them started to gather on or around the

                      bridge over the River Don in Leppings Lane.      There

                      was a noticeable reluctance on the part of many

                      fans to enter the ground.




                      R25   Police officers made random checks to locate

                      non ticket holders and others carried out searches

                      both inside and outside the ground to prevent

                      crimes and breaches of the ground rules.



    Part V            R26   Superintendent MARSHALL in his statement

    Statement Pages   provides information as to his duty on the day and

    2527-2547         he graphically describes his actions in a run up to

                      the large gathering of the crowd.   It is important

                      to be reminded that at the corresponding fixture in

                      1988 Superintendent MARSHALL was inside the ground

                      and Superintendent GREENWOOD outside.




                      R27   In 1988 there had been three special trains

                      from Liverpool to Sheffield and the passengers on

                      those trains had been met by police and either

                      bused to the stadium or escorted in crocodile

                      fashion along Leppings Lane to the turnstiles.




                                                                               18
R28   In 1989 there was only one special train from

Liverpool, it arrived by 1400 hours and the 350 or

so Liverpool supporters who had travelled on it

were met by police, escorted in crocodile fashion

down Leppings Lane and gained access to the ground

easily and safely by 1420 hours.   The escorting

officers were then deployed on other duties in

accordance with the Operation Order.   The

increasing crowd which followed them came along

Leppings Lane unescorted and although police

officers mounted and on foot were deployed to keep

them on the pavements, the numbers were such that

the crowd overspilled onto the roadway.




R29   Because of this at 1417 Superintendent

MARSHALL requested on his radio for motorised

traffic to be stopped from entering Leppings Lane.

This was done, albeit not quickly, and only after

further efforts by Superintendent MARSHALL.




R30   There is an argument which runs to the effect

that traffic flow is one way of keeping crowds

confined to a pavement or similar controllable safe

space, but in the circumstances prevailing at the

time I have no doubt that the request and the

decision were correct.
                     R31   It is clear now that Superintendent MARSHALL

                     had recognised a considerable crowd build up and

                     had started to respond to the situation.




                     R32   Later he made further positive

Part V               decisions which involved Police Constable BUXTON

Statement Pages      arriving in the Land Rover and using the loud

2830-2835            speaker to appeal to the supporters immediately

                     outside the turnstiles.




                     R33   It is the final build up sometime from

                     2.30 pm onwards that needs closer examination and

                     the methods of crowd control relative to that.




                     R34   A matter that has featured in the statements

                     of supporters who attended the same match in 1988

                     concerns the queuing to the turnstiles.    Two

                     aspects are relevant to this in 1989.



Part III             R35   Firstly, a comparison of the crowd build

Document 143a        up on video between 2 pm and 3 pm for both years

Schedule Page 803a   shows a considerable difference in the numbers of

                     supporters making their way to the ground.    In 1989

                     the crowd build up is greater in number and clearly

                     visible.




                                                                             4 b
                                                                  2C
                     R36     Secondly, directly related to that is the

                     different method used to allow supporters into the

                     area between the outer iron perimeter gates and the

Part III             turnstile entrance.    Again the 1988 and 1989 video

Document No 143a     be used as a reference.    In 1988 it does appear

Schedule Page 803a   that only one of the three double iron perimeter

                     gates was fully open giving access to turnstiles A

                     to G.    The 1989 video shows all three gates open,

                     thus giving the approaching crowds more access to a

                     restricted funnel area at the turnstile entrance.




                     R37     The effect in 1988 may have produced a far

                     better filter effect because the open iron

                     perimeter gate gave direct access to those

                     turnstiles. The problem in 1989 was that supporters

                     effectively had to negotiate the waist high barrier

                     running from the end of the A to G turnstile block

                     out towards the iron perimeter gates.



Part VII             R38     There is no particular police plan for this

Appendix C           and the interview with Superintendent MARSHALL

Pages 617-619        covers this point.




                     R39     It is correct that in normal league games all

                     of these iron perimeter gates would be open to give

                     not only access to the West Stand through




                                                                             22
                   turnstiles A to G but also to allow supporters to

                   walk down alongside the River Don to the South

 Part II           Stand turnstiles numbered 19 to 22 and 23 to 28 on

 Document 107      the plan.

 Page 738




                  R40    In conclusion there is every likelihood that

                  the system in 1988 with less of a crowd build up

                  made many supporters believe there was a better

                  queuing system in operation.




                  R41   Whether the same system, if employed in 1989,

                  would have assisted in control of the crowd is

                  speculation only but the point must be considered.




                  R42   The question of crowd control is the main

                  issue for this specific disciplinary offence and

                  the following are matters relevant to

                  Superintendent MARSHALL’S ability to recognise the

                  problem, act upon it and effectively deal with it.

Part V

Statement Pages   R43   In his statement and in his interview

2527-2547         Superintendent MARSHALL details the officers under

Part VII          his command.   Importantly he also takes full

Appendix C        responsibility for the control of those police

                                                                       2.1
Part IV           officers outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles who,

Document 194      according to the match operational order are

Pages 1128-1210   under Superintendent GREENWOOD’S control.




                  R44   Examination of the match order and the

                  postings of the officers effectively shows that

                  with the addition of the mounted officers and

                  Superintendent GREENWOOD’S turnstile serials Mr

                  MARSHALL had available in the Leppings Lane area

                  approximately 100 police officers.    Many of those

                  posted to Leppings Lane were positioned static at

                  the road junctions to control the flow of

                  supporters along prescribed

                  routes.




                  R45   Quite simply based upon a crowd build up that

                  reached several thousand people the

                  police officers, and Mr MARSHALL especially, were

                  reliant upon a degree of co-operation from them.

                  Indeed, with a total crowd that day of over 50,000

                  people the fact is that even with in excess of 1000

                  police officers on duty there is an onus on the

                  crowd to co-operate and invariably the vast

                  majority always will.




                                                                        23
•
                      R46    Given normal circumstances it should have

                      been possible to effectively control the supporters

                      in Leppings Lane using the same number of police

                      officers as in 1988.      The fact is control was not

                      effective on 15 April 1989 due to a combination of

                      factors partly linked to the resources available to

                      Superintendent MARSHALL.




    Part VII          R47   Mr MARSHALL in his interview deals with

    Appendix C        this aspect and gives his answer that faced that

    Pages 643-651     day with that crowd he could not control, or regain

                      control even using the other resources both

                      deployed or held in reserve.




                      R48   The other factors linked to the resource

                      issue are;

Part VI           R49   The effect of alcoholic drink on some of the
Statement Pages
1291-1292         supporters must be considered because it is a
1293-1294
1295-1298         factor important in the eyes of each of the groups
1299-1301
1302-1304         just mentioned.     In an effort to understand the
1305-1306
1307-1315         extent of this problem consideration must be given
1316-1324
1325-1329         to the evidence provided by licensees, bar staff
1330-1339
1340-1344         and the owners or sales staff of various stores

                  that were selling intoxicants on the day.




                  R50   The variety in descriptions of drunkenness

                  does little to prove the extent of the problem.

                  That some supporters were drunk, that some were

                  affected by drink is a certainty, but how much this

                  affected the ability of the police and

                  Superintendent MARSHALL in particular, to control

                  the crowd is impossible to assess.




                                                                       25

 Pages 991-997           statement breaks down the blood alcohol content of

 Statement Pages         each deceased. Of the 95 that died, 23 entered

 2433-2456               through Gate C after 2.52 pm and of those it could

Document 16             be said a significant proportion had higher alcohol

Page 34                 levels than those who apparently entered other than

                        through Gate C.     If it is right to say that, it may

                        suggest that a higher proportion of supporters who

                        were later arriving were those who had been

                        drinking either in local hostelries or from cans

                        purchased locally or brought en route from home.

                        This assumption is tentative and may be flawed by

                        lack of good evidence but it has to be said and

                        considered when addressing the ability of

                        Superintendent MARSHALL to police a crowd that may

Lord Justice Taylor’s   have contained a nucleus, who, because of drink,

Final Report            failed to co-operate and respond. Lord Justice

Paragraph 250           TAYLOR in his final report makes this very point.



Part V                  TICKET HOLDERS

Document 194

Page 1112               R52    A method was adopted to deal with this

Part V                  possibility and of course the problem is not

Statement Page 2472     unknown to police officers dealing with football

Part VII                semi finals.     Superintendent MURRAY in his

Appendix C              statement and interview explains the method

Pages 948-953           adopted.   There is contained in the
Part IV            main file evidence of a fair number of supporters
Statement Pages
1559-1566          milling around looking to buy "spares".   The
1567-1575
1576-1579          ability of the police to deal effectively with such
1580-1586
1587-1590          individuals proves a difficult task and the
Part VII
Appendix C         interview with Superintendent MARSHALL provides
Pages
588-600           his account and views.



Part I            R53     Alongside this it is important to consider

Statement Pages   the ways and methods used by non-ticket holders to

369-373           gain entry to a ground and some turnstile operators

473-480           at Hillsborough provide that evidence.




                  R54     The result is that crowd control is affected

                  by the insistence of some supporters to travel

                  without tickets, join those that have tickets and

                  generally cause disruption to the flow of the

                  turnstiles.




                  R55     The problem again is assessing exactly the

                  extent of this problem on 15 April 1989 at Leppings

                  Lane.   It is impossible to give precise details and

                  numbers of supporters in this category but it is a

                  feature for further consideration in Superintendent

                  MARSHALL’S ability to control the crowd with the

                  resources available to him.




                                                                       27
                   THE MATCH TICKETS




                  R56   That there was a problem with the

Part II           identification of the match tickets and the correct

Statement Pages   entry point is clear and the evidence of that has

921-935           been dealt with in the main file.




                  R57   Once more the extent to which it had an

                  adverse affect on the crowd control is difficult to

                  assess but it becomes one more additional factor,

                  coupled with those previously stated, to consider

                  in the overall control of the crowd and the ability

                  of the supporters to move about to find the right

                  turnstile entrance,




                  R58   Each of these factors identified must,

                  therefore, be considered not only in isolation but

                  in conjunction with each other.   Add to this the

                  positive acts taken by Superintendent MARSHALL once

                  he recognised his problem and it becomes necessary

                  to decide if there was anything more he could have

                  done to prevent the crushing which happened outside

                  the turnstiles and resulted eventually in the

                  opening of the gates and Gate C in particular.




                                                                       28
•
                      R59   Further resources were sent by the football

                      control room inside the stadium and in particular a

                      number of police horses went to Leppings Lane and

    Part V            attempted to assist in the crowd control.     This is

    Statement Pages   highlighted in   the evidence of Inspector

    2836-2842         HAND-DAVIS.




                      R60   The sending of some fifty police officers to

                      assist at Gate A was a decision taken in the

                      control room at the ground but it was not likely to

                      assist the control outside.    The reason, of course,

                      being that those additional police officers were

                      coming from inside the ground and were limited to

                      policing the area between turnstiles 1 to 8 and the

                      seated North Stand.




                      R61   Although the police horses were able to come

                      and assist, they had to be re-deployed from other

                      duty and by the time the control was lost    it is

                      doubtful if the addition of any   number of foot

                      officers would have had any effect.    In any event

                      it would have required moving officers already

                      posted to other duties and that, of course, would

                      have reduced the policing of other sections of the

                      crowd which could not be neglected and could have

                      caused additional safety problems.




                                                                              29
•
    R62    If Superintendent MARSHALL is to be

    considered responsible for failing to control the

    crowd then the points previously raised form the

    basis of the problems he faced.




    R63    It is clear he recognised a problem as early

    as 1417 hours but it is equally clear that he had

    no immediate cause to believe the problems would

    become unpoliceable at that early stage.

    Specifically the complaint by Mr JONES refers to

    this time of 1417 hours and he alleges




          "it was obvious he had lost control

          of the turnstile area."




    R64   Mr JONES then clarifies the complaint by

    saying that Superintendent MARSHALL;




          "In any event should have acted by

          1430 hours."




    which was the time when the traffic was eventually

    stopped.




    R65   The crux of this is that according to Mr

    JONES, Superintendent MARSHALL should have filtered




                                                         30
•
                             fans away from the immediate vicinity of the

    Lord Justice Taylor *s   turnstiles between these two times.   He no doubt

    Interim Report           takes these times of 1417 and 1430 from the Taylor

    Paragraph 62             interim report.




                             R66   The fact is it is not proved he had lost

                             control at these times and there is nothing

                             evidentially to point to the fact Superintendent

                             MARSHALL should have done more there and then.




                             R67   The second element of Mr JONES’ complaint

                             relates to Superintendent MARSHALL giving no actual

                             order to restrict the approach of the supporters,

                             or after 1430 hours, to actually stop the fans

                             entering Leppings Lane.




                             R68   It is correct to say this was not done but it

                             is an operational policing matter that requires

                             Superintendent MARSHALL to decide on the action to

                             be taken.   The actions taken have been referred to

                             and it is conjecture as to whether such action as

                             this would have alleviated the situation, even if

                             it'was feasible and that must be very doubtful.




                             R69   By the time the crowd was totally out of

                             control and the requests to open the gates were




                                                                                 31
•
    made, this option referred to by Mr JONES was not

    possible and would not have made the slightest

    difference.   His complaint hinges on crowd control

    but there is nothing to substantiate that

    Superintendent MARSHALL should have done what Mr

    JONES suggests as early as he suggests.




    R70   There is one further important issue when

    considering the loss of control of the crowd.     If

    it is accepted that at 1447 hours when he first

    requested to open the gates, Superintendent

    MARSHALL had lost control, then up until that time

    he may have felt the problem was policeable.

    Hence, it is difficult in hindsight to show at what

    time control was lost outside the turnstiles.




    R71   In addition, and of particular reference to

    crowd behaviour, is the action taken by the police

    once the gates had been opened and just before.

    Although done by the horsemen under the command of

    Inspector HAND-DAVIS, the closure of the iron

    perimeter gates was a positive act to ease the

    crush between the iron perimeter gates and the

    turnstiles.   It is fair to say that although

    Superintendent MARSHALL took no part in this

    positive move he had a vantage point to see it and




                                                      %z
                  if he had disagreed with it could have said so.     He

                  thus gave tacit approval to the action.




                  R72   This is important because had this been

                  successful, and it was for just a few minutes, then

                  there is a chance the police could have regained

                  the control they had lost.




                  R73   Unfortunately, either as a result of a

                  deliberate act by some supporters or sheer pressure

                  from the crowd in Leppings Lane the iron

Part IV           perimeter gate nearest the River Don burst open

Document 190      and the crowd attached itself to those being

Pages 987-990     allowed through Gate C to relieve the crush at

Part III          the turnstiles.   The video which shows this

Document 110      clearly pictures the crowd flow and the loss of

Statement Pages   police control.   There is the possibility that the

742-747           crowd in Leppings Lane which was growing and

                  getting impatient as kick off time approached

                  looked for any avenue to gain admission.   Those

                  supporters at the iron perimeter gate nearest the

                  River Don had an excellent view of the movement

                  through Gate C compared to the other supporters

                  spread along Leppings Lane.   It may be coincidence

                  that this was the gate which was forced open but

                  equally it is likely a deliberate act was made to




                                                                        33
gain early entrance.    Once that happened the police

and Superintendent MARSHALL had no way of regaining

control of the crowd.




R74   Mrs McBRIEN is also a little more specific

because she uses the phrase;




      "inadequate policing arrangements"




in her part of the complaint against Superintendent

MARSHALL and his failure to prevent a build up of

Liverpool supporters.   This has been dealt with in

the preceding paragraphs when referring to the

resource issue.




R75   Mr HICKS does not attempt to clarify his

allegation on this aspect.




R76   These particular allegations made by Mr

HICKS, Mr JONES and Mrs McBRIEN, form part of the

evidence submitted to the Director of Public

Prosecutions who is considering criminal offences

against Superintendent MARSHALL of Manslaughter and

Culpable Malfeasance.
•
                       R77     The evidence required to consider

                       Manslaughter requires a high degree of gross

                       negligence or recklessness and there is no

                       comparable discipline offence to consider.




                       R78     However, the offence of Culpable Malfeasance

                       is an alternative offence to Manslaughter, and

                       although it is based upon the same evidence, it

                       requires a lesser degree of negligence or

                       recklessness and embraces neglect of a duty.




                      R79      Should the Director of Public Prosecutions

                      decide there is insufficient evidence to prove

                      offences of Manslaughter or Culpable Malfeasance,

                      no further action can be taken in respect of this

                      disciplinary offence of Neglect of Duty.




                       (B )   THE OPENING OF THE GATES AND THE CONTROL OF

                              SUPPORTERS SUBSEQUENT TO THE OPENING OF

                              GATE C




    Part IV           R80     Mrs Joan McBRIEN makes the following

    Statement Pages   allegation against Superintendent MARSHALL

    2432 A-R

                              He should not have requested Chief

                              Superintendent DUCKENFIELD to open the gates




                                                                            35
                         under any circumstances and thereby giving

                         unlimited and uncontrolled access into the

                         football ground by supporters.




                  R81    She makes a similar complaint against Chief

                   Superintendent DUCKENFIELD, albeit directed at him

                  actually giving the order to open the gates based

                  upon the request from Mr MARSHALL.




                  R82   The complaint made by Mrs McBRIEN, although

                  aimed at the decision to request the opening of

                  the gate, also covers the subsequent unlimited and

                  uncontrolled access into the football ground by

                  supporters.




Part IV           R83   It is this situation that gives rise to the

Statement Pages   second complaint by Mr HICKS where he alleges

2331-2356

                        Failed to control the movement of supporters

                        subsequent to the opening of gate ’C ’.




                  R84   It is evident, therefore, that these two

                  complaints form the basis for further consideration

                  of a disciplinary offence of:-




                                                                        36
      NEGLECT OF DOTY



      Without good and sufficient cause he

      neglected or omitted to attend to or carry

      out with due promptitude and diligence

      anything which it was his duty as a member of

      a police force to attend to or carry out,

      viz, he failed to control the movement of

      supporters subsequent to the opening of the

      gates and gate C in particular at

      Hillsborough on 15 April 1989.




      Contrary to Police (Discipline) Regulations

      1985 Schedule 1. Regulation 4 (1). Paragraph

      4 a.




R85   In consideration of this complaint account

must be taken of the part played by Chief

Superintendent DUCKENFIELD and to that extent the

file in respect of that officer dealing with this

from his point of view should be read in

conjunction with this.




R86   Beginning with the element of the complaint

made by Mrs McBRIEN concerning the initial request

to open the gates it is difficult to see how this




                                                   37
                        complaint gives rise to any specific disciplinary

                        offence.   In logic it cannot be said that the gates

                        should not be opened under any circumstances.

                        Without entering the realms of fantasy it is

                        possible to envisage many circumstances which would

                        justify the opening of a gate or gates, and on 15

                        April 1989, such was the build up of circumstances

                        at the Leppings Lane turnstiles that Superintendent

                        MARSHALL had no alternative but to request Chief

                        Superintendent DUCKENFIELD to open the gates.     The

                        late and uneven flow of Liverpool supporters at the

                        inadequate number of unsatisfactory constructed

                        turnstiles, aggravated by a substantial minority of

                        fans who had drunk too much, many of them without

                        tickets, led, among other things, to a loss of

                        police control at Leppings Lane.   Whether or not

                        these circumstances, or some of them, should have

                        been avoided or prevented, is discussed elsewhere

                        in this report, but the fact remains, given the

                        circumstances prevailing at the time that in

Lord Justice Taylor’s   respect of the opening of Gate C; "Superintendent

Interim Report          MARSHALL was right at that stage to ask for it and

Paragraph 228           Mr DUCKENFIELD was right to agree."




                        R87   The request to open the gates was a positive

                        decision made by Superintendent MARSHALL and in
itself cannot amount to a neglect of duty.     It

might be argued by Mrs McBRIEN it was a wrong

decision but that does not amount to neglect.




R88   If this is accepted the causation now falls

to be considered as to Superintendent MARSHALL’S

failure to control the movement of supporters

subsequent to the opening of the gates and gate C

in particular.




R89   In considering this again it is important to

recognise the part played by Chief Superintendent

DUCKENFIELD who is in overall command and who

actually grants the request.




R90   Superintendent MARSHALL has responsibility

for policing outside the ground, which means

outside the iron perimeter gates, although by

consent he accepts the policing outside the

turnstiles.   He has no control inside the ground,

that is in the hands of Chief Superintendent

DUCKENFIELD and Superintendent GREENWOOD.




R91   He cannot, therefore, supervise or make

positive decisions or policing arrangements inside
the ground.   Certainly he could suggest things to

thbse inside but physically he cannot act.




R92   Superintendent MARSHALL was faced with a life

or death situation both in his view and in the view

of some of the supporters who were in that crush

outside the turnstiles.    He had knowledge of the

inside of the ground, he had considerable

experience and he should have been thinking ahead,

but the question really is could he have foreseen

the death of 95 people in those pens as a direct

result of his actions.    It seems inexplicable to

believe he could have thought that far ahead,

especially based upon the way in which the South

Yorkshire Police view crowd monitoring and

distribution with their "find their own level"

policing policy.




R93   At the moment he first requested the opening

of the gates Mr MARSHALL was under severe pressure

and he had the back up of knowing his request was

being considered by equally experienced senior

police officers inside the ground.   He would have

to, rely upon them and was entitled to rely upon

them to address the policing arrangements if his

request was granted.




                                                     40
R94   This allegation made by Mrs McBRIEN and Mr

HICKS forms part of the evidence submitted to the

Director of Public Prosecutions who is considering

criminal offences against Superintendent MARSHALL

of Manslaughter and Culpable Malfeasance.




R95   The evidence required to consider

Manslaughter requires a high degree of gross

negligence or recklessness and there is no

comparable discipline offence to consider.




R96   However, the offence of Culpable Malfeasance

is, an alternative offence to Manslaughter, and

although it is based upon the same evidence, it

requires a lesser degree of negligence or

recklessness and embraces neglect of a duty.




R97   Should the Director of Public Prosecutions

decide there is insufficient evidence to prove

offences of Manslaughter or Culpable Malfeasance,

no further action can be taken in respect of this

disciplinary offence of Neglect of Duty.




(C)   HIS RESPONSE TO THE DISASTER AND THE

      ACTION HE TOOK
Part IV           R98    Only Mr HICKS makes this complaint against

Statement Pages   Superintendent MARSHALL and he alleges

2331-2356

                         Failed to respond to the developing tragedy

                         and was slow to effect a rescue operation.




                  R99    The substance of this allegation raises the

                  possibility of a further disciplinary offence of:-




                         NEGLECT OF DUTY




                         Without good and sufficient cause he

                         neglected or omitted to attend to or carry

                         out with due promptitude and diligence

                         anything which it was his duty as a member of

                         a police force to attend to or carry out,

                         viz, failed to respond to the developing

                         tragedy and was slow to effect a rescue

                         operation.




                         Contrary to Police (Discipline) Regulations

                         1985 Schedule 1. Regulation 4 (i). Paragraph

                         4 a.




                  R100   This complaint made by Mr HICKS is also

                  directed at Assistant Chief Constable, Mr JACKSON,
                 Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD, Superintendent

                 MURRAY and Superintendent GREENWOOD.




                R101      Within the files relating particularly to Mr

                 JACKSON and Mr DUCKENFIELD is contained the

                 evidence of how the police responded to the

                disaster as an organisation and those aspects must

                be considered alongside the specific acts of

                Superintendent MARSHALL. In effect Mr HICKS had no

                contact with Mr MARSHALL and there is no direct

                evidence by which to assess how Superintendent

                MARSHALL dealt with the disaster.




Part VII        R102   The allegation was put to him in

Appendix C      interview and he makes it clear exactly the role      he

Pages 666-678   played.     Based upon his evidence and explanation   it

                is not possible to pursue the matter further.




                R103   Again this aspect forms part of the evidence

                submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions

                who is considering criminal offences against

                Superintendent MARSHALL of Manslaughter and

                Culpable Malfeasance.
                 R104    The evidence required to consider

                 Manslaughter requires a high degree of gross

                 negligence or recklessness and there is no

                 comparable discipline offence to consider.




                 R105    However, the offence of Culpable Malfeasance

                 is an alternative offence to Manslaughter, and

                 although it is based upon the same evidence, it

                 requires a lesser degree of negligence or

                 recklessness and embraces neglect of a duty.




                R106    Should the Director of Public Prosecutions

                 decide there is insufficient evidence to prove

                 offences of Manslaughter or Culpable Malfeasance,

                no further action can be taken in respect of this

                disciplinary offence of Neglect of Duty.




?art VII        R107    Superintendent MARSHALL was interviewed under

Appendix C      caution for the criminal allegation at Furnival

Pages 543-715   House, Sheffield on 19 June 1990.   He agreed to a

                video and tape recorded interview and copies of

                these are available if required.    Mr MARSHALL

                agreed to use the same interview for the discipline

                aspects.




                                                                     44
                        R108     During the course of the interview he

Part VII                handed a written document over that he wished

Appendix C              to be considered alongside his verbal answers.      The

Pages 687-715           first part of this document was actually forwarded

                        in letter format to the investigation team prior to

                        interview but it has been included as one complete

                        document for ease of reference.     Each specific

                        complaint is also answered by Mr MARSHALL in

                        written form within this document. An appropriate

                        caution is also signed by Mr MARSHALL in relation

                        to it.




                        R109     Superintendent MARSHALL was served with

Documents 17.18   12.   Regulation 7 Notices based upon the complaints

Pages 35.36.37          by Mr HICKS, Mr JONES and Mrs McBRIEN and the dates

                        of service are shown on those documents.




                        R110     There are no matters of unrelated discipline

                        to consider.




                        ANTECEDENTS




                        Rill   Superintendent Roger MARSHALL is almost 47

                        years of age, being born on                      He is

                        a married man with

                        owner/occupier accommodation at
•
    R112   He joined the Yorkshire West Riding

    Constabulary on 28 August 1962 after Cadet service

    with that force and served at Dewsbury Division

    until promotion to Sergeant in November 1968 when

    he transferred to Rotherham Division.   In April

    1973 he undertook Training Sergeant duties in

    Barnsley Division and after transfer to South

    Yorkshire Police on amalgamation in April 1974 he

    was promoted to Inspector and posted to training

    duties at Force Headquarters on 19 June 1974.      He

    was transferred to patrol duties at FI (Hammerton

    Road) Sub Division in August 1977 where he remained

    until promotion to Chief Inspector and transfer to

    Deputy Commander of B1 (Barnsley) Sub Division on 6

    October 1980.   Following a 12 month period in the

    Organisation and Planning Department between June

    1981 and July 1982 he was seconded to HM

    Inspectorate as personal Staff Officer to HM

    Inspector.




    R113   During that secondment he was promoted to

    Superintendent in October 1983 and on return to the

    Force in December 1984 he became Commander of D1

    (Sheffield Centre) Sub Division where he remained

    until October 1987 when he transferred to his

    current duties as Deputy Commander of F (Sheffield

    North) Division.

•
                            R114   He has no record of disciplinary matters and

                            has been commended on two occasions, once by the

                            Courts and the other by the Chief Constable, both

                            for prompt and praiseworthy action.




                            115    Since this disaster a number of Liverpool

                            supporters have written to Superintendent MARSHALL

                            expressing their thanks to him for what he did that

                            CONCLUSION




                            R116   Because South Yorkshire Police placed a great

                            emphasis upon the successful policing of the 1988

                            FA Cup semi-final between the same teams as in

                            1989, with supporters allocated the same ends of

                            the ground and no unresolved problems, I find it a

                            little difficult to understand why it was felt to

                            be justified to change the duties of the two Ground




                                                                                47
•
    Commanders, Superintendent MARSHALL and

    Superintendent GREENWOOD.   The potential for

    problems at the Leppings Lane turnstiles was

    recognised by those responsible for planning the

    1989 event as is evidenced by the fact that no

    reduction in manpower was to be imposed there.     In

    view of the fact that there was to be a newly

    promoted Chief Superintendent in overall

    operational command; the Leppings Lane potential

    for trouble; and the successful policing operation

    in 1988; it would appear to make sense to have left

    Superintendent GREENWOOD in charge of outside the

    ground and Superintendent MARSHALL inside the

    ground.   Of course, that is with the benefit of

    hindsight, both Superintendents are very

    experienced officers, and the change was in no way

    the responsibility of Superintendent MARSHALL.




    R117   Although all senior officers involved in the

    1989 event seem to understand the somewhat

    perplexing overlap of responsibilities of

    Superintendent MARSHALL and Superintendent

    GREENWOOD in respect of the Leppings Lane turnstile

    area, it is a matter which should have been tidied

    up, by the planners at an earlier date, but it has

    to be recognised that both Superintendent GREENWOOD




                                                         48
and Superintendent MARSHALL understood the position

and accepted it without question on the day.




R118    From various accounts Superintendent MARSHALL

did all that was necessary to take charge of his

area outside the Leppings Lane entrance and the

approaches to it, at an early hour on 15 April

1989.      Through his eyes there was a good and tested

Operation Order, ample resources , including

reserves, and there had been extensive briefings.

There was nothing extraordinary in the Match

Intelligence Report and from early on in the day he

was ensuring that appropriate police action was

being taken in respect of disorder, ticketless fans

and ticket touts.     He had seen the Liverpool fans

from the special train, escorted effectively from

the station to the ground and up to 1415 hours he

would have considered that the operation was moving

along effectively.     Efforts were being made to

encourage loiterers to enter the ground.     He was on

foot and in uniform with a personal police radio.

Shortly after he arrived at the area directly

outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles he became

concerned about the number of Liverpool supporters

coming down Leppings Lane and spilling onto the

roadway.     At that time cars and buses were still




                                                      49
•
    able to drive along Leppings Lane but because of

    the danger of pedestrian injuries he radioed to the

    Police Control Box at 1417 hours for Leppings Lane

    to be closed to traffic.    There was some delay in

    achieving this and buses were still using the road

    at about 1430 hours.    However, shortly after that

    the road was closed to traffic.    In the Police

    Control Box it is likely that this unusual request

    triggered off a discussion between Chief

    Superintendent DUCKENFIELD and Superintendent

    MURRAY as to whether the crowd outside Leppings

    Lane turnstiles would all get into the ground by

    1500 hours, the kick-off time, and they rehearsed

    the policy for delaying the start of the match.

    This was unknown to Superintendent MARSHALL and at

    that time he had no perception of the crisis to

    come.    The crowd was large but in good humour with

    no signs of panic.




    R119    This report has discussed earlier the

    possible configurations of the iron perimeter gates

    across the mouth of the Leppings Lane turnstiles.

    They were open, whereas in 1988 they had been

    closed except for two gates to filter the crowd

    through to the turnstiles in orderly queues.




                                                          SO
•
    Because in 1989 those gates were all open, the

    crowd had completely covered the concourse area

    immediately outside the turnstiles.




    R120   Between the closing of Leppings Lane to

    traffic shortly after 1430 hours and 1444 hours the

    crowd grew at the Leppings Lane entrance.     Fans

    were experiencing difficulties over the

    instructions on their tickets so that many of them

    arrived at the wrong turnstiles and had to be

    re-directed.    Some fans tried to buy their way

    through the turnstiles and on rejection they had to

    be removed.     Pressure of the crowd affected the

    efficiency of the turnstiles which often could not

    turn because of bodily pressure.    The mounted

    officers found it extremely difficult to operate

    being surrounded by a dense mass of people some of

    whom attacked the horses with lighted cigarettes.

    So dense was the crowd becoming that one horse was

    lifted from the ground by the mass of people

    surrounding it.                           '




    R121   Superintendent MARSHALL gained a raised

    vantage point on a parapet of the bridge over the

    River Don.    He was attacked by one frustrated fan

    and clearly the mood of the crowd had changed from




                                                          51
reasonably patient good humour, to one of

impatience, frustration and hostility    The

situation was made worse by elements in the crowd

who had been drinking.    These, mostly young men,

pushed from the back, weaved and forced their way

into and through the crowd.




R122   At 1444 hours Superintendent MARSHALL radioed

for extra manpower, including horses, for a message

to be broadcast by the Club tannoy to urge the

crowd to stop pushing and for a police vehicle

equipped with a public address system.    It was

about this time that the police personal radio

system failed, but two of Superintendent MARSHALL’S

requests were acted upon, and the third, the

request for a PA equipped police vehicle, was

answered by Police Constable BUXTON acting on his

own initiative.




R123   The tannoy was used to no effect but the

reinforcements arrived from the Penistone Road end

of the ground.    Police Constable BUXTON got no

response from the crowd to his repeated broadcasts

for them to stop pushing.
R124   Such was the pressure that the foot officers

were withdrawn through the turnstiles into the

ground to re-emerge through exit Gate C.




R125   The mounted officers moved to a position just

outside the iron perimeter gates and the gates were

closed.   The reinforcements had arrived so the

mounted officers were able to form a cordon outside

those gates with the intention of holding back the

crowd until the area immediately outside the

turnstiles could be cleared.   Superintendent

MARSHALL realised that police had lost control of

the crowd and with understandable reluctance at

1447 hours he radioed to the Police Control Box for

permission to open the exit gates.     While that

request was being considered Gate C was opened for

police officers inside the ground to eject a youth

who had climbed in without a ticket.     As Gate C

opened, about 150 supporters forced their way into

the ground through the gate until a mounted officer

managed to manoeuvre his horse to stop the flow and

the gate was shut.




R126   It was about this time that Police Constable

BUXTON radioed to the Police Control Box for the

stkrt of the game to be delayed.     This request was
 acknowledged but refused.     Having received no

 response to his earlier request, Superintendent

MARSHALL asked again for permission to open the

 exit gates, but there was still no response from

the Police Control Box.      He made it a third time

explaining that there was a danger of fatalities.

At 1452 hours, permission having been given from

the Control Box, Gate C was opened and the crowd

congested outside of the turnstiles started to come

through it into the ground     These fans being held

outside the iron perimeter gates by the mounted

officers saw the influx through gate C and made a

"bee-line" for it.    This forced open the iron

perimeter gates and the dense crowd cleared quickly

through the open gate.




R127    Although Superintendent MARSHALL had asked

for all the exit gates to be opened, A, B and C,

and Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD had approved

the opening of all those gates, only Gate C was

opened immediately.   A specific request had to be

made by Police Sergeant Edward HIGGINS for Gate A

to be opened.   Whether or not it was specifically

requested, Gate B was also opened for a short

time.   Shortly after 1500 hours Superintendent

MARSHALL heard a police radio message directing
all available officers into the stadium.      Because

there was still a considerable number of people in

Leppings Lane Superintendent MARSHALL remained

thtere but sent thirty of his officers into the

stadium.    From the police radio traffic, which he

could hear, and the exodus of fans, some injured,

from the rear of the West Stand onto the concourse,

he realised something was seriously wrong so he

took his remaining officers to the concourse and

started to deal with casualties and fatalities.        He

remained there until summoned to the Police Control

Box some time between 1600 hours and 1615 hours

where he met the Assistant Chief Constable, Mr

Walter JACKSON.    At about 1715 hours he accompanied

Mr> JACKSON to Police Headquarters to see the Chief

Constable and the Deputy Chief Constable.




R128    Superintendent MARSHALL, and other officers,

gave evidence at the Lord Justice TAYLOR public

inquiry which was critical of some of the Liverpool

supporters’ behaviour.




R129    There are three aspects of that criticisms -




  (i)         the crowd were unco-operative




                                                            55
                       (ii)          drink was a major factor




                      (iii)          ticketless fans and ticket touts were a

                                     serious problem.




                      R130     Because the deaths and injuries occurred at

                      the Leppings Lane end of Hillsborough Stadium, this

                      report concentrates on the Liverpool supporters and

                      the events which surrounded them on the day of the

                      disaster.



Part IV               R131     Because of the Liverpool Football Club’s

Documents 183 & 184   success over a long period of time it has a large

Statement Pages       following by fans.     Their behaviour is well

1152-1154             documented by police.     Among other details, a

                      tendency to arrive late and without tickets is

                      noted.




Part IV               R132     Police Sergeant George CHARLESWORTH collated

Statement Pages       the pre-match intelligence by liaising with both

1145-1151             Merseyside Police and Nottinghamshire Constabulary

                      and presented the information in report form at the

                      pre-match briefing.



Part IV               R133     Once Hillsborough had been selected as the

Document 185          venue for the semi-final in 1989, an undated

Page 929              letter was circulated by Walter JACKSON, Assistant
•
                       Chief Constable (Operations), by South Yorkshire

                       Police, in which he details recommended routes to

                       Sheffield, parking arrangements, search procedures

                      and opening times for the ground.    The letter asked

                       supporters to arrive between 1030 hours and 1400

                      hours to ensure they were in the ground for the

                      start of the match at 1500 hours, and indicated

                      that ticketless fans should not attend.



    Part IV           R134   The Liverpool Football Club’s programme for

    Document 186      the home game at Anfield on 8 April 1989 contained

    Pages 930-931     an' article in the same vein and this was repeated

                      in media broadcasts and publications, both locally

                      and nationally.




                      R135   Some 102 coaches containing Liverpool

                      supporters travelled to Sheffield on 15 April 1989.

                      Most of these were accompanied by a Liverpool

    Part IV           steward and either they, or the driver were

    Statement Pages   advised prior to departure about the arrangements

    1155-1161         in South Yorkshire.   Additional arrangements were

                      made by Merseyside Police.




                      R136   The largest proportion of supporters

                      travelled in private hire cars, vans and

                      mini-buses.   It is impossible to quantify these




                                                                            57
                    vehicles numerically but there was no significant

                    traffic delays to cause late arrival of fans in

                    Sheffield.    This matter is considered again later

Part IV             in this report.   A detailed report from British

Documents 187-188   Transport Police confirms that one special train

Pages 932-938       and three service trains from Liverpool conveyed

      939-962       825 supporters to Sheffield, and other trains from

                    other areas brought the total to 1,337.




                    R137   By comparison, 1,932 Nottingham Forest

                    supporters travelled by a combination of special

                    and service trains to attend the match.     The

                    conclusion was that the supporters were happy and

                    good natured with few signs of intoxication.

Part IV

Statement Pages     R138   There is evidence of Liverpool and other

1208-1211           supporters procuring and consuming alcohol en

1212-1214           route to the game.




                    R139   Despite the entreaties for fans to arrive

                    early (previously referred to) some of the gates

Part IV             into Hillsborough Stadium were not opened until

Statement Pages     1130 hours and some even later than that.    Fans

1241-1243           were already in Sheffield and drinking alcohol by

                    0845 hours.
•
    Part IV           R140   There are many descriptions of the behaviour

    Statement Pages   of supporters in various parts of Sheffield but

    1237-1240         predominantly in the area within two miles or so

    1246-1247         from the ground between 0845 hours and 1500 hours.

    1293-1294         They present a picture of drinking, boisterous and

    1244-1245         rowdy behaviour, some drunkenness and urinating

    1295-1298         in public and secluded places.   But not all of the

                      statements are critical, some praise the behaviour

                      of Liverpool supporters.   At one location seven

                      dustbin liners were collected full of cans, bottles

                      and other alcoholic drink containers, and that was

                      on one garage forecourt.   One public house sold out

                      of beer.




                      R141   As part of the policing arrangements on 15

                      April 1989 many of the public houses within one

                      mile radium of the stadium were closed for the sale

                      of alcohol.   Those licensed premises which did open

                      instigated various controls on the door but the

                      further away from the stadium the premises are

                      situated, the more attractive they were to

                      supporters wishing to drink.   The further away from

                      the stadium the premises are situated, the more

                      likely was a late arrival at the stadium.    This may

                      have put more customer pressure on other retail

                      outlets where alcohol is sold and police control
Part IV            is more difficult.   Most of the supermarkets and

Statement Pages    off-licenses did open and they sold a considerable

1291-1292          amount of drink on the day.    Public houses and

1325-1329          off-sales describe the significant increases in

1330-1334         their takings on 15 April 1989.     The pattern of

                  this evidence is that whilst sales increased

                  considerably, in general the behaviour of the

                  supporters was good, although there were incidents

                  of very bad behaviour.




                  R142   This bad behaviour was perhaps naturally more

                  acute nearest to the stadium.     People living near

                  to any football stadium are well accustomed, some

                  would say long-suffering, to the disruption which

                  occurs in their neighbourhood when a football match

                  takes place.   By reason of their experience the

                  local residents develop the ability to identify

                  those teams whose supporters cause them the most

                  trouble.   Given the dangers of bias, prejudice and

                  stereotyping, as a result some supporters are

                  attributed with a group reputation, but the local

                  residents are in a position to compare and balance

                  the behaviour of various supporters week by week,

                  and even year by year.




                  R143   On the day in question a picture emerges of

                  cars being parked early, those roads nearest to




                                                                         60
Part IV           the stadium at the Leppings Lane end (the Liverpool

Statement Pages   end) being full of parked cars by 1100 hours.       A

1345-1349         considerable amount of alcohol was being carried

1353-1358         and consumed.    Fans were seen walking towards the

1429-1432         stadium with little or no chance of being there for

1349-1364         the start of the game.     There is some evidence that

                  on 15 April 1989 at the Leppings Lane turnstiles

                  the behaviour of the fans was the worst ever seen.

                  Through the eyes of the local residents the

                  Liverpool supporters were generally more badly

                  behaved in 1989 than they were on the occasion of

                  the semi-final in 1988; the bad behaviour was

                  influenced by alcohol; and too many fans arriving

                  late.




                  R1AA    But from the evidence of witnesses it is not

                  at all clear that the only cause for the fans late

                  arrival at the Leppings Lane turnstiles was

                  drink-related.   The day of the match was warm and

                  sunny with a temperature of 12 degrees Celsius or

                  53.6 degrees Fahrenheit.    Many of the supporters

                  attending the match were intent upon enjoying a

                  traditional pre-match drink.    In some cases the

                  alcohol led to rowdy, boisterous or disorderly

                  behaviour, in others it led to a reluctance to

                  leave licensed premises until the last minute.




                                                                          61
Part IV           However, although traffic volume was heavy on all

Statement Pages   approach routes and traffic delays were not a

1208-1211         serious problem, some traffic hold-ups did occur

1212-1214         to cause late arrival at the ground.     The police

1415-1423         search operation inevitably caused some delay

1424-1428         to some supporters, for example, the search of one

                  private mini-bus took twenty minutes to complete,

                  the occupants arriving at the ground at 1A55

Part III          hours.     On balance it is likely that one cause of

Document 109      late arrivals at the Leppings Lane turnstiles was

Schedule Pages    drink-related.     The build-up started at about 1A20

740-741           hours and continued until Gate C was opened at 1A52

                  hours.




                  R1A5     The evidence suggests that very many of the

                  fans who arrived at the ground after 1A30 hours,

                  had been drinking at public houses or from

                  containers brought from home or bought from

                  off-licenses and other retail outlets.     But there

                  is little evidence of arrestable drunkenness and

                  there is no evidence of wide-scale prosecutable

                  drunkenness.     There was certainly an element in the

                  crowd outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles who were

                  the worse for drink but the evidence suggests that

                  element was in a minority.    That element contained

                  young people influenced by drink who were pushing,

                  shoving and
                  weaving among the crowd either through impatience

                  or bravado and there seems little doubt that those

                  arriving at Leppings Lane at a time nearest to the

                  kick-off had drunk the most and were the worst

                  behaved.     This "late arrival element" would have

                  been most likely to be among those who entered the

                  ground through Gate C at 1A52 hours and made their

                  way to the back of pens 3 and A .    Of the 95 who

                  died in pens 3 and A it can be shown that 23

                  entered through Gate C after 1A52 hours and of

                  these some had significantly high blood/alcohol

                  levels, but to deduce more than that from the

                  evidence available would be no more than

                  speculation.




                  R1A6    A not unrelated difficulty was caused by fans

                  arriving without tickets despite the all-ticket

                  nature of the match and the entreaties previously

                  mentioned.



Part IV           R1A7    Evidence from the supporters themselves

Document 183      suggests that a considerable number of people

Pages 910-922     travelled without tickets in the hope of purchasing

Part II           them at or near to the stadium.     The police

Statement Pages   evidence suggests large numbers of ticketless

1152-1154         fans.   An estimate calculated from the statements




                                                                          63
Part IV         suggests something in the region of 2.000 fans

Document 184    arriving at Hillsborough without tickets.

Pages 923-928

Part IV         R148   From the turnstile count print-out it is

Document 189    possible to calculate the number of fans outside

Pages 963-986   Leppings Lane turnstiles just before the opening of

                Gate C at 1452 hours.   The estimate is 3,264 still

                waiting to enter the ground. Add to that the

                estimated 2,000 non-ticket holders and there is a

                potential crowd of 5,246 still to come into the

                stadium just before the opening of Gate C.




                R149   The calculation as to the number of

                ticketless fans who entered the stadium at the

                Leppings Lane end is open to dispute.   There is a

                considerable amount of evidence which suggests that

                there were frequent requests and negotiations for

                tickets during the time that the crowd built up

                outside Leppings Lane turnstiles.   The police

                officers intervened on many occasions in the

                interests of preventing obstruction and to detect

                forged tickets.   Many of the supporters moved on in

                this fashion returned predominantly to the bridge

                area over the River Don.   From the CCTV video

                evidence there was a large number of fans loitering




                                                                       64
•
     in the area outside of Gate C making no attempt to

    enter through the turnstiles.   That may have been

    because they were waiting for the crush to clear

    before presenting their tickets at the turnstile,

    but it may have been the case that they had no

    tickets to present and were waiting the opportunity

    to buy a ticket or enter the ground "illegally".




    R150   It has been suggested that as the kick off

    time approached the West Terraces and the North

    Stand still had many spaces in pens 1 and 2, 6 and

    7 and the North Stand seats, the Liverpool

    supporters accommodation.   Because the match was

    "all-ticket" and a "sell out” these spaces must

    indicate that there were many ticket holders still

    to come into the stadium and that would account for

    the large crowd still outside the Leppings Lane

    turnstiles.   If those spaces had been filled by

    about 1420 hours it would have indicated that the

    large crowd outside the turnstiles had no tickets,

    but these spaces were still empty at that time.




    R151   In an attempt to resolve the matter account

    has been taken of the Club’s electronic monitoring

    system. This shows that a total of 7,038 people

    passed through turnstiles A-G, the entrance to the




                                                          65
                  West Terraces.   However, the counting mechanism on

                  turnstile G was defective.   The Health and Safety

                  Executive from a study of the CCTV film which

                  portrays turnstiles A-G and Gate C, estimated that

                  as many as 7,644 people entered through turnstiles

                  A-G but that estimate is based upon not only a

                  "head count" of the video film but also a

                  projection of figures from other turnstiles.     Again

                  using the video film, the Health and Safety

                  Executive estimated that as many as 2,480 people

                  entered the ground through exit Gate C.      The best

                  estimate available from the Health and Safety

                  Executive is that 10,124 people entered through

                  turnstiles A-G and Gate C.   However, this estimate

                  does not take into account those people with

                  tickets for the West Terraces who were allowed

                  through turnstiles 1-16, and other factors such as

                  the opening of Gate A which distort the figures.

                  Bearing in mind that 10,100 tickets were sold for

                  the West Terraces, the evidence, such as it is,

                  does suggest that non-ticket holders entering the

                  West Terraces (the Liverpool end) could have been

                  as high as 2,000 or as low as 200.   It is

                  impossible to be more precise.



Part IV           R152   There are many descriptions of the activities

Statement Pages   of ticketless fans and ticket touts on the day, but




                                                                           66
1559-1566   there is no evidence of any conspiracy by Liverpool
1567-1575
1576-1579   supporters, or groups of supporters, to descend on
1580-1586
1587-1590   the turnstiles in Leppings Lane to force, or
1664-1670
1671-1673   otherwise gain entry illegally.




            R153   Finally, the crowd outside the Leppings Lane

            turnstiles were criticised because they took no

            notice of police requests to stop pushing and to

            ease back to relieve pressure at the turnstiles.        I

            can do no better than to quote from Lord Justice

            Taylor’s Interim Report at page 34, paragraph 197s-




                   "How could they?     In that crush most people

                   had no control over their movements at all.

                   Two incidents involving police horses

                   illustrate the point.    One horse was found

                   afterwards to have cigarette burns on its

                   rump.   Clearly that was the despicable work

                   of a hooligan whether in drink or not.

                   However, there were also eyewitness accounts

                   of a horse being physically lifted off its

                   feet by the crowd.    That occurred, as the

                   police accepted, without malice or intent but

                   as an involuntary consequence of crowd

                   pressure which those by the horses flanks

                   could not resist any more than the horse

                   itself."




                                                                        67
•
    Superintendent MARSHALL’S request for the exit

    gates to be opened was forced upon him by a serious

    crowd problem which quickly developed outside the

    turnstiles.     The crush which developed was so

    serious that injuries were being sustained and

    fatalities were feared unless the pressure could be

    released swiftly.    His request was a positive act

    which, given the circumstances prevailing at the

    time, was the right one.




    R15A   The inability of the turnstiles to cope with

    the uneven flow of fans; the lack of a police

    strategy in advance to deal with a large and uneven

    flow of supporters all arriving at the turnstiles

    during the last half an hour before kick-off; the

    presence of a substantial minority of fans who had

    drunk too much; the rejection of the option of

    delaying the kick-off; the confusing tickets; the

    presence of ticketless fans; all created an

    unmanageable crush with a serious danger of deaths

    and injuries.




    R155   At that time there was no option left to him

    other than to request the opening of the gates.

    The clecision so to do was not his, but once that

    decision was made it solved Superintendent




                                                          68
                   MARSHALL’S problem.     That the opening of the exit

                   gates would create problems for someone else,

                   inside the ground, was a problem for the Police

                   Control Box, not for Superintendent MARSHALL, and

                   that is a matter dealt with in other files which

                   relate to other officers.




                   R156   All of the evidence shows that Superintendent

                   MARSHALL was doing his best to control, and

                   eventually to try and regain control, of a

                   situation which neither he, nor anyone else had

                   foreseen.   That there were other things he could

                   have done earlier is clear, for example the call

                   for reinforcements.     That some of the things he did

                   were unlikely to succeed is clear, for example

                   entreaties for the crowd to stop pushing.     But he

                   did enough on the day, on the spot, to show that

                   there is insufficient evidence to prove any

                   disciplinary charges against him.    I find the

                   complaints unsubstantiated.

 Dear Home Secretary,


                                          re: Hillsborough Disaster


 I am     the    father      of     the    late    Sarah          and Victoria Hicks who unfortunately
v’-vre among the 95 people so tragically killed at Hillsborough.


You     will    require          little    reminder          of    the     increasingly          acrimonious        rounds
of    accusation        and       counter     accusation             that    abounded           in    the   media       until
you had the good sense to issue your instruction to the police and request
a general cessation.
Despite        acute    provocation          and       at    times        great    personal          anquish,      my    wife
and     I have     resisted         numerous        opportunities             to    fuel       that    deplorable         and
unseemly        state       of    affairs,     preferring             to    assist       the     Taylor      Inquiry       in
its difficult task - including being prepared to await the outcome before
making detailed comment to the media.


I write        to you       today    to request             your    comment        and    intervention          following
  }e statement,         widely reported                in the media,              by South Yorkshire's Deputy
Chief     Constable         Peter     Hayes       to    the        effect    that        "no    further     action       was
required”        in     connection           with           the     actions        and     behaviour          of        Chief
Superintendent David Duckenfield.
I was under           the   impression        that Lord Justice Taylor on the one hand and
the internal Police Investigation by the West Midlands force on the other,
would    draw    conclusions          when    and       only when           they had concluded              their work
and   had      time    to    deliberate.           Despite          the    careful       wording,       the     issue     of
this statement by the Deputy Chief Constable pre-empts these findings!


Words fail me when I try to convey to you the hurt and totally unneccessary
anguish     this untimely           statement has given my wife,                          myself and presumably
the   other     families.          Apart    from       the        crass    nature    of        this action,        I find
the need to issue such a statement at this time beyond contempt.
                                                                                            DOCUMENT No.          1



                                                           2



  One can only conclude that this is yet a further attempt by South Yorkshire
  Police      to    divert       public    opinion       away       from   their       appalling     performance
  both on the fatal day and subsequent to it.


  Apart      from   obvious       offence    to    the    bereaved,        how     are    the public      to view
  this premature ’’absolution" by the Deputy Chief Constable!
  That a senior police officer - who by his own admission deliberately chose
  to deceive his superiors (and others!) should not be disciplined is totally
  incredible.
  Even    if one believes Chief Superintendent Duckenfield’s reasons for lying
  to the general public at the time,                  (and I am bound to say that I personally
       Inot!^ there could have been no credible reason to have misled the Deputy
  Chief Constable.


  Is    it   purely       coincidence       that    this       provided       an      excuse   for    the    Chief
  Constables silence during the lead-in /initial week of the Taylor Inquiry,
  when the fans were able to give their views?
  I trust       that     under    the    circumstances         you    will    understand my          fears   of       a
  "whitewash" at the             least and at the worst a deliberate attempt to "close
  ranks" and distort the course of justice.


  I regret that Mr.Hayes’s insensitive and untimely public action has further
 reduced my opinion of the South Yorkshire senior police.
  It leaves me no alternative but to formally complain directly to yourself,
   .id to ask you as the vanguard of a Government claiming to be ’’committed
 to    law and      order” to make          an    unequivocal         statement          of your opinion       and
 intended actions in the wake of this regrettable development.


 I will await your urgent response during the course of today or tomorrow,
 but    would      advise    that       should    I fail       to   recieve      an    appropriate     response
 I reserve         the   right     to    follow    Mr.Hayes         example      and     release   this     letter
 to the media tomorrow evening.

Dear Mr Dear



I do hope you don't mind my writing to you but I feel by being able to

do this will help me a great deal.     You see like many, many other

people, our family is seriously affected by events at Hillsborough on the

15 April where our son, John, was killed.     Luckily, my husband has been

able to continue with his work but I am finding that it is not possible

for me to live life as I knew it before.    Before the tragedy, I felt
life was pretty good.    I was employed as a school-teacher and was able
to drive and generally had a pleasant and positive attitude to life.
But most of all my husband and I were proud to be John's parents as he
was a good-looking young man who was very healthy with a wonderful

personality and who was doing well at school and taking three 'A' levels

- Maths,   Politics and Economics.   We were looking forward to seeing him

attending Liverpool University this Autumn.    He had chosen Liverpool out
of the four acceptances he had
                                                                DOCUMENT No. i




                                      -   ?   -




received.    On the morning of the beutiful April day, life was so full of




I know the FA made a number of mistakes viz; holding the match at

Hillsborough instead of Manchester and allocating less tickets to
Liverpool fans.



But it was a real blunder for the police td insist on accommodating the

Liverpool fans at the Leppings Lane end and then not exercising strict

control at the main entrance.   Only ticket-holders should have been

allowed through those gates and only a manageable number at a given time

with proper queues at the turnstiles.         I feel the police gave the fans

far too much freedom to exert pressure which led to an uncontrollable

situation.   They allowed anyone,   fans with or without tickets,     to get far

too close to the scene of action and it seemed inevitable that certain
individuals would take advantage of such a position.
                                                            DOCUMENT No.




                                      - 3 -




The situation should never have been allowed to develop to such an extent

that fans could actually gain access by climbing walls into the ground.

It was a grave error to open the large concertina Gate C to eject one fan

who had invaded the ground.     It would have been sensible to have kept

him inside and put him out later when the crowds had dispersed.



But of course the crucial mistake was the request and then the order to
open Gate C again and leave it open for anyone to walk in so close to
kick-off.



In my opinion,    there was only one sensible decision to be made at

that time and that was to have the game delayed and use the turnstiles

only for entry.    That way people would move in at a much slower pace and
the crowd would be less dense.    That way they would be able to see for

themselves where to go.    It was the sheer volume of people coming in

through Gate C and then down the tunnel that caused the disaster.      It is

no wonder that on-one had admitted to doing this as it was indeed an
extremely foolish procedure.



I, myself, would certainly not have liked to have been faced with a
request from a senior officer to open the exit

gates to allow anyone in as that to me sounds a very unusual request

indeed and is undoubtedly a recipe for disaster.    If I had been faced

with such a request,   I would have felt that I had no alternative to

having the game post-poned or even abandoned as that to me would seem the

only right decision to make.   The other decision was entirely wrong as

beyond that gate on the outside there was the space of the whole world

but within the stadium there was a limited space only and    it was indeed a
very dangerous thing to exceed that capacity at any time.



I feel generally that the police in this country are doing a    fine job on

all Saturdays throughout the football season as their job    is indeed a

difficult one.   I also feel that the police operation adopted on the 15th
April was a well-thought out plan that had worked at Hillsborough

previously as John had attended the same match last year.    But it did

appear quite obviously from 2.30 pm that there were difficulties in the

Leppings Lane area and it was becoming increasingly difficult to maintain
control.   I think the situation then should have been assessed and some

have been taken at that time.   Strict control was definitely needed at
the turnstiles from 2.30.



I cannot criticize the police for not having officers directing the fans
to various pens.   I feel many fans choose the standing area because they
feel less restricted there in some ways.    They are not tied to one

particular spot as with seating;   in other words,   they have free choice to

go to any pen where they see room and if need be can move from one pen to

another by means of the gates at the top of the pens.     I suppose this is

what usually happened.   I don't think the fans would actually want the

police to tell them where to go under normal circumstances.     But what

happened on the 15th April 1989 was a different set of circumstances
altogether.   People, who were legitimate ticket-holders were not coming

in as usual through the turnstiles and finding their positions in the

pens.   It appeared suddenly that anybody and everybody had been allowed

in, indiscriminately, without warning, in such large numbers to create
overcrowding on a very large scale.



It was noted by the police at 2.40 pm that there was room on the
                                                               OOCUMENT No.     10

 f.errvjc.es for another 3,000 fans only and at that time it appeared that a

very similar number were waiting to come in, outside the turnstile area.

However, within minutes, the 3,000 outside turned into about 5,000.     This

was clearly seen so it was extremely foolish to think that 5,000 could

fit into a place for 3,000 and throw the gates open.     It couldn't be done
and it shouldn't have been done.



It was wrong to allow ticketless fans in and it was posing a security

risk, too, as a large mob like that could have missiles or the like.     In

any case, no-one is allowed into any other place of entertainment without

producing a ticket first and that is the purpose of the turnstiles.     No

steward was told of the police decision to open the gates as I'm sure any

steward would have objected because surely it was against Club Rules.



I will now give you the information relating to our son, John.



John left home on the 15th April   1989 just in time to catch the Deeside
Liverpool Supporters' coach from outside the Victoria Hotel at Holywell,
Clwyd.



He travelled to the match with a ticket and consumed no alcohol on that
day.




                                                                               17

                                      - 7 -




 The coach arrived at Sheffield at approximately 2 pm and John and a
 number of other young supporters made their way to the ground.



I was told that the organisation this year was totally different to that

of last year when there were a number of control points to check for

tickets before the fans arrived at the main gate and turnstiles.     In fact

on a number of occasions in the past, ticketless fans were taken to a

specified area where they listened to the match on a transistor radio and
so did not pose a problem.



This year there appeared to be no plan whatsoever operating at the

Leppings Lane end and widespread chaos developed when the road was

closed, following Mr Marshall's request, at 2.30.   It was a very foolish

move as fans were then able to spread out in all directions and checks on
them became impossible.   Fans with tickets were being pestered all the

time by fans without tickets asking if they had any spare tickets.     It

appeared that the police didn't understand what 'spares' meant!



By the time John and his friends managed to get through the maingate
there was utter confusion with fans




                                                                               18

 being helped over the turnstiles and walls by policemen and one

policeman on the roof of the turnstiles.        Also, ticketless fans were
attempting to bribe the turnstile operators and so were hindering the

flow through the turnstiles.   Added to this was the fact that the tickets
themselves were incorrectly numbered or lettered.



John and his friends were being pushed and crushed at the turnstile area

at about 2.45.   As one of his friends suffers with asthma and started to

have an attack, they quickly moved out of the crush at the turnstiles and

went as far away as possible to stand outside the exit Gate C where there
were not too many people at the time.       They went there because they felt

safer and at that point they weren't even bothered about seeing the

beginning of the match.   They were concerned only with their own safety.



To their amazement, Gate C suddenly opened to eject a fan and police

officers there at the time mistakenly thought that the gate had been

opened in response to Mr Marshall's request and so they told John and his
friends along with other fans, totalling about

 200 lo go in.   John and his friends looked back and saw the gate closing

 behind them and felt safe so they went to the lavatories and then quickly
 made their way down the tunnel and took up their positions in Pen 3.



 No sooner bad John and his friends got into their places in Pen 3, then

 thousands of people came following down the tunnel after Gate C was opened
 again and left open.



We know nothing more about John and are still trying to find the

 following information and should be grateful if you could help with this
matter.



1)   What time John was found dead or injured?


2)   Who found him?



3)   Was he taken to hospital?



4)   Did he receive any medical attention at any time?


5)   Did anyone try to help him in any way?



It may help you to know that John was   wearing a red and white scarf.



The facts clearly indicate complete wrecklessness on the part of those

put in responsible positions on that day.     Power can indeed be a very
dangerous tool if put in the hands of
                                                               DOCUMENT No.       10

 irresponsible individuals!    John should never have died at 18 - this was
completely and easily avoidable!     We can all recover from mistakes made

connected with the Economy; we cannot recover from the mistakes made by

 imcornpetent people who were in a position of responsibility on the 15th

April   1989.   The price all the bereaved families have had to face is a

colossal one.    This is something that no-one can put right but we do hope
that at least justice is done!



If only Police Constable Buxton's request to have the kick-off post-posed

had not been rejected by Mr Duckenfield, I am sure there would not have

been that terrible tragedy.     Instead, Mr Marshall,   in more authority,

requested that the exit gates should be opened to get rid of the crowd

surging around him.    That was not just a serious mistake, but a fatal one
where John was concerned!     I'm sure he would not expect that gate where

he was standing to suddenly open and allow him in - in to his death!         It
was utterly wreckless!



Mr Jack Stone, a gate-man at Gate A pleaded with the police not




                                                                                  21

to open the exit gates as it was against Club Rules and said, "all hell

will break loose if you open them,” and it surely did!         He refused to

open his gate and stood firmly by it but was eventually compelled by the
police to do so.   I know he was just a gate-man but he knew his job - he

knew that exit gates were not to be opened until after the match; he knew

what the right decision was - if only the power would have been in his

hands instead of Mr Marshall's and Mr Duckenfield's.         He obviously cared

for the fans and knew the dangers.       It was such a short time after he

pleaded with the police not to open the exit gates, that people died

inside the stadium and that wonderful and intelligent son of ours was

changed from a healthy, happy and lively person into a dead body labelled

No 68.   Although John was carrying a provisional driving licence,       I went

through the trauma of not knowing the truth until about 4.30 am on Sunday

16th April when I tried to identify him.         He was beyond recognition and I

refused to believe it was him until his clothing was produced.         I would
like a copy




                                                                                   22

 of f.ho photograph that was available for identification purposes,    if it

 is possible for me to try to comprehend how the most handsome young man
 in the world in my eyes could have been turned into something to
grotesque!



I ve been a Church-goer all my life but I have been unable to attend

Church since this tragedy because I just cannot forgive those policemen.
I feel that the police felt contempt for the Liverpool fans; I feel

contempt now for the South Yorkshire Police, especially as Mr Duckenfield

even lied about the fans and said that they had forced Gate C open.      This

is completely unforgivable!   I just hope that a verdict of unlawful

killing is pronounced as that would be the only thing that would make me

feel better as John was the most wonderful person I have ever known in my
life and the loss of his life is indescribable!



I m sure neither Mr Marshall nor Mr Duckenfield deliberately caused
John's death, but by their irresponsible actions they certainly caused
it.   It was clear to John and his friends that it was absolute

pandemonium at the turnstiles with fans constantly being




                                                                                23

nI Iowed to get over the wall and this is why John and his friends moved

away to relative safety as they thought but instead were actually invited

into that cage by the police; then John was allowed to be crushed by a
terrific force with no police officer in the ground doing a thing about
it .




Nothing can bring John back but 1 do wish that I could do something to
help to prevent further disasters.



First and foremost I would like to see all-seater stadiums.    I feel when

fans pay £6.00 to be spectators they should be entitled to both comfort

and safety.   They should be treated with the same respect as anyone else

who pays to be entertained.   They should be ushered safely to their

places and high safety standards should be maintained at all times.



They should be allowed refreshments including alcohol, as this is
available at most other places

                                   -]/■!-




of entertainment.   Fans should be treated as innocent and decent human

beings and only if they misbehave should they have their photographs
taken and be thrown out.



I am totally against the ID card scheme and do wish that the Bill could

be stopped.   I know I would certainly not wish to attend a place of

entertainment if I had to produce a photo and details of myself first -
I believe the fact that I had paid for admission should surely be

sufficient.   These young people are already finding it difficult to

manage to pay the £6.00, especially if they are still at school.    Why
should further expense be imposed upon them to cater for the hooligans
once again?



I would like to see all perimeter fences removed.



I would like to see newspapers and magazines sold at the ground and maybe
even tapes.



I do, however, feel that ticketless fans should never, never be admitted

but most of all that exit gates remain closed until the end of the match.

I think it would be a good idea to have Rottweillers standing by the

police to deal with any pitch invasions, maybe even teargas or the like.

Photographs should be taken of any offenders and they should not be
allowed to attend further matches.



I am enclosing a few photocopies to illustrate the kind of son we have
lost and why our lives have been totally ruined as a result of such poor
management.     Perhaps it would have been better to have had fewer

policemen but better trained for such an arduous task.     'Quality rather
than quantity' may have made a big difference to the outcome of that
horrible day!

   On Saturday, 15 April 1989, at Hillsborough Football Ground, Sheffield, a
   disaster occurred in which 95 people died.

  Leslie Jones of                             Liverpool, the father of one of the
  deceased, Richard Jones, has made the following allegations relating to your
  duties at the ground on 15 April 1989;

   (a)        You failed to control and filter fans away from the immediate vicinity
              of the turnstiles even after 1417 hours, when it was obvious you had
              lost control of the turnstile area.  In any event you should have
              acted by 1430 hours at the latest.

   (b)        You gave no actual order to restrict the approach of those fans, or
              after 1430 hours, to actually stop the fans entering Leppings Lane.

 Chief Constable

 Following our telephone conversation of recent date I write to you with a
 proposition in connection with the routeing of the papers arising from the
 crime investigation into the Hillsborough disaster.

You will know that my investigation into the criminal and disciplinary aspects
is being supervised by the Police Complaints Authority. At the end of my
investigation, which is not far off, the PCA must make a statement that it is
satisfied with the conduct of the investigation.  That statement will be sent
to you, the complainants and to the officers whose conduct has been called into
question.  The only exception to that will be the PCA statement in respect of
your Assistant Chief Constable Mr Walter JACKSON. In his case the PCA
statement will go to your Police Authority.

In strict accord with the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, the way for
this to be achieved is for me to submit my original report to the PCA, and at
the same time send a copy to you (or your Police Authority). Once the PCA is
satisfied with my investigation it sends the forementioned statement to that
effect, to you (or to your Police Authority).

You (or your Police Authority) are then required first to consider matters
related to any criminal offences revealed in the report and refer them to the
Director of Public Prosecutions.   Thereafter you are required to submit a
report to the PCA setting out your opinions as to the merits of the complaints
against police officers; any disciplinary charges preferred or proposed- the
merits or otherwise of convening a disciplinary tribunal; and any reasons for
not preferring disciplinary charges.

My proposition is that for various reasons; including the referral of the
matter by Peter Wright to the DPP in the first place; the complex circumstances
of the investigation; the bulk of the documentary and other evidence; and the



                                                     Continued.
                                                                DOCUMENT No.     24

need for expediency; you allow me to deal direct with the DPP in so far as the
crime aspects are concerned. Of course, you will receive the PCA statement at
the appropriate time and you will receive all of the evidence and reports in
time for your consideration of the disciplinary aspects with the PCA   The
matters relating to your Assistant Chief Constable would not be affected.

I hope that this letter is comprehensible and that you will agree to mv
proposal, in which case a short letter of reply would be appreciated.

 Many thanks for your letter of         17 July 1990 which concerns the routeing
 of your report to the DPP.

I quite understand that there are exceptional circumstances which surround
your investigation and that the bulk of the material which accompanies
your report isconsiderable.    It is also relevant    that the  matter was
referred to the   DPP by Peter Wright in the first instance, and the need
for expediency should require no argument.

Of course, I am directly concerned only with the matters which involve
officers of and below the rank of Chief Superintendent, so I cannot speak
for my Police Authority which is concerned with officers of ACPO rank.

I have no objection to your submitting          your   report   to   the      DPP        through
the PCA without sending a copy to me.

I understand that in due course I shall receive a statement from the
PCA in respect of your conduct of the investigation and that I shall
receive all the    reports and supporting evidence in good time for me to
consider any disciplinary aspects of the case.

I trust that this letter is sufficient for your purposes                    and        that          it
will help to bring the matter to a swift conclusion.

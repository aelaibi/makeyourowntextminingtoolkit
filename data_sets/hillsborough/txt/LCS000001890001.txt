Mr. M. Reddington,
Manager,
Hillsborough Disaster Appeal Fund,
P.O. Box 220,
4 Water Street,
Liverpool, L69 2PN.




Dear Mr. Reddington,

                       Hillsborough Disaster Appeal Fund.

     The Social Services Departments, together with other statutory and
voluntary agencies have collaborated to provide direct, assistance to survivors
and families of Hillsborough.   The work I know is appreciated and understood by
the Trustees and yourself. The co-ordination and management tasks across seven'
local authorities to say nothing of the administrative and communication problems
requires financial support.

     I realise that David Mason has already discussed the possibility of financial
support from the.Appeal Fund to enable these services to be maintained and developed
in line with emerging patterns of demand. . To date the largest burden has fallen
upon the City in both staffing and financiial terms. I_am becoming increasingly;
concerned about this position and our capacity to sustain the services given oiir
own financial position.

     Would you please arrange an urgent meeting ideally within the week for myself
and David Mason to meet with the Trustees, or at least the Chair, and yourself to
explore this problem and possible support from the fund.

     I. cannot stress too strongly the urgency of the situation and trust you will
use your good offices to set up a meeting quickly.

                                   Yours sincerely,




                                   Keva Coombes,
                                   Leader.

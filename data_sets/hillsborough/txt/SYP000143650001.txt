       I feel that the kick-off should have been delayed.

       I should add that two of those Liverpool supporters returned

       at about 6 pm (1800).    We were not open until 6.30 pm (1830).

       They rang the bell and I spoke to them from a window above.

       They asked to come in.    I explained I would not open to

       6.30 pm (1830).   They said their mate had been injured at the

       match.   I donst know if they were kidding or what.    Anyway

       there was 3 of them earlier on so one was missing.     They didn’t

       say anymore and they left.

Ground          it    was          for    Leppins                LN    standing             and       it    cost          six       pounds.




We    left       my       house          between             eleven          o ’clock            and       half-past                eleven          and     got

on    to    the       M61          and    then          onto          the    M62       and       although             I d o n ’t k n o w              where           we

get    off       I know             it    was       an       A    class          road       on    the       way       to       Sheffield              but      we

came       across             a    lot    of       traffic             hold-up             caused          by the a m o u n t                 of     cars      and

vehicles             on       the       road       sometimes                we    stopped             completely                but       most        of    the

time       we    were             just    crawling                along.           Whilst             we. w e r e         on    the       M62       we

stopped          at       a       Motorway          services                for    ten          minutes          to       buy       some       sarnies.




When       we    actually                got       into          Sheffield             we       saw    the       Ground             from       a    bit     away

and    we       just          turned          up    a    side          street          and       parked          the       car       and       we     started

to    walk       towards                the    Ground             this       must          have       been       about          one       o ’clock          in

the    afternoon.                       Between          the          car    and       the       Ground          we       past       a    few        pubs      and

there       was       a       few       lads       outside             having          a    few       drinks.              I also             noticed          that

there       were          no       Police          to    give          any       directions                to    the       fans          or    give        them

an    escort          and          in    fact       I only             saw       about          eight       Policemen                on       horses        all

together             in a          side       street             on    the       way       to    the       Ground          and       they          w e r e n ’t

doing       anything                but       I d i d n ’t            see    any       drunkenness                or       fighting                whilst         I

getting          a    lot          of    stick          from          the    supporters                shouting                at    him       and       the

like.           Once          I got       actually                through          the          turnstile             I    looked             to    my     right

and    I saw          a       Steward          standing                by    a    large          gate       in    the          wall       I saw          that

the    gate          that          was    about          a       quarter          open          but     I d i d n ’t s e e               if    anyone          was

walking          through                because          I d i d n ’t            take          much       notice.              I d i d n ’t         see       any

Police          in    that          area       and       the       Steward                I saw          was    just       standing             there

doing       nothing                and    certainly                not          giving          directions                or    anything             like

that.           Although                 I myself                have       never          been          to    Hillsborough                before             my

mates       both          had       so    we       had       no    problems                in       finding          the       Ground          or    the

t u r n s t i 1e s .




At    the       time          when       I went          through                the       turnstiles             I d i d n ’t s e e             anybody

trying          to    get          into       the       ground             by    any       other          way    than          by    the       turnstiles.




When     I had            got       through             the       turnstiles                   into       the    area,          behind          the       Stand

there       were          a    lot       of    people             standing                around          drinking             tea       from       the

refreshment                   stand,          so    we       went          round          to    our       left       went       to       buy    a    cup       of

tea    from          the       refreshment                   stand          and       also          a    programme             and       went       back       to

the    area          behind             the    turnstiles                   where          we       had       come    in a n d           although             there

were     no      signs             to    tell       us       where          to       go    we >saw a            tunnel          through             which          we

could       see       the          crowd       and       the       tops          of       tjne goal^s so w e w a l k e d u p to it by

this     time         it       must       have          been       about             h-¥lf-~one           to    quarter             to    two       in    the

afternoon.                    We    started             to       walk       down          the       tunnel       and       1    could          see       that

there       were          no       Stewards             or       Police          at       the       start       of    the       tunnel          or       in    it.

There       were          a    few       people          in       the       tunnel             but       we    had    no       problem          whatsoever

walking          down          the       tunnel,             and       I    can       safely             say    thatyl          didn't          see       any

fighting             or       drinking             in    the       Ground.




When     I got            out       of    the       tunnel             I saw          straight\a^way                  that          the    terracing                in

front       and       to       the       sides          of       the       tunnel          was          really       pafcked         it    was       heaving

so    I decided                to       stay       up    the       top          by    the       tunnel          entrance.                 I have          been

                 down    towards           the       front       of       the    terracing                by    the       pitch.          This

                started         at    about          quarler-to-two                   (1345)          and       it       continued         almost             all    the

                 pushing        and       jostling          and       although             you       c o u l d n ’t a c u t a l l y        go       where          you

                By     this     time       I had          managed          to    get          my    arms       free       and     I started              to    help

                 lift    people           up    towards          the       overhanging                 part         of    the Stand            above          and

people       in       there          were       pulling        people          uo f.        I must        have helped                five        or

six    people          up    I c a n ’t          remember           anthiyfg           about       them           then       someone        fi\om
                                                                              /        S& aJ& d                               ^JclkO
behind,          who    also          d i d n ’t    see       gfNabbed/me              and    pushed              me    up    into       the     Stand

above       and       somebody             grabbed        me       a .r Q /t w a s      p u lled         up       into       the    Stand.               I

stayed       right          at       the    front        of    the       Stand         and    I helped                 pull    some       others

up    and    over.           1 d i d n ’t          see    the       girl       I saw         faint        in       front       of    me     again.

I also       saw       at    this          time     that       the       Match         itself          had        been       stopped        but          I

didn't       actually                see    it     being       stopped.




I had       been       in    the          top    Stand,        helping            people          up     for       about       ten       minutes

when    I looked             at       the       front         of    the       terracing            and        I    could       see       the     gate

in    the    front          fence          was     open       and       the    people         in       the        terracing          were

rushing          towards             it    to    get     out.           Also      there       were        people             climbing          over

the    Fence          and    people             actually           getting          through            gate,           also    saw       that        by

this    time          there          were       hundreds           of    people         on    the        pitch          itself.           As     I

looked       on       I saw          that       people        were       being         passed          over        the       top    of    the

fence       by    the       people          in     the    terracing               to    the       people           on    the       pitch       side

of    the    fence.              One       of    the     people          being         passed          over        was       obviously           dead

because          he    was       all       limp     and       his       back      had       the    appearance                 of    being

broken.           All       I can          remember           about       him       was      that        he       was    between          ten        and

fourteen          and       had       dark       hair.




All    this       time       the          Notts     Forest          Fans       were         still        chanting             and    the

Liverpool             Fans       on       the    pitch        started          to      charged           towards             their       end     so

the    Police          put       a    cordon        across          the       half-way            line        to       stop    them.




I think          that       some          time     after       the       cordon         was       p ut    across             the    pitch        two

lads    in       the    Stand             where     I was          standing            started           to       argue       they       w e r e n ’t

fighting          just       a       heated        argument             and    eight         to    ten        coppeers             came     in       and

pulled       them       apart             I d o n ’t     think          they      took       them        away          with    them       but        I
                                                                                                                                        PAGE        6
                                                                                                                                        S 1206

             thought        it    was    a    bit       excessive         the       amount       of    Police       there    when       they

             coulcl h a v e       been       used       better      on    the       pitch       below.




             By    about     half~past-four                  (1630)       in    the       afternoon          I wanted       to    get    a

             drink    of     water       so    I started            to    make       my    way    to    the    back    of    the      Stand

             and    when     I got       to    the       back      into    a    cafeteria             that    had   been     left       open

             and    there        was    quite       a    few    people         in    there       but    it    was    then    that       I heard

             a Tannoy       announcement                 asking      people          to    leave       the    Ground,       so    I

             left    the    Ground           and    went       straight         back       to    the    car,




             I d i d n ’t   get        injured          in   the    incident,             and    I d i d n ’t s e e    any       deaths,       at

             least    I d o n ’t t h i n k          I did       whilst         I was       in    the    ground.

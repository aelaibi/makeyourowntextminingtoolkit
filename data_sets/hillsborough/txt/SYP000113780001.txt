              On Saturday,          15 April,          1989,    (150489),      I c o m menced duties at 8 . 4 5 a m

              there at a p p r o x i m a t e l y 9 . 3 0 a m     (0930).

              At    10.0 0 a m    (1000)      that day     1 took my        seat    in the N o r t h          stand,        along

              At    11.0 0 a m    (1100)      that day I com m e n c e d my a s s i g n e d duties                patro l l i n g

              Edwards,       assigned         six of the serial            to the     corridor       patrol         and the

              other     four      officers      to tur n s t i l e   duties at        the L e p p i n g s Lane             entrance

              Those     of us w o r k i n g     the upper        corridor      had been         i n f ormed of a robbery

              that    had t a k e n place at the               previous y e a r ' s Semi Final match,                      a n d we

              had been w a r n e d       to    pay p a rticular a t t e n t i o n to the            r e f r e shment         booths

              a n d also     to a b e t t i n g       booth.

              During      the first        hour up to the t u r n s t i l e s         opening at             12 noon,        PC

              Marsh and          I spoke      to the     personnel        open i n g the     r e f r e shment       booths,           in

              part i c u l a r    to those      setting up a sales a r e a on a g roup of tables,

assist       in closing           the    ’booth*.        We a l s o       spoke       to some of the

stewards,           i n f ormed    t hem of our         patrol         a r e a an d     instr u c t e d them to

contact us           in the       event     of a n y    trouble.

From     12 noon,        the t u r n s t i l e s w ere open,              but there was a slow trickle

of fans        coming up to the top                corridor.              At some time              s h o r t l y after

12.00,      we spoke          to P S E d w a r d s an d an            Inspector.             The    Inspector a s k e d

for one of us to               stay w i t h the staff                 of the    betting            b ooth at 3 , 0 0 p m

(1500)      until       the    taki n g s    had been       coun t e d up, an d then escort                       the

staff t h r o u g h the           corridor,       down to the             rear of the stand,                  acr o s s the

front      of the S p i o n Kop,            at the side          of the        pitch,         and a l o n g    the       front

of the S o u t h s tand            into the       players*            e n t rance     to a room where all                  the

m o n e y was       to be     collected.          The    offi c e r was then to resume to the

N o r t h Stand.

After      speaking         to the       Inspector,       PC M a r s h and             I deci d e d that we w ould

work the duty together,                     f o llowing     the        standard match               p r o cedure of

always working              in pairs        for safety.

Until      2.00pm       (1400)      there was a st e a d y              but slow            influx     of fans.

During       that time the              fans we    saw were            b e h aving          in a reasonable

manner,       none a p p e a r e d to be the w orse                    for drink.             Some     of those fans

did speak           to us,     m a i n l y about       the match,          and all           that    did a p p e a r e d

f r i e n d l y and     in a n t i c i p a t i o n of an e n t e r t a i n i n g match.

At 2 . 0 0 p m      (1400)     I left PC M a r s h at the                 bottom of one              of the     flights

of steps           leading     to the       seating area.               I w a l k e d to the           top and       looked

to the S p i o n K o p         end of the gr o u n d a n d              being a life               long

Wednesday           supporter,          my t h o ughts    on looking            at the Ko p were that                     it

looked a m a g n i f i c e n t          sight w h e n    it was         full.         I was aware          that      it was

not full           to capacity,          but the       fans were          evenly d i s t r i b u t e d a n d         I

es t i m a t e d    that the K o p was a bout             three         quarters            full.      I then looked

to the L e p p i n g s Lan e            stand and a l t h o u g h         there were a lot of L i verpool

         fans     in that       stand,        it seemed to be           less than half               full.

         I then      resumed       patrol w i t h PC M a r s h a l o n g            the    corridor.          From

         a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 . 15pm    (1415)     the volume            of fans     entering         the   corridor

         increased        c o n s iderably.           It was a p p a r e n t       that m a n y of t h e m had been

         drinking,        a l t h o u g h at first,          there was          no m a r k e d    change i n the

         general        attitude        of the fans.

         At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 . 2 0 p m    (1420) we were a p p r o a c h e d by a s t e w a r d who

         informed us that               some    of the L i v e r p o o l        fans were         climbing over the

         fence,      b e t w e e n the Wes t         (Leppings Lane)             stand an d the N o r t h stand.

         T o g e t h e r w i t h PC Marsh,           I went    to the       top of the s t a i r w a y a n d w a t c h e d

         for a few seconds,                after w h i c h a y o u t h was            seen to climb over the

         fence     from the W est             stand     into the N o r t h stand.                 PC M a r s h an d    I

         approached         the y o u t h and d e t a i n e d him under                 the ground          regulations.

         He   p r o duced to us a ticket                 for the N o r t h stand,                stating that         he had

         been     let    into    the W est s t a n d on that               ticket.         The ticket         had the

         counterfoil          stub missing.

         We   escorted        the y o u t h down to the            charge          office        below the      stand,

         w h e r e we a s c e r t a i n e d that he was           called                               iI             I--.ofr
                                               Liverpojol.        On se a r c h i n g                    PC M a r s h found a

         se c o n d ticket       for     the West        stand    in his         pocket.          This    ticket also           had

         the stub missing.

         Having      con f i r m e d    by tel e p h o n e that        the y o u t h was who he said he was,

         we e s c o r t e d him to the L e p p i n g s L ane               end of the ground.                 It   is normal

         practice        to eject        such       people    from the ground by means of the                          large

         metal     double       gates      s i t uated at the sides                of the t u r nstile          blocks.          Qn

         approaching          the t u r n s t i l e s    from the N o r t h stand,                we a p p r o a c h e d the

         gates d i r e c t l y to the           right     of the turnstiles.                     Looking     t h r o u g h the

         g lass    panel,       I could see that there w e r e L i verpool                           fans    pressed       right

         up to the        gate,        a n d that     if the gate was              opened,        a large     q u a n t i t y of

         t hem w o u l d gain entry.                 I could not        see how far back                 from the door

the body of fans extended.                       We w a l k e d    by the turnstiles,               towards the

dividing        fence     separating          the West       stand entrances              from the N o r t h

stand entrances.                As    I passed the          turnstiles,        there was a fan in one

of them s h o u t i n g at           the operator        that he was         unable        to go back out of

the turnstile.              I did not hear w h y he                could not be           let t h r o u g h into

the ground.

We    passed t h r o u g h      the barrier w h i c h had been opened by a steward*                               and

I saw that the            large blue gates              i m m e d i a t e l y to my right w e r e also .

being       pushed a g a i n s t       by a large number            of fans on the outside.                   I

the n looked a c r o s s         the en c l o s u r e to the double              gates      s i t u a t e d a long

the wall a d j a c e n t        to the a p p r o a c h to the S o u t h stand.                 I could see

that two o f f i c e r s were           eject i n g a n o t h e r y o u t h from the ground,                 I saw

them start to           close those           gates,     and shou t e d to them to h old them

open.        We a d v i s e d                that he s h o u l d not try            to re-enter      the ground

a n d e j e c t e d him t h r o u g h the door.             A l t h o u g h there     had been a large

number       of fans      pressed agai n s t          the    other     double       gates,     on    looking out

of this gate,           the     crowd seemed the same as w ould be seen on a normal

Saturday.

I recall        that w h e n we were            leading                out of the          gate,     there were

a group of fans             inside      the ground          s h o u t i n g at a group o f fans through

the open gate.             The e x c h a n g e s were        of a t h r e a t e n i n g    nature.      One

youth       in p a rticular          on the     inside      of the    ground was very agitated.                      I

On   ret u r n i n g to the a p p r o a c h           to the N o r t h stand,         it wa s a p p a r e n t that

the volume          of fans       entering        the       pitch had       i n creased tremendously*                       We

The number          of fans       on that        corridor       had     i n creased considerab ly,                 again

At 2 . 5 0 p m     <1450)     PC M a r s h a n d       I took     up a posit i o n next to the

betting      booth to a w a i t          its     closure,       an d    prevent a last mi n u t e

from the L e p p i n g s        Lane     end to the S p i o n H o p end.                He was        being

assisted         by a P o l i c e w o m a n ,    but a se c o n d y o u t h was w a l k i n g           behindi

a d v i s e d him r e g a r d i n g     his     conduct.        At     first    he a p p e a r e d    to want          to

fight     but then         changed his mind.                  I a g a i n a d v i s e d him before

During     the      next    few minutes,              the    number     of fans      coming a l o n g        the

s t a nding at the door                to the     booth,       we were a p p r o a c h e d       by a middle

a g e d m a n and woman,            who made          us a ware      of the extent         of the          crowd

waiting      to get        into     the ground at             the L e p p i n g s Lane end.            The woman

in fact made           r e ference       to the         Heysel     S t a d i u m d i saster.         PC M a r s h did

not have a radio              but      I had my         personal        radio wit h me. At that            time

there was a certain amount                       of     radio     traffic, some of          it       concerning

the fans w a i t i n g to enter the                     gr o u n d at    that end.

This w o u l d have         bee n just a fter               the game had started.                We    could tell

    along        the    corridor,        the     numbers       had not decreased.                 This wa s         not

    unusual,           as at m ost m a t c h e s        it     is common for the            last    ruth to

    that     it was a n y t h i n g other than a                    crowd     invasion.

    A group of fans at the                      rear of the          s t a i r w a y shou t e d that the            invasion

    was the         ’P o l i c e ’s f a u l t ’ .      I a p p r o a c h e d them and spoke           to them,

    informing them that                  the s i t u a t i o n w o u l d      be dealt w i t h as s o o n as

    possible,           an d that       the    game w o u l d then           continue.       As    I tu r n e d to walk

    derogatory            remarks,       but     I ignored them an d                returned to PC H a r s h              in

    the    corridor.

    We were         then a p p r o a c h e d by a few L i v e r p o o l             supporters,       who     complained

    about        the a t t i t u d e   and actions            of some        of their      fellow fans.             One        of

    the s u p p o r t e r s a y oung man               in his       e a r l y twenties st a t e d that              he had

    me,    but stopped.                The man      informed us that in the                   event    of any

    trouble         he w o u l d as s i s t      us,    inti m a t i n g     that    he was a P o l i c e     officer

    from L i verpool.

ordinary occurrence.                    I could hear            that there was a con s i d e r a b l e

a m o u n t of     radio traffic,               a l t h o u g h because     of the      loud crowd noise*                 I.

could not a s c e r t a i n what was                   happening

I have a t t e n d e d at          numerous         f o o t b a l 1 m a t c h e s an d also w o r k e d i o n a

have    been s u b j e c t e d to threats of v i o l e n c e an d even thre a t s of

murder.          In s o m e     of those         cases the threats were at the time meant

however      I have         never      been s u b j e c t e d to such feelings                   of ha t r e d a n d      it

was a p p a r e n t      that    the threats w o u l d soon became a reality

number     of fans t h r e a t e n i n g           us were       increasing all           the time.          There

were    in excess           of t h i r t y shout i n g at           us, a n d m a n y more m i l l i n g a r o u n d

at the     rear        of the      group.          It was      obvious      that we were            out   on a limb

an d to ask           for a s s i s t a n c e    was    not    only futile but wrong,                  so we

d e c i d e d to      leave     our    position.          At that time           I was     in fear        of my

life.      I can say that               I have         been more       f r i g h t e n e d but    only one other

occasion,          when     s t a nding 25 y ards             from an u n e x p l o d e d G e r m a n     bomb found

near the Bramall                Lane Football            Ground.         I have     never        been so a f r a i d

for my     life        from other         people        before.

PC M a r s h and         I w a l k e d away          from the       crowd towards the K o p end of the

it was futile to                return to the            corridor,        so we went         down the        ramp to

assist.          At    the b o t t o m of the           ramp,     I lost     contact w i t h PC Marsh.

           q u i c k l y to the      gap    leading onto the             pitch,      and saw two        people being

           brought     from the         pitch on bro k e n hoardings.                   An ambulance         th e n came

           up behind me an d an              Inspector            s h o u t e d for the gate to be cleared.

           I lo o k e d at the first              person       being     carried out on a              hoard ing. It w a *

           a   large w h i t e male,         about      13     stone,     I w o u l d guess. His        red Jumper

           was   pulled over          his head,         he     had no clothing           on his        chest*



                         I took       one    look at him and thought                   ’H e ’s d e a d ’ .   The second

           pe r s o n was alive.            I did not         pay m u c h a t t e n t i o n to him,        there were

           several      people       c a r rying    him,      an d    I could hear him screaming.

           As the a m b u l a n c e was          trying      to get     onto the       pitch,     a man w a l k e d

           across     the front         of the vehicle.                I pulled him a way f r o m the front of,

           the vehicle,          to the outside              of the gate ac r o s s        that     gap.      The man

           another ambulance               came out,         so    I had to wait a few seconds.                     I. then

           w a l k e d q u i c k l y onto    the    pitch.           At the    corner near the gap,                leading

           off the      pitch,       there were a lot of                people       laid on the      grass,        several

           of them were o b v i o u s l y          dead,      others were        being tended to by other

           officers,          fans and St.         Johns      people.         T here were     people a r o u n d each

           of t hose      laid out,         and    I r e a l i s e d that      I could be of better                use at

           the L e p p i n g s Lane        end of the         pitch.

           I felt that          I did not want to be near what was                         h a ppening       but    I had to

      ''   do what      I could.           All    the   feeli n g s of fear had e v a p o r a t e d when              I went

           to get on-the          pitch,         but a feeling          of a p p r e h e n s i o n had taken        its

place.         I w o n d e r e d what was     the     best     thing      to do,        a n d d e c i d e d to

fo l l o w a g r o u p who were         carrying a m a k e s h i f t          str e t c h e r up, the       pitch.

I ran along w i t h them,              but w h e n    I got       to the L e p p i n g s L a n e end of the

p itch I could not            get near the fence               due to the          large volume            of

people a n d the         c o n fused nature          of the       incident.         T h e r e were        people

w a l k i n g about as       if nothing        had happened,             some obi i v i o u s       to the d e a d ;

an d   injured,       others     obviously        in shock.             I s t a r t e d to    look a r o u n d for.

some w a y to get         i n v olved but a f t e r a few seconds,                      a senior        officer

was s h o uting       for a line to form a c r o s s               the     centre of the            pitch,       so I

went     to join the         line.       I stood      next     to PC 41 Bellamy,                an d other

officers          I did not know.           At first       I could not see the use of the

line     but w i t h the      confused nature            of the         events,     it became obvious

that     not      only were we keeping the               few      idiotic        fans    from      inciting

t r o u b l e by going       to the Forest           s upporters,          but    it was a point from

w h i c h o f f icers    could be taken to as s i s t                in other areas,               as    in fact

later     happened.

While      in the     line,    I was       facing     the L i v e r p o o l      end.      I saw        people

ob v i o u s l y d istressed,        but    only a few feet awa y from them were                            others

that w ere         unaware    of the       situation.          I saw one g r o u p of three

Liv e r p o o l   supporters        o b v i o u s l y drunk,      one    of them openly u r i n a t i n g on

the    pitch       in front    of other fans.              S ome     of the       people were           screaming

at us that we were m u r d e r e r s a n d vent i n g                   extreme a nger at us.                   I kne w

that     it was a r e a c t i o n to the s i t u a t i o n and there were times when                                  in

dif f e r e n t   situations        firm a c t i o n w o u l d     have been taken,                but not under

the    circumstances          prevailing.

I also saw that the              fans      in the N o r t h       stand were        b e c oming m ore and

more    i r r a t e # an d n o t i c e d at    least     two      fights a m o n g s t       the    fans.        On

just    pointing at the              crowd and talking.                   There were        o f f icers       on both

sides of the            line    talking       to an d a s s i s t i n g      people.

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 4 . 10pm       (1610)      we were        o r d e r e d onto P e n i i t o n e R o a d a#

the d e c i s i o n to clear          the gr o u n d had b een made.                     Once onto      the road I

h e l p e d make a cordon across                 the      road,       to keep all         the Fo r e s t      fans

from walking along Penistona Road away                                 from the       city.       I c o ntinued

doing that until               the fans had all             cleared,         and then stood             in front        of

the e n t rance         to the ground,           that leads            to th® N o r t h s t a o d a-fid

traf f i c    flowing        in order to          reduce        the    bottl e n e c k    closer to the          city.

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 7 . 0 0 p m    (1900)      I went        back    into the ground,             and onto

the N o r t h stand,           where most         of the        other     officers who           had been at the

m a t c h were     situated.           After a few minutes,                  I went       to the      rear of the

s t a n d where      I met P o l i c e S e r g e a n t      752 Batty.              It was d e c i d e d that the

area officers who               had been at the m a t c h and were w o r k i n g a 6pm 2am

st a nding at the side               of the g y m n a s i u m w h e n         I saw Special           Constable

M a r t i n stood w i t h a group of Spec i a l                   C onstables.               It was     obvious that

she was very d i s t r e s s e d and              I walked        over       to her.          I took her             toone

side,     and she         i m m e d i a t e l y burst     into tears.           She        was sobbing

uncontrollably.                At P S B a t t y ’s s u g g e s t i o n       I took        her into      the         Police

room,     where      after m a k i n g her a cup of tea,                      and    listening to what               she

had done,        she s u d d e n l y said she was alright,                      we w a l k e d    out    into the

a r e a next to the            gymnasium,         where     she       said    "I've got to go back               in".

She    then w a l k e d awa y from me              into the           building.

                had      been w ar ne d        to    pay        particular          attention           to     the   refreshment           booths

                and also         to    a betting              booth.

erected           especially                for     the      day.        We    informed             them          that       in the         event

of a n y      problems              with       customers,               they       were       to    contact             us    a n d we         would

assist        in       closing           the      ’b o o t h ’ .        We    also       spoke          to    s o me     of       the

stewards,              informed             them       of    our       patrol       area and             i nst r u c t e d         them        to

contact           us    in the           event         of a n y        trouble.

From      12 noon,             th e      turnstiles               were       open,       but       there          was    a    slow        trickle

of     fans       coming          up     to    the      top       corridor.              At    some          t im e     shortly after

12.00,         we       spoke       to P S E d w a r d s           and an           Inspector.                 The       Inspector             asked

for     one       of    us     to      stay with             the       staff       of    the       betting            booth        at 3 » 0 0 p m

(1500)        until          the       takings          had       been       counted          up,       and       then       escort         the

staff        through          the        corridor,               down    to    t he      rear       of       the      stand,        across            the

front        of     the      Spion          Kop,       at    the       side    of       the    pitch,             and    along          the        f r o nt

of     the    South          stand          into       the       players’ entrance                      to a       room where               all       the

money        was       to    be     collected.                   The    officer          was       then       to      resume         to     the

N o rth S t a n d .

After        speaking             to     the      Inspectors,            PC    Marsh          and       I decided             t h at      we       would

work      the      duty       together,                following             the    standard match                      procedure              of

always        working             in     pairs         for       safety.

Until        2.00pm          (1400)           there         was    a steady             but    slow          influx          of    fans.

During        that          time       the     f a ns       we    saw were          behaving             in a         reasonable

manner,           none       appeared             to    be       the    worse       for       dri n k.            Some       of    those           fans
                                                                                                                                                    \
did     speak          to    us,       mainly          about       the       match,       a n d all           t h at     did a p p e a r e d

friendly           and       in a n t i c i p a t i o n           of a n      entertaining                   match.

At     2.00pm          (1400)          I left          PC    M a r s h at      the       bottom          of       one    of       the     flights

of     steps       leading             to     the      seating          area.           I walked             to    the       top and           looked

to     the S p i o n         Kop       end     of      the       ground       and       being       a    life         long        Sheffield

Wednesday              supporter,              my      thoughts          on    looking          at       the       Kop       were       that        it

looked a magnificent                           sight         when       it w a s        full.           I wa s        aware        t ha t      it was

n ot    full       to       capacity,             but       the    f a ns     were       evenly          distributed and                       I

estimated              that       th e      Kop was          about       three          quarters             full.           I then         looked

                                                                                                                                             R305

to     the    Leppings             Lane          stand and a lt hough                   there          were       a    lot       of L i v e r p o o l

fans        in t h at     stand,             it    seemed          to     be    less         than      half       full.

I then        resumed          patrol             with       PG M a r s h       along         the      corridor.                 From

approximately                 2 . 15pm           (1415)       the       volume         of     fans        entering           the       corridor

increased           considerably.                       It w a s ;appa'rent                  t h at   many        of    them          had       been

drinking,,          although                at    fir st ,        there        was     no     marked         change          in the

general           attitude          of t h e           fans.

At     approximately                2.20pm             (1420)       we     were        approached                by a       steward             wh o

informed           us    that       some          of    the       Liverpool            f an s      were      climbing             ov e r        the

fence,        between          the          West       (Leppings           Lane)         stand and               the N o r t h         st an d.

Together           with       PC    Marsh,             I went       to     the        to p    of      the    stairway             and watched

for     a few seconds,                      after       which a youth                  was        seen      to    climb          over       the

fence        from       the    West          stand        into      the        North         s t an d .      PC       Marsh       and       I

approached              the    youth             and    detained           him        under        the      ground          regulations.
                                                                    /'■
He     produced          to    us       a    ticket          forythe           North         st an d,       stating          that       he        h ad

been        let    into       the       West       st a ntfr on         that      ticket.              The       ticket          had    the

counterfoil              stub       m i s s in g,

We     escorted          the       youth          down       to    the     charge            office         below, the            stand,

where        we a s c e r t a i n e d ^ h a t            he       was     called                                                            o f

second        ticket          for       the W e s t          stand        in hi s       pocket.              This       ticket          also           had

th e    stub missing.

Having         confirmed            by       telephone             that        th e    youth was             who       he    said       he was,

we     escorted         him        to       the    Leppings             Lane     end         of    the      ground.              It    is       n or m a l

practice           to    eject          such       people          from        the     ground          by m e a n s         of    the       lar g e

metal        double       gates             situated          at    the        sides         of    the      turnstile             blocks.                On

approaching              the       turnstiles                from       the N o r t h         stand,         we a p p r o a c h e d          the

gates        directly          to       the       righ t      of    the        turnstiles.                  Looking          through             the

glass        panel,       I could                see    t h at     there        were         Liverpool            f a ns     pressed             rig ht

up     to    the    gate,          and       that       if    the       gate     was         opened,         a    la rge         quantity              of

them would              gain       entry.              I could         not       see       how        far    b ac k     from        the       door

the     body       of    fans          extended.                We    walked          by       the     turnstiles,                towards           the

dividing           fence          separating              the W e s t           stand          entrances              from    th e       North

stand      entrances.                   As       I passed            the    turnstiles,                 there          was    a fan           in one

of     them      shouting              at    the       operator            that       he wa s          unable          to    go     b a ck     out    of

the; t u r n s t i l e -           I did          not      hear       why       he    could           not    be       let    through           into

t he    ground.

We     passed         through           the       barrier            which       had       been        opened          by a s t e w a r d ,          and

I saw      that         the       large          b l ue    gates       immediately                    to m y      rig ht      were        also

being      pushed against                        by a      l a r ge    number             of    fans        on    the       outside.            I

then     looked          across             the     enclosure              to    the       double           gates       situated              along

the     w a ll     adjacent             to       the      approach          to       the       South        sta n d.         I could           see

that     two       officers             were        ejecting           another             youth        from          the    ground,           I sa w

them      start         to    close          those         gates,          and       shouted           to    them       to    hold        them

open.         We      advised)                         [t hat    he    should             not     try       to    re-enter           the       ground

and     ejected          hi m      through             the      door.           Although              there       had       been     a    large

number        of      fans        pressed against                     the       other          double        ga te s ,       on     looking          out

of     this      gate,        the       crowd          seemed         the       same       as     would          be    seen       on a n or m a l

Saturday.

I r ec a l l       that       when          we    were       leading                           out     of    the       gate,        there       were

a    group       of     fans       inside           the      ground         shouting             at a g r o u p of                fans        through

the     open       g ate.          The       exchanges               were       of    a threatening                    nature.            One

youth      in      particular                on the          inside         of       the       ground was              very       agitated.               I

remember           that       he w a s           a white         male       approximately                    6 f e et        tal l .          In his

Predominnantly                    brown.          There         were       one       or    two        other       f an s     with        h i m who

appeared           to    be       drunk.            Others           in t h a t       area        were       similarly              the       worse

On    returning              to    th e    approach              to    the    North            sta nd ?        it w a s        apparent           that

the    volume           of    fans        entering           the       pitch        had        increased             tremendously.                     We

stopped        and       spoke        to       two       programme           sellers             near      to    the       turnstiles,

before      returning               to     the       upper        corridor            at       S.35pm          (1435).

The    number           of    fans        on    that        corridor          had         increased             considerably,                    again

m-any of       them          appeared           to       have     consumed            a     considerable                  amount           of

alcohol,        although              not       in the           majority,            some        of      the    fans          appeared           in

an a g g r e s s i v e        mood.

At    E.50pm        (1450)          PC     Marsh and              1 took          up a         position           next         to    the

betting        booth          to a w a i t          its     closure,          and         prevent          a    last       minute

snatch.         1 saw PS              Edwards             escorting           a     prisoner              along       the       corridor

from     the    Leppings              Lane          end     to    the    Spion Kop                end.          He    was       being

assisted        by a P o l i c e w o m a n ,                but       a second            youth        was      walking             behind

them,     arguing             with        other          officers.            I approached                     the    youth          and

advised        him       regarding              his        conduct.           At      first         he a p p e a r e d          to w a n t        to

fight     but       then          changed           his     mind.        I again               advised          him       before

returning           to P C         Marsh.

During      the         next       few     minutes*              the    number            of     f a ns    coming          along           the

corridor        continued                 to    increase.               Many        of      them       running            to    the

stairways           in o r d e r          to    find        their       seats.              At    3.00         (1300)          the     betting

booth     closed             and    th e       staff,started                 to     check         the      takings.                 While

standing        at       the       door        to    the     boo th ,        we     were         approached               by a m i d d l e

in fa c t      made          reference              to    the         Heysel        Stadium disaster.                          PC M a r s h       did

that    the       game       had       commenced,             due       to    the       volume          of    noise.           There        was

one    particular             loud          roar       and    from       the       sound          it w as      apparent            t ha t     one

of    the    teams        had      just       missed          the       g oal.          There          were     still       fans        running

along       the     corridor,               the    numbers          had       no|/decreased.                       This     was      not

I did       not     see      anyone          who       was    apparently                injured,             nor     could      1 tell

was    the     "Police's               fault*.           I approached                   them and             spoke     to      them,

killed          their       friends          and     then       they      started        to    threaten               our       lives.

ordinary             occurrence.               I could          hear      that     there       was        a    considerable

amount          of    radio       traffic,           although           because           of the l o u d c r o w d              n oi s e ,         I

could       not       ascertain           what       was     happening.

I have          attended          at, n u m e r o u s      football         matches            and also w o r k e d               on        a

support          unit       during        the M i n e r s *        Dispute.               In b o t h       circumstances I

have       been       subjected           to    threats           of    violence         and        even       threats           of

murder.              In s o m e     of    those          cases      the    threats        were           at    the     t i me      meant,

however          I have        never         been        subjected         to     such     feelings              of    hatred and                  it

was    apparent             that      the      threats          would      soon     become           a    reality.               The

number           of     fans t h r e a t e n i n g        us.were         increasing               all the       t ime.           There

decided          to    leave        our      position.             At     that     time       I was           in f e a r        of m y

As     the    ambulance             was       trying          to    get    onto      the        pitch,          a man           walked

across        the       front       of       the      vehicle.            I pulled            him away              from        the     front       of

the     vehicle,             to    the       outside          of    the    gate      across             that        gap.         The     man

                         t ha t     were          unaware            of    the       situation.                   I s a w one          group         of      three

                        Liverpool                 supporters               obviously               drunk,          one       of     them       openly            urinating              on

                        the       pitch           in f r o n t        of    other            fans.           Some       of     the     people           were          screaming

                        at     us     that         we    were         murderers               and       venting          extreme            anger           at    us.         I knew

                        t ha t      it w a s        a     reaction              to      the       situation             and       there        were         times          when        in

                        different                 situations               firm action would                        have          been      ta k e n ,       but       not        under

seemed        to    be a          lot    of    people         milling             about       doing         nothing.              Near       the

players"           tunnel          were       a number            of    people          in y e l l o w       UMBRO        jackets,

just    pointing              at    the       crowd and            talking.               There        were       officers           on b o t h

sides     of       the       line       talking         to a n d a s s i s t i n g            pe ople.

At.approximately                    4. ,10pm (1610)                we w ere          ordered           onto       P e n i s t o n e R o a d as

from walking                 along       Penistone            Road away              from        the     city.          I continued

doing     t ha t        until       th e      f an s    h a d all        cleared*             and      then       stood        in f r o n t        of

the    entrance              to    the     ground,           that       leads        to     the     North         stand and

controlled              the       traffic          flow along            Penistone               R o ad ,    keeping           the      r oa d

At    approximately                 7.00pm          (1900)         I went          b a ck     into       the      ground,          and       o nt o

the    North        stand,          where          most      of    the       other        officers           who     had       b e e n at        the

match     were          situated.              After         a few       minute                                     the      rear       of    the

shift     would          work       together.                Whilst          waiting          for      orders        we      were

standing           at    the       side       of    the      gymnasium             when       I s aw S p e c i a l           Constable

Martin        stood          with a        group        of S p e c i a l          Constables.                     It w a s     o b v i o u s t ha t

she    wa s    very          distressed and                  I walked             over      to    her.             I took         her        to one

side,    and        she       immediately               burst          into       tears.          Sh e       was sobbing

uncontrollably.                     At     P S B a t t y ’s s u g g e s t i o n             I t oo k          her i nt o          the        Police

had    done,        she       suddenly             said      she       was    alright,            we w a l k e d        out       into       the

area    next        to       the    gymnasium,               where       she       said       "I'v e        got    to     go      back       in".

She    then walk e d               away       f r o m me      into       the       building.

E N D OF   REPORT
PHILIP BDNGAY   P.G. 184?   E2       Area Constable.


   On Saturday 15th April 1989* I commenced duties at 8.45am at Woodseats Police
Station, and at 9«00am that day I was transported to the Sheffield Wednesday Football
Ground, arriving there at approximately 9•30am.
   At 10.00am that day I took my seat in the North Stand, along with the other officers
in serial 11, and stayed until the match briefing had concluded.
   At 11.00am that day, I commenced my assigned duties patrolling the tipper corridor
of the North Stand, in company with Police Constable 1506 Marsh. The serial Sergeant,
Police Sergeant 2279 Edwards, assigned six of the aerial to the corridor patrol, and
the other four officers to turnstile duties at the Leppings Lane entranced.
   Those of us working the upper corridor had been informed of a robbery that had taken
place at the previous years Semi Final match, and we had been warned to pay particular
attention to the refreshment booths and also to a betting booth.
   During the first hpur up to the turnstiles opening at 12.00 noon, P.C. Marsh and
I spoke to the personel opening the refreshment booths, in particular to those setting
up a sales area on a group of tables, errected especially for the day. We informed them
that in the event of any problems with customers, they were to contact us and we would
assist in closing the ’booth’. We also spoke to some of the stewards, informed them of
our patrol area, and instructed them to contact us in the event of any trouble.
   From 12.00noon, the turnstiles were open , but there was a slow trickle of fans
coming up to the top corridor. At some time shortly after 12.00, we spoke to P.S* Edwards
and an Inspector. The inspector asked for one of us to stay with the staff of the
betting booth at 3.00pm, until the takings had been counted up, and then escort the
staff through the corridor, down to the rear of the stand, accross the front of the
Spion Kop, at the side of the Pitch, and along the front of the Sogrth Stand into the
Players Entrance to a room where all the money was to be collected. The. officer was then
to resume to the North Stand*
    After speaking to the inspector, P.C. Marsh and I decided thatbwe would work the duty
together, following the standard match procedure of always working in pairs for safety.
    Until 2.00pm, there was a steady but slow influx of fans, During that time the fans
we saw were behaving in a reasonable manner, none appeared to be the worse for drink.
Some of those fans did speak to us, mainly about the match, and all that did appeared
friendly and in anticipation of an entertaining match.
    At 2.00pm I left P.C. Marsh at the bottom of one of the flights of steps leading
to the seating area. I walked to the top and looked to the Spion Kop end of the Ground,
and being a life long Sheffield Wednesday Supporter, my thoughts on looking at the Kop
were tkat 1% looked a magnificent sight when it was full. I was aware that it was not
full to capacity, but the fans were evenly distributed, and I estimated that the Kop
was abotit three quarters full. I then looked to the Leppings Lane Stand, and although
there were a lot of Liverpool Fans in that Stand,it seemed to be less than half full.
    I then resumed patrol with P.C. Marsh along the corridor. From approximately 2.15pm
the volume of fans entering the corridor increased considerably. It was apparent that
many of them had been drinking, although at first, there was no marked change in the
general attitude of the fans.
    At approximately 6,20pm we wesee approached by a steward who informed us that some of
the liiverpool fans were climbing over the fence, between the West ( Leppings Lane )
Stand, and the North Stand. Together With P.C. Marsh, I went to the top of the Stairway
and watched for a few seconds, after which a youth was seen to climb over the fence
from the West Stand into the North Stand. P.C. Marsh and I approached the youth and
detained him under the ground regulations. He produced to us a ticket for the North
stand, stating that he had been let into the West Stand on that ticket. The ticket had
the counterfoil stab missing.
    We escorted the youth down to the charge office below the stand, where we ascertained
that he was called               [        of ]
                                            \                         Liverpool. On
searching         P.C. Marsh found a second ticket for the West Stand in his pocket .
This ticket also had the stub missing.
    Having confirmed by telephone that the youth was who he said he was, we escorted him
to the leppings lane end of the ground. It is normal practice to eject such people from
the ground by means of the large metal double gates situated at the sides of the
turnstile blocks. On approaching the turnstiles from the North stand, we approached the
gates direetly to the right of the turnstiles. Looking through the glass panel, I could
see* that there were Liverpool fans pressed right up to the gate, and that if the gate was
opened, a large quantity of them would gain entry* I could not see how far back from the
door the body of fans extended. We walked by the turnstiles, towards the dividing fence
seperating the West Stand entrances from the North Stand entrances. As I passed the
turnstiles, there was a fan in one of them shouting at the operator that he was unable
to go back out of the turnstile, I did not hear why he could not be let through into the
ground.
     We passed through the barrier which had been opened by a steward, and I saw that the
large blue gates immediately to my right were also being pushed against by a large number
of fans on the outside, I then looked accross the enclosure to the double gates
situated along the wall adjacent to the approach to the south stand, I could see that
two officers were ejecting another youth from the ground, I saw them start to close
those gates, and shouted to them to hold them open. We advised          that he should not
try to reenter the ground, and ejected him through the door. Although there had been a
large number of fans pressed against the other double gates* on looking out of this
gate, the crowd seemed the same as would be seen on a normal Saturday.
     I recall that when we were l e a d i n g o u t of the gate, there were a gropp of fans
inside the ground shouting at a gruop of fans thruogh the open gate. The exchanges were
of a threatening nature. One youth in particular on the inside of the ground was very
agitated, I remember that he was a white male approximately 6feet tall. In his late
twenties, with short dark hair. He was wearing a pair of brown trousrea, and an old
style sports jacket with a small check pattern. Predominantly brown. There were one or
two other fans with him who appeared to be drunk. Others in that area were similarly the
worse for drink, but there were too many to deal with, and as the time was 2^30pm, P.O.
Marsh and I decided to return to the upper corrider, to attend at the betting booth.
     On returning the the approach to the North Stand, it was apparent that the volume of F
fans entering the pitch had increased tremendously. We stopped and spoke to two programme
sellers ner to the turnstiles, before returning to the upper corridoD at2.35Pm «
     The number of fans on that corridor had increased considerably, again many of them app
appeared to have consumed a considerable amount of alcohol'* Although not in the majority,
some of the fans appeared in an aggressive mood.
     At 2.50pm, P.C. Marsh and I took up a position next to the betting booth, to await
its closure, and prevent a last minite snatch. I saw P.S. Edwards escorting a prisoner
along the corrider from the leppings lane end to the Spion Kop end. He was being assisted
by a Police Woman, but a second youth was walking behind them, arguing with the officers#
I approached the youth and advised him regarding his conduct. At first he appeared to want
to fight, but then changed his mind, I again advised him before returning to P.C. Marsh,
     During the next few minutes, the number of fans coming along the corridor continued
to increase. Many of them running to the stairways in order to find there seata*f At 3.00
pm, the betting booth closed, and the staff started to check the takings. While standing
at the door to the booth, we were approached by a middle aged man and woman, who made
us aware of the extent of the crowd waiting to get Into the ground at the leppings lane
end. The woman in fact made reference to the Heysel Stadium Disaster. P.C. Marsh did
not have a radio, but I had my personal radiowith me. At that time there was a certain
amount of radio traffic, some of it concerning the ftma waiting to enter the ground
at that end.
      This would have been just after the game had started. We could tell that the game
had commenced, due to the volume of noise. There was o ne particular loud roar and from
the sound it was apparent that one of the teams had just missed the goal* There were
still fans running along the corridor, the numbers had not decreased. This was not
unusual, as at most matches it is common for the last rush to continue for five minutes
after the game has commenced*
      The first indication that anything was wrong was when a steward came down and
informed us that there had been a crowd invasion. We cciPLd then sense the difference in
the crowd noise, I walked to the top of the nearest stairwell, just in time to see the
players walking from the pitch, and a large crowd on the pitch near to the leppings
lane end, Ther were officers running accros the pitch to the crowd, but I did not see
anyone who was apparently injured, nor could I tell that it was anything other than a
crowd invasion.
      A Group of fans at the rear of the stairway shouted that the invasion was the
 *P©lice's Fault*, I approached them, and spoke to them, informing them that the
  situation would be dealt with as soon as possible, and that the game would then
  continue, as I turned to walk away, there were shouts of *Fuck Off* ; Fucking
  Bastard*and other derogatory remarks, but I ignored them and returned to P.C. Marsh
in the corridor.
    We were then approached by a few Liverpool,supporters, who complained, about the
attitude and actions of some of there fellow fans* One of the Supporters a young man
in his early twenties stated that he had seen the fans shouting at me, and that one of
them had moved towards me, but stopped. The man informed is that in the event of any
trouble he would assist usf Intimating that he was a Police Officer from Liverpool.
    During the next few minutes, a large number of fans started to filter down the
stairways, the first couple of them stated that two dead fans had been carried from the
leppings lane end. Several others came down the stairs, and started to shout that we were
murderers, we had killed their friends and then they started to threaten our lives.
    We had already informed the betting booth staff to stay in the booth until order
returned, but we were becoming aware that this was not an ordinary occurence, I could hear
that there was a considerable amount of radio traffic, although because of the loud
crowd noise, I could not ascertain what was happening,
    I have attended at numerous football matches, and also worked on a support unit
during the Miners Dispute, In both circumstances I have been subjected to threats of
violence, and even threats of murder. In some of those cases, the threats were at the
time meant, however I have never been subjected to such feelings of hatred, and it was
apparent that the threats would soon become a reality. The number of fans threatening us
were increasing all the time , there were in excess of thirty shouting at us, and many
more milling round at the rear of the group. It was obvious that we were out on a limb,
and to ask for assistance was not only futile, but wrong, so we decided to leave our
position. At that time I was in fear of my life, I can say that I have been more frightenec
but only o»® other occasion, when standing 25yards from an unexploded German bomb found
near the bramall lane football ground, I have never been as afraid for my life from
other people before#
    P.0. Marsh and I walked away from the crowd towards the Kop end of the corridor, and
then onto the ramp leading down to the rear of the stand# We looked over the edge, towards
the opening between the North Stand and the Kop, and saw that several people were laying 01
on the gr$0nd being attended to by other fans and police officers# Other injured people ' »
were being brought from off the pitch. We knew that it was futile to return to the
corridor, so we went down the raap to assist. At the bottom of the ramp, I lost contact
with P.O. Marsk,
    I estimate that the time was approximately 3»1"lpm, I walked quickly to the gap leading
onto the pitch, and saw two people being brought from the pitch on broken hoardings.
An Ambulance then came up behind me, and an Inspector shouted for the gate to be cleardd#
The two hoardings were let through, and others were held back on the pitch, as the
ambulance made its way onto the pitch#
   I Looked at the first person being carried out on a hoarding. It was a large white
male, about 15 stone I would guess. His red lumper was pulled over his head, he had no
clothing on his chest.
                    I took one look at him and thought 1 He's dead.* The second person
was alive, I did not pay nm.ch attention to him, there were several people carrying him,
and I could hear him screaming*
    As the ambulance was trying to get onto the pitch , a man walked accross the front
of the vehicle, I pulled him away fromthefrontofthevehicle,tothe outside of the gate
accross that gap. The man grabbed me by the shoulders and was crying, He kept shouting
 •I was in Belgium, I was at Heysel, Not agate* please not again" I saw another fan who
  was apparently alright, so I asked M m to look after the first man* I managed to get
  through the gate to the inside, but another ambulance came out, so I had to wait a few
seconds, I then walked quickly onto the pitch. At the corner near the gap, leading off the
pitch, there were a lot of peaople laid on the grass, several of them were obviously dead,
others were being tended to by other officers, fansand st Johns people. There were
people around each of those laid out, and I realised that I could be of better use at the
Leppings Lane end of the pitch*
      I felt that I did not want to be near what was happening, but I had to do what I
could# All the feelings of ear had evaporated when I w*f>t to get on the pitch, but a
feeling of apprehension had taken its place. I wondered whajr was the best thing to do,
and decided to follow a group vho were carrying a makeshift stretsher up the pitch*
I ran along with them, but when I got to the Leppings Lane End of the pitch, I could not
get near to the fence due to the large volume of people, and the confused nature of the
incident* There were people walking about as if nothing had happened, some oblivious to
the dead and injured, others obviously in shock# I started to look around for someway
to get •involved, but after a few seconds, a senior officer was shouting for a line to
form accross the centre of the pitch, so i went to join the line. I stood next to P.G
                                         b


   Bellamy, and other officers I did not know. At first I could not see the use of the lii
line, but with the confuted nature of the events, it became obvious that not only were
we keeping the few idiotic fans from inciting trouble by going to the Forest Supporters,
but it was a point from which officers could be taken to assist in other areas, as itf
fact later happened.
   While in the Line, I was facing the Liverpool end. I saw people obviously distressed,
but only a few feet away from thenw wesra others that were unaware of the situation, I saw
one group of three Liverpool supporters obviosly drunk, one of them Openly urinating oji
the pitch, infront of other fans. Some of the people were screamong at us that we were
murderers and venting extreeme anger atus, S knew that it was a reaction to the situation
and there were times when in different situations firm action would have been taken, but
not under the circumstances prevailing, •
   I also saw that the fans in the North Stand were becoming more and more         irate, andn
noticed at least two fi hts amongst the fans. On the pitch while some fans .were blaming i
us, others were pulling them away and saying that it wasnt our fault. To the rear of us,
there seemed to be a lot of people milling about doing nothing, near the players tunnel w<
were a number of people in yellow UMBRO jackets, just pointing at the crowd and talking.
There were officers on both sides of the line talking to and assisting people.
   At Approximately^,1Op,m le were ordered onto Penistone Road, as the decision to clear
the grouni had been made,Once onto the road I helped make a cordon accross the road, to
keep all the forest fans from walking along Penistone Road away from the city, I continuec
doing that untill the fans had all cleared, and then stood infront of the entrance to the
ground, that leads to the North Stand, and controlled the traffic: flow alotrg Penistone
Road, keeping the road clear for emergency vehicles, bnt at the same time keeping
the regular traffic flowing, in order to reduce the bottleneck closer to the city.
   At approximately 7.oopm, I went back into the ground, and onto the north Stand, where
most of the other officers who had been at the match were situated. After a few minutes,
I went to the rear of the stand where I met Police Sergeant 752 Batty, Itwas decidedthat
the area officers who had been at the match, arid were working a 6pm 2am shift would
work together, While waiting for orders we were standing at the side of the Gymnasium
when I saw Special Constable Martin stood with a group of Special Constables,         It was
obvious that she was very distressed, and I walked over to her, I took her to         one    s
and she immediately burst into tears. She was sobbing uncontorlably. At P,S, Batty’s
suggestion I took her into the Police room, where After making her a cup of tea, and
listening to what she had done, she suddenly said she was alright, we walked out fnto
the area next to the Gymnas um, where she said "Ive got to go back-in*”, she then
walked away from me into the building*
    From approximately 7»30pm to 8,00pm , I v/as on security duty on the gate between
the North Stand and a group of outbuildings. After 8,00pm until 5«30am the following
morning, I was on security duty at the entrance to the rear of the Gymnasium from
Penistone Road,   While there we were keeping the press from entering the ground, or from
getting intthe way, Bfeeibing the relatives, Sociii. Workers, Ministers and others coming to
the ground, and escorting those that were allowed through to the reception area, and
keeping others out*
    At approximately 8,00pm, while inside the ground a coat was found at the rear of the
Notthe Stand, next to the sand bins, I took that coat into the Gymnasium, and handed it
over to the officers there. The only dealing I had with a body, was to assist
ambulance staff in carrying one into the Gymnasium,

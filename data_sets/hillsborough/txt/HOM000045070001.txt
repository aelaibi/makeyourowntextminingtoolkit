P.R.O. FILES ABOUT LORD TAYLOR’S INQUIRY INTO
HILLSBOROUGH


I am very grateful to you for obtaining these so quickly for Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s
scrutiny o f evidence relating to the Hillsborough Stadium disaster. I have passed five of
these files to the Judge - these are PRO numbers HO/397/48, 49 and 50 (three together, which
I have passed to the Judge in their PRO box), 52 and 53.

2.     I am returning to you herewith the others which I took away yesterday. You now
have in Room 102 all the PRO files (HO/397 1 to 106 inclusive) except the five I’ve listed
above.
                                                      UA-v
3.     I shall now be away until 4 August. It is not|possible (in fact it is likely) that the
Judge may want to see other files in the PRO series in that time - if so, the request will come
to you through Matt Pyne, OPPU, or one of his colleagues.

4.      I am grateful to you also for agreeing to house all these files in 102 until I return.
When I do, I hope to have suitable accommodation o f my own for them, and perhaps also to
be able to weed out the ones which we are unlikely to need so that they can be sent back to
Kew.

5.      We’ll talk again then.

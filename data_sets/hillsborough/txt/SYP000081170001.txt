              which     is about       15 rnins walk from the ground.                         We   parked up for a few

              m oments and had some             lunch    in the        car and at about 2.20pm                     (1420)      we

              w a l k e d towards      the ground,       arriving at the                turnstiles          in L e p p m g s    Ln ..

              at 2 . 3 0 pm      ( 1430)«

              There were hundreds              of basically well                behaved Liverpool             supporters,

   ^          all making          their way on foot           towards          the ground.           Some Liverpool

              supporters were drinking at a pub,                         near     to the ground at this                 time.

              I did not see any drunkene ss                   or d is or de rl y        conduct         from any of them.

              All    of our       party all     had tickets          fc/ a/s                   the North Stand,             so we

              made    our way to the Leppirtgs Ln turnstiles                            (North Stand          end),     'which is

              to the     left of the          row of turnstiles                looking from Leppings Ln.

              The    scene at the turnstiles                 ft   2 / 3 0 pm    M 4 3 0 ) was      one of a d i so r g a n i s e d

              crowd of        people all       trying    to get        into the ground through the

              turnstiles.           They were all        crowded         into the enclosure                 outside     the

              turnstiles.           They ware     o bviously very over                  crowded         in this are a and               I

                                                                                                               S2543

 saw some        people who were              in some distress as a result                      of being        crushed

 in this       crowd.

 I only saw one Police Officer                             outside the t u r n s t i l e s standing            between

 two    of the turnstiles                leading           intjr the N or th Stand.

 I was standing            in the        left handrside               of the    crowd waiting          to get     in

 and    I saw a man,            who    I can osuy describe ass

 White male,           70 years,         s h o r y s t a t u r e , he was       becoming    c e n t r a l ly

 cyanosed        (blue)     t h r ough       1/ack of o x y g e n and          pressure from all

 directions.            I tried tcK sh ie ld him from the                       pressure    of the        crowd,       but

 this was        impossible           to do.

 I e ve nt u a ll y got         into     the ground at 2 . 5.0pm ( 1 4 5 0 ) , through a

^ turnstile,          at w hich       I produced my ticket,                   w hich was   taken from me.

 Once    inside        the ground         I saw about & /Pol ice Officers                   standing           behind

 the turnstile area,                                                          who was with me          c omplained

 to these Officers               that something                  ■/hould be done about          the    e a cessive

 about     the       lack of Po 1 i ca, Of f i yer s present                  outside    the turnstiles.               1 he

O f f icers      stated that           their       post was          inside    the ground,       but    one of them

 did    pass a message            over       his    radio.

All     five     of us then made              our way            into t hj/N orth S t a n d .     We had no

 At that       time     I could see that                   peyfe 3 and 4 in the West Terrace w e re

 very over           crowded and th^t              the/pens         to either side were s pa rcely

 the score bo ar d near                the South Saand.                 Icould see      that more        and more

 s upporters were           coming        into      j/ens 3 and 4 through the tunnel                     and     people

 were    still        arriving         in the^yWorth Stand.

          cheer and        I saw the        crowd    in pens         and 4 surge        forward.           They began

          climbing        over    the     perimeter      fencf     and onto     the    pitch.         At   first 1

          thought        it was a pitch          irivasior/       but then after about            5 minutes or         so

          I realised that              something w a s / w r o n g .       I could hear a voice on the

          t annoy system,          but     I was    unfrole to hear what was             being     said.

          A ft e r about        10 m inutes      I a4w more and more            people       coming onto the

          pitch.         Then    I saw numerous          people     lying down on the           pitch and          I knew

          then that some were se ri ou sl y                 injured.         I then made my way to the

          front of the North Stand.                    I told      a WPC     that    I was a doctor and asked

      \i f I could help.                  I went    onto    the    pitch and saw as

          l^ y o u n g    boy aged about           10 y e a r s , he was wit h someone,            who      I think was

qjj S '         his father.            He was    lying on the jjrass.           He was        in a state of

                shock,     but was       fully     cons c ioKxy\       I comforted him and            loosened his

                clothing        and he seemed, ok &

          I then saw the following (/escr i b e d ;

                white male,        20 years,        heavy build.           I c a n ’t say what        he was

                wearing.         He was     on the     pitch/in the         12 yard area,        lying on his

                back.      Someone was          trying     lira lift hi m/oj )to an ad v e r ti si ng         board.

                He was unconscious,              a pwise was        presents        *1 turned him          into the

                and ^.carried him up the             pitch towards          the Hop e nd where             I handed him

                over     to the first aid           team.

          I then went           back    to the West End of the              pitch and        I saws

          3     white male,        17 years.         He had h i T shirt             rolled up over           his    chest

                he was     lying       on the ground naer the goal.                  I a t t em p te d     cardiac

                massage,        there were       othter /people        round him.       After a very short

                time     I knew that        he was     dead a nd beyond help.

          1 then w o n dered           round and tried to help other                 people,     but they were

          all    being     tended to and there seemed nothing further                           I could do.

          I went       back     into    the N or th Stand and then went               out of the ground and

              back    to the        car?   where     I met   up with the other 4 people who m        I went

              with.      I think       I left the       ground at about 4.2D pm     (-1620? and we arri v e d

              home    in Liverpool          a t about 6. 1 3 p m   (1813).

              After     I left the         ground on the way back to the          car,   I ov er he ar d a

running        these       kiosks w ou ld        number about 80             in total.          Vhf   job was      to

circulate a r o u nd the kiosks,                    helping        out w h e r e v e r    1 w^ts needed.           The

kiosks        w o u l d have    op e n e d betw e e n 12.30pm (1230) to "^m <1300) on that

day.         I was aware        that there would be one ihi^/o r m \ / Police Offi c e r

st a n di ng     near each kiosk and                 I believe        that       this was a direct              result

of     past e x p e r i e n c e s    at semi-final           games,        whe n there       had been d i s order

at     the    kiosks.

After        the kiosks were           opened        I was    kept      busy      circulating among              the

various        kiosks,       helping          out as and whe n             needed.       At 2 . 3 0 p m   (1430) I

was     in the N or t h Stand,                I heard of large             crowds at Leppings              Ln.

About        2.55pm    <1455)        I went      to Leppings          Ln    (kiosk 20)        behind the West

Stand        in the seating           area,      the kiosk         is a     long     kiosk with a metal                mesh

pulled down at all                  times,     leaving       only a gap at the bottom,                     in w hich

to serve         orders and          take    in money.          T he / m e s h    is kept      lowered this way

to     prevent       people     going         nearer      the co/nter         into the kiosk.

On the way to this                  kiosk    from the Np r t hi S t a n d at 2.55 pm                  (1455)     there

into      the N orth Stand.                I d o n ’t k/ow how many,               but    it a p p e a r e d to    be at.

least 200         people.           1 had to •ifta/d back             out    of the way to            let this

crowd        rush past.        U su a l l y a steward           is    in a tt en da nc e      there       to    check

the     tickets       of    people     entering          the stand,         but    I saw stewards              there,

an d    no one       in this        running      crowd had their             tickets       checked.            1 had to

stand        back for a few minu t e s              to a llow        the    crowd past.

1 then headed s t r aight                  to kiosk 20,         in the       seated area of the West

Stand,        the game       had just        begun as        I arrived.            On arrival         I found fans

        at    the      kiosk giving          the    girls and lads            behind       the   counter a lot of

        abuse.          There was      some        s w e aring      going    on.     There was        no P o l i c e m a n       in

        a t t e n d a n c e and    it was      bec oming          quite     frightening,         with the a t t i t u d e             of

        the    fans      towards my staff.                  I told the female members                    of staff       on duty

        in the         kiosk    to /eave and go down s t a i r s                  to our    s t o reroom area.           This

        just     left some lads/iri the                 kiosk an a          I told tharo to give the fans what

        they wanted,            with o u t    payment,           this was     just one or two fans,                just          to

        get    rid of/them.            Once        this was         done,    we    placed     part the       remaining

        stock         into   locked     cupboards and toget h e r wit h                    the   remaining        staff          I

        left     kiosk 20 and we all                 went        downstairs.

        I next went            to the S ou t h Stand,               but   betw e e n there and the West Stand,

        I f ound a girl w i th her                  husband,         she was       sitting       on the metal        steps

        near the Police             box,      this     girl was           in a hysterical          condition,        she had

        her    head between            her    knees.            I spoke     to her,      I d o n ’t know her         name,

        the ma n said he was                 her husband.              I presumed        she had been          in a crowd

        crush,         but they never          said.            Some of our female            staff      e s c o r t e d this

        couple         to a s to re r o o m at        the       b>aSck of L e p p i n g s Ln.     This      girl was

        d re s s e d    in a black       jacket, y m e            was about        30 years       old.      By this      time

        next met a lad w h o had A s e e n                  w o r k ing    in one of our kiosks              in the

        they     had     closed their          kiosk and            locked, it up to go and help                  out    in the

        ::r o w d .

        I went         to our s t o r e r oo m behind the west S t a n d and filled up buckets                                        of

        water w hi c h the          fans w o u l d      take        out   on to the        pitch.        I also a s s i s t e d

          A   man      lying    face down on the                 ground. This mas/ was              not being a t t e n d e d          to

T O       »/\£x4 by anyone.           He was a white man,                h e a v i l y by/llt,     about 23 years       old,

^^®^^^ldressed                in a pair of blue             jeans,       both       le>/s of w h i c h were     ripped.          He
f
              had on a white            shirt,        or a white         'T'    shjjfrt,      this was    ripped off his

&*J\0 ^   0 ^ - back and was          in shreds and              his back             wak^    clearly visible.             He was           la

              in the        recovery        position.            I d i d n ’t         see     muc h of his face,           but        it

              appeared         to be white an d            pale.       I did not a p p r o a c h       this man.        I think

              that      this ma n was         dead.        I have      never        seen a dead       person before.

              I could tell            that the a t m os ph er e at              the    back      of Leppings Ln was         bad

              w i th    lots of       people      just     hanging about.                There was a lot of shouting

              an d     swearing       going     on and most            of this was           d i r e c t e d towards the

              Police.          The    a tm os p h e r e   was     electric          in that area.

              U p s t ai rs    in the West S t a nd             it a pp e a r e d    overcrowded'.        Before and        just

              at kick         off    time    there were          people     running a b o u /        in the aisle       of the

              stand trying            to get a seat.

              L oo ki ng      back    I feel     that      there was a notic e a b l e              lack of Police

              Later      I. was      on the    pitch,       a    loudspeaker made two a n n o u n c e m e n t s ,

               reque s t i n g that the fans should not atte m p t to leave the^grpund.       I

              As     I was making my way back                    to the N or t h Stand             towards kiosk      number

              sure      of the time,          but     it was as most            people were          leaving    the ground.

              I saw one         lad kicking at the                locked door,           at first      he kicked the         door

              high      in the are a of the               lock.      At the         second     time saw him kick           the

                      door     it flew     open and two             ^&ds went      into the kiosk,             the first     one
              ’4
                      inside was         the    lad who ki c k e d the door              open.        A third     lad waited

                      out s i de the kiosks          open & o o r .        As    I watched       I saw the        lads    take out

                      " M a r s ’ bars    out    into|l/he      crowd.          Another       lot was       drag g e d to the     door

                      but just        left b e h i n d T      Some    people      that    had    chocolate        bars    thrown at

                      them were        shouting      abuse      back at these            lads.        The    lads then     came out

                      of the     kiosk      carrying a box of              chocolate,          ’T w i x ’, "Kit K a t s ’ , etc.

                      The 3 lads all            grab b e d    bars    out of the         box and just threw the boxes

                      down.      the 3 lads all              then w a l ke d off.         I c a n ’t really describe              them,

Wj|p>T                they were        just 3 w hite          youths.                                             /
                      Later     on I went        to kiosk £0 upstairs at                  the    back of              West Stand,

                      after most         people     had      left    the   ground.        I saw boxes /on the             floor,

^ ^ ' ^ c o n t e n t s               chocolates       on the        floor.       The    locked       cupb/ard doors had been

                      forced open,          one door         had been      ripped off          comp l e t e l y and was     on the

                      floor,     anot h e r     door was       just    hanging      down.        This was        the kiosk that               I
orr
~T7\                  had to have         closed      earlier        that day.          The    door    on the kiosk was           not

 o   6 ^   a !o £ 5   locked,      but the       stock       had been      locked       in secure       cupboards.
 /Vr                  1 should add that             earlier         in the afternoon,            just after 3pm           ClbGG),         1

                      was m a k in g my way         to bar HO,         at the      back of West Stand.                  I saw a group

                      of     people    in the area,           this was       the time         i saw the       body     I described.

                      There were a lot of              people sitting             down    in this area,               I saw young

                      lads     u r i nating agai n s t        the wall,         even though        there      is a toilet       close

                      by .

                      I d o n ’t know       if there were            other      bodies    in this are a or not.

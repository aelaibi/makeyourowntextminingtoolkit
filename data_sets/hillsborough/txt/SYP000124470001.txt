JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I THOUGHT IT STRANGE THAT VEHICLES WERE ALLOWED TCTPARK          IN LEPPINGS LANE

RIGHT BY THE GROUND.         IT IS ONLY A SMALL ROAD/^ND A COACH WAS EVEN PARKED

THERE.    THIS ALL ADDED TO THE CONFUSION AND'SEEMED TO CAUSE A FUNNEL EFFECT

PACKING PEOPLE T O G E T H E R .   ONCE INSIDE THJt TURNSTILES THERE WAS A DISTINCT

LACK OF POLICE OFFICERS ABOUT.           I SAW   STEWARDS BUT THEY WERE ALL STANDING

TOGETHER AT ONE STAIRCASE CHATTING.

 IS    THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 1) I KNOW THAT THE ALLOCATION OF ENDS OF THE GROUND WERE MADE BECAUSE OF THE

 ROUTES FROM LIVERPOOL AND NOTTINGHAM BUT I STILL THINK THE KOP END SHOULD

 HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO LIVERPOOL.         TRAFFIC COULD HAVE BEEN DIVERTED QUITE EASILY,

 2) THE ADDRESS SYSTEM COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER NO ONE COULD HEAR IT.

 YES THAT WAS THE REASON WE GOT OUT OF PEN 4.         AT 1415 (1415)    IT WAS OBVIOUS TO

 NO

 NO

 G47

 I SAW DEAD PEOPLE LYING ON THE PITCH, BUT I DID NOT SEE ANYONE DIE.

 NO


G17

 G49

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR       IN THE DEATHS, OR THE

 INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 I^fcslITIALLY SAW PEOPLE CLIMBING OUT OF THE PENS BEHIND THE GOAL, AND

 MOMENTARILY T H O U G H T , THAT THEY WERE BEING DISRUPTIVE TO THE GAME, BUT ALMOST

 IMMEDIATELY I REALISED THAT PEOPLE WERE HAVING TO GET ONTO THE PITCH           TO GET

 AWAY A SERIOUS CRUSH IN THOSE PENS.     THE CLIMBING OF THOSE FENCES         IS NOT AN

 EASY TASK, AND THERE WAS NO WAY THAT ANYONE SHOULD HAVE HAD THE

 IMPRESSION THAT A PITCH INVASION WAS TAKING PLACE, THE FAILURE TO              -          .
                                                    _______________________    C JO Im M       .
 COMPREHEND THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE SITUATION BY THE POLICE IN FRONT OF THE

 TERRACING,    AND THEIR FAILURE TO PROMPTLY OPEN THE GATES, AND ALLOW PEOPLE

 OUT ONTO THE PITCH WAS A FACTOR    IN CAUSING THE DEATHS AND INJURIES TO THOSE

 PEOPLE.     ALSO I REMEMBER AT 1445 HOURS   (1445) A LOUD SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT
                                                                                      PAGE       8

 SAYING "pOULD THE LIVERPOOL FANS PLEASE MOVE FOREWARD TO ALLOW THEIR

 COLLEAGUES IN AT THE B A C K , 1' WHICH HIGHLIGHTS A LACK OF UNDERSTAND OF THE

 SITUATION BY THE AUTHORITIES AT THE GROUND.

 Q50

 WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 AFTER A LOUD SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT ASKING US TO DELAY LEAVING THE GROUND FOR

 ■10 MINUTES TO ALLOW EMERGENCY SERVICES TO LEAVE.

 QS1

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A STEWARD, A LOUD

 SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 l ^ O U D SPEAKER A N N O UN C EM EN T .


Q18

 Q52

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO

 G53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 INITIALLY THE INCIDENT WAS DEALT WITH AS CROWD DISORDER RATHER THAN THE
                                         C./VT"               C O M M
 D ^ t S T E R IT WAS. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE POLICE SEEMED TO BE STANDING AROUND

 DOING NOTHING, OFFERING NO HELP TO ATHE VICTIMS.              I ONLY SAW ONE AMBULANCE ON

 THE PITCH,     TO ATTEND TO THE NUMBER OF         INJURED AND DYING, WHY COULDNT MORE

 AMBULANCES HAVE BEEN BROUGHT ONTO THE PITCH RATHER THAN THE NEED FOR THE FANS

 TO CARRY PEOPLE ON HOARDINGS.              THE OVERALL IMPRESSION I HAD OF THE RESPONSE

 TO THE DISASTER WAS INEPT INCOMPETENCE.

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 1.    I READ AN ARTICLE PRIOR TO THE MATCH AT HILLSBOROUGH BEFORE IT WAS

 SELECTED AS THE VENUE IN THE LIVERPOOL POST/ECHO,             WHERE PETER ROBINSON
                                                                             PAGE       9
                                                                             Q S L 1990

STATED THAT THE CLUB DID NOT WISH HILLSBOROUGH TO     BE THE VENUE,   BECAUSE

OF PROBLEMS THE PREVIOUS YEAR.    I RECALL THE FA'S   RESPONSE WAS THEY   WOULD

TAKE THESE VIEWS ON BOARD, AND YET DESPITE THIS HILLSBOROUGH WAS CHOSEN

AS THE SEMI FINAL VENUE.

2.   THERE WAS A COMPLETE LACK OF STEWARDIMG,    AND THATS SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAYS

RESPONSIBILITY.
                                     A i c   •


3.   THE FAILURE TO CONTROL THE CROWD OUTSIDE BY FORMING QUEUES.

4.   THE LAYOUT OF THE TURNSTILES AT THE LEPPINGS LANE END.     LACK OF

DIRECTIONAL SIGNS DIRECTING YOU TO OTHER AREAS OF STANDING.

5.   THE LONGITUDINAL FENCING SEPARATING THE FANS ON THE TERRACING, PREVENTED

P^pPLE IN THE CRUSH MOVING TO THE SIDES AND SPREADING OUT.

 AT ABOUT 2.40 PM (1440) TO 2.45 PM (1445) THE PRES^tfRE STARTED TO INCREASE,

 COULD JUST ABOUT MOVE MY ARMS AND I C OUL J^ B R E A T H , I WAS FORCED TOWARDS THE

 DIVIDING FENCE, WHICH I CLIMBED W H E N y * R E A C H E D   IT, AS I CLIMBED IT,    I WAS

 THE INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 I THINK    IF THE GATES AT THE END OF THE TUfcff      HAD BEEN CLOSED AND CONTROLLED,

 AS THEY WERE IN JANUARY,     THEN IT W O U L D N ’T HAVE HAPPENED.

     KIND OF RESCUE OPERATION.
              *

     THE AMBULANCE THAT CAME INTO THE GROUND WAS, FOR SOME REASON,      DRIVEN ALL THE

     WAY ROUND THE PERIMETER TRACK AND THROUGH THE INJURED AND SHOCKED FANS, WHO BY

     THEN WERE ON THE PITCH.     THIS SEEMED A STRANGE WAY TO DO IT, ALSO IT WAS THE

     ONLY AMBULANCE TO COME IN.    THE FANS ORGANISED THEIR OWN RESCUE,    USING TORN

     UP HOARDINGS AS STRETCHERS TO CARRY THE DEAD AND INJURED.       THERE SHOULD HAVE

     BEEN MORE DONE BY THE POLICE AND EMERGENCY SERVICES.

     DID YOU GO TO THE MATCH IN 1988?

     NO.

     G ^

     IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

    JUDICIAL INQUIRY?
:


     I WAS SEARCHED TWICE AS I ENTERED THE GROUND,      THE SERGEANT WHO SEARCHED ME THE

    SECOND TIME,    INSIDE THE GROUND, WAS OBVIOUSLY AN EXPERIENCED MAN WHO COULD

    PROBABLY HAVE BEEN BETTER DEPLOYED.

     I ALSO FEEL THAT THE LIVERPOOL FANS SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE LARGER END WITH

     THE HIGHER TICKET ALLOCATION.       WITH THE PRESENT ROAD SYSTEM LIVERPOOL FANS

    WERE APPROACHING THE GROUND FROM THE HOP END.

 UNTIL IT BECAME VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.         THERE WAS JOSTLING AND MOVEMENT AND I

 WAS SPLIT UP FROM ________|.       I STARTED TO MOVE BACKWARDS,   IN HOPE OF GETTING

 OUT OF THE CRUSH.       I MANAGED TO GET BACK NEAR TO THE WEST STAND WALL.        THE

 PRESSURE W A S N ’T QUITE SO BAD.      I WAS THERE ABOUT TEN MINUTES WHEN I WAS

 L W E D   AND PULLED UP INTO THE WEST STAND.

 045

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY CROWD SURGE,         IF SO, DO YOU KNOW WHAT CAUSED IT?   (BRIEFLY)

 OF THE WAY.

 DID ‘YOU WITNESS ANY DEATHS?

 I SAW “PEOPLE LYING ON THE PITCH, AND FROM THE STAND I COULD SEE PEOPLE

 WITHIN THE CROWD AROUND THE GATE IN PEN 3 WITH THEIR HEADS FLOPPED BACK,             THEY

 APPEARED DEAD, JUST BEING SUPPORTED BY THE CROWD, UNABLE TO FALL.

 G4-8

 DID YOU ASSIST ANYONE WHO WAS DEAD OR INJURED,          IF SO, BRIEFLY EXPLAIN.

 NO,     I HAD BEEN LIFTED OUT OF      IT.


G17

 G49

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR          IN THE DEATHS, OR THE

 J      uries   to   any   person?

 THE FENCES SEEMED A CAUSE,          THERE WAS NOWHERE FOR PEOPLE TO GO TO ESCAPE THE

 CRUSH.

 G5G

 WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 ABOUT 5.13PM (1715)

 G51

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A STEWARD,             A LOUD

 SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 I ^ E A R D ANNOUNCEMENTS ASKING PEOPLE TO CLEAR THE PITCH, THEN LATER      I HEARD A

 POLICE ANNOUNCEMENT SAYING THAT THE MATCH HAD BEEN ABANDONED.


G18

 G52

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO.

 G53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 A POLICEMAN IN THE WEST STAND SEEMED MORE INTERESTED IN POSSIBLE CROWD
                                                                                PAGE    9

 PROBLEMS.      PEOPLE IN THE STAND APPEARED TO BE FAINTING AND HE D I D N ’T HELP.
         «

 I ONLY* SAW ONE AMBULANCE A ST JOHNS AMBULANCE COME ONTO THE PITCH, THERE

 SEEMED TO BE A LACK OF MEDICAL TEAMS TO ASSIST THE INJURED.         I NOTICED THAT

 THE FANS WERE HAVING TO MAKE THEIR OWN STRETCHERS OUT OF HOARDINGS,         AND USE

 THEM.

 I FEEL THAT THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE INFORMATION BROADCAST ON THE TANNOY

 SYSTEM,     THIS WOULD HAVE INFORMED EVERYBODY INCLUDING NOTTS FOREST FANS, THAT

 THERE WAS A SERIOUS PROBLEM AND NOT A PITCH INVASION.

 G53A

 DID YOU ATTEND THE MATCH IN 1988?

 Nj^

 G54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE STEWARDS AND BETTER SIGNS TO DIRECT FANS.          THE

 ONLY WAY SEEMED TO BE THROUGH THE TUNNEL.

•1) I THOUGHT THE ST JOHNS AMBULANCE PEOPLE DID/fS WELL AS THEY COULD HAVE DONE

2) THERE WERE ABOUT 3 OR 4 POLICEMEN IN F R p m     OF US TRYING TO PULL UP THE

PERIMETER FENCING BUT THEY C O U L D N ’T DO/^NY GOOD.               •

OPENED THE GATE FIRST OF ALL OR IF IT HAD BEEN FORCED OPEN.

(4) AFTER WE HAD GOT OUT AND HAD STARTED TO HELP WITH THE INJURED PEOPLE,

THE POLICE WEREN'T GIVING US ANY DIRECTIONS AND THERE SEEMED TO BE A LOT OF

THEM LINED UP ACROSS THE PITCH, MORE THAN WAS NECESSARY,       I THINK THESE COULD

HAVE BEEN DIRECTED TO HELP THE INJURED

Q54

IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

J < 4 £ d A L ENQUIRY?

I    THOUGHT THERE WAS A COMPLETE LACK OF ORGANISATION AT THE TURNSTILES AREA

AT THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME.

ALSO I NEVER SAW ANY STEWARDS OUTSIDE THE TURNSTILES AREA, TO GIVE DIRECTIONS

ALSO THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE ASKING FOR TICKETS OUTSIDE THE GROUND MORE

THAN I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT.

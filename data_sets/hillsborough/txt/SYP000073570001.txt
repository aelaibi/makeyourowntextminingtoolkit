            I live at the above address with my parents.                  I have lived at this

            address for four years.

            I am a Liverpool supporter and a member of the Avon and South West and

            South Wales Liverpool Supporters Club.                 I am also a season ticket

            holder for Liverpool.            I obtained a ticket for the semi final between

            Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Sheffield Wednesday,                  Hillsborough

            Football ground.     We got Vn</ supporters coach at Chepstow at about 8.

            00am    (0800)1 was with             , and we sat together on the coach.

            It was Saturday 15th April 19^9 (1^0489) when we went to the game.                         We

                                                                                              S17S3

              travelled along the til motorway and we stopped at the last Service

              area on the M1 prior to the turn off for Sheffield             (Woodall Services).

              We stopped there for about       15 minutes to about 30 minutes. We set off

              from the services and just after we left the services and turned off

              the motorway the coach filled up with diesel fumes.                The driver

              stopped the coach and checked it over.            This was about      1.30pm (1330)

              and we only stopped a couple of minutes and then carried on with our

              journey to the ground.       We got to near the ground at about 2.00pm

              (1400).     The driver stopped the coach at the bottom of a hill near to

              the Leppings Ln.     Myself,                                   and Mike KELLY got

              off the coach together.        We all walkecfr'to the ground t oget her .         We got

              to the ground at about 2.30pm (143<l/and when we got there,                there were

8 - 0 . e.    thousands of supporters outside Vhe ground trying to get in,                          and

                       m d me joined the end of the crowd as that is what it was.                 Other

              supporters were still     coming and joining the crowd and the pressure

              behind me got more and more eventually I started to get crushed in the

              crowd outside.     I went with the      crush and eventually I got to a

              turnstile between A and G.        The   crowd carried me towards this

              turnstile.     Eventually at about      2.45pm   (1445)   I got through the

              turnstile into the ground.        I felt real relief at being out of the

              crush.     During the crush I felt      frightened at what was happening but I

              did not feel    panic set in.     The   only police officer        I saw outside the

 C/VT         ground was one police officer on a horse.              When I got into the ground

 fb u o £ ~   I felt a great relief that I was out the crush.              Whilst    in there
   f ir r
  U           collected my throughts and pulled myself together and                 I happened to

              look back towards the turnst i l e s ^ t o o k   for         and           I cannot

              remember seeing Mike Kelly af^er we left the coach whilst I was

              looking back towards t h’to^J^dfrns t i 1 e s , I think it was the third one from

              the gate.     Mark C on the Diagram (Item No            ) (Exhibit No           >    I

              saw a man hand his young son over the turnstile to a police officer.
                                                                                       PAGE       3
                                                                                       SI 783

             The young lad could not have been more than eight yeaars.            The man I

             would describe was in his late twenties early thirties with dark hair

             and wearing a grey jacket.        The turnstile    operator started to argue

             with the man and he started to shout to the police officer to             give him

             his son back.     I did not see what happened after that,       or whether

             he got into the ground.     I can understand the man being upset as

             when I got into the ground I felt a great          relief of getting out of the

             crush and I would think the father was frightened as I was until             I got

             into the ground.    I then looked around and       saw     came through

             the turnstile.     We were waiting for            and we went and sat by the

             programme seller who was by tha/C gate.           At about 2.50pm   (1450) we saw

        f-   the gate   *C* open.   It was o'pened by a steward and two or three police

             officers ejected two peo-fue out of the ground.          As they were trying to

             put them out the crowd outside managed to push into the ground and

             pushed the police officers and the people who were being ejected back.
t o gj& lt
             The surge at this time made the o^lice officers          release these people

             and they all    ran into the gro<dnd.    After they closed the gate people

             were shouting open the gate let us in,       it was a cry for help a sort of

             panic type cry.     By this time there was about four stewards by the

             gate and about two and three police officejyC by the gate. The next

             thing I saw was a steward open the g a t e ./ w hen the gate was opened

C£c>KD       there was a big surge through the gatey^of fans. After the first

   iN        surge and the tail end of the surge/got through the gate,           I noticed

                  coming    into the ground,       shouted to him,    he saw me and he came

             across to me.     We were then Vogether and made our way towards the
                      T o /v W £ _ L -
             tunnel. We went down      th e^tunnel and into Pen 3, a nd said that it was

             so packed that we turned around and pushed our way back out of the

             tunnel towards the rear of the stands.       J/fe then    made our way towards

             the left of the stand and went intckj^n 6 were we stayed.                  |who

             had cousins and relatives at the game went and climbed over the
                                                                                     PAGE     4
                                                                                     S17S3

          dividing barriers towards pen 4 after we had seen the people going

          onto the pitch from pen 3.          I saw         get into Pen 4 and after about

          15 minutes       later I saw        standing on the pitch and walking around

          as if he was in a trance.          I never saw anyone else who I knew was on

          the bus.     Until a few minutes later when I saw                    grab hold of

                 and put his arms around him.                      [name is             who

          lives in Bristol. Whilst         I was standing   in Pen 6 people were shouting

          from pen 6 to open the gate and friends op the pitch were also asking
                   Gr*rT«£-^> A-t   P€-£~\
          for the gate to be opened but the Police Officer on it refused at the

          first instant but later opened i^           wfeen relatives and friends of

          people in pen 6 wanted to make sure everyone was alright who they knew.

          When the tradgedy was at its height the thing I felt I must say is

          that there was a photographer was taking ph o to’s of people who was

          dead and there is no doubt he could have done something to help people,

          as he was he hindering the police and rescue services.              This man is

          the luckiest man to be alive today apart from the fatally injured.

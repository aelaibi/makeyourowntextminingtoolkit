                Anthony Bland became 21 on the 21st September of this year but

                for the past three and a half years he has been totally unaware

               of the world around him.                      As       a keen        supporter of Liverpool

               Football Club he was at the Hillsborough football ground on the

              , 15th April 1989.               He was then 1714,          He was one of the victims of

               the disaster.               He suffered a severe crushed chest injury which

               gave      rise        to    hypoxic   brain    damage.               His           condition   rapidly

               deteriorated and despite the intensive and heroic efforts of the

               doctors and nurses he has remained ever since in a state of

               complete unawareness.                 This is known to the medical profession

               as a 'Persistent Vegetative State (PVS).                             Although his brain stem

               is intact he suffered irreparable damage to the cortex.                                        All the

               higher functions of Anthony Bland’s brain have been destroyed.

               There is no hope whatsoever of recovery or improvemerit of any

               kind.        That is the unanimous opinion of all the distinguished /

               doctors who have examined Anthony Bland.



               Since the 12th May 1989 he has been under the care of Dr J.G.Howe

               FRCP* a Consultant Geriatrician at the Airedale General Hospital*

               Dr.Howe has very considerable experience of patients suffering

               from what is described as the Persistent Vegetative State.                                       After

              his transfer                to   the Airedale General                 Hospital prolonged            and

              persistent attempts were made to                            revive Anthony               Bland.     The

               skilled hospital staff including senior physiotherapists assisted


                                                                  1

by     the parents    and    sister    of Anthony       Bland made     exhaustive

attempts    to achieve some sign             of revival.        Although Anthony

Bland's body breathes and reacts in a reflex manner to painful

stimuli it is quite clear that there is no awareness on his part

of anything that is taking place around him.                    EEG and CT scans f

reveal no evidence of cortical activity.^                  Indeed recent scans

which have been photographed and produced to the Court show that

there is more        space   than     substance     in the      relevant part of

Anthony Bland's brain*        There is simply no possibility whatsoever

that he has any appreciation of anything that takes place around

him.    He is fed artificially and mechanically by a naso gastric

tube which has been inserted through his nose and down into his

stomach.    All the natural bodily functions have to be operated

with nursing intervention.            He is fitted with a catheter which

has given rise to infection necessitating surgical intervention.

It is to be noted that the necessary surgical incision was madef

without any anaesthetic because Anthony Bland is utterly devoid J

of feeling of any kind!         He requires four to five hours nursing

attention by two nurses every day.              No complaint is made by the

hospital authorities         of the fact       that they have to allocate

substantial resources to this particular case - that is not a

factor which has been prayed in aid of the course which the

Plaintiffs now seek to be allowed to follow.                      By August 1989 1

supported by the opinion of Dr.Michael Johnson*                     a Consultant

Neurologist of St.James' University Hospital Leeds, Dr. Howe had

reached the clear conclusion that there was absolutely no hop§

of any improvement. He felt that it would be appropriate to cease

further treatment.      This would involve withdrawing the artificial

              not furnish medical treatment to Anthony Bland except for the

              sole purpose of enabling Anthony Bland to end his life and die

              peacefully with              the greatest         dignity and        the        least    of pain

              suffering and distress.                The Plaintiffs action is fully supported

              by the parents and family of Anthony Bland.                                    Because Anthony

              Bland himself is wholly incapable of taking any step with regard

            , to this matter the Official Solicitor of the Supreme Court has

              been       appointed        to   act    as    his      Guardian     ad     litem.         He   has

              instructed Counsel to appear on the hearing of this Summons.

              Whilst          not     disputing      the   completely         insensate        condition      of

             Anthony Bland, he opposes the Plaintiffs' application contending

              that       if the        action proposed          by Dr.    Howe         and    the     Plaintiff

             Hospital Authority were                    to be       implemented it would in               terms

              amount in law to the crime of murder.                            Because of the public

              importance of this case the Court invited the assistance of the

             Attorney General and he has                      instructed Counsel               to appear      as

              'amicus curiae’.



             This case               clearly   raises      serious moral,        medical        and    ethical

              issues.         However, none of the facts relating to the circumstances

              and the condition of Anthony Bland are in dispute.                               The Court has

             been assisted by expert medical evidence from witnesses of the
              highest calibre and of the very greatest experience.                                  All *greef

            irreversible and is not susceptible of any improvement.                      He is

            completely insensate and no medical procedure or treatment can

           bring about any beneficial change in his condition.                        All the

           witnesses have stated that the standard of care which has been

           afforded to Anthony Bland at The Airedale General Hospital is of

           the highest character.          His parents have visited him daily and

           his sister has also been present frequently.                      The anguish which

           they continue to experience is self evident.                        His father has

         t given oral evidence before me and I also have a statement from

           Anthony Bland*s mother.         The father is a splendid straightforward

           Yorkshireman          He has    faced   the    terrible       tragedy which has

           befallen his family with remarkable realism and dignity.                     He has*

           not allowed emotion to influence his judgment.§ He traced for me

           Anthony's brief life - explaining how he was a thoroughly normal

           boy.     He described him as not a very clever boy but with a good

           personality - sensitive and willing,                    His great interest was

           football and Liverpool his chosen team.                 He said that he was not

           religious but that he had attended Sunday School in the Church

           of England.         His assessment of Anthony Bland's situation was

           expressed in these clear terms:             "He certainly wouldn't want to

           be left like he is.        1 would feel that he should be removed and

           the family feel the same.          I was angry when the advice from the

           express views of his own and there had been no occasion for him

           to express any view as to how he might view his situation if some

            terrible tragedy such as this befell him.

 This case raises for the first time in the English Courts |;he

 question in what circumstances, if any, can a doctor lawfully

 discontinue life sustaining treatment (including nutrition and

 hydration) without which a patient in Anthony Bland’s condition

 will die?     Professor Bryan Jennett CBE until recently Foundation

 Professor of Neuro        Surgery at the                Institute       of Neurological

 Science in the University of Glasgow and having the very widest

 experience as a neuro           surgeon was             responsible      together with

< Professor Plum of New York             for coining             the term    1Persistent|

 Vegetative State* in 1972.f It is intended to describe a syndrome^

 that was being increasingly encountered as the life saving andj|

 life sustaining technologies of intensive care were securing the^

 Survival of some patients with brain damage of a severity that|

 would previously have proved fatal,                     professor Jennett told the

 Court that until this descriptive term was proposed,                            and soon

 widely adopted, such patients were often referred to as being in

 a prolonged or irreversible comaj                   However the word 'coma', he|

 said, implies a continuing sleeplike state due to depression of^

 the brain stem activating systems - whilst the hallmark of the^

 vegetative    patient     is    that        after       a    variable    time   in   coma^

 wakefulness    returns,        with    long        periods      of   spontaneous

 openingj    This period in coma commonly lasts 10 to 21 days after

 head injury which causes concussive depression of brain stem

 function, but after hypoxic insults patients often begin to open

 their eyes in 2 to 3 days.             Unlike less severely brain damaged4

 patients emerging from coma,                the vegetative patient              fails to §
 regain any cognitive behaviour that would indicate function in ^

 the   cerebral    corte?|       -     the        grey       matter   responsible      for I

consciousness, thinking, feeling and responding in meaningful (^s I

distinct from reflex) ways to stimuli from the surroundings (I

Because the brain stem and various other sub-cortical and more,

primitive      parts       of    the   brain    are     still    functioning*        the

vegetative patient has a wide range of reflex activity, including
                                                                       r

breathing wand        in   some patients,        a very      limited    capacity      to

swallow reflexly.          Vegetative patients must be distinguished from

patients in a ’locked in'              syndrome - who, because of a focal /

lesion in the brain stem that does not affect consciousness, are^

totally paralysed in limbs and speech but may communicate by a,

yes/no code using eye or eyebrow movements// They are also quite

different from patients who have suffered 'brain death' - whosej

brain   stem    has    permanently       ceased       to   function    and    who    are|

dependent on a ventilator to maintain respiration,                           and whosefj

heart   always    stops         within a week      or      two at   the most.         By

contrast, vegetative patients have suffered cognitive death, butf/

can continue to breath for years because the brain stem is still//

functioning.<] The key to              the diagnosis is that, on              clinical

observation over a prolonged period of time, there is no evidence^
                       q
of a working mind.         EEG records show a range of abnormal activity

with severe depression of cortical activity obvious only in a

minority of      cases.          Professor     Jennett      referred   to    the    very

considerable research^which has taken place internationally and

the consideration of the problem by the Medical Ethics Committee
of the British Medical Association.                   He concluded from all the

research material that only exceptional cases have been reported|

as showing recovery after a yearf and none of those patients

appear to have achieved independence.                 He gave it as his opinion
 that naso gastric feeding is a form of ^medical treatment

as is a ventilator or a kidney machine.                           It    is a means of

substituting a function that has naturally failed.                           He said that

tube feeding is accepted as 'medical treatment'                             in the United

States of America and in Canada.                 He referred to the Appleton

International Conference which                 accepted that           life       sustaining

hydration       and    nutrition     is    a   medical       treatment            which   may

justifiably be withdrawn from persistently vegetative patients

for whom there are no patient based reasons for continuing to

treat.    He expressed the opinion that it has become accepted good

practice in this country as elsewhere to agree in consultation

with     the    families     of   the     vegetative      patients           to    withhold

antibiotics and cardio pulmonary resuscitation in the event of

complications that would call for such measures in patients with

a prospect of recovery.            He expressed the very strong view that |

it would be in accordance with good medical practice in the casej

of Anthony Bland to withdraw the naso gastric artificial feeding^

He   stated     that    he   considered        there    to       be    no     benefit      in

maintaining life sustaining treatment because he could see no

prospect of recovery of cognitive function.                       He like the other

expert medical witnesses who gave evidence before me had examined

Anthony Bland.         He stated that in his view this was an extreme |

and clear case of the Persistent Vegetative State. | He could see

no benefit to the patient in continuing the treatment of feeding

by means of a naso gastric tube.                  Dr.    Cartlidge FRCP is the

        Persistent Vegetative State.               He too examined Anthony Bland and

        expressed the firm opinion that he was showing all the signs of

        this    extreme      condition.       He       said    there         is   no     possibility

        whatsoever that he will recover. |He too expressed the opinion

        that it would be medically justifiable to withdraw the artificial

        feeding process for there was no useful purpose in continuing it

       and     it was      not    in   the patient's          best    interests          to   prolong

        survival in these circumstances.                 Professor Peter 0. Behan FRCP

       of the Department of Neurology at the Institute of Neurological

       Sciences       at    the    Southern   General          Hospital           of    Glasgow   was

       instructed by the Official Solicitor to examine Anthony Bland.

       The Court has the advantage of a report prepared by Professor|

       Behan fwhich has been accepted in evidence.                            He was unable to

       attend Court to give oral evidence.                      In his report he said:

       "What is the diagnosis?             This can be confidently answered that

       on the basis of history, physical and neurological examination

       supplemented by laboratory data, this is a classical example of

       the Persistent Vegetative State.”                  He went on to say:                   "I am

       confident      that       from my   knowledge      of     other patients,              neuro­

       physiology, previous cases from the literature and from animal

       experimentation that the patient has no awareness nor can he

       suffer pain or experience pleasure.                      Further the prospect of

       improvement can also confidently be answered since based on what

       we know of the degree of damage to his brain, the comparison of

       his case with those recorded in the literature                                  (particularly

       considering the nature of his damage and the duration of his

       illness) and the type of systems and signs he exhibits, there is

      jio hint or hope or any prospect of improvement!*'                               Next he said:

  "In my opinion artificial             feeding and hydration,        constitutes!

  'medical treatment'I         If a patient were to be admitted under my

  care and was for one reason or another unable to feed himself,

  the setting up of a naso gastric tube for feeding and hydration

  would constitute beyond any measure of doubt ‘medical treatment'

  as opposed to normal feeding.”               He further stated that he was:

   "Very impressed by the recommendation of the British Medical

 Association that is to say in respect of the consultation and

  treatment of patients in the persistent vegetative state.                       In

  particular the recommendation that where the diagnosis had been

 well established and the differential diagnoses had been ruled

  out     and   all   the   necessary    laboratory     tests     done    then   the

 prognosis could confidently be given as zero if after one year?

  there was no sign of improvement 4'



 Dr.    Keith Andrews       FRCP   is   the Director of         Medical   Research

 Services at the Royal Hospital and Home Putney.                 At his hospital

 there is a twenty bedded brain injury rehabilitation unit*                      Dr,

 Andrews has had experience of about 50 patients in a persistent 4

 vegetative state.f He examined Anthony Bland.                  He told the Court

  "I regard him as being in a persistent vegetative state."                       He

  said:     rtHe is the most severe case I have seen land I do not

  consider Tony Bland will make any recovery whatsoever.                    If the

  regime continues as at present he is likely to survive a few

  years, not more than five, because he is prone to infections.w

  He expressed the view that feeding by tube was. not in his view ^

  medical treatmlnt.         In amplification he said:            "The use of the

  equipment might be thought to be medical treatment but not the

   supply of food which is a basic human requirement."                      He said he *

   would not favour the withdrawal of treatment because he would I

   find the means of death worrying. It! would be distressing to

   watch although Anthony Bland himself would not experience any

   sensation.           He agreed that    sedative drugs could be given to

   lessen the unpleasant features which he felt would inevitably

   follow from the withdrawal of the artificial feeding.



   The Plaintiffs' submissions have been put clearly and succinctly

   by Mr. Francis QC both in a written skeleton argument and also

   in oral submissions.          He submits that it is the unanimous opinion

   of all the expert medical witnesses that Anthony Bland is in a

   severe Persistent Vegetative State.                There is no hope of any

   improvement.          His parents with knowledge of their son say that

  he    would      not    wish   his   present   condition        to   be   continued.

  Although Anthony Bland himself cannot express any view it should

   be inferred in the light of the medical evidence as well as of

   the evidence of his own father and mother that the prolongation

   of the present treatment is. not in his best interests.!                       Good

  medical practice, accepted by a large and responsible body of

   medical opinion suggests that the course proposed by Dr.Howe, and

   supported by Professor Jennett and by Dr.                 Cartlidge should be

   followed.           Mr. Francis referred to a passage in the speech of

   Lord Bridge in the leading case of In Re F (Mental Patient;

   Sterilisation) reported in T19901 2 Appeal Cases at page _1.                     At

   page 52 of the report Lord Bridge said:                "Moreover it seems to

         In his detailed and erudite submission Mr.Munby                    Q.C. on behalf

         of the Official Solicitor challenged the view that the artificial

         feeding regime could be considered as ’medical treatment|,                        He

         sought support for that submission from the evidence of Dr. Keith

         Andrew.     However      his   principal      submission was        that   what    isf

         proposed by Dr.Howe is the doing of an act intended to lead tof

         the death       of   Anthony   Bland. I     In    the     result   he   argued    the

         withdrawal of the feeding regime would amount to unlawful killingf

         and would in fact be the crime of murder.                      He referred to the

         summing up of Mr. Just ice Devlin,               in the case of The Queen v

         Bodkin Adams.        He picked out a phrase used by the learned Judge:

         ♦'cutting the thread of life"|        Mr.Munby argued that even if the

         artificial feeding process were to be considered to be medical

         treatment it would nevertheless be unlawful in the instant case

         to withdraw that treatment.         He referred to what Lord Donaldson,

         Master of the Rolls described as the ’critical equation'!in the

         case of In re J (Wardship; Medical Treatment) reported in r19911

         Family Division Reports at pace 33.                   That case concerned the

         consideration of potential further treatment to a severely brain

         damaged child.        The problem raised in the case was what should

         be done if the child should suffer another collapse which might

         occur at any time.        Should resuscitative treatment be given in

         such a case?     Mr.Munby relying upon a passage in the judgment of

         Lord Donaldson at page 46 submitted that because of the very |

         strong presumption which exists in favour of preserving life^a

   withholding or withdrawing of treatment could only be justified

    in the critical case where the pain and suffering likely to be

   suffered by the patient exceeded the benefit to the patient of

   preserving life.     At page 46 of the report Lord Donaldson said:

   "This brings me face to face with the problem of formulating the

   critical equation.      In truth it cannot be done with mathematical

   or   any   precision.     There   is without     doubt     a   very    strong

   presumption in favour of a course of action which will prolong

   life, but, even excepting the "cabbage" case to which special

   considerations may well apply, it is not irrebuttable.                As this

   Court recognised in "In Re Bw , account has to be taken of thJ

   pain and suffering and quality of life which the child wil^

   experience if life is prolonged«$ Account has also to be taken

   of the pain and suffering involved in the proposed treatment

   itself.”     Later in his judgment he said:       "But in the end there9

   will be cases in which the answer must be that it is not in the^

   interests of the child to subject it to treatment which willj

   cause increased suffering and produce no commensurate benefit ,J

   giving the fullest possible weight to the child's and mankind^

   desire to survive."I In this case however, said Mr.Munby, there

   is no question of suffering because Anthony Bland is totally

   without feeling    or awareness.        He went on       to speak of     "the

   slippery slope” which would be embarked upon if the Court were

   to make a declaration in the terms sought by the Plaintiffs:               A
   dangerous precedent would be established.         He developed in depth

   his submission that      there is an absolute prohibition upon a|

   doctor against taking active steps designed to bring about death./

   He likened the situation to that of two climbers roped together

       where one       climber deliberately cut the rope which                       bound
       companion to himself, or to switching off an iron lung.



       Mr.Anthony Lester Q.C.               instructed by the Attorney General to

       appear    as     Amicus       Curiae       made    submissions       which    in     effect

       supported the Plaintiff's case.                   He acknowledged that the          subject ^
   matter of this case is obviously emotive and difficult.                                 He said ?

       that   the      Court       would    not   be     assisted     by    an   absolutist     or |

       dogmatically         legalistic       approach.      J It was not a so calledfI
   euthanasia case; | it was in terms a case about whether in the I?

   view of the doctors and the Court a particular treatment decision f

   should be taken which would remove the artificial support forf

   life       and      allow       nature    to    take     its     course ;so      that     death|

   supervenes!              He submitted that the law should strive to be inj

   accordance with contemporary medical                           ethics and good medical|

   practicJ.          He acknowledged that Anthony Bland*s case, is difficult

   because, at first sight, it seems to require the Court to reject

   the vital principle of the sanctity of life in favour of value

   judgments           as     to     the    quality       of    the    further      artificial

   prolongation of the life of Anthony Bland.                         He submitted however|

   that there is no inherent conflict between having regard to thef

   quality of life and respecting the sanctity of life if                                  on the |

   contrary, they are complementary;                       the principle of sanctity of^

   life embraces the need for full respect to be accorded to thef

   dignity and memory of the individual human being. fThe meaning |

   and criteria of quality of life should focus on benefit to the |?

   patient. |He contended that Anthony Bland had an interest in the ^

   way in which his family would remember him after his death and f

             medically         sure $on    all    the    evidence          that     the    patient   in a

             persistent vegetative state is suffering permanently from loss

             of consciousness, there is no legal duty to maintain what remains
                                                                                                             M
             of his or her ’’life" whether by feeding or by giving medication.

             It is not in the patient's best interests to do so.                                  In those

             circumstances he submitted there would be no breach of duty or

            criminal liability in ceasing to feed or otherwise to treat the

            patient.           Such a conclusion, he argued, is in accordance with

            existing English case law. ^If the Court declared the treatment

            proposed by Dr. Howe to be 'lawful* then he said the criminal law

            would not become involved because a basic element of criminal

            liability, that is to say an unlawful act (the actus reus) is not

            made out!



            It is correct that there has been no previous case o-f this nature

            in this jurisdiction.            Mr. Lester referred to a case before the

            Supreme Court of the United States:                     Cruzan v Director. Missouri

            Department         of Health     cited at           110 S.Ct.         2841     (1990).     The

            headnote      of     the    report     reads:          “Guardians         of    patients    in

            persistent vegetative state brought declaratory judgment action

            seeking judicial sanction of their wish to terminate artificial

            hydration and nutrition for patient.                      The Circuit Court* Jasper

            County, Probate Division, Charles E. Teel Junior, J. directed

            State employees to cause request of guardians to be carried out.

            Appeal      was      taken.      The    Missouri          Supreme        Court     reversed.

            Certiorari          was    granted.         The     Supreme      Court        Chief   Justice

            Rehnquist, held that:

                        treatment;



               2       State Supreme Court did not commit constitutional error in

                        concluding that evidence adduced at trial did not amount to

                        clear and convincing evidence of patient's desire to cease

                       hydration and nutrition;             and



           3           Due process did not require State to accept substituted

                       judgment of close family members absent substantial proof

                       that their views reflected those of the patient.



           The decision therefore turned on a constitutional point as to the

           jurisdiction of the State of Missouri.     However, in dissenting
                                         tCytV
           judgments Justice Brennan and two other Justices referred to what

          may be regarded as the substantive merits of the case with regard

           to the treatment of patients in a Persistent Vegetative State.

          Mr,         Lester      referred to passages           in the         judgments of Justice

          Brennan and Justice Stevens.                     He drew attention to a passage at

          page 2883 of the report:                       "Medical advances have altered the

          physiological conditions of death in ways that may be alarming:

          highly invasive treatment may perpetuate human existence through

          a merger of body and machine that some might reasonably regard

          as an insult to life rather than as its continuation.                                    But those

           same          advances,        and    the      reorganisation                of     medical        care

                   transformed the political and social conditions of death:                                  people

                  are less             likely to die at home,               and more        likely       to die in

                   relatively public places such as hospitals or nursing homes.

                  Ultimate            questions         that might once        have been       dealt with in

                  intimacy by a family and its physician have now become the

                  concern of institutions."                   At page 2886 Justice Stevens observed

                  "But for patients like Nancy Cruzan who have no consciousness an<f

                  no chance of recovery, there is a serious question as to whether^

               , the mere persistence of their bodies is "life**, as that word is/

                  commonly understood!"                    "The States unflagging determination to

                  perpetuate Nancy Cruzan's physical existence is comprehensible

                  only as an effort to define life’s meaning, not as an attempt to

                 preserve its sanctity."                      At page 2887 he said I                 g    g        n     ^

                  absent some theological abstraction,                          the idea of life is not|

                  conceived separately from the idea of a living person-Mj Justice

                 Brennan used a phrase to which Mr.Lester also pointed when he

                 described persons in the condition of the subject in that case

                 as "passive prisoners of medical technology".                                Mr.Lester also

                 drew attention to the Canadian Law Reform Commission Working

                 Paper of July 1983.                     I do not need to comment in detail upon it

                 but in it the Law Reform Commission of Canada recommended that

                 the cessation of life sustaining treatment in such cases should

                 not attract criminal liability.                          There are a number of other

                 decisions                 of   State    Courts   in     the   United       States       in    which

                 applications for a declaration or for leave to withdraw life

                 sustaining treatment have been granted.                             However they are not

                 strictly comparable to cases in this jurisdiction because many

                 of          them    import       a     consideration     of   ’parens      patriae*          in       the

                    particular States,         In the      present case           there isno question but ^

                    that Anthony Bland         is in a condition         known as the Persistent

                Vegetative State.             He has no feeling, no awareness, nor can he

                experience anything relating to his surroundings.                    To his parentsf

                and family he is "dead". I His spirit has left him and all that

                remains is the shell of his body.                This is kept functioning as

                a biological unit by the artificial process of feeding through

                a mechanically operated naso gastric tube.                    Intensive attention

              . by skilled nurses assists the continuation of the existence of

                the body.           It is a    desperately tragic situation both for what

                remains of Anthony             Bland and   for the devoted          members of his

                family.        The doctor having the responsibility for the care of

                Anthony Bland has come to a very clear medical conclusion.                           He

                is     supported      in   his   assessment     and      opinion    by    doctors     of

                unrivalled experience and professional standing.                         They say in

                terms that it is in accordance with good medical practice and in

                accordance with the true benefit to Anthony Bland himself that

                the artificial feeding regime should be withdrawn.                       The Official

                Solicitor has made clear to the Court the possible implications

                of a precedent being established by a decision in favour of the

                Plaintiffs in this case, although such a decision would accord

                with decisions taken in other common law jurisdictions.                             The

                Court must consider this case in the light of its particular

                facts      and      upon   the   principles     of    law    obtaining       in     this

                jurisdiction.         In my Judgment the provision of artificial feeding|

                by means of a naso gastric tube is ’medical treatment'.                              The

                Court has before it overwhelming medical evidence which supports

                this view.          I accept i|.   The clinical judgment of Dr.Howe is to

              the effect that it would be in the best interests of Anthony

              Bland for that artificial feeding regime to be withdrawn at this

              stage-       He has cogently    given his reasons          for reaching   that

              conclusion.        After three and a half years he has not lightly made

              that decision.         It is a clinical decision arrived at in the

              honest and responsible exercise of his duty of caring for his

              patient.       The fact that Anthony Bland’s existence will terminate

              does not in my judgment alter the reality that the true cause of

              death will be the massive injuries which he sustained in what has

              been described as the Hillsborough disasterf I am satisfied that

              there is no reasonable possibility of Anthony Bland ever emerging

              from his existing persistent vegetative state to a cognitive

              sapient state.         I am satisfied that there is no therapeutic,

              medical      or other benefit    to Anthony Bland          in   continuing   to

              maintain his ventilation nutrition and hydration by artificial

              means.     I am further satisfied that to discontinue the same would

              accord with good medical practice as recognised and approved

             within the medical profession and finally that the order that 1

             propose to make is in the circumstances in the best interests of

             Anthony Bland.         His parents and sister concur in the making of

              the order which I propose to make and I therefore declare that

             despite the inability of Anthony Bland to consent thereto^the

             Plaintiffs and the responsible attending physicians:

              It is understandable that those who are concerned with patients

              in the Persistent Vegetative State should seek assistance as to
                                                                                                                           ft
              appropriate practice in the future.                               Because of the gravity of f

              the decision and the likely possible variation in the facts of#

              individual cases I consider that the approval of the Court should J

              be sought in cases of a similar nature.                                 In accordance with thef

              procedures indicated by Lord Brandon <$f Oakbrook in the case of

              In Re F               T19901      2 Appeal      Cases at page             65         the appropriate

              procedure should be by a summons for a declaration made to the

              Family Division of the High Court.                             The Official Solicitor should

              in my Judgment be invited to act as the Guardian ad litem of the




Received   from   e?i       353   0425                                  11.19.1992    12:25                           P . 14
patient which would guarantee th®. fullest possible investigation

of all the facts and            circumstances of the             individual              case.

Although      essentially      the   decision     is     one    for     the    clinical

judgment of responsible medical practitioners, in my judgment it

is desirable as a safeguard and for the reassurance of the public

that the      Court    should be     involved in         the    way     that        1 have

indicated.     I would expect that in all similar applications there

would    be   not    merely    one   medical     opinion       but     at     least        two

responsible medical           opinions.        Further    the    position           of    the

members of the family is very important.                  It may be that there

will be cases where there is a division of opinion among members

of a family.        In such cases it would be essential in my judgment

for responsible medical carers to                seek the authority of the

Court.

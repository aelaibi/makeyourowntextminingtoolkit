                    Dear Sirs,
                                       Hillsborough Disaster - Public Enquiry.

                         I had a chat with oiie of your staff,a Mr. Mould in fact,yesterday
                    regarding the holding of a Public Enquiry on the above matter, and I
                    asked him to pass on to the appropriate authority my suggestion that
                    I could possibly offer my services in this regard.

                         I am a qualified Civil Engineering Consulting Engineer practising
                    in ISreJiieid since iy^u a S T now agea                               ”

                         During the 60*s and 70’s I have been responsible for the design
                    and construction of many sporting facilities including stadia, sports
                    halls, turnstiles and other amenities and in particular those at Hillsborough.

                         I have been involved at all levels of soccer since my youth and am
                    particularly interested in the comfort and safety of spectators as a
                    regular supporter of all local clubs and a visitor to most grounds in this
                    country.

                         I have served over the years on various committees involving the
                    relevant Institutions and am presently a visiting lecturer at the Sheffield
                    Polytechnic who show great appreciation of my experience and practical
                    knowledge.

                         Perhaps you will pass this letter to the Secretary of the proposed
                    Committee.

                                                 Yours faithfully,

                                                                      /I

                    d mood.        There were           a few Police          in pairs       standing        on street

              corners,           not as m a n y as        I e xp ec te d for a semi-final,                   but they were              not

              e s c o r ti n g    fans at all.           At    the tu rn st il e      there were           no orderly queues

              at all       just a mass            of    people.       There were       three        p ol icemen on horses               but

              they     couldn't          do anything.           There were        t h o u sa nd s    of    people all

              c r ow di ng a ro u n d the t u rn st il es and trying                       to get     in. We       joined      in the

              crowd and tried to get to the turns ti le s                              for L ep pings Lane Terraces.

              The    crushing was              pretty     bad and        I could feel         my     chest     being     s qu eezed

              as we were           being       pushed side to side.               After      about        10 minu te s     I saw a

              gap a pp ea r        in front        of the       tur ns ti le a head of me and                I made      for    it.      I

              was    then        just    carried        t h r ou gh by the       people      behind me         right     up to the

              turn st ile.          It a p p e a r e d    that       the t u r n st il e    had broken because              it was

              just     clicking          round and        I went        straight      t h r ou gh without          handing my

              t icket      in. My        cousins        and                    came t h r ou gh the same             tu rn st il e at

              the same           time.    It was        quite       e mpty   in the are a           between the        turnstile

              a n d the     back of the West Stand.                      We went      to a P r o g r a m m e      seller    for a

              p r og ra mme and we then s to od                     reading    it,    quite    near to the tunnel

              e n tr a nc e w h ic h      leads        to the       central    terraces.       We had been there                for

                 out     five m i n ut es w he n          I sudde nl y saw a blue               c oncertina type gate

              open at       the side of the               t u rn st il es     that we had entered through.                      The

              crowds just           piled t h r ou gh the gate and w a l k e d                 towards         the tunnel.          We
               ^                                                                                     -
              wanted/to           get a good           p os ition so we went           into the tunnel              first,      just

                       nt of the mass              of    people.       I can't       remember        seeing any Po li ce            or

T   oa/A16C   st/ewards by the e nt ra nc e                   to the tunnel.         We w a l k e d down the tunnel

     could see        that      the     pens were        packed full.            The       crowd of                people       caught

     up w i t h us just          before we got             to the end and we were                           just         swept       up by

 them a n d farced               into       the   pens.     I fell       over an d my friend m a n a g e d                            to

     pick me up.          THe    crushing         from behind was              t er rible and we were                           pushed

     f rom side       to side a n d furt he r and furt he r                      into the              pens.            I was just

     t ry in g    to keep on my feet a nd stop my se lf                          from being                 crushed.            A fter

 a bo ut         10 or    13 m i n u t e s    I found myself             right at the front                             of Pen 3.

 T he re was a small                  gate    in front       of me w h i c h          led onto the                      pitch.       It was

     closed at this             time     but a ft er       only a m at t e r          of 10 or 20 seconds.                            I saw .

     it o p e n e d ~     I think        by a P o l i c e m a n       on the      perimeter               track.          A few

     people a h e a d      of me        s c r a m b l e d out.       I felt    someone             push me an d               I managed

'Ho get           to the gate a n d           out    onto    the track.             I saw then that                       the

     game was       being       played a l t h o u g h      I hadn't          seen an yt h i n g                  of    it.

     Infact       I hadn't       r ea lised       that     the game had s t a rt ed until                               then.        The

     crushing       in the       pen had been            really bad a nd               people all

     round had        been scr ea mi ng           for    the gates         to be opened to                         let us out.             The

     people w ere         crushed        so t i gh tl y together              that       some fans                 trying       to get

     out w a l k e d across           the    tops    of the          peoples     heads and shoulders                            to the

     front       fe ncing and         clim be d out.        It took me a couple                         of m i n ut es          to

     recover a nd         get my b re a t h back after                  I had       come through the gate a nd                                  I

     then saw a P o l i c e m a n           run to the       referee and he stopped the                                   game.

 P eo p l e       were    s c a t te re d all       over    the       pitch.     I remember                 some         fans were

     ge tt in g a d v e r t i s i n g    boards      down from the stands                       to make                stretchers.          I

" in ju re d on the boards                   to the other             side of the             pitch where                 the

 ambulances              were.    I had       got s e p e ra te d from my                cousins and my friend

               in the     crush.        I was     going     from one          person to another                          to see       if

     they were a n y of the                 injured ones          on the       pitch but                c o u l d n ’t find them.

     I h el p ed to       carry a bout 5            injured fans across                    t he      pitch to where                   the

   I had seen          lots      of people who a p p e a r e d         to be dead on the             pitch.    I

   d i d n ’t give an y          1st aid       tre at me nt as      I d i d n ’t know how to.             I just   did

   what     I could         in a s s i s t i n g    the   injured to the ambulances.                 I w a l k e d back

   to the        coach an d met           up w i t h                              but then found out           that

            was missing.            We went         to a Po li ce S t a t i o n    but     I can't remember

   m u c h about       that.      E v e n t u a l l y we were      told that                was    in hospital

   with     injuries         to his       ribs and arm the             coach took         us to the hospital

   a n d we were a l l o w e d          to go       in and see            . He was         not too serious and

   a fter about         10 minu te s we             left.   We   left S h e f f i e l d    quite    late on and

    .Jfeent back to Live rp oo l.              I think      that    the major       problem at the game                had
  ft'
 /'
I been the lack of Po li ce                    o r g a n i s a t i o n outside and        inside    the ground.

   A fter       it had happened,             most      of the Police        officers        on the    pitch did

   try an d help as              best     they      could but      some   s tood    round doing           nothing.      I

   can't        say   if the       d ec i s i o n   to open the gates          by the       turnstiles       had been

   a correct          one    in the       c i rc um st an ce s   but    I had been         in the    crush outside

   for about          10 -     13 minu te s and to me              it se em ed as bad as            the    crush   I

   experienced          in the        pert behind the goalmouth.                  I was     not    injured

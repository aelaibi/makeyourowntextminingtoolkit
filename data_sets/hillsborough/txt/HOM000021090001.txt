FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL: COMMITTEE ISSUES


During the Commons Committee proceedings, Mr Hogg gave a number
of undertakings to consider further amendment to the Bill at
Report Stage. This submission sets out the considerations in
each case for amendment and seeks agreement to the proposed
action. In particular the submission reports on progress with
DoE following concerns expressed by Mr Hogg that the criminal
offences in Part I should not be 'absolute' (ie should contain
defences). I attach extracts from the O.R. relevant to the
issues for Home Office consideration.


2.   We are to meet Mr Lloyd on Tuesday 26 September and can
discuss any of these points with him then. The general
introductory brief on football submitted on 11 August provides
some background as does the draft paper for H submitted on
15 September.


ISSUES FOR HOME OFFICE CONSIDERATION

Minimum period in which initial reporting should take place

3.   Clause 16(2)(a) stipulates that all those subject to a
restriction order should report initially to a police station
specified by the court, within 5 days of the making of the order.
Failure to comply with this duty will constitute an offence,
punishable by up to one month's imprisonment or a level 3 fine
(Â£400).


4.   Opposition Committee members advocated a relaxation of this
minimum period to take into account any obligations which would
prevent the reportee's attendance at a police station. In
Committee Mr Hogg expressed some sympathy with this view,
suggesting that it might be appropriate for the presumption of a
5 day period to be maintained, but for a power to be introduced
to enable the court to extend that period, on application, to a
maximum of 28 davs. should special circumstances apply.


5.   The duty to report within 5 days is not seen by us as unduly
burdensome and it is important that an order has effect quickly.
The court will specify that the person concerned should report to
the police station most convenient for him and there is good
coverage of police stations open 24 hours per day. Furthermore,
the offence of failing to report is already provided with a
defence of reasonable excuse. We see no compelling reason for
making a concession here. However, if Ministers wish to make a
concession an amendment could be offered at Report enabling the
court when imposing the restriction order to allow the offender
up to 14 days to report initially if special circumstances
justified that. We would recommend against a more generous
concession since in the Lords the Government narrowed the
standard period to 5 davs from the 28 davs originally in the
Bill.


Minimum period in which initial reporting should take place
following discharge from prison


6.   Clause 16(3V applies the same minimum period of 5 davs to
those reporting for the first time following a period of
imprisonment. An Opposition Committee member (Ted Rowlands,
Merthyr-Tydfil and Rhymney) sought the same level of flexibility
for these cases as previously discussed; Mr Hogg showed less
sympathy for this proposition.
7.   This case is similar to the earlier one but it may be weaker
since those just discharged from prison may have fewer
commitments which would preclude them from attending a police
station within the prescribed period. The defence of 'reasonable
excuse' applies equally in these circumstances. But it is the
practical aspect which presents a real difficulty: the offender
would have no ready-made opportunity to apply to the court for an
extension of the 5-day period.


8.   We recommend that no Government amendment be prepared in
this case.


Place of residence as criteria for making a restriction order

9.   Mr Hogg expressed some unease to us privately about the
possibility of a court making a restriction order against a
foreign visitor. Although it is generally right that anyone
spending time in this country should be subject to the full
weight of our law, it would be worthless to impose an order on a
foreign visitor who could not reasonably be expected to comply
with its requirements for some length of time, if at all.


10. Clause 15(2) already provides that the court shall make a
restriction order only where it is satisfied that in relation to
the accused to do so would help to prevent disorder at designated
matches. It would be possible to amplify this test by requiring
the court to give specific consideration to the period in which
the accused is likely to remain in the jurisdiction if not
ordinarily resident in England and Wales. However, this would
complicate the provision and might open up debate on a
potentially contentious area.


11. We recommend that no Government amendment be prepared in
this case.


Minimum notice of reguirement to report


12. In Committee Mr Hogg agreed to consider introducing a
minimum period of notice to be given to an offender each time he
is required to report when a key match is being played abroad.
There are general arguments in favour of the proposition but
there are practical difficulties attached to the application of a
specified timescale. The fixture list is generally available
well in advance but it is not unusual to have a match rescheduled
at short notice and there are inherent difficulties with
competitions where the identity of the teams playing in the
finals is unknown until the qualifying matches have been played.
A degree of flexibility must be preserved.


13. We recommend that no amendment be made to the Bill but that
guidance to the enforcing authority to be issued by the
Secretary of State should include an instruction that the
enforcing authority should give at least 14 day's notice of the
requirement to report whenever practicable.


Extension of relevant offences in Schedule 1


14. Opposition Committee members tabled an amendment to extend
the relevant offences detailed in Schedule 1 which trigger
disqualification from the membership scheme to include all
alcohol-related offences on the wav to or from a match.
Mr Moynihan resisted the amendment on the grounds that many such
offences would have no relevance to football hooliganism.
However, he undertook to look again at the matter. (See col. 521,
20 July, in attached O.R. extracts.)


15. There does appear to be an anomaly here that would be worth
clearing up. Drunkenness at a match is covered by paragraph fb^
of Schedule 1, which refers to any offence under Section 2 of the
Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol etc) Act 1985 (SECA): that
section makes drunkenness inside or on entry to a designated
ground an offence.  (Possession of alcohol on entry to the ground
is also covered by Section 2 of the 1985 Act and therefore by
Schedule 1 to the Bill.) However, paragraph (fy of the Schedule
refers to Section 1 of SECA. which covers drunkenness and
possession of alcohol on only some journeys to or from a
designated match (broadly by "football specials" whether train,
coach or minibus). So conviction under Section 1 of SECA for
possession of a few unopened cans of beer in a minibus, while
sober, going to a match would lead to disqualification from the
scheme and perhaps a restriction order but conviction for walking
to the match, drunk and in public, would not.

16. Mr Moynihan was quite correct to say (as we had advised him)
that drunkenness offences other than Section 1 of SECA might not
be relevant to behaviour at a match. However, the declaration of
relevance required in paragraph (f) of the Schedule and for other
"journey" offences (ie offences on a journey to or from a match)
ensures that only offences declared bv the court to be related to
football matches would be caught.


17. We have considered whether, if the scope of the alcohol
offences triggering disqualification was widened to include
drunkenness by pedestrians on journeys to or from matches, it
should also be widened to catch drunken driving by those in
private cars on such journeys. When SECA was being enacted there
was sensitivity over extending the Section 2 offence to private
cars largely because of the power of search in Section 7 of SECA,
in connection with any offence under that Act. This objection
would not apply to including drunken driving among the triggering
offences because under the Football Spectators Bill there is no
power of search.


18. On balance, having reflected on the Opposition's suggestion,
we recommend that anv offence of drunkenness on a iournev to or
from a designated match should be an offence triggering
disqualification from membership of the scheme, provided the
court makes a declaration of relevance. As this affects Part I
as well, we will provide a draft letter to Mr Moynihan, if
Ministers are content with our recommendation.

ISSUES FOR DOE CONSIDERATION

Defences to Part I offences


19. Mr Hogg was concerned at the lack of any defence to the
criminal offence in Clause 2(1) of the Bill (the offence of
unlawful entry under the membership Scheme, eg by a disqualified
person). The most serious objection to the Clause 2(1) offence
being absolute was (post-Hillsborough) that the police or club
might order people through turnstiles in an emergency without
inspecting their membership cards. It would be unfair to convict
people caught up in the crowd for failing to be a member of the
scheme when they might not even have been trying to enter the
ground.


20. During the Recess DoE have been persuaded to accept the
defence of acting on lawful authority. An amendment to Clause 2
is being drafted accordingly.


21. A lesser objection to the Clause 2(1) offence being absolute
was that someone such as a foreign visitor mi^ht - conceivably -
be unaware of the requirement to have a card, fail to see warning
signs and not be challenged by the turnstile operator. But this
has to be weighed against the risk of opening a loop-hole for
those deliberately wanting to cheat the scheme: Criminal
department (C4 Division) are content to go along with DoE's very
strong preference (expressed most recently in Mr Ridley's letter
of 21 July to the Home Secretary) not to include a defence in
this case.


22. We therefore consider that Mr Hogg's concerns on defences to
Part I offences have been adequately met and invite Ministers to
agree.


Police intervention in an emergency


23. We have consistently argued in Parliament and with DoE, from
before Hillsborough, that the police have common law powers to
take action intended to save life and protect property and that
it would be undesirable to create a new power under the Football
Spectators Bill to enable the police to suspend the membership
Scheme in an emergency.  (Those supporting such a move have in
mind congestion outside turnstiles, potentially fatal as at
Hillsborough, caused by delays through membership checking.)
24. We can now report that Counsel have replied to DoE's latest
letter firmly endorsing our view that the right way of easing
membership checks in an emergency is by provision in the Scheme
not by allowing police to override the scheme. Amendments to
clause 5 and clause 10 providing for admission in an emergency
are being drafted accordingly.

Awav bans


25. Latest DoE correspondence with Parliamentary Counsel
suggests a new provision allowing the Football Licensing
Authority to prohibit 'away' supporters, from a particular source
club or at a particular destination ground, from attending
particular matches. We are discussing this further with DOE and
will report again.

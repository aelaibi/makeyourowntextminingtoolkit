 On Saturday 15th April 1989, I attended the semi-final (between Liverpool F.C.
 and Nottingham Forest F.C. at Hillsborough, on duty with the St. John Ambulance
 Brigade to which I am a full adult member.         I arrived at Hillsborough at
 approximately 2.15 p.«. after making my own way to the ground.              After signing
 the attendance book and leaving the first aid room, I was asked to join my
 colleagues in the corner of the north stand and the Kop which is usually used
 by the Sheffield Wednesday supporters.        This Kop on the Saturday of the semi­
 final was used by the Nottingham Forest supporters.


Myself and my colleagues commented on the lack of Liverpool supporters on the
 'wings' of the Leppings Lane end of       Hillsborough as we expected the latter to
be full.    We also     commented on the full turnout of the St. John Brigade
members as many more had attended the match than are at a usual Saturday League
match of Sheffield      Wednesday.     All the St. John members were assembled in their
designated corners      by approximately 2.^0 p.m.       At around 2.55 p.m. as the
match was due to start, a police constable remarked to Peter Wells to which I
was party to, that the match had been put back for 15 minutes and was due to
start at 3*15 p.m. instead of 3*00 p.m.         This was not to occur as at exactly
3.0C p.m. both teams came onto the pitch.


■rhe opening minutes of the match seemed to go perfectly normal, until we saw
what looked like the     Liverpool supporters had invaded the pitch.            Nobody knew
what was happening at the Leppings Lane end.           Myself and my colleagues decided
to take the stretcher down to where we thought the trouble was occurring.               As
we arrived on the scene, what seemed like total mass confusion had broken out.
People were being carried out by police officers and Liverpool supporters and
we promptly carried out mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and external heart compressions
on the dying victims.       I, was brought a young man who had been crushed and had
an injury to his left calf and who was also very distressed.               As I remember, I
comforted the young man who was around 18 years of age and put him at complete
rest as I had to leava him to attend other casulaties.            I returned to him when
I could ancl he was eventually taken by some Liverpool supporters on an advertising
board to the first aid room.         Then, I was called by a Tireraan to do resuscitation
on an elderly gentlemaij.     We tried to resuscitate him together, as I was attempting
mouth-to-mouth the fireman was attempting external heart compressions.              Eventually
after several minutes of resuscitation we still couldn't feel a pulse or any si^ns
of life and the fireman agreed we could not have done anything else.              I was then
called upon to attend a young -man who was laid on the pitch.          I put him into the


                                                                                      2/

recovery position^as he was breathing and didn't appear to have any visible
injuries.     I ask# a group of supporters to take him to the first aid room
and he was promptly lifted onto an advertising board and. taken round to be
ferried by one of the many ambulances to hospital.             When I left the man in the
capable hands of his fellow supporters I went round anyone who appeared to be
injured or distressed.      I went to a girl who was very distressed and appeared
to be having trouble breathing       although she hadn't any pain in her chest or
any visible injuries.      I calmed her down and talked to her until her husband
came and found her.      As I felt satisfied that my services were no longer
required, I left her to go to other casulaties.

As most of the bodies and injured people had been taken off the pitch, I made
my way round to the first aid room to see if I could be of any help.                  I was
called by a policewoman to a girl and her husband who had both suffered injuries
in the crowd.      The girl had a pain in her chest said so I examined the area
where I found she had a broken rib.             I felt that any treatment given to her would
have made her uncomfortable so after her husband had been treated for a crush
injury to his ankle we took them to an awaiting mini-bus which was being used for
the casualties who needed to be taken to the hospital but could walk.                  I then
went to see if anymore casualties could be taken to the hospital in the mini-bus.
I went to a young man who had had his legs and his right arm crushed and who
couldn't walk.      Myself, a fellow colleague and a policeman carried the young man
to the bus and I made him a makeshift sling for his arm out of his Liverpool scarf.
Along with two other St. John personnel I went to the hospital with casualties.
On ' viving at the Hg.llamshire hospital, we helped the ca sualties into the
Casualty Department.      I borowed a wheel chair for the young lad who couldn't
walk.     I pushed him to where some doctors were standing and the young lad was
told rather harshly to stand up.          He couldn't stand up and was then promptly
dragged out of the wheelchair where upon he fell to the floor.                  I am not even
sure this woman was a doctor, I helped him back to             the wheelchair.     We then
left the hospital and returned toHillsborough in the mini-bus.


As we arrived back at Hillsborough, we v/ent back to the pitch to find our
colleagues.      This was at approximately 5*^5 p-m.           We then had th* task of
looking for our stretchers that had been left all around the ground.                  After
returning to the first aid rccm                had a drink and a rest.       Wethen left   the
ground at approximately 6.30 p.m.               I arrived home at 7.00 p.n.

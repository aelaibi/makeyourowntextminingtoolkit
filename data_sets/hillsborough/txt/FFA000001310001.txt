WORLD CUP - MEXICO

          addressed the meeting briefly on what the U.K. Police
Forces were doing to stop the Hooligan Element travelling to
Mexico for the forthcoming World Cup.

SPECIAL SERVICE AGREEMENTS

          introduced                 - Deputy Head of Finance to
address the meeting on the Force's Special Service Agreements
with London Clubs.               opened his address by informing
the meeting that the Metropolitan Police charge the following
venues for use of Police - those being the Palace of Westminster
- Houses of Parliament, Heathrow Airport among others. Football
Clubs.

He stressed that changes made to Clubs were set by the Home
Office and were direct instructions to the Metropolitan Police,
who had no choice in the matter where as with County Forces, The
Chief Constables had the last say on Special Service Agreements,
having been advised by the Home Office.

             continued by informing the Forum he had been tasked
to recover as much of the Costs as possible. The Annual cost for
a season is about £1,000,000. The Force was still owed some
£150,000 which was why the Interest clause was inserted into
contracts to deter 'slow payers'.

The Commissioner   had been given permission by the Home Office to
take 'persistent   offenders' to Court for the recovery of payments
due, and the end   result may be the application to the Courts for
the 'winding up'   of such Clubs.

Should Clubs wish to apply for changes in charges they must apply
to the Home Office. As far as the numbers of Police Officers
solely employed inside a ground, this was a matter for discussion
between the Clubs and local Chief Police Officers.


ALL TICKET GAMES

          expressed the view of Police that all ticket matches
did not work, and placed an additional burden on manpower resour­
ces. He stated he had let the F.A. know these said views.

He went on to congratulate both Wimbledon and Charlton on their
promotion to the 1st Division.

         (Wimbledon) pointed out there would have to be changes
and because of the ground at Wimbledon, there would have to be
certain ALL TICKET games in the forthcoming season.

This was accepted by             and any changes would be a matter
for agreement.

                                    The above first league fixture of the 1986/87 Season was played
                                    at Ewood Park and was designated an all ticket match. This wag

                                    An assessment of ticket sales on Friday 22nd August indicated

                                    that there would be a quick processing through the turnstiles
                                    and that there would be little or no problems associated with
                                    infiltration.

                                    As it transpired, over 800 Leeds fans arrived not in possession
                                    of tickets* and with the clear intention of seeking access to the
                                    ground. Considerable problems were encountered at the JDarwen End
                                    turnstiles which provide access to the visitors terraces. These
                                    were associated with the intermingling of ticket and non-ticket
                                    holders in front of the turnstiles and the consequent slow prog­

                                    numerous Leeds fans were in possession of tickets for home areas
                                    of the ground, but wished, quite sensibly, to join their own

                                    facing the ground. Many of these were ticket holders who were

                            would very likely be the subject of violence and damage.

                            thereby containing the situation.

                    End. Despite this, and the fact that a further two pay turnstiles
                    were openea, t n e nuik of the    (JJil nnL galn awveaa l u Un? gi'vuud
                    until 3.50 p.m. At this stage, only 3^ ferns. *er* left oufeaide the
                    ground, and these had no cash in their possession.

                    Take- verall, the policing operation went quite well, but was hindered,
                    rather than assisted by the all ticket embargo which seemingly had done
                    nothing to deter the hooligan element, who were conscious that weight of
                    numbers iaa be a factor that weighs heavily in their favour.

                    Football Liaison Officer at Leeds, and I ask that a further copy be

REPORT O F A MEETING HELD BETWEEN REPRESENTATIVES O F THE EXECUTIVE
     COMMITTEE AND THE ASSOCIATION OF CHIEF POLICE OFFICERS


                              HELD AT
                 16, Lancaster Gate, London, W.2.,
                  on Wednesday, 1st October, 1986

Present:   The Football Association:    Messrs.   F.A. Millichip (in
           the C h a i r ) ,            and

           Commander L. Walker

                                 G. Kirton and

           The Association of Chief Police Officers:      Asst.
           Constable J.D. Phillips.

An apology for absence was received from

The Chairman said that the meeting had been convened primarily to
discuss the effects of ’’Al 1 Ticket" restrictions, bearing in mind
the crowd problems that had occurred at the Odsal Stadium on the
occasion of the Bradford City v. Leeds United match on 20th
September, which had occurred immediately following the lifting
of such a restriction, and of the Membership Scheme currently
adopted by Luton Town F.C., which excluded away supporters from
visiting the stadium.

The Chairman gave a brief history of recent decisions taken
involving Leeds United F.C., culminating in the decision  to lift
the "All Ticket" restrictions imposed on the club's away
fixtures, which had been taken having regard to representations
made by other Second Division Clubs and more particularly various
Police Authorities. Mr. Phillips was then asked if he would
advise the members of the views of the Police Authorities on
these matters.

Mr. Phillips agreed that it was the view of his Association that
the imposition of "All Ticket" restrictions hindered the
satisfactory policing of football matches.   He explained that the
Police Authorities faced two problems, these being:-

(a)   that supporters obtained tickets from "Ticket Touts" and
      other sources and this caused serious segregation problems
      inside the grounds:

(b)   that supporters of both the home and away teams without
      tickets still travelled to the grounds giving rise to
      possible crowd troubles in areas surrounding football
      matches.

Mr. Phillips said that it then became the responsibility of the
local Chief Constable or his appointed deputy to decide whether
those outside the ground'without tickets should be allowed to
gain admittance to prevent problems outside the ground.  Mr.
Phillips believed that "All Ticket" matches could only be policed
effectively and efficiently if they were allied to some form of
workable membership scheme involving the home club.




                                 (1)
     With regard to the Luton Town Membership Scheme, Mr. Phillips
     said that his Association were monitoring the Scheme with
     interest and had agreed to assist the Bedfordshire Constabulary
     as necessary, although there was some doubt in their minds as to
     whether such a Scheme would be viable at other League Grounds.
     In respect of Membership Schemes in general, Mr. Phillips said
     that his Association were in favour    of the      introduction of some
     means of Indentity System providing    such a      system could be proved
     to be practicable.  They were of the opinion at present that the
     implementation of such Schemes would prove totally unworkable,
     bearing in mind the particular difficulties experienced in
     allowing for a very large number of    people      to gain admittance to'
     a stadium in a very short period of    time. He said that his
     Association were always very concerned with the practical
     policing problems that could occur.

                 pointed out that over a number of years several games
     had been made "All Tic k e t ” and to the knowledge o f ‘ The
     Association, no serious disturbances had been caused outside
     grounds by people without tickets who were unable to gain
     admittance.   Commander Walker supported this view and said he
")   felt it had been a major factor in the crowd troubles at Bradford
     that the "All Ticket" restrictions had been lifted, thus allowing
     a far greater number of Leeds Supporters to be admitted to the
     ground.  Mr. Phillips noted these comments but felt unable to
     support them as in his experience making local derby matches "All
     Ticket" led to segregation problems and did not help the policing
     situation in any way.

     The Chairman asked Mr. Phillips for the police reaction should
     the "All Ticket" arrangement be reinstated.  Mr. Phillips said
     that the police would naturally do everything in their power to
     make it work.  In such circumstances he felt it very important
     that home clubs should ensure that tickets for such matches went
     on sale in controlled circumstances - preferably at one of their
     previous home fixtures.  This would alleviate the problem of
     people having to visit the ground twice and also ensure that
     tickets only went to their own supporters.  It was also agreed
     that considerable publicity should be given to "All Ticket"
     matches to ensure that the public were aware that tickets had to
/    be purchased in advance.

     Mr. Phillips reported in detail present measures being taken by
     the police in an endeavour to eliminate hooliganism at football
     matches, including the use of close circuit television and still
     photographs to assist in bringing prosecutions.  It was agreed by
     all attending the meeting that hooliganism was basically a social
     problem and unfortunately football matches were used as a vehicle
     for anti-social behaviour.

     The representatives of The Football Association gave their
     individual views on various matters appertaining to the subjects
     under discussion, including the recent Alcohol Legislation.   Both
     parties felt that the Government had acted in haste in this area
     and that the problem of drunkeness at football grounds was not
     solved by a ban on the sale of alcohol within the Stadia.   It was
     agreed for the need for even closer liaision to exist between the
     clubs and relevant Police Authorities, particularly with regard
     to a club deciding to make one of its fixtures "All Ticket".




                                   (2)
          The Chairman concluded the meeting by thanking Mr. Phillips for
          giving those present a far greater insight into the working of
          the Police Authorities with regard to the policing of football
          matches and for giving the frank views of his Associations on the
          topics under discussion.

                                                        14th October, 1936



            Dear Colleague,

                   I write in my capacity as Chairman of the ACPO Sub-Committee on
            Hooliganism at Sporting Events.

                  vf.>u rnriy bs av/ars that the Football Association liave recently
           re-imposed their ’ail ticket’ restriction in respect of Leeds UniteCs
           away fixtures. Prior to their decision the Secretary of my sub-committee,
           David Phillips, met with the Football Association and placed on record
           the ACPO view, based on numerous incidents over the last two years where
           the all ticket arrangements had not worked well. Our argument has always
           been that the all ticket option should be considered as a means of
           restricting capacity and not. as ar, F.A. punishment.     In the event -che
           F.A., having considered our view, took the decision which they were
           entitled to do as they felt the image of the game required it.

                  In spit." of previous restrictions -large numbers of Le-ids f-ins
           have consistently travelled to away games without tickets. The Ground
           Commander on the day has then often been faced with the. o p t i o n of
           dividing his resources to police both in&ide and outside the ground or
           allowing those without tickets into the ground jio that he i s better able
           to police them. He has frequently been lsft with little choice but to
           allow them into grounds thus defeating the object of the all ticket
           arrangements.

                  Whilst we advised the Football Association against this course
           of action we should, I believe, now do what we can to support the ban
           otherwise we shall be presenting a divided front to the hooligans'
           advantage.

                  I would therefore recommend that every effort be made in planning
           for the remaining Leeds 'away' games to enforce the ban.

                                         Yours sincerely,




                                             Chief Constable
                                                             n    r   7

Superintendent McCRONE said it had been agreed at the previous

meeting that Bank Holiday kick offs should be in the morning and

sought agreement on this in the future.   There was no dissent.


                    said that in regard to evening matches it may

be a good idea to time the kick off for 8.00 pm rather than

7.30 or 7.45 in order to minimise inconvenience to commuters

using an already crowded transport system at the same time as

supporters.   Discussion followed and the general concensus was

that later kick offs could give rise to other problems and it had

been found that many people still arrived at the last moment.



ALL TICKET GAMES


Commander ROBINSON said generally police are opposed to 'all

ticket' matches as due to the considerable practical policing

problems in enforcing this rule.   After discussion it was

generally agreed that 'all ticket' games often caused more

problems than they solved but they were occasionally necessary.


PUBLIC ORDER ACT 1986


Superintendent McCRONE outlined the main changes which affected

executive boxes, alcohol restrictions in respect of mini buses,

and the prohibition on fireworks, flares, etc., which came into

force on 1st January.   He also outlined the provisions which will

apply to Exclusion Orders and explained it was anticipated that

this part of the Act would come into force on 1st August.


The British Transport Police said they would seek such orders

from a court against anyone convicted of offences on the

Transport System where they were on way to a match.

Dear                                 Oj u l        hdcJ:
              Thank you for your letter of^oth. April, 198$ >
regarding the policy of allowing ticketless fans into matches.

               I have looked at my records and have found the
following matches where Police did not allow ticketless supporters
into the relevant ground.

5 -3 -8 8 .       Queens Park Rangers      v. Liverpool. — Metropolitan Eolice.
1 -1 0 -8 0 .     Brighton v. Leeds.                              - Sussex Constabulary.
1 0 -1 2 -8 0 .   Tottenham v. Killwall.                          - Metropolitan Folice.
4 -2 -8 9 .       Queens Park Rangers      v. Millwall.           - Metropolitan. Folice.
        !-■
1 -4 - 8 9 .      To11 enham v . WestBam                         —    Metropoitan Police.

In addition to these matches I have attended many games at Millwall
especially where they have been 'all ticket’ and on no occasion have
visitors or home supporters "been allowed in without a ticket.

Although I cannot recall the date^but it would have been I986 or 1987,
I was at Srimsby v. Leeds and 200 were refused entry.

             It has to he remembered that not many matches are
designated 'all ticket' and therefore we are considering very few in
comparison.
              Of all the Clubs tlr.t I attend I regard Millwa.ll as the
most proficient in sta,ging 'all ticket'.    The Police corden off
the ground at either end of Coldblow Lane a,nd only ticket holders are
allowed forward to the turnstiles.     This can "be expensive in manpower
"but once an established practiced the numbers can be reduced as the fans
have got the message.      I am a great believer in early cordens wherevei
the geography permits.

             You will see that the Metropolitan Iolice have been
the most consista,nt at the matches I have attended, but they do have
strong reserves in Central Ionc.on and the Senior Officer at the '.fround
is not as vnnerable as his colleagues in parts of the provincies.

             Generally speaking the rjenior Officer prefers to have
the ticketless fens where he can stipi ervise and segregate then® He
wishes to avoid splitting his manpower to police the town centre when
frustrated visitors lay seige. Fe will fr:,ve to police the area when
they have left and face the angry oirtbursts of local traders and others
who have been injured or their property damaged. Hi?- view then is often
parochial #

             Finally, it could be argued that greater hooliganism and
more arrests night have occurred if fans were kept out, certainly

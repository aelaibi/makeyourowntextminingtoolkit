I found that          the main          root    of this    disorder       was       due    to m e m b e r s    of    the

media    forcing       u n w a n t e d a t t e n t i o n upon d i s t r e s s e d    relatives        of decease

and    injured       persons       and       indeed upon some         of the        injured        persons

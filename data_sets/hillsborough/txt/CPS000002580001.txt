1.    ISSUE

1.1   Hillsborough

2.    ACTION REQUIRED


2.1   In order to prepare handlingarrangements for the publication of LordJustice Stuart-
       Smith’s report, GeorgeCroston was asked to review the report and advise the
       Director on the following points

                 •   what the Home Secretary can properly say about the Director’s
                     decision (that the material presented to her prior to the scrutiny would
                     not justify fresh proceedings):

                 •   whether there is any part of the report which would cause us concern
                     if it was published;

                 •   the extent to which the material which the judge has considered can or
                      should be put into the public domain;

                 •   whether there is anything in the report that may give rise to
                     suggestions that there ought to be further police enquiries regarding the
                     amending of police officers’ (or other persons’) statements;

                 •   whether the state of the terracing requires further enquiry;

                 •   the extent to which the report discloses new information not previously
                      considered that may reflect on the potential criminal liability of the
                      football club.
2.2   The Home Secretary’s letter of the 9 February 1998 addressed to the Attorney
      General (and copied to the Director) asks for his views on certain points concerning
      issues involving the Director. I have been requested to advise on these points as
      follows:

             •      whether advice considered by the Director in 1990 and 1997 as to the
                    evidence needed to support criminal proceedings, could be placed in
                    the Library at the House and therefore be in the public domain;

             •      whether or not the Director agrees that having considered the
                    conclusions of the report, and on the basis of the material it contains,
                    there is no basis that would justify fresh criminal proceedings;

             •      whether anything in the process by which police officers submitted
                    statements to the Taylor Inquiry might amount to misconduct of a
                    criminal or disciplinary nature, and thus require the instigation of a
                    police investigation;

             •      whether the new information concerning the condition of the terraces
                    and the overestimation of the crowd capacity would have affected the
                    conclusions of the Taylor Inquiry and by inference the Director’s
                    original decision not to prosecute any person;

3.    TIMING

3.1   A public announcement will be made by the Home Secretary on the 18 February
      1998.

3.2   This advice is required as soon as possible.

4.    BACKGROUND

4.1   Following the submission of the Central Casework review note to her, the Director
      wrote to the Attorney General on the 9 May 1997 advising that there was no new
      evidence and no grounds for re-opening the police enquiry. That review, dated the
      8 May 1997, should be read in conjunction with this briefing note as it gives more
      comprehensive details of the allegations and evidence that were examined.

4.2   On the 13 May 1997 the AttorneyGeneral endorsed the Director’s view.

4.3   After consultation with theDirector and the Law Officers, the Home Secretary
      announced his independent scrutiny on the 30 June 1997.
CPS co-operated fully with Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s enquiry. His enquiry has seen:

       •      the schedule of documents considered by the CPS in this case;

       •      the opinions of counsel;

       •      George Croston’s recent review note, leading to the Director’s decision
              on the 9 May 1997.

Chapter 1 of the report covers the background to the disaster in detail.

KEY CONSIDERATIONS

The scrutiny terms of reference appertaining to the CPS were "To ascertain whether
any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough Stadium on 15 April
1989 which was not available to the Director of Public Prosecutions ... for the
purpose of discharging ...(her)... statutory responsibilities ... and to draw to (her)
attention any evidence not previously considered by (her) which may be relevant to
(her) ... duties".

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith was also to consider the existence of evidence in relation
to police disciplinary matters.

For the purposes of the scrutiny he received evidence both orally and in written form
from relatives of the victims, members of the public, police officers and others (for
a full list see Appendix 1 to the report). He examined the papers from Lord Taylor’s
Inquiry and most of those from the Inquests. He looked at the body files and
submissions from the counsel for the Hillsborough Family Support Group (HFSG)
and members. He considered all the above evidence whether previously available or
not. ‘Previously available’ was defined as being within the public domain or known
to the legal advisers of the parties or families. He read the joint opinion of counsel
( of the 6 August 1990) who advised the DPP that the police investigation had not
changed the findings of the Taylor Inquiry. The report does not mention that the CPS
review note of 1997 was taken into consideration or indeed read.


The report’s covering letter, which was addressed to the Home Secretary, says that
the report was written with publication in mind following the Minister’s stated
intention to publish the evidence considered during the scrutiny. Lord Justice Stuart-
Smith gives categories of that evidence which he does not think should be disclosed.
It includes:

       •      Reports from Drs Bums and West (relates solely to the death of one
              particular person).
       •      Report of N.Bume (copyright problem involving privileged material
              although his oral evidence is in the public domain).
       •      Details of consultations as listed at paragraph 6 of Appendix 1,
              including the Coroner.
       •      Transcripts of private discussions with relatives of the deceased.
The report consisted of seven chapters and ten appendices. The key points from each
chapter will be considered in order.

Chapter 1: BACKGROUND: Paragraphs 25 and 26 of the report state that counsel
for the HFSG only invited a recommendation (as to criminal prosecution) in the case
of Duckenfield and Murray, who were the two main senior officers on the day. The
Judge opined that the fresh evidence would have to be of sufficient significance that
in considering it there would be a real possibility that the DPP might change her mind
and institute proceedings for manslaughter, or any other offence, against one or both
of the officers. At paragraph 56 it was said that any prosecution of an individual
police officer would have to establish his individual responsibility. It would not be
enough to prove the composite failure of the police operation.

Chapter 2: VIDEO EVIDENCE: The Judge found that there was considerable
confusion and misunderstanding about the video evidence of the disaster. All four
police video tapes (including the one that was supposedly missing) were made
available in their entirety to the Taylor Inquiry and to the Coroner. There was no
evidence for the suggestion that the theft of two video tapes from the club’s Control
Room was part of a police ‘cover-up’. Submissions to him by counsel for the HFSG
were:

        •     Police evidence that their failure to see overcrowding in the pens was
              due to a defective camera was deliberately false.
        •     Evidence from video tapes was deliberately suppressed and concealed
              by the police because it would have revealed the above falsity.
        •     The Coroner failed properly to pursue the question of the ‘missing
              footage’.
        •     PCs Bichard and Ryan, and PS Goddard deliberately gave false
              evidence about camera 5 not working properly.
        •     The evidence of Mr Houldsworth, the club CCTV technician, that the
              pens were overcrowded, was deliberately withheld from the jury.



He says that if the first two submissions are made out they might affect the verdict
of accidental death and the decision of the DPP not to prosecute for manslaughter. The
third submission is a grave allegation against the Coroner which could also affect the
verdict. On the fourth submission consideration would have to be given to prosecuting
the officers concerned. The fifth shows a further criticism of the police failure to
appreciate a dangerous situation. His brief findings on each point are shown below:

5.7.1         Submission 1 is quite untenable.

5.7.2         As submission 1 is misconceived, number 2 must fail also. There
              never was any disappearance or concealment of video footage from
              camera 5. The allegation is completely unfounded.

5.7.3          Submission 3 is unfounded as there was no missing footage.
       5.7.4          The evidence on submission 4 is wholly insufficient to warrant
                      consideration of criminal proceedings against any police officers.

       5.7.5          Mr Houldsworth’s evidence is rejected. His explanation as to why it
                      was only in 1996 that he realised his evidence was important is not
                      convincing. What he now says is inconsistent with what he said
                      before.The importance of his evidence has been exaggerated out of all
                      proportion.

5.8    Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s final comments on the video evidence is that there is
       nothing in the submissions that calls for any further inquiry or consideration by the
       prosecuting or disciplinary authorities.

5.9    Chapter 3: MEDICAL EVIDENCE: The Judge said that the Coroner’s reasoning has
       been widely misunderstood and misinterpreted. In considering the question of how
       someone died it is not usually relevant to consider matters subsequent to the infliction
       of injuries which obviously result in death. There was no new intervening cause
       which might break the chain of causation between the crushing injuries and death.
       The Coroner did not say that all those who died did so before 3.15. The cut-off time
       was necessarily imposed to keep the Inquiry within reasonable bounds. It is difficult
       to see the relevance of further evidence that a person was alive at 3.15pm but died
       subsequently.

5.10   The scrutiny considered the evidence of Dr Walker among others. It was suggested
       by counsel that the medical conclusions and assumptions made by the Coroner as to
       the cut-off time were false, and that on an application for judicial review it would be
       open to the Divisional Court to hold that the (inquest) verdicts had been procured by
       fraud, suppression of evidence or insufficiency of inquiry. Further that the non­
       presentation of Dr Walker’s evidence (like that of Mr Houldsworth) could amount to
       fraudulent concealment.

5.11   Lord Justice Stuart-Smith found all the submissions on the medical evidence to be
       unfounded. The relevant part of his reasoning was that the evidence of Dr Walker and
       others added nothing to that given at the Inquest. The suggestion that the evidence
       now put before him was deliberately suppressed and concealed and those concerned
       acted in bad faith, was in his opinion wholly irresponsible.

5.12   Chapter 4: ALLEGED IMPROPER INTERFERENCE WITH WITNESSES: These
       allegations were not made to the CPS in the HFSG letter of 4 March 1997 or at any
       other time, except by way of a general remark that "one of the most striking aspects
       of this history is the way in which the evidence presented to the Inquest was evidence
       that tended to exculpate the South Yorkshire Authorities and the police from blame.
       Very serious questions arise as to the process by which evidence was selected by the
       West Midlands Police who assisted the Coroner". The allegations were either of
       pressure being brought by police officers to bear on witnesses in order to prevent
       certain evidence being put before the jury, or of the way in which South Yorkshire
       Police obtained evidence about the disaster from their own officers (specifically the
       amendments made to their witness statements).
5.13   The Divisional Court did not find it necessary to investigate the allegation concerning
       the police putting improper pressure on civilian witnesses. The scrutiny did look into
       this matter in great detail. The first conclusion was that the suggestion that police
       officers brought pressure to bear on witnesses as part of a biased and incomplete
       investigation was clearly untenable. Secondly, that for the most part the suggestions
       made by the solicitors (acting for the police) for amendments were not open to
       criticism. In a few cases it would have been preferable if a deletion had not been
       made. At worst it was an error of judgement, it was not unprofessional conduct. Any
       amendments made by the police themselves were unexceptionable. The Judge is quite
       satisfied that the exclusion of comments (in the statements) could not possibly have
       affected the DPP. The allegation of irregularity and malpractice is not substantiated.

5.14   Chapter 5: OTHER MATTERS OF CONCERN: Families of some of the victims
       raised concerns about alleged inconsistency in police evidence, failure to disclose
       documents, and police bias. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith was not able to resolve all the
       concerns about conflicts in evidence. However he would be surprised if the criticisms
       about families being unable to obtain copies of relevant documents were true. He saw
       no reason to differ from Lord Taylor’s conclusion as to the impartiality of the West
       Midlands investigation.

5.15   Chapter 6: MISCELLANEOUS: The state of the ground: New evidence was heard
       from Mr N.Bume, a structural engineer who advised on the safety and structural
       aspects of the Hillsborough ground in 1990. It had not been available at the time of
       the Taylor Inquiry and he was not called to give evidence at the Inquest. In October
       1990 Mr Bume gave evidence before a High Court judge in the contribution
       proceedings (when the apportionment of liability was decided as between the police,
       the Club and others). However these proceedings were settled before his evidence was
       complete or could be tested in cross-examination. His report criticised, among other
       things, the inadequate number of turnstiles, the lack of a control system for
       monitoring numbers in each pen, the overestimation of overall capacity on the
       Leppings Lane Terraces, inadequate emergency signing, and the inadequate standard
       of crush barriers. There were said to be many breaches of the advice and
       recommendations contained in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds. The scrutiny
       found that all but two of the criticisms were fully considered by the Taylor Inquiry.
       These were the height of the crush barriers which were too low, and the overall
       capacity of the terrace which was overestimated. The conclusion was that these
       matters did not give grounds for re-opening the Judicial Inquiry or any other
       proceedings. The Judge considered that had Lord Taylor known about them he might
       have criticised the Club, their consultant engineers, and those responsible for the
       licensing of the ground in more stringent terms than he did. He did not consider that
       the central conclusion of the Inquiry would have been changed, in that the primary
       cause of the disaster was a failure of police control. However, if the responsibility
       of the other parties was somewhat greater than had earlier been appreciated, that
       might have a bearing on any reconsideration of criminal proceedings against officers.
                                           *


5.16   Chapter 7: SUMMARY: Lord Justice Stuart-Smith does not consider that there is any
       material that should be put before the DPP or Police Complaints Authority which
       might cause them to reconsider the decisions they have already taken. There is no
       occasion for any further investigation into the circumstances in which alterations were
       made to some of the self written statements of South Yorkshire officers.

5.17   The conclusions from the scrutiny report mirror the relevant comments from my
       review.Indeed the Judge’s observations on the allegations and submissions put to him
       on behalf of the HFSG are often more stinging than mine.

6.     RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1    The recommendations on the points requiring action in paragraph 2.1 above are:

       6.1.1 The Director’s decision: The Home Secretary stated to Parliament on the 30
             June 1997 that the Director of Public Prosecutions takes the view that the
             material so far presented to her would not justify fresh criminal proceedings.
             My review of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s scrutiny report is that he comes to
             the conclusion that, having heard fresh evidence, there is nothing that should
             be put before the Director to cause a reconsideration of previous decisions.

              Therefore I recommend that the Director can quite properly say that the report
              does not change her stated view.

       6.1.2 Publication of the report: I have read the report a number of times and am
             unable to find any point of evidence or conclusion which is adverse, unfairly
             or otherwise, to the CPS. While there is a quote from counsels’ joint opinion
             of 1990, and therefore strictly speaking privileged, the way in which the quote
             and comment are used is supportive of our decision making process in the
             case.

              I recommend that no objection be taken.

       6.1.3 Material for the public domain: Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s covering letter to
             the Home Secretary said that the Minister’s stated intention was to publish the
             evidence which was considered during the scrutiny. That letter makes certain
             recommendations to the Minister about specific categories of evidence and
             which do not involve the CPS. By inference it could be said that other
             material, for example, the 1990 joint opinion of two leading counsel, should
             be put into the public domain by being deposited in the House Libraries. This
             opinion was read by the Judge who commented favourably on it. He did not
             say that he considered in any way whatsoever the 1997 report to the Director
             from myself. Neither of the two reports could be classed as evidence, fresh
             or otherwise. They are legally privileged or subject to Public Interest
             Immunity and not normally subject to disclosure unless previously in the
             public domain or where that privilege or immunity is waived. Neither have
             been disclosed publicly. The basic rule is that reasons for prosecuting
             decisions are given in only the most general terms. The view is normally
             taken that the public discussion of a decision not to prosecute could amount
       a trial of a suspect, in this case certain police officers and others, without the
        safeguards which criminal proceedings are designed to provide. The Judge’s
       comments on our decision in 1990 should be sufficient for the interests of
       justice to be served. Similarly, the above reasons should also apply to the
        1997 review.

       I recommend that it is not in the interests of justice for the disclosure of the
       two advices.

6.1.4 Further police inquiries re amended statements: The report conclusions are
      that there was no improper pressure put on witnesses and that a small part of
      the amendment procedure involved at worst an error of judgement on the part
      of solicitors. As we have not seen the evidence available to the scrutiny we
      have no reason to consider going behind the conclusions made.

       I recommend that there should be no further action on this point.

6.1.5 Further inquiries re the terracing: Paragraph 5.1.4 above covers Lord Justice
      Stuart-Smith’s opinion that the new and valid evidence concerning the crush
      barriers and terrace capacity would not have affected the central conclusion
      of the Inquiry. He might have made stronger comments about the Club and
      others. This new evidence was extremely relevant to civil liability claims and
      was before the High Court for those proceedings. It must be right that when
      the scrutiny report is published a more fair apportionment of blame can be
      acknowledged. My assessment of the comment that the appreciation of a
      greater responsibility of other parties might have a bearing on any
      reconsideration of criminal proceedings against officers is that if there had
      been a decision to prosecute it would have been affected by the new and
      mitigating evidence.

       I recommend that no further action is required as to any more inquiries.

6.1.6 Potential criminal liability of the Club: I can find nothing in the report which
      can be seen as a suggestion that the new evidence goes towards criminal rather
      than merely civil liability. The Judge considers that there are no grounds for
      reopening the Judicial Inquiry or any other proceedings.

       I recommend that no action should be taken by us on the new evidence now
       seen.

The recommendations on the points requiring action in paragraph 2.2 above are in
accordance with what I have already said:

6.2.1 Disclosure of our advices into the public domain should be resisted, not least
      on the ground of ‘candour’.

6.2.2 There is no basis for the instigation of criminal proceedings against police or
      others or for any further investigation into allegations of purported criminal
      liability.
7.    CONCLUSION

7.1   There have been       detailed and comprehensive investigations of the grave
      circumstances that lead up to the disastrous consequences in the Hillsborough
      Stadium. It should now be considered that UK judicial procedures have been fully
      explored and satisfactorily exhausted for the purposes of the CPS. I have no doubt,
      based on my dealings with the HFSG, that the matter will not end here.

7.2   There are a number of matters contained in the Home Secretary’s letter of the 9
      February 1998 which do not fall within the CPS remit and I have therefore expressed
      no view. They concern any applications to the High Court for a new inquest and the
      role of a Coroner following an inquiry into a major disaster.

7.3   Our concerns about placing the 1997 review note and the 1990 joint opinion in the
      library of the House have been expressed orally to Stephen Wooler, who will brief
      the Attorney General accordingly. It is understood that the Attorney General and the
      Home Secretary will be discussing Hillsborough in the margins of another meeting
      today. Thereafter, Stephen Wooler will draft a reply from the Attorney General to
      send to the Home Secretary, which we will consider before despatch.



George Croston                                                          11 February 1998
ATTORNEY GENERAL

               Background Note: Hillsborough Disaster


1.      On the 15th April 1989 at the Hillsborough stadium,
        Sheffield 95 people died and over 400 were injured due to
        gross overcrowding and crushing in the two pens behind
        the goal at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.

2.      A public enquiry headed by Lord Justice Taylor produced
        an interim report in August 1989.  The West Midlands
        Police assisted in the preparation of the report and
        later conducted a criminal investigation which was
        requested by the D.P.P.  The criminal investigation was
        extensive producing bulky documentation and a full
        transcript of the evidence given at the enquiry. The
        police investigation was meticulous.

3.      A copy of Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report and a copy
        of Counsel's opinion by Gareth Williams Q.C. and Peter
        Birts Q.C. are attached.  It would be useful to refer to
        the plans at Appendix 1 and Appendix 4 of the report.


Facts

4.      There is little, if any, dispute as to what actually
        happened.Chief Superintendent Duckenfield was the police
        officer responsible for policing the match.

5.      At 2.52 pm (8 minutes before kick-off) Duckenfield
        ordered one of the exit gates, Gate C, at the Leppings
        Lane end to be opened.  This was to relieve massive
        overcrowding and crushing at the turnstiles caused by a
        build up of supporters arriving after 2.30 pm.  In the
        five minutes after the gate was opened 2000 supporters
        entered the ground and went into a tunnel under the west
        stand which gave access only to the central pens 3 and 4.
        Those pens were already full. There was no controlled
        way in which supporters were allowed in to the pens. The
        additional influx caused intense pressure and resulted in
        the collapse of a crush barrier 124A near the front of
        pen 3. Many died from suffocation and crushing and some
        were trampled on. Perimeter gates were not opened by the
        police partly because of orders not to do so without
        permission and partly because officers did not appreciate
        the severity of what was occurring initially.  Later when
        the emergency was appreciated the small size and number
        of the gates made evacuation extremely difficult.

6.      The build up of fans outside the ground was due to the
        geography of the turnstiles, their marking and numbers
        and to a loss of police control of supporters outside
        becoming keen to get inside before the kick-off.
7.    The three major causal factors w e r e :-

      i . the layout of the ground
      ii. the opening of the exit gate (gate C)
      iii. the build up outside the ground

Layout of the Ground

8.    The club were advised by a structural engineer, Dr
      Eastwood.  The Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 required
      expert advice to obtain a safety certificate under the
      Act from the local council.  Dr Eastwood advised
      additional crush barriers, these were installed in 1979.
      A certificate was granted.

9.    The safety certificate did not specify maximum numbers
      for the pens.  This, with turnstile monitoring of
      numbers, would have limited entrance to the pens.

10.   It was the policy of the police at semi-finals to allow
      movement of supporters between pens before the kick-off
      after which the radial gates would be closed and locked.
      Hence without a control on the numbers entering the
      tunnel access pens 3 and 4 were liable to become grossly
      overcrowded.  The police had accepted responsibility for
      monitoring the pens and their policy of "letting the fans
      find their own level" was severely criticized by Taylor.

11.   The exit gate C, opened following Duckenfield's
      instruction, is opposite the tunnel.  No steps were taken
      to cordon off the tunnel or divert the fans around the
      sides of the West stand.  The supporters had nowhere to
      go but the already crowded pens 3 and 4.

12.   At 3.04 pm a surge forward in pen 3 caused the crush
      barrier 124A to break. This appears to have been a major
      factor in the deaths since there were far fewer deaths in
      pen 4 where no barrier collapsed.  Barrier number 144 had
      been removed in 1986, its absence meant there was no
      retarding structure as fans emerged from the tunnel into
      pen 3. There was unbroken diagonal pressure from the
      mouth of the tunnel down to barrier 124A. the collapse
      of barrier 124A was a major factor in the cause of the
      deaths.  Barrier 124A was slightly corroded but it had
      been tested in July 1988 and had passed loading tests
      specified in the Government's Green Guide. Taylor found
      that corrosion played a part in the collapse but the
      effective cause was the excessive unanticipated pressure
      exerted at the time of the forward surge.

13.   The crushing in pens 3 and 4 was not recognised by police
      either in the control box or on the perimeter of the
      pitch.  Even supporters nearby, broadcasters and stewards
      were not immediately aware.

14.   Even after the crush, and until 3.06 pm, the main police
      concern was to prevent a pitch invasion.
The build up outside the Ground

15.   The opening of gate C which precipitated the disaster was
      made necessary by the massive build up of supporters at
      the Leppings Lane turnstiles between 2.30 and 2.50 pm.
      As kick-off time approached the crushing increased. The
      police lost control of the crowd.  The crush became
      unmanageable, many feared for their lives.  The kick-off
      was not postponed.  This course was only to be taken if
      there was a major cause of delay eg. a motorway accident
      or fog. Taylor concluded that the kick-off should have
      been postponed.

16.   There was considerable evidence that people would be
      killed if gate C was not opened and that Duckenfield had
      no alternative but to do s o . That being so neither
      Duckenfield nor other officers took any steps to deal
      with the consequences of opening the gate. The tunnel
      was not closed off even though such action had been taken
      by the police in 1988. Duckenfield did order the influx
      at gate A, which had been opened earlier, to be
      monitored.  His omission to do so at gate C was said by
      Taylor to be "a blunder of the first magnitude". This
      was the immediate cause of the crushing in pens 3 and 4.
      It was not the sole cause.

17.   The layout of the turnstiles, inadequate space for the
      formation of orderly queues and the limited extent of the
      waiting area combined with poor designation and marking
      of turnstiles contributed to slow turnstile operation.

18.   There were only 7 turnstiles to admit 10,100 fans at the
      other end of the ground there were 60 turnstiles to admit
      29,800.  Taylor concluded that the police and club should
      have foreseen potential queuing and waiting to admit
      fans.

19.   Many supporters arrived after 2.30 pm. Tickets advised
      arriving 15 minutes before kick-off.   Some arrived
      without tickets.   The evidence shows many had been
      drinking.   Taylor concluded the majority had not been
      affected by drink.   Unruliness contributed to the pushing
      effect.   This contributed to the loss of control by the
      police.

20.   The main factor in the police loss of control was
      ineffective strategy planning for the large number of
      arrivals. Taylor concluded that by controlling the fans
      and postponing the kick-off gate C could have remained
      closed.

Responsibilities

21.   The layout of the ground was the responsibility of the
      Club, Eastwood, the Council and the police. No one
      foresaw that up to 2000 fans would ever be allowed to
      enter pens 3 and 4 when they were already overcrowded.
      No one anticipated gate 3 being opened or the crushing
      outside the ground.  The police must take the main
      responsibility for letting the fans "find their own
      level", however, the Club must share responsibility for
      the way in which supporters were allowed to fill the pens
      at semi-finals.                             *

22.   The opening of gate C was Duckenfield's responsibility.
      In the circumstances his decision was correct. His
      failure was to give no order to deal with the sudden
      influx of fans. Had the tunnel been cordoned off the
      disaster would almost certainly have been averted.

23.   The layout of the turnstiles, their numbers and marking
       are primarily matters for the police and the Club, but
       the Council have a partial responsibility to ensure safe
       access to the ground.

Criminal Offences

24.   The two offences would be Manslaughter and Culpable
      Misfeasance.  These potential offences were considered
      against all parties, ie. the club, the Council, the
      police and the structural engineers (Mr Eastwood).

The Club

25.   The Club's responsibility for the layout and alterations
       inside the ground and for the layout of the turnstiles is
      where any potential liability exists.   It is clear that
       these were not the sole, or even the major causes and
       that any actions and omissions by the club only partly
       contributed to the crushing and deaths. The Club not
       only relied on its own consultant engineer Dr Eastwood
       but it responded to the suggestions and advice of the
       police in important matters.

26.   There is insufficient evidence to establish the actus
      reus of manslaughter against the Club. Additionally the
      evidence does not show either the recklessness or gross
      negligence required for the manslaughter offence.
Eastwood and Partners

27.   Eastwood's advice formed only part of the events that
      lead tot he structural condition at the groujid. It could
      not be said that his advice caused the deaths. In fact
      some of his advice, not acted on for financial reasons,
      may have lead to maximum limits being set for pens 3 and
      4.

28.   Again there is insufficient for the actus reus of
      manslaughter nor can the required recklessness or
      negligence be established against Eastwood or his firm.

The Council

29.   The Council is responsible for the safety certificate and
      compliance with the Green Guide. There were minor errors
      on the council's part but these only contributed in part
      to the ground conditions.   These are too remote to
      amount to the actus reus of manslaughter.  Again there is
      no evidence of recklessness or gross negligence.

The Police

30.   It is agreed that the main responsibility for the
      disaster must rest with the police.   They have partial
      responsibility for the ground layout.   They were
      responsible for the "find their own level" policy with
      the supporters and also for supervising the Leppings Lane
      turnstiles.  The difficulties of large scale admission to
      the ground should have been foreseen.   However, the
      police failures occurred as part of a complex sequence of
      events, often outside the control of the police. The
      difficulties at Leppings Lane were partly geographical
      and resulted largely in the arrival of vast numbers of
      supporters after 2.30 pm. Those matters were beyond
      police control.  Unruly behaviour by a minority created
      problems.

31.   Responsibility for the failure to postpone the kick-off
      and to cordon off the access tunnel is confined to
      Duckenfield.  As an organisation the police cannot be
      said to have caused the deaths by their strategy and
      operational shortcomings.  Whilst there were errors of
      judgement*and practice there is no evidence that the
      police acted recklessly or in a grossly negligent manner
      as an organisation.

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield

32.   The failure to cordon off the access tunnel and not to
      postpone the kick-off were bad errors of judgement. They
      were his ultimate responsibility.  He failed to notice
      the overcrowding in pens 3 and 4. He was recently
      promoted and had little experience for this semi-final
      match.  His slowness to respond to what was happening was
      a result of is lack of experience.
33.   His failures significantly contributed to the crowd
      pressure which caused the crushing and collapse of
      barrier 124A. Had Duckenfield the requisite intention to
      support a charge of manslaughter? Clearly there was no
      unlawful or dangerous act on his part.   In failing to
      postpone the kick-off or order closure of the tunnel
      after opening gate ,C did he do an act which created an
      obvious and serious risk of causing personal injury
      either not giving thought to the possibility of such risk
      or having recognised that there was some risk involved
      nevertheless gone ahead and taken it?

34.   There are difficulties in proving that he intended to do
      an act which created an obvious and serious risk of
      causing personal injury.  The Director and Counsel
      concluded that it was not an obvious risk at the time.
      It is easy with hindsight to judge, but there must be a
      grave doubt as to whether the omissions created a risk
      which was obvious to anyone on the ground at the time.

35.   The Director concluded that there was insufficient
      evidence under the recklessness head of manslaughter
      against Duckenfield. Nor was there evidence that he was
      grossly negligent in his failures to act.

36.   Counsel and the Director concluded that there was no
      evidence that Duckenfield was wilfully neglectful of his
      duty or was culpable so have to committed the offence of
      Culpable Malfeasance by a public official.

Conclusions

37.   The Director's decision not to issue proceedings was
      reached solely on the basis of an insufficiency of
      evidence to prove any criminal offence against any
      individual or body corporate ie. the City Council, the
      Police, the Engineers.   The decision was reached in
      accordance with the Director's code for Crown
      Prosecutors. The Public Interest factor was not one
      which came into play as the evidential^sufficiency
      criterium had not been established in respect of any
      potential defendant.   Full consideration was given to the
      possibility of the proseuction of each of the bodies
      involved despite their corporate status.

38.   The disaster was caused not by one single error or
      failure but by the combined effect of a series of
      mistakes, misjudgments and poor decisions, made by groups
      of people both over a period of time and by individuals
      on the day of the disaster.

Coroner's Inquests

39.   The Inquests began after the disaster and were adjourned
      when the Director requested a criminal investigation.
      The Coroner is obliged to adjourn an inquest when the
      Director makes such a request under the Coroner's Rules.
                                 7.

      Once the Coroner has received notification that the
      Director has decided not to issue criminal proceedings
      (or after such proceedings have concluded) the Coroner
      may resume the Inquest hearing. The Hillsborough Inquest
      recently recommenced in November 1990. The latest
      estimate is that the Inquests will continue hearing
      evidence and are likely to conclude in March 1991.

40.   The point made by Kenneth Hind MP about the matter being
      forgotten if action is not taken against those
      responsible can be answered by pointing to the detailed
      interim and final report of the Public Inquiry conducted
      by Lord Justice Taylor, the civil proceedings at which
      the police admitted liability and the fact that
      disciplinary action is being considered by the Police
      Complaints Authority against various officers.

41.   The Coroner's jury may be influenced by the publicity
      surrounding the Director's decision. The criminal
      investigation and any prosecution must take precedence
      over the Coroner's Inquisitorial hearing where no
      individual can be held responsible. The Public Inquiry
      itself has been widely reported and such publicity can
      also be said to influence the jury's conclusions.
ATTORNEY GENERAL

               Background Note: Hillsborough Disaster


1.      On the 15th April 1989 at the Hillsborough stadium,
        Sheffield 95 people died and over 400 were injured due to
        gross overcrowding and crushing in the two pens behind
        the goal at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.

2.      A public enquiry headed by Lord Justice Taylor produced
        an interim report in August 1989.  The West Midlands
        Police assisted in the preparation of the report and
        later conducted a criminal investigation which was
        requested by the D.P.P. The criminal investigation was
        extensive producing bulky documentation and a full
        transcript of the evidence given at the enquiry. The
        police investigation was meticulous.

3.      A copy of Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report and a copy
        of Counsel's opinion by Gareth Williams Q.C. and Peter
        Birts Q.C. are attached.  It would be useful to refer to
        the plans at Appendix 1 and Appendix 4 of the report.


Facts

4.      There is little, if any, dispute as to what actually
        happened.Chief Superintendent Duckenfield was the police
        officer responsible for policing the match.

5.      At 2.52 pm (8 minutes before kick-off) Duckenfield
        ordered one of the exit gates, Gate C, at the Leppings
        Lane end to be opened. This was to relieve massive
        overcrowding and crushing at the turnstiles caused by a
        build up of supporters arriving after 2.30 pm.  In the
        five minutes after the gate was opened 2000 supporters
        entered the ground and went into a tunnel under the west
        stand which gave access only to the central pens 3 and 4.
        Those pens were already full.  There was no controlled
        way in which supporters were allowed in to the pens. The
        additional influx caused intense pressure and resulted in
        the collapse of a crush barrier 124A near the front of
        pen 3. Many died from suffocation and crushing and some
        were trampled on. Perimeter gates were not opened by the
        police partly because of orders not to do so without
        permission and partly because officers did not appreciate
        the severity of what was occurring initially.  Later when
        the emergency was appreciated the small size and number
        of the gates made evacuation extremely difficult.

6.      The build up of fans outside the ground was due to the
        geography of the turnstiles, their marking and numbers
        and to a loss of police control of supporters outside
        becoming keen to get inside before the kick-off.
7.    The three major causal factors w e r e :-

      i.   the layout of the ground
      ii. the opening of the exit gate (gate C)
      iii. the build up outside the ground

Layout of the Ground

8.    The club were advised by a structural engineer, Dr
      Eastwood. The Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 required
      expert advice to obtain a safety certificate under the
      Act from the local council.  Dr Eastwood advised
      additional crush barriers, these were installed in 1979.
      A certificate was granted.

9.    The safety certificate did not specify maximum numbers
      for the pens. This, with turnstile monitoring of
      numbers, would have limited entrance to the pens.

10.   It was the policy of the police at semi-finals to allow
      movement of supporters between pens before the kick-off
      after which the radial gates would be closed and locked.
      Hence without a control on the numbers entering the
      tunnel access pens 3 and 4 were liable to become grossly
      overcrowded.  The police had accepted responsibility for
      monitoring the pens and their policy of "letting the fans
      find their own level" was severely criticized by Taylor.

11.   The exit gate C, opened following Duckenfield1s
      instruction, is opposite the tunnel.  No steps were taken
      to cordon off the tunnel or divert the fans around the
      sides of the West stand.  The supporters had nowhere to
      go but the already crowded pens 3 and 4.

12.   At 3.04 pm a surge forward in pen 3 caused the crush
      barrier 124A to break.  This appears to have been a major
      factor in the deaths since there were far fewer deaths in
      pen 4 where no barrier collapsed.  Barrier number 144 had
      been removed in 1986, its absence meant there was no
      retarding structure as fans emerged from the tunnel into
      pen 3. There was unbroken diagonal pressure from the
      mouth of the tunnel down to barrier 124A.  the collapse
      of barrier 124A was a major factor in the cause of the
      deaths.  Barrier 124A was slightly corroded but it had
      been tested in July 1988 and had passed loading tests
      specified in the Government's Green Guide.  Taylor found
      that corrosion played a part in the collapse but the
      effective cause was the excessive unanticipated pressure
      exerted at the time of the forward surge.

13.   The crushing in pens 3 and 4 was not recognised by police
      either in the control box or on the perimeter of the
      pitch.  Even supporters nearby, broadcasters and stewards
      were not immediately aware.

14.   Even after the crush, and until 3.06 pm, the main police
      concern was to prevent a pitch invasion.
The build up outside the Ground

15.   The opening of gate C which precipitated the disaster was
      made necessary by the massive build up of supporters at
      the Leppings Lane turnstiles between 2.30 and 2.50 pm.
      As kick-off time approached the crushing increased. The
      police lost control of the crowd.  The crush became
      unmanageable, many feared for their lives. The kick-off
      was not postponed.  This course was only to be taken if
      there was a major cause of delay eg. a motorway accident
      or fog. Taylor concluded that the kick-off should have
      been postponed.

16.   There was considerable evidence that people would be
      killed if gate C was not opened and that Duckenfield had
      no alternative but to do so.  That being so neither
      Duckenfield nor other officers took any steps to deal
      with the consequences of opening the gate. The tunnel
      was not closed off even though such action had been taken
      by the police in 1988. Duckenfield did order the influx
      at gate A, which had been opened earlier, to be
      monitored. His omission to do so at gate C was said by
      Taylor to be "a blunder of the first magnitude". This
      was the immediate cause of the crushing in pens 3 and 4.
      It was not the sole cause.

17.   The layout of the turnstiles, inadequate space for the
      formation of orderly queues and the limited extent of the
      waiting area combined with poor designation and marking
      of turnstiles contributed to slow turnstile operation.

18.   There were only 7 turnstiles to admit 10,100 fans at the
      other end of the ground there were 60 turnstiles to admit
      29,800.  Taylor concluded that the police and club should
      have foreseen potential queuing and waiting to admit
      fans.

19.   Many supporters arrived after 2.30 pm. Tickets advised
      arriving 15 minutes before kick-off.   Some arrived
      without tickets.   The evidence shows many had been
      drinking.  Taylor concluded the majority had not been
      affected by drink.   Unruliness contributed to the pushing
      effect. This contributed to the loss of control by the
      police.

20.   The main factor in the police loss of control was
      ineffective strategy planning for the large number of
      arrivals.  Taylor concluded that by controlling the fans
      and postponing the kick-off gate C could have remained
      closed.

Responsibilities

21.   The layout of the ground was the responsibility of the
      Club, Eastwood, the Council and the police. No one
      foresaw that up to 2000 fans would ever be allowed to
      enter pens 3 and 4 when they were already overcrowded.
      No one anticipated gate 3 being opened or the crushing
      outside the ground.  The police must take the main
      responsibility for letting the fans "find their own
      level", however, the Club must share responsibility for
      the way in which supporters were allowed to fill the pens
      at semi-finals.

      failure was to give no order to deal with the sudden

       contributed to the crushing and deaths. The Club not
       only relied on its own consultant engineer Dr Eastwood

26.   There is insufficient evidence to establish the actus
      reus of manslaughter against the Club. Additionally the
      evidence does not show either the recklessness or gross
      negligence required for the manslaughter offence.
Eastwood and Partners

27.   Eastwood's advice formed only part of the events that
      lead tot he structural condition at the ground.  It could
      not be said that his advice caused the deaths. In fact
      some of his advice, not acted on for financial reasons,
      may have lead to maximum limits being set for pens 3 and
      4.

28.   Again there is insufficient for the actus reus of

      negligence be established against Eastwood or his firm.

      to the ground conditions.   These are too remote to
      amount to the actus reus of manslaughter. Again there is
      no evidence of recklessness or gross negligence.

The Police

30.   It is agreed that the main responsibility for the
      disaster must rest with the police.   They have partial
      responsibility for the ground layout.   They were
      responsible for the "find their own level" policy with

      police acted recklessly or in a grossly negligent manner
      as an organisation.

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield

32.   The failure to cordon off the access tunnel and not to
      postpone the kick-off were bad errors of judgement.  They
      were his ultimate responsibility.  He failed to notice
      the overcrowding in pens 3 and 4. He was recently
      promoted and had little experience for this semi-final
      match.  His slowness to respond to what was happening was
      a result of is lack of experience.
33.   His failures significantly contributed to the crowd
      pressure which caused the crushing and collapse of
      barrier 124A. Had Duckenfield the requisite intention to
      support a charge of manslaughter? Clearly there was no
      unlawful or dangerous act on his part.  In failing to
      postpone the kick-off or order closure of the tunnel
      after opening gate C did he do an act which created an
      obvious and serious risk of causing personal injury
      either not giving thought to the possibility of such risk
      or having recognised that there was some risk involved
      nevertheless gone ahead and taken it?

34.   There are difficulties in proving that he intended to do
      an act which created an obvious and serious risk of
      causing personal injury.  The Director and Counsel
      concluded that it was not an obvious risk at the time.
      It is easy with hindsight to judge, but there must be a
      grave doubt as to whether the omissions created a risk
      which was obvious to anyone on the ground at the time.

35.   The Director concluded that there was insufficient
      evidence under the recklessness head of manslaughter
       against Duckenfield. Nor was there evidence that he was
      grossly negligent in his failures to act.

36.   Counsel and the Director concluded that there was no
      evidence that Duckenfield was wilfully neglectful of his
      duty or was culpable so have to committed the offence of
       Culpable Malfeasance by a public official.

Conclusions

37.   The Director's decision not to issue proceedings was
       reached solely on the basis of an insufficiency of
       evidence to prove any criminal offence against any
       individual or body corporate i e . the City Council, the
      Police, the Engineers. The decision was reached in
       accordance with the Director's code for Crown
       Prosecutors.  The Public Interest factor was not one
      which came into play as the evidential sufficiency
       criterium had not been established in respect of any
       potential defendant.  Full consideration was given to the
       possibility of the proseuction of each of the bodies
       involved Respite their corporate status.

38.   The disaster was caused not by one single error or
      failure but by the combined effect of a series of
      mistakes, misjudgments and poor decisions, made by groups
      of people both over a period of time and by individuals
      on the day of the disaster.

Coroner's Inquests

39.   The Inquests began after the disaster and were adjourned
      when the Director requested a criminal investigation.
      The Coroner is obliged to adjourn an inquest when the
      Director makes such a request under the Coroner's Rules.
                                 7.

      Once the Coroner has received notification that the
      Director has decided not to issue criminal proceedings
      (or after such proceedings have concluded) the Coroner
      may resume the Inquest hearing.  The Hillsborough Inquest
      recently recommenced in November 1990. The latest
      estimate is that the Inquests will continue hearing
      evidence and are likely to conclude in March 1991.

40.   The point made by Kenneth Hind MP about the matter being
      forgotten if action is not taken against those
      responsible can be answered by pointing to the detailed
      interim and final report of the Public Inquiry conducted
      by Lord Justice Taylor, the civil proceedings at which
      the police admitted liability and the fact that
      disciplinary action is being considered by the Police
      Complaints Authority against various officers.

41.   The Coroner's jury may be influenced by the publicity
      surrounding the Director's decision.  The criminal
      investigation and any prosecution must take precedence
      over the Coroner's Inquisitorial hearing where no
      individual can be held responsible.  The Public Inquiry
      itself has been widely reported and such publicity can
      also be said to influence the jury's conclusions.
ATTORNEY GENERAL

               Background Note: Hillsborough Disaster


1.      On the 15th April 1989 at the Hillsborough stadium,
        Sheffield 95 people died and over 400 were injured due to
        gross overcrowding and crushing in the two pens behind
        the goal at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.

2.      A public enquiry headed by Lord Justice Taylor produced
        an interim report in August 1989.  The West Midlands
        Police assisted in the preparation of the report and
        later conducted a criminal investigation which was
        requested by the D.P.P.  The criminal investigation was
        extensive producing bulky documentation and a full
        transcript of the evidence given at the enquiry. The
        police investigation was meticulous.

3.      A copy of Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report and a copy
        of Counsel's opinion by Gareth Williams Q.C. and Peter
        Birts Q.C. are attached.  It would be useful to refer to
        the plans at Appendix 1 and Appendix 4 of the report.


Facts

4.      There is little, if any, dispute as to what actually
        happened.Chief Superintendent Duckenfield was the police
        officer responsible for policing the match.

5.      At 2.52 pm (8 minutes before kick-off) Duckenfield
        ordered one of the exit gates, Gate C, at the Leppings
        Lane end to be opened. This was to relieve massive
        overcrowding and crushing at the turnstiles caused by a
        build up of supporters arriving after 2.30 pm.  In the
        five minutes after the gate was opened 2000 supporters
        entered the ground and went into a tunnel under the west
        stand which gave access only to the central pens 3 and 4.
        Those pens were already full.  There was no controlled
        way in which supporters were allowed in to the pens. The
        additional influx caused intense pressure and resulted in
        the collapse of a crush barrier 124A near the front of
        pen 3. Many died from suffocation and crushing and some
        were trampled on. Perimeter gates were not Opened by the
        police partly because of orders not to do so without
        permission and partly because officers did not appreciate
        the severity of what was occurring initially.  Later when
        the emergency was appreciated the small size and number
        of the gates made evacuation extremely difficult.

6.      The build up of fans outside the ground was due to the
        geography of the turnstiles, their marking and numbers
        and to a loss of police control of supporters outside
        becoming keen to get inside before the kick-off.
7.    The three major causal factors were:-

      i . the layout of the ground
      ii. the opening of the exit gate (gate C)
      iii. the build up outside the ground

Layout of the Ground

8.    The club were advised by a structural engineer, Dr
      Eastwood.  The Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 required
      expert advice to obtain a safety certificate under the
      Act from the local council.  Dr Eastwood advised
      additional crush barriers, these were installed in 1979.
      A certificate was granted.

9.    The safety certificate did not specify maximum numbers
      for the pens.  This, with turnstile monitoring of
      numbers, would have limited entrance to the pens.

10.   It was the policy of the police at semi-finals to allow
      movement of supporters between pens before the kick-off
      after which the radial gates would be closed and locked.
      Hence without a control on the numbers entering the
      tunnel access pens 3 and 4 were liable to become grossly
      overcrowded.  The police had accepted responsibility for
      monitoring the pens and their policy of "letting the fans
      find their own level" was severely criticized by Taylor.

11.   The exit gate C, opened following Duckenfield's
      instruction, is opposite the tunnel.  No steps were taken
      to cordon off the tunnel or divert the fans around the
      sides of the West stand.  The supporters had nowhere to
      go but the already crowded pens 3 and 4.

12.   At 3.04 pm a surge forward in pen 3 caused the crush
      barrier 124A to break. This appears to have been a major
      factor in the deaths since there were far fewer deaths in
      pen 4 where no barrier collapsed.  Barrier number 144 had
      been removed in 1986, its absence meant there was no
      retarding structure as fans emerged from the tunnel into
      pen 3. There was unbroken diagonal pressure from the
      mouth of the tunnel down to barrier 124A.  the collapse
      of barrier 124A was a major factor in the cause of the
      deaths.  Barrier 124A was slightly corroded but it had
      been tested in July 1988 and had passed loading tests
      specified in the Government's Green Guide.  Taylor found
      that corrosion played a part in the collapse but the
      effective cause was the excessive unanticipated pressure
      exerted at the time of the forward surge.

13.   The crushing in pens 3 and 4 was not recognised by police
      either in the control box or on the perimeter of the
      pitch.  Even supporters nearby, broadcasters and stewards
      were not immediately aware.

14.   Even after the crush, and until 3.06 pm, the main police
      concern was to prevent a pitch invasion.
The build up outside the Ground

15.   The opening of gate C which precipitated the disaster was
      made necessary by the massive build up of supporters at
      the Leppings Lane turnstiles between 2.30 and 2.50 pm.
      As kick-off time approached the crushing increased. The
      police lost control of the crowd. The crush became
      unmanageable, many feared for their lives.  The kick-off
      was not postponed.  This course was only to be taken if
      there was a major cause of delay eg. a motorway accident
      or fog. Taylor concluded that the kick-off should have
      been postponed.

16.   There was considerable evidence that people would be
      killed if gate C was not opened and that Duckenfield had
      no alternative but to do so. That being so neither
      Duckenfield nor other officers took any steps to deal
      with the consequences of opening the gate. The tunnel
      was not closed off even though such action had been taken
      by the police in 1988. Duckenfield did order the influx
      at gate A, which had been opened earlier, to be
      monitored. His omission to do so at gate C was said by
      Taylor to be "a blunder of the first magnitude". This
      was the immediate cause of the crushing in pens 3 and 4.
      It was not the sole cause.

17.   The layout of the turnstiles, inadequate space for the
      formation of orderly queues and the limited extent of the
      waiting area combined with poor designation and marking
      of turnstiles contributed to slow turnstile operation.

18.   There were only 7 turnstiles to admit 10,100 fans at the
      other end of the ground there were 60 turnstiles to admit
      29,800.  Taylor concluded that the police and club should
      have foreseen potential queuing and waiting to admit
      fans.

19.   Many supporters arrived after 2.30 pm. Tickets advised
      arriving 15 minutes before kick-off. Some arrived
      without tickets. The evidence shows many had been
      drinking. Taylor concluded the majority had not been
      affected by drink.  Unruliness contributed to the pushing
      effect.  This contributed to the loss of control by the
      police. t>

20.   The main factor in the police loss of control was
      ineffective strategy planning for the large number of
      arrivals.  Taylor concluded that by controlling the fans
      and postponing the kick-off gate C could have remained
      closed.

Responsibilities

21.   The layout of the ground was the responsibility of the
      Club, Eastwood, the Council and the police. No one
      foresaw that up to 2000 fans would ever be allowed to
      enter pens 3 and 4 when they were already overcrowded.
      No one anticipated gate 3 being opened or the crushing
      outside the ground.  The police must take the main
      responsibility for letting the fans "find their own
      level", however, the Club must share responsibility for
      the way in which supporters were allowed to fill the pens
      at semi-finals.

22.   The opening of gate C was Duckenfield's responsibility.
      In the circumstances his decision was correct. His
      failure was to give no order to deal with the sudden
      influx of fans. Had the tunnel been cordoned off the
      disaster would almost certainly have been averted.

23.. The layout of the turnstiles, their numbers and marking
     are primarily matters for the police and the Club, but
     the Council have a partial responsibility to ensure safe
      access to the ground.

Criminal Offences

24.   The two offences would be Manslaughter and Culpable
      Misfeasance.  These potential offences were considered
      against all parties, ie. the club, the Council, the
      police and the structural engineers (Mr Eastwood).

The Club

25.   The Club's responsibility for the layout and alterations
       inside the ground and for the layout of the turnstiles is
      where any potential liability exists.   It is clear that
       these were not the sole, or even the major causes and
       that any actions and omissions by the club only partly
       contributed to the crushing and deaths.   The Club not
       only relied on its own consultant engineer Dr Eastwood
       but it responded to the suggestions and advice of the
       police in important matters.

26.   There is insufficient evidence to establish the actus
      reus of manslaughter against the Club. Additionally the
      evidence does not show either the recklessness or gross
      negligence required for the manslaughter offence.
Eastwood and Partners

27.   Eastwood's advice formed only part of the events that
      lead tot he structural condition at the ground.  It could
      not be said that his advice caused the deaths. In fact
      some of his advice, not acted on for financial reasons,
      may have lead to maximum limits being set for pens 3 and
      4.

28.   Again there is insufficient for the actus reus of
      manslaughter nor can the required recklessness or
      negligence be established against Eastwood or his firm.

The Council

29.   The Council is responsible for the safety certificate and
      compliance with the Green Guide.  There were minor errors
      on the council's part but these only contributed in part
      to the ground conditions.   These are too remote to
      amount to the actus reus of manslaughter. Again there is
      no evidence of recklessness or gross negligence.

The Police

30.   It is agreed that the main responsibility for the
      disaster must rest with the police.   They have partial
      responsibility for the ground layout.   They were
      responsible for the "find their own level" policy with
      the supporters and also for supervising the Leppings Lane
      turnstiles.  The difficulties of large scale admission to
      the ground should have been foreseen. However, the
      police failures occurred as part of a complex sequence of
      events, often outside the control of the police. The
      difficulties at Leppings Lane were partly geographical
      and resulted largely in the arrival of vast numbers of
      supporters after 2.30 pm.  Those matters were beyond
      police control.  Unruly behaviour by a minority created
      problems.

31.   Responsibility for the failure to postpone the kick-off
      and to cordon off the access tunnel is confined to
      Duckenfield.   As an organisation the police cannot be
      said to have caused the deaths by their strategy and
      operational shortcomings. Whilst there were errors of
      judgement* and practice there is no evidence that the
      police acted recklessly or in a grossly negligent manner
      as an organisation.

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield

32.   The failure to cordon off the access tunnel and not to
      postpone the kick-off were bad errors of judgement.  They
      were his ultimate responsibility.  He failed to notice
      the overcrowding in pens 3 and 4. He was recently
      promoted and had little experience for this semi-final
      match. His slowness to respond to what was happening was
      a result of is lack of experience.
33.   His failures significantly contributed to the crowd
      pressure which caused the crushing and collapse of
      barrier 124A. Had Duckenfield the requisite intention to
      support a charge of manslaughter? Clearly there was no
      unlawful or dangerous act on his part.  In failing to
      postpone the kick-off or order closure of the tunnel
      after opening gate C did he do an act which created an
      obvious and serious risk of causing personal injury
      either not giving thought to the possibility of such risk
      or having recognised that there was some risk involved
      nevertheless gone ahead and taken it?

34.   There are difficulties in proving that he intended to. do
      an act which created an obvious and serious risk of
      causing personal injury.  The Director and Counsel
      concluded that it was not an obvious risk at the time.
      It is easy with hindsight to judge, but there must be a
      grave doubt as to whether the omissions created a risk
      which was obvious to anyone on the ground at the time.

35.   The Director concluded that there was insufficient
      evidence under the recklessness head of manslaughter
      against Duckenfield.  Nor was there evidence that he was
      grossly negligent in his failures to act.

36.   Counsel and the Director concluded that there was no
      evidence that Duckenfield was wilfully neglectful of his
      duty or was culpable so have to committed the offence of
      Culpable Malfeasance by a public official.

37.   The Director's decision not to issue proceedings was
      reached solely on the basis of an insufficiency of

      individual or body corporate ie. the City Council, the
      Police, the Engineers.   The decision was reached in

      potential defendant.   Full consideration was given to the
      possibility of the proseuction of each of the bodies
      involved (despite their corporate status.

38.   The disaster was caused not by one single error or
      failure but by the combined effect of a series of
      mistakes, misjudgments and poor decisions, made by groups
      of people both over a period of time and by individuals
      on the day of the disaster.

Coroner's Inquests

39.   The Inquests began after the disaster and were adjourned
      when the Director requested a criminal investigation.
      The Coroner is obliged to adjourn an inquest when the
      Director makes such a request under the Coroner's Rules.
                                 7.

      Once the Coroner has received notification that the
      Director has decided not to issue criminal proceedings
      (or after such proceedings have concluded) the Coroner
      may resume the Inquest hearing.  The Hillsborough Inquest

I have now seen Sue Ross's further letter and the amended draft, which contains Philip Havers' suggestions. I
am content with the amendments - 1 do not feel strongly one way or the other about the final sentence of the first
full paragraph on page 2. If the letter is to come from me, then some further amendments will be needed to the
first three full paragraphs on the final page, which are at present expressed in the third person. That is no
problem and can easily be done at this end if the letter does go from me. Do any of you have a view on who
should sign th§ letter - or any other comments on the draft?

 to exercise its power under Section 6(2) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 to take over the
 criminal proceedings against your clients with a view to discontinuing them.


 You ask for further information. (1) as to the factual matters on which the CPS relied and
 identifying which parts of the evidence is "new" since the Crown Prosecution Service last
 considered the case; and (2) as to the way the Service applied the Code for Crown Prosecutors
 in deciding whether to intervene.


 These questions indicate that you misunderstand the factors the Crown Prosecution Service
considers when deciding whether to take over a private prosecution at the request of a defendant
with a view to discontinuance. It may help              if J   set out again in broad terms the approach the
Service adopts to these decisions.


As you taow, the Code for C m Prosecutors indeed sets out the general principles applied by
the Service when (inter alia) deciding whether to continue a prosecution it has taken over; or
whether to institute proceedings or to advise the police whether to do so. It is correct that 'the
Crown Prosecution Service decided in 1997 that the evidence av ailab le at th « , i „ e w„ „ ot
sufficient, In its now, to provide a realistic prospect of the conviction of either of your clients
for an offence.       However, it does not follow that, when considering the evidence and
       representations submitted by the private prosecutor, and by yourselves on behalf of your clients,
            CPS should see^. r o jj|y to identify whether there is now any new evidence sufficient to
       pr    ide a realistic frospec^il* a conviction. The decision whether to intervene in a private
       p r e s e c u t i o n w i ^ v ^ 't o terminating it calls for a it e g * ^ different considerations to be
       applied.             possible for a private prosecution to continue notwithstanding that the CPS

     15 M         T       the baSiS ° f it$ °Wn aSS6SSment of the sfrww* of         evidence, that the
     mjL     F       PSSS1116 evidential suffici®cy test in the Code (that there should be a "realistic
     jfflbspe^of a conviction").


     In br° ad tSrms> the reason for  is    Section 6(1) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985,
     which established the Service's powers and duties, specifically preserved the right of private
   individuals and prosecuting authorities or bodies other than the CPS to bring criminal
' proceedings. This right is subject (among other limitations) to the limitation.® Section 6(2) that
  the CPS may nevertheless take over the proceedings with a view either to conducting or to
  terminating those proceedings. Jlhe Service takes the view that it should not exercise that power
  unless there is a particular need to do so on behalf of the public?^


  Private prosecutors are not bound to apply the Code for Crown Prosecutorswhen deciding
  whether to institute proceedings, nor do the courts apply the evidential sufficiency test in the
 C ^de when deciding whether there is a case to answer. The Service therefore recognises that
            ot appropriate to intervene to terminate a private prosecution without good reason. That
 general principle has recently been endorsed by the Law Commission in,its Consultation Paper
 No, 149 Consents to Prosecution" (see paragraphs 6.3 and 6.4).

                                          ™ - W x ± 't f c
                  ^     rvicejwill not take over a private prosecution with a view to terminating it
unless one or more of the following applies:


(0
             thCre is Cieariy no case t0 mswer' A Private prosecution started in these circumstances
             would be unfounded and ought not to be permitted to continue.

(ii)        the public interest factors tending against prosecution clearly outweigh those in favour
            (examples might be where the prosecution is malicious or vexatious or the offence is one
            for which the defendant should clearly have been cau tio n ed , o r where the defendant is
            terminally ill and the offence is serious).
   (m)      the prosecution is clearly likely to damage the interests of justice.
                        ■    ...




      this case the decision. not‘% mtervene was considered at a very senior level within die Service,
   by the Director ^ | a s ^ r k Evaluation. After careful consideration, he concluded in respect
   of the                                           m d w im ^g lect to perform a public duty (which, for the

   aV0^ i ^          WCre e3Ch considered against each ^dividual separately) that he could not
   say * # y ! s dearly no case to answer. It was not right therefore for the Service to take over
                      wiA a view to terminating them.


  Against that background, and after specifically considering the appropriate course to take in these
  circumstances, he concluded that it would not be right to. intervene in respect of the one
  remaining charge against Mr Duckenfield of attempting to pervert the course of justice, albeit
     had formed the view that there was clearly no case to answer on that charge alone. The charge
  of attempting to pervert the course of justice is a serious one, particularly when levelled against

      onsidered whether, nevertheless, there were overriding public interest factors that should
 lead to the Service intervening with a view to discontinuance but came to the conclusion that
 [any] public interest factors tending against prosecution did not clearly outweigh those in favour.
 Nor did he consider that the prosecution is clearly likely to damage the interests of justice.

ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

letter from the CPS, also dated 18 December 1998, informing you of the Service's decision not
to exercise its power under Section 6(2) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 to take over the

HILLSBOROUGH: RE ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

Thank you for your letter dated 22 December, which I received on return from my Christmas
break on 5 January 1999.

I have considered the papers and note that you now prefer to have written advice rather than to
have a conference to discuss the issues raised by the letter addressed to the CPS from Walker
Morris dated 18 December 1998. You do not say that you wish to seek advice from counsel, but
you will no doubt wish to consider that option after reading this letter. Because of the nature of
this case I suggest that you should consider doing so - Philip Havers QC seems to have been
involved at an earlier stage in advising Mr Newell and I would be able to get the papers to him
today or Monday (depending on timing). I am sure you are right to ensure that your reply is
drafted with an eye to the possibility of proceedings for judicial review being brought against you
in respect of the decision not to intervene.

Giving reasons for decisions
The CPS does not have a common law obligation to give detailed reasons for its decisions. Its
decisions do not fall within the category identified by the courts in which fairness requires
reasons to be given: CPS decisions are not judicial in the sense of being adjudications. That was
accepted by the Divisional Court in ex parte Treadaway 31 July 1997 and it also follows from
the decision in R v Civil Service Board ex parte Cunningham [1991] 4 All ER.

The CPS is not obliged to give detailed reasons for its decision not to intervene, despite the
detailed questions posed by the solicitors for the defendants in their letter dated 18 December
1998.

But where proceedings for judicial review are in prospect, a key practical consideration in
framing decision letters with a view to avoiding proceedings being brought or, if that fails,
persuading the Court not to grant leave (notwithstanding that detailed reasons have not been
provided), is to ensure that the prospective applicants do not have a misleading impression of the
approach adopted by the CPS to its decision, such that the CPS might be vulnerable to leave
being granted. If the decision letter is put before a Court (as it surely would be) the CPS's
position is spelled out succinctly and persuasively, especially anticipating points likely to be
argued by the intending applicants.

Secondly, given that the events of Hillsborough and the nature of the decisions already taken
have been exhaustively reviewed and/or litigated publicly, I would suggest that - so long as the
CPS does not stray into matters that, if published, might tend to prejudice magistrates or a jury -
there is good reason for the CPS to treat this case as a special one which, in the public interest,
ought to attract more details as to the reasoning than is contained in the letter of 18 December
1998.

What has been said so far

The original decision letter dated 18 December 1998 signed by Chris Enzor states :

       "We have considered the evidence, the representations made by the parties and all the
       surrounding circumstances o f the case. We have concluded that we should not intervene
       to take over any o f the charges".

A press notice was enclosed that contained factual information only. I should say that that letter
was written against the background of a letter sent by you in July 1998 setting out in brief terms
the nature of the CPS's policy in respect of intervening in private prosecutions.

The reply from Walker Monis, of the same date, does not ask for detailed reasons except on two
points:

       what factual matters persuaded the CPS to come to this decision, identifying the factual
       elements on which the CPS relied in deciding not to intervene, and further identifying
       which of that evidence is "new" since the last time that the DPP considered this case.

       the way in which the CPS applied its discretion under the Code.

They go on to say "unless we hear....with full details as requested, we will assume that you have
applied the discretion in the way set out in correspondence, and that you have not regarded any
evidence that you have considered relevant as "new"....."

It can be inferred from this line of questioning that Walker Morris believe that as a matter of law
the ordinary principles of the Code for Crown Prosecutors must be applied when taking the
decision to intervene. Given that the CPS has taken the decision not to prosecute, it would
follow that they should take over and discontinue the private prosecution unless some new
evidence has emerged that is capable of providing a realistic prospect of a conviction. As there
is nothing new, the Director should have taken this case over and discontinued it.

Bearing this in mind, I set out below some thoughts as to whether such an argument could be
mounted on the basis that the DPP's policy on private prosecutions is unlawful, but I proceed on
the assumption that the CPS has already formed a view on the law and that I should focus on the
points to be covered in the letter.

The first key point that we must meet head on is the suggestion that the CPS was obliged by law,
or otherwise, to apply the Code tests.

The second is to outline the factors bearing on the actual decision. That would require expansion
of the letter of 18 December from Chris Enzor. I recognise that the letter of 27 July gives an
outline of the policy considerations, but I suggest that instead of referring back to it it would be
as well to explain the relevant factors in the one letter.

I also think that we need to expose the different basis for the decision in respect of the charge of
attempt pervert and why different considerations were applied than would otherwise have been
dictated by the policy. The reasons for this advice are twofold. First, we need to avoid being
misleading; and secondly, we need to head off any application for judicial review that might be
brought on the basis that this decision - implicitly taken because the Director could not say that
there was clearly no case to answer - was irrational (at least on that charge) because in fact there
is clearly no case to answer. If they could mount a case on that basis they could argue that the
decisions in respect of the other two charges must also be tainted.

The disadvantage is of course that exposing the point might hand further ammunition to Walker
Morris, but on balance I think it better to be up front. It would be hard to argue that Chris
Newell's approach was irrational. All guidelines need to be departed from sometimes to meet
the special circumstances of an individual case.

All this means that we need to be clear about the basis for the different decisions and how the
policy was applied. I have drafted a suggested reply, which I attach herewith and which can be
put before counsel for his consideration. I have taken Chris Newell's letter to LSLO dated 3
December 1998 as setting out the basis for the decision, as he was the decision maker.

Is the policy unlawful?

The basis on which the CPS decision may be being considered for judicial review is that the
policy set out in the letter of 27 July 1998 is unlawful, or at least irrational or otherwise plain
wrong. The legal argument might run as follows: the Director is required by Section 10 of the
Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 to apply the Code for Crown Prosecutors when considering
(I) whether proceedings should be instituted or, where they have been instituted, (ii) whether they
should be discontinued. On that basis the Director's policy of not applying the evidential test
to a private prosecution with a view to taking it over and discontinuing it could be said to be
unlawful.

I work on the assumption that in drawing up its policy on private prosecutions the CPS has
already formed a view that it is not required by Section 10 to apply the Code tests to private
prosecutions. Section 10 is not expressly limited to cases which the Director has a duty to
institute or take over. But that is the general context in which it appears in the statute. It does
not lay down any particular test. Nor is the Code required under Section 10 to do anything more
than lay down general principles.

The CPS has departed from these general principles in a carefully considered policy designed to
recognise the right of private prosecutors, which is preserved by Section 6(1), to pursue criminal
proceedings without the intervention of the Director other than for good reason. I note that this
is the general approach adopted by the Law Commission on page 14 of its Consultation Paper
No 149 on Consents to Prosecution. In paragraph 6.4 on page 55 they say:

        "............ .for some members o f our society - those, for example, who have doubts about
        the impartiality of the prosecuting authorities, or who believe that an official prosecutor
        has misjudged the evidence in a case - the right of private prosecution is an important
       safeguard against abuse"

They do go on to say in paragraph 6.17 that "a private prosecution is likely to be undesirable if
itfails either or both o f the tests in the Code for Crown Prosecutors" provisionally concluding
that if measures are needed to avoid harm to innocent defendants or the public interest, the most
effective would be an offence based system of consents. Nevertheless, this supports the view
that the law does not require the Director to intervene on the basis of the Code tests. Private
prosecutors are not themselves bound by the Code, nor are the Code tests applied by the Court
when deciding whether there is a case to answer. No doubt these were factors in the Director's
policy.

I have looked at R v Bow Street Stipendiary Magistrate and Another ex parte South Coast
Shipping Co. Ltd. And Others (1993) 96 CAR 405 and the well known Turner case. Neither say
anything that contradict the Director's approach.

I cannot see that Walker Morris could successfully argue that the CPS policy is unlawful or
irrational.


Recommendation

If you wish to run the draft letter past Philip Havers QC I can arrange that quickly, subject to any
amendments you or Chris Newell might have.

I am copying this letter and enclosures to Chris Newell.

representations submitted by the private prosecutor, and by yourselves on behalf of your clients,
the CPS should seek.merely to identify whether there is now any new evidence sufficient to
provide a realistic prospect of a conviction. The decision whether to intervene in a private
prosecution with a view to terminating it calls for altogether different considerations to be
applied. It is quite possible for a private prosecution to continue notwithstanding that the CPS
is not satisfied, on the basis of its own assessment of the strength of the evidence, that the
evidence'would pass the evidential sufficiency test in the Code (that there should be a "realistic
prospect of a conviction").


In broad terms, the reason for this is that Section 6(1) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985,
which established the Service's powers and duties, specifically preserved the right of private
individuals and prosecuting authorities or bodies other than the CPS to bring criminal
proceedings. This right is subject (among other limitations) to the limitation in Section 6(2) that
the CPS may nevertheless take over the proceedings with a view either to conducting or to
terminating those proceedings. The Service takes the view that it should not exercise that power
unless there is a particular need to do so on behalf of the public.


Private prosecutors are not bound to apply the Code for Crown Prosecutors when deciding
whether to institute proceedings, nor do the courts apply the evidential sufficiency test in the
Code when deciding whether there is a case to answer. The Service therefore recognises that
it is not appropriate to intervene to terminate a private prosecution without good reason. That
general principle has recently been endorsed by the Law Commission in its Consultation Paper
No. 149 "Consents to Prosecution" (see paragraphs 6.3 and 6.4).


Generally, the Service will not take over a private prosecution with a view to terminating it
unless one or more of the following applies:


(i)    there is clearly no case to answer. A private prosecution started in these circumstances
       would be unfounded and ought not to be permitted to continue.


(ii)   the public interest factors tending against prosecution clearly outweigh those in favour
       (examples might be where the prosecution is malicious or vexatious or the offence is one
        for which the defendant should clearly have been cautioned, or where the defendant is
       terminally ill and the offence is serious).
(iii)   the prosecution is clearly likely to damage the interests o f justice.



In this case the decision not to intervene was considered at a very senior level within the Service,
by the Director of Casework Evaluation. After careful consideration, he concluded in respect
of the charges of manslaughter and wilful neglect to perform a public duty (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, were each considered against each individual separately) that he could not
say that there is clearly no case to answer. It was not right therefore for the Service to take over
the proceedings with a view to terminating them.


Against that background, and after specifically considering the appropriate course to take in these
circumstances, he concluded that it would not be right to intervene in respect of the one
remaining charge against Mr Duckenfield of attempting to pervert the course of justice, albeit
he had formed the view that there was clearly no case to answer on that charge alone. The charge
of attempting to pervert the course of justice is a serious one, particularly when levelled against
one who was, at the relevant time, a serving, senior police officer. Nevertheless, in the context
of the disaster as a whole that charge is not the gravamen of the criminality alleged against Mr
Duckenfield and he concluded that his approach to that charge should be led by his conclusions
on the charge of manslaughter.


He considered whether, nevertheless, there were overriding public interest factors that should
lead to the Service intervening with a view to discontinuance but came to the conclusion that
[any] public interest factors tending against prosecution did not clearly outweigh those in favour.
Nor did he consider that the prosecution is clearly likely to damage the interests of justice.


I should point out that the Crown Prosecution Service is not obliged in law to provide detailed
reasons for its decisions and we do not in any event consider it appropriate in this case to provide
an analysis of the evidence. However, in all the circumstances of this particular case and against
the background of its history, we did consider it appropriate to explain the factors taken into
account in more detail than was contained in the Service's letter dated 18 December 1998.

ATTORNEY GENERAL

               Background Note: Hillsborough Disaster


1.      On the 15th April 1989 at the Hillsborough stadium,
        Sheffield 95 people died and over 400 were injured due to
        gross overcrowding and crushing in the two pens behind
        the goal at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.

2.      A public enquiry headed by Lord Justice Taylor produced
        an interim report in August 1989.  The West Midlands
        Police assisted in the preparation of the report and
        later conducted a criminal investigation which was
        requested by the D.P.P. The criminal investigation was
        extensive producing bulky documentation and a full
        transcript of the evidence given at the enquiry. The
        police investigation was meticulous.

3.      A copy of Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report and a copy
        of Counsel's opinion by Gareth Williams Q.C. and Peter
        Birts Q.C. are attached.  It would be useful to refer to
        the plans at Appendix 1 and Appendix 4 of the report.


Facts

4.      There is little, if any, dispute as to what actually
        happened.Chief Superintendent Duckenfield was the police
        officer responsible for policing the match.

5.      At 2.52 pm (8 minutes before kick-off) Duckenfield
        ordered one of the exit gates, Gate C, at the Leppings
        Lane end to be opened.   This was to relieve massive
        overcrowding and crushing at the turnstiles caused by a
        build up of supporters arriving after 2.30 pm. In the
        five minutes after the gate was opened 2000 supporters
        entered the ground and went into a tunnel under the west
        stand which gave access only to the central pens 3 and 4.
        Those pens were already full. There was no controlled
        way in which supporters were allowed in to the pens. The
        additional influx caused intense pressure and resulted in
        the collapse of a crush barrier 124A near the front of
        pen 3. Many died from suffocation and crushing and some
        were trampled o n . Perimeter gates were not opened by the
        police partly because of orders not to do so without
        permission and partly because officers did not appreciate
        the severity of what was occurring initially. Later when
        the emergency was appreciated the small size and number
        of the gates made evacuation extremely difficult.

6.      The build up of fans outside the ground was due to the
        geography of the turnstiles, their marking and numbers
        and to a loss of police control of supporters outside
        becoming keen to get inside before the kick-off.
7.    The three major causal factors w e r e :-

      i.   the layout of the ground
      ii. the opening of the exit gate (gate C)
      iii. the build up outside the ground

Layout of the Ground

8.    The club were advised by a structural engineer, Dr
      Eastwood.  The Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 required
      expert advice to obtain a safety certificate under the
      Act from the local council.  Dr Eastwood advised
      additional crush barriers, these were installed in 1979.
      A certificate was granted.

9.    The safety certificate did not specify maximum numbers
      for the pens. This, with turnstile monitoring of
      numbers, would have limited entrance to the pens.

10.   It was the policy of the police at semi-finals to allow
      movement of supporters between pens before the kick-off
      after which the radial gates would be closed and locked.
      Hence without a control on the numbers entering the
      tunnel access pens 3 and 4 were liable to become grossly
      overcrowded.  The police had accepted responsibility for
      monitoring the pens and their policy of "letting the fans
      find their own level" was severely criticized by Taylor.

11.   The exit gate C, opened following Duckenfield's
      instruction, is opposite the tunnel. No steps were taken
      to cordon off the tunnel or divert the fans around the
      sides of the West stand. The supporters had nowhere to
      go but the already crowded pens 3 and 4.

12.   At 3.04 pm a surge forward in pen 3 caused the crush
      barrier 124A to break. This appears to have been a major
      factor in the deaths since there were far fewer deaths in
      pen 4 where no barrier collapsed. Barrier number 144 had
      been removed in 1986, its absence meant there was no
      retarding structure as fans emerged from the tunnel into
      pen 3. There was unbroken diagonal pressure from the
      mouth of the tunnel down to barrier 124A. the collapse
      of barrier 124A was a major factor in the cause of the
      deaths.  Barrier 124A was slightly corroded but it had
      been tested in July 1988 and had passed loading tests
      specified in the Government's Green Guide. Taylor found
      that corrosion played a part in the collapse but the
      effective cause was the excessive unanticipated pressure
      exerted at the time of the forward surge.

13.   The crushing in pens 3 and 4 was not recognised by police
      either in the control box or on the perimeter of the
      pitch.  Even supporters nearby, broadcasters and stewards
      were not immediately aware.

14.   Even after the crush, and until 3.06 pm, the main police
      concern was to prevent a pitch invasion.
The build up outside the Ground

15.   The opening of gate C which precipitated the disaster was
      made necessary by the massive build up of supporters at
      the Leppings Lane turnstiles between 2.30 and 2.50 pm.
      As kick-off time approached the crushing increased. The
      police lost control of the crowd. The crush became
      unmanageable, many feared for their lives.  The kick-off
      was not postponed.  This course was only to be taken if
      there was a major cause of delay eg. a motorway accident
      or fog. Taylor concluded that the kick-off should have
      been postponed.

16.   There was considerable evidence that people would be
      killed if gate C was not opened and that Duckenfield had
      no alternative but to do so. That being so neither
      Duckenfield nor other officers took any steps to deal
      with the consequences of opening the gate.  The tunnel
      was not closed off even though such action had been taken
      by the police in 1988. Duckenfield did order the influx
      at gate A, which had been opened earlier, to be
      monitored. His omission to do so at gate C was said by
      Taylor to be "a blunder of the first magnitude". This
      was the immediate cause of the crushing in pens 3 and 4.
      It was not the sole cause.

17.   The layout of the turnstiles, inadequate space for the
      formation of orderly queues and the limited extent of the
      waiting area combined with poor designation and marking
      of turnstiles contributed to slow turnstile operation.

18.   There were only 7 turnstiles to admit 10,100 fans at the
      other end of the ground there were 60 turnstiles to admit
      29,800.  Taylor concluded that the police and club should
      have foreseen potential queuing and waiting to admit
      fans.

19.   Many supporters arrived after 2.30 pm.   Tickets advised
      arriving 15 minutes before kick-off.   Some arrived
      without tickets.   The evidence shows many had been
      drinking.   Taylor concluded the majority had not been
      affected by drink. Unruliness contributed to the pushing
      effect.   This contributed to the loss of control by the
      police.

20.   The main factor in the police loss of control was
      ineffective strategy planning for the large number of
      arrivals. Taylor concluded that by controlling the fans
      and postponing the kick-off gate C could have remained*
      closed.

Responsibilities

21.   The layout of the ground was the responsibility of the
      Club, Eastwood, the Council and the police. No one
      foresaw that up to 2000 fans would ever be allowed to
      enter pens 3 and 4 when they were already overcrowded.
      No one anticipated gate 3 being opened or the crushing
      outside the ground. The police must take the main
      responsibility for letting the fans "find their own
      level", however, the Club must share responsibility for
      the way in which supporters were allowed to fill the pens
      at semi-finals.

22.   The opening of gate C was Duckenfield's responsibility.
      In the circumstances his decision was correct. His
      failure was to give no order to deal with the sudden
      influx of fans. Had the tunnel been cordoned off the
      disaster would almost certainly have been averted.

23.   The layout of the turnstiles, their numbers and marking
      are primarily matters for the police and the Club, but
      the Council have a partial responsibility to ensure safe
      access to the ground.

Criminal Offences

24.   The two offences would be Manslaughter and Culpable
      Misfeasance.  These potential offences were considered
      against all parties, ie. the club, the Council, the
      police and the structural engineers (Mr Eastwood).

The Club

25.   The Club's responsibility for the layout and alterations
      inside the ground and for the layout of the turnstiles is
      where any potential liability exists.  It is clear that
      these were not the sole, or even the major causes and
      that any actions and omissions by the club only partly
      contributed to the crushing and deaths. The Club not
      only relied on its own consultant engineer Dr Eastwood
      but it responded to the suggestions and advice of the
      police in important matters.

26.   There is insufficient evidence to establish the actus
      reus of manslaughter against the Club. Additionally the
      evidence does not show either the recklessness or gross
      negligence required for the manslaughter offence.
Eastwood and Partners

27.   Eastwood's advice formed only part of the events that
      lead tot he structural condition at the ground.  It could
      not be said that his advice caused the deaths. In fact
      some of his advice, not acted on for financial reasons,
      may have lead to maximum limits being set for pens 3 and
      4.

28.   Again there is insufficient for the actus reus of
      manslaughter nor can the required recklessness or
      negligence be established against Eastwood or his firm.

The Council

29.   The Council is responsible for the safety certificate and
      compliance with the Green Guide.  There were minor errors
      on the council's part but these only contributed in part
      to the ground conditions.   These are too remote to
      amount to the actus reus of manslaughter. Again there is
      no evidence of recklessness or gross negligence.

The Police

30.   It is agreed that the main responsibility for the
      disaster must rest with the police. They have partial
      responsibility for the ground layout.  They were
      responsible for the "find their own level" policy with
      the supporters and also for supervising the Leppings Lane
      turnstiles.  The difficulties of large scale admission to
      the ground should have been foreseen.  However, the
      police failures occurred as part of a complex sequence of
      events, often outside the control of the police. The
      difficulties at Leppings Lane were partly geographical
      and resulted largely in the arrival of vast numbers of
      supporters after 2.30 pm. Those matters were beyond
      police control. Unruly behaviour by a minority created
      problems.

31.   Responsibility for the failure to postpone the kick-off
      and to cordon off the access tunnel is confined to
      Duckenfield. As an organisation the police cannot be
      said to have caused the deaths by their strategy and
      operational shortcomings. Whilst there were errors of
      judgement and practice there is no evidence that the
      police acted recklessly or in a grossly negligent manner
      as an organisation.

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield

32.   The failure to cordon off the access tunnel and not to
      postpone the kick-off were bad errors of judgement. They
      were his ultimate responsibility.  He failed to notice
      the overcrowding in pens 3 and 4. He was recently
      promoted and had little experience for this semi-final
      match. His slowness to respond to what was happening was
      a result of is lack of experience.
33.   His failures significantly contributed to the crowd
      pressure which caused the crushing and collapse of
      barrier 124A. Had Duckenfield the requisite intention to
      support a charge of manslaughter? Clearly there was no
      unlawful or dangerous act on his part.  In failing to
      postpone the kick-off or order closure of the tunnel
      after opening gate C did he do an act which created an
      obvious and serious risk of causing personal injury
      either not giving thought to the possibility of such risk
      or having recognised that there was some risk involved
      nevertheless gone ahead and taken it?

34.   There are difficulties in proving that he intended to do
      an act which created an obvious and serious risk of
      causing personal injury. The Director and Counsel
      concluded that it was not an obvious risk at the time.
      It is easy with hindsight to judge, but there must be a
      grave doubt as to whether the omissions created a risk
      which was obvious to anyone on the ground at the time.

35.   The Director concluded that there was insufficient
      evidence under the recklessness head of manslaughter
      against Duckenfield.  Nor was there evidence that he was
      grossly negligent in his failures to act.

36.   Counsel and the Director concluded that there was no
      evidence that Duckenfield was wilfully neglectful of his
      duty or was culpable so have to committed the offence of
      Culpable Malfeasance by a public official.

Conclusions

37.   The Director's decision not to issue proceedings was
      reached solely on the basis of an insufficiency of
      evidence to prove any criminal offence against any
      individual or body corporate ie. the City Council, the
      Police, the Engineers. The decision was reached in
      accordance with the Director's code for Crown
      Prosecutors. The Public Interest factor was not one
      which came into play as the evidential sufficiency
      criterium had not been established in respect of any
      potential defendant.  Full consideration was given to the
      possibility of the proseuction of each of the bodies
      involved despite their corporate status.

38.   The disaster was caused not by one single error or
      failure but by the combined effect of a series of
      mistakes, misjudgments and poor decisions, made by groups
      of people both over a period of time and by individuals
      on the day of the disaster.

Coroner's Inquests

39.   The Inquests began after the disaster and were adjourned
      when the Director requested a criminal investigation.
      The Coroner is obliged to adjourn an inquest when the
      Director makes such a request under the Coroner's Rules.
                                 7.

      Once the Coroner has received notification that the
      Director has decided not to issue criminal proceedings
      (or after such proceedings have concluded) the Coroner
      may resume the Inquest hearing. The Hillsborough Inquest
      recently recommenced in November 1990. The latest
      estimate is that the Inquests will continue hearing
      evidence and are likely to conclude in March 1991.

40.   The point made by Kenneth Hind MP about the matter being
      forgotten if action is not taken against those
      responsible can be answered by pointing to the detailed
      interim and final report of the Public Inquiry conducted
      by Lord Justice Taylor, the civil proceedings at which
      the police admitted liability and the fact that
      disciplinary action is being considered by the Police
      Complaints Authority against various officers.

41.   The Coroner's jury may be influenced by the publicity
      surrounding the Director's decision. The criminal
      investigation and any prosecution must take precedence
      over the Coroner's Inquisitorial hearing where no
      individual can be held responsible. The Public Inquiry
      itself has been widely reported and such publicity can
      also be said to influence the jury's conclusions.
                                                                 A /s i^ e * I.




ATTORNEY GENERAL

               Background Note: Hillsborough Disaster


1.      On the 15th April 1989 at the Hillsborough stadium,
        Sheffield 95 people died and over 400 were injured due to
        gross overcrowding and crushing in the two pens behind
        the goal at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.

2.      A public enquiry headed by Lord Justice Taylor produced
        an interim report in August 1989. The West Midlands
        Police assisted in the preparation of the report and
        later conducted a criminal investigation which was
        requested by the D.P.P.  The criminal investigation was
        extensive producing bulky documentation and a full,
        transcript of the evidence given at the enquiry. The
        police investigation was meticulous.

3.      A copy of Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report and a copy
        of Counsel's opinion by Gareth Williams Q.C. and Peter
        Birts Q.C. are attached.  It would be useful to refer to
        the plans at Appendix 1 and Appendix 4 of the report.


Facts

4.      There is little, if any, dispute as to what actually
        happened.Chief Superintendent Duckenfield was the police
        officer responsible for policing the match.

5.      At 2.52 piu (3 minutes before kick-off) Dur^enfield
        ordered one of the exit gates, Gate C, at the Leppings
        Lane end to be opened. This was to relieve massive
        overcrowding and crushing at the turnstiles caused by a
        build up of supporters arriving after 2.30 pm. In the
        fixre minutes after the gate was opened 2000 supporters
        entered the ground and went into a tunnel under the west
        stand which gave access only to the central pens 3 and 4.
        Those pens were already full. There was no controlled
        way in which supporters were allowed in to the pens. The
        additional influx caused intense pressure and resulted in
        the collapse of a crush barrier 124A near the front of
        pen 3. Many died from suffocation and crushing and some
        were trampled on. Perimeter gates were not opened by the
        police partly because of orders not to do so without
        permission and partly because officers did not appreciate
        the severity of what was occurring initially. Later when
        the emergency was appreciated the small size and number*
        of the gates made evacuation extremely difficult.

6.      The build up of fans outside the ground was due to the
        geography of the turnstiles, their marking and numbers
        and to a loss of police control of supporters outside
        becoming keen to get inside before the kick-off.
7.    The three major causal factors were:-

      i-   the layout of the ground
      ii- the opening of the exit gate (gate C)
      iii. the build up outside the ground

Layout of the Ground

8.    The club were advised by a structural engineer, Dr
      Eastwood.  The Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 required
      expert advice to obtain a safety certificate under the
      Act from the local council.  Dr Eastwood advised
      additional crush barriers, these were installed in 1979.
      A certificate was granted.

9.    The safety certificate did not specify maximum numbers
      for the pens. This, with turnstile monitoring of
      numbers, would have limited entrance to the pens.

10.   It was the policy of the police at semi-finals to allow
      movement of supporters between pens before the kick-off
      after which the radial gates would be closed and locked.
      Hence without a control on the numbers entering the
      tunnel access pens 3 and 4 were liable to become grossly
      overcrowded. The police had accepted responsibility for
      monitoring the pens and their policy of "letting the fans
      find their own level*' was severely criticized by Taylor.

11.   The exit gate C, opened following Duckenfield's
      instruction, is opposite the tunnel. No steps were taken
      to cordon off the tuniiex or divert the fans around the
      sides of the West stand. The supporters had nowhere to
      go but the already crowded pens 3 and 4.

12.   At 3.04 pm a surge forward in pen 3 caused the crush
      barrier 124A to ^reak. This appears to have been a major
      factor in the deaths since there were far fewer deaths in
      pen 4 where no barrier collapsed. Barrier number 144 had
      been removed in 1986, its absence meant there was no
      retarding structure as fans emerged from the tunnel into
      pen 3. There was unbroken diagonal pressure from the
      mouth of the tunnel down to barrier 124A.      the collapse
      of barrier 124A was a major factor in the cause of the
      deaths. Barrier 124A was slightly corroded but it had
      been tested in July 1988 and had passed loading tests
      specified in the Government's Green G u i d e . Taylor found
      that corrosion played a part in the collapse but the
      effective cause was the excessive unanticipated pressu?£
      exerted at the time of the forward s urge.

13.   The crushing in pens 3 and 4 was not recognised by police
      either in the control box or on the perimeter of the
      pitch. Even supporters nearby, broadcasters and stewards
      were not immediately aware.

14.   Even after the crush, and until 3.06 pm, the main police
      concern was to prevent a pitch invasion.
The build up outside the Ground

15.   The opening of gate C which precipitated the disaster was
      made necessary by the massive build up of supporters at
      the Leppings Lane turnstiles between 2.30 and 2.50 pm.
      As kick-off time approached the crushing increased. The
      police lost control of the crowd.  The crush became
      unmanageable, many feared for their lives. The kick-off
      was not postponed.  This course was only to be taken if
      there was a major cause of delay eg. a motorway accident
      or fog. Taylor concluded that the kick-off should have
      been postponed.

16.   There was considerable evidence that people would be
      killed if gate C was not opened and that Duckenfield had
      no alternative but to do so. That being so neither
      Duckenfield nor other officers took any steps to deal
      with the consequences of opening the gate. The tunnel
      was not closed off even though such action had been taken
      by the police in 1988. Duckenfield did order the influx
      at gate A, which had been opened earlier, to be
      monitored. His omission to do so at gate C was said by
      Taylor to be "a blunder of the first magnitude". This
      was the immediate cause of the crushing in pens 3 and 4.
      It was not the sole cause.

17.   The layout of the turnstiles, inadequate space for the
      formation of orderly queues and the limited extent of the
      waiting area combined with poor designation and marking
      of turnstiles contributed to slow turnstile operation.

18.   There were only 7 turnstiles to admit 10,100 fans at the
      other end of the ground there were 60 turnstiles to admit
      29,800.  Taylor concluded that the police and club should
      have foreseen potential queuing and waiting to admit
      fans.

19.   Many supporters arrived after 2.30 pm. Tickets advised
      arriving 15 minutes before kick-off.  Some arrived
      without tickets. The evidence shows many had been
      drinking. Taylor concluded the majority had not been
      affected by drink. Unruliness contributed to the pushing
      effect. This contributed to the loss of control by the
      police.

20.   The main factor in the police loss of control was
      ineffective strategy planning for the large number of
      arrivals. Taylor concluded that by controlling the fans
      and postponing the kick-off gate C could have remained'
      closed.

Responsibilities

21.   The layout of the ground was the responsibility of the
      Club, Eastwood, the Council and the police. No one
      foresaw that up to 2000 fans would ever be allowed to
      enter pens 3 and 4 when they were already overcrowded.
      No one anticipated gate 3 being opened or the crushing
      outside the ground. The police must take the main
      responsibility for letting the fans "find their own
      level” , however, the Club must share responsibility for
      the way in which supporters were allowed to fill the pens
      at semi-finals.

22.   The opening of gate C was Duckenfield's responsibility.
      In the circumstances his decision was correct. His
      failure was to give no order to deal with the sudden
      influx of fans. Had the tunnel been cordoned off the
      disaster would almost certainly have been averted.

23.   The layout of the turnstiles, their numbers and marking
       are primarily matters for the police and the Club, but
       the Council have a partial responsibility to ensure safe
       access to the ground.

Criminal Offences

24.   The two offences would be Manslaughter and Culpable
      Misfeasance. These potential offences were considered
      against all parties, ie. the club, the Council, the
      police and the structural engineers (Mr Eastwood).

The Club

25.   The Club's responsibility for the layout and alterations
       inside the ground and for the layout of the turnstiles is
      where any potential liability exists.   It is clear that
      these were not the sole, or even the major causes and
      that any actions and omissions by the club only partly
      contributed to the crushing and deaths. The Club not
      only relied on its own consultant engineer Dr Eastwood
      but it responded to the suggestions and advice of the
      police in important matters.

26.   There is insufficient evidence to establish the actus
      reus of manslaughter against the Club. Additionally the
      evidence does not show either the recklessness or gross
      negligence required for the manslaughter offence.
Eastwood and Partners

27.   Eastwood's advice formed only part of the events that
      lead tot he structural condition at the ground.   It could
      not be said that his advice caused the deaths. In fact
      some of his advice , not acted on for financial reasons ,
      may have lead to maximum limits being set for pens 3 and
      4.

28.   Again there is insufficient for the actus reus of
      manslaughter nor can the required recklessness or
      negligence be established against Eastwood or his firm.

The Council

29.   The Council is responisible for the safety certificate and
      compliance with the Green Guide. There were minor errors
      on the council's part but these only contributed in part
      to the ground conditions.     These are too remote to
      amount to the actus reus of manslaughter.   Again there is
      no evidence of recklessness or gross negligence.

The Police

30.   It is agreed that the main responsibility for the
      disaster must rest with the police.   They have partial
      responsibility for the ground layout.   They were
      responsible for the "find their own level" policy with
      the supporters and also for supervising the Leppings Lane
      turnstiles. The difficulties of large scale admission to
      the ground should have been foreseen.   However, the
      police failures occurred as part of a complex sequence of
      events, often outside the control of the police. The
      difficulties at Leppings Lane were partly geographical
      and resulted largely in the arrival of vast numbers of
      supporters after 2.30 pm. Those matters were beyond
      police control. Unruly behaviour by a minority cr^at-^d
      problems.

31.   Responsibility for the failure to postpone the kick-off
      and to cordon off the access tunnel is confined to
      Duckenfield. As an organisation the police cannot be
      said to have caused the deaths by their strategy and
      operational shortcomings. Whilst there were errors of
      judgement and practice there is no- evidence that the
      police acted recklessly or in a grossly negligent manner
      as an organisation.

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield

32.   The failure to cordon off the access tunnel and not to
      postpone the kick-off were bad errors of judgement. They
      were his ultimate responsibility. He failed to notice
      the overcrowding in pens 3 and 4. He was recently
      promoted and had little experience for this semi-final
      match. His slowness to respond to what was happening was
      a result of is lack of experience.
33.   His failures significantly contributed to the crowd
      pressure which caused the crushing and collapse of
      barrier 124A. Had Duckenfield the requisite intention to
      support a charge of manslaughter? Clearly there was no
      unlawful or dangerous act on his part.  In failing to
      postpone the kick-off or order closure of the tunnel
      after opening gate C did he do an act which created an
      obvious and serious risk of causing personal injury
      either not giving thought to the possibility of such risk
      or having recognised that there was some risk involved
      nevertheless gone ahead and taken it?

34.   There are difficulties in proving that he intended to do
      an act which created an obvious and serious risk of
      causing personal injury.  The Director and Counsel
      concluded that it was not an obvious risk at the time.
      It is easy with hindsight to judge, but there must be a
      grave doubt as to whether the omissions created a risk
      which was obvious to anyone on the ground at the time.

35.   The Director concluded that there was insufficient
      evidence under the recklessness head of manslaughter
      against Duckenfield. Nor was there evidence that he was
      grossly negligent in his failures to act.

36.   Counsel and the Director concluded that there was no
      evidence that Duckenfield was wilfully neglectful of his
      duty or was culpable so have to committed the offence of
      Culpable Malfeasance by a public official.

Conclusions

37.   The Director's decision not to issue proceedings was
      reached solely on the basis of an insufficiency of
      evidence to prove any criminal offence against any
      individual or body corporate ie. the City Council, the
      Police, the Engineers.   The decision was reached in
      accordance with the Director's code for Crown
      Prosecutors. The Public Interest factor was not one
      which came into play as the evidential sufficiency
      criterium had not been established in respect of any
      potential defendant.   Full consideration was given to the
      possibility of the proseuction of each of the bodies
      involved despite their corporate status.

38.   The disaster was caused not by one single error or
      failure but by the combined effect of a series of
      mistakes, misjudgments and poor decisions, made by groups
      of people both over a period of time and by individuals
      on the day of the disaster.

Coroner's Inquests

39.   The Inquests began after the disaster and were adjourned
      when the Director requested a criminal investigation.
      The Coroner is obliged to adjourn an inquest when the
      Director makes such a request under the Coroner's Rules.

                       Once the Coroner has received notification that the
                       Director has decided not to issue criminal proceedings
                       (or after such proceedings have concluded) the Coroner
                       may resume the Inquest hearing.  The Hillsborough Inquest
                       recently recommenced in November 1990.  The latest
                       estimate is that the Inquests will continue hearing
                       evidence and are likely to conclude in March 1991. -
                 40.   The point made by Kenneth Hind MP about the matter being
                       forgotten if action is not taken against those
                       responsible can be answered by pointing to the detailed
                       interim and final report of the Public Inquiry conducted
                       by Lord Justice Taylor, the civil proceedings at which
                       the police admitted liability and the fact that
                       disciplinary action is being considered by the Police
                       Complaints Authority against various officers.
                 41.   The Coroner’s jury may be influenced by the publicity
                       surrounding the Director’s decision. The criminal
                       investigation and any prosecution must take precedence
                       over the Coroner's Inquisitorial hearing where no
                       individual can be held responsible. The Public Inquiry
                       itself has been widely reported and such publicity can
                       also be said to influence the jury's conclusions.

     Butler Inquiry

    ^ D E C IS IO N         HAS THE CPS REACHED IN THE CASE OF RICHARD


    The CPS has now completed its re-view of the decision not to prosecute any police officer
    following the death o f Richard Joseph O’Brien in April 1994. The advice o f Senior Treasury
    Counsel was obtained and, after very careful consideration, the CPS has advised the
    Metropolitan police to initiate proceedings for manslaughter against three police officers.

    DOES THIS SHOW THAT THE CPS MADE MISTAKES?

    The CPS accepts that errors were made in the original decision-making process anH has
    written to lawyers acting for the family. The matter is now sub judice and it would be
    inappropriate for me to add anything further at this stage.

    WHAT ABOUT THE CASE OF DEREK TREADAWAY?

    The advice o f Senior Treasury Counsel is that there is insufficient evidence to prosecute and
    that the original decision not to prosecute was correct.

    WHAT ABOUT LAPITE?

    The case o f Oluwashijibomi Lapite is still under consideration.

   WHAT ABOUT THE BUTLER INQUIRY REPORT?

   The CPS has received the report from His Honour Gerald Butler QC intn the decision­
   making process within CPS Central Casework and is seeking independent advice from senior .
   counsel as to whether the report can be published while proceedings in the case of Richard
   O’Brien are under way.


   Hillsborough Inquiry

   WHAT WAS THE CPS ROLE IN THE HILLSBOROUGH CASE?

   In 1990 the CPS considered whether there was sufficient evidence to prosecute any one
   arising out o f the disaster. It concluded there was not. In 1997, the CPS considered material
   supplied by or on behalf o f the Hillsborough Family Support Group (HFSG). Allegations
   were made that evidence had been suppressed from the Taylor Inquiry and the inquest. The
   CPS considered whether there were grounds for asking the police to institute further criminal
   investigations. It concluded that there were insufficient grounds, ["material"- ie. papers and
   video tapes],

   WHY WILL YOU NOT TAKE ACTION IN RELATION TO THE ALLEGATIONS
   THAT POLICE OFFICERS ALTERED THEIR STATEMENTS?

   This matter was considered in full by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith. He considered that these
   98   10:17     ©01 71 273 8450                                        UNITED HOUSE          @




             in no way affected the outcome of either the Taylor Inquiry or the Inquest.

WELL YOU ASK TH ^ POLICE TO INVESTIGATE THE STATE OF THE GROUND
IN THE LIGHT OF THE COMMENTS OF LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH?

No. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith made it clear that some evidence not previously considered
about the size of crush barriers and the capacity of parts of Leppings Lane terraces do not
give grounds for re-opening the Judicial Inquiry or any other proceedings.

WHY WILL YOU NOT PUBLISH YOUR ADVICES?

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith was asked to consider whether there is any new material which
might have a bearing on the CPS decisions. He was not asked to comment on the decisions
themselves. It has long been accepted that detailed reasons for prosecuting or not
prosecuting someone should not be made public.

n f pressed, reasons are: Decisions about prosecution frequently involve the interests and
reputations o f witnesses, the victim and the accused or suspect. Publicly calling[into question
decisions about prosecution could amount to a trial of the suspect without the safeguards
which criminal proceedings are designed to provide].

HAS THE DPP HERSELF BEEN INVOLVED IN CONSIDERING THE CASE?

The DPP has been consulted about the decisions and has been kept informed o f key
developments.


PAC: Returned Briefs

WHAT IS THE CPS DOING ABOUT RETURNED BRIEFS?

 The CPS and the Bar have agreed a Service Standard on returned briefs, which sets out the
 circumstances in which a return will be acceptable; these vary with the nature of
 The CPS has also negotiated a formal monitoring scheme with the Bar which involves the
 Bar monitoring their performance against the Returned Brief standard. The scheme beg
 on 2 February 1998.

 WHAT EFFECT WILL MONITORING HAVE?

 All chambers instructed by the CPS will provide monthly reports giving fee              of
 briefs returned and the reasons. Meetings between Branch Crown Prosecutors and heads of
 chambers every six months w ill provide an opportunity to discuss chambers performance and
 agree measures for improvement where necessary.

 WHY DID THE CPS NOT ACT SOONER?

 •me problem o f returned briefs has always been high on
 necessary to establish a performance framework before introducing a standard on returns.
 The introduction of the monitoring scheme on 2 February 1998 demonstrates the commi

Q&A

. What is the CPS role in the Hillsborough case?

In 1990 the CPS considered whether there was sufficient evidence to
prosecute any one arising out of the disaster. We concluded there was not.

In 1997, the CPS considered material supplied by or on behalf of the
Hillsborough Family Support Group (HFSG). Allegations were made that
evidence had been suppressed from the Taylor Inquiry and the inquest. CPS
considered whether there were grounds for asking the police to institute
further criminal investigations. We concluded that there were insufficient
grounds. [ " m a t e r i a l ” - ie. p a p e r s and v i d e o t a p e s ].

2. Will the CPS be taking any action following the publication of the
Report ?

No, the report has confirmed that there are no new grounds for criminal
investigation.


3. But what about prosecuting the police for withholding some video
evidence ?

The suggestion that police withheld video evidence has not been upheld by
the Report. The CPS has reviewed all the available video evidence in
making its decisions.


4. Should police be prosecuted for giving misleading evidence on whether
the cameras were working properly or not at the inquest?

The report found that submissions on this were untenable, therefore the
evidential position remains unchanged.

5. Why will you not take action in relation to the allegations that police
officers altered their statements?

This matter was considered in full by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith. He
considered that these amendments in no way affected the outcome of either
the Taylor Inquiry or the Inquest.

6. What about allegations that the police improperly interfered with
witnesses ?

The report concluded that there was no improper pressure put on witnesses
and therefore there are no grounds for instituting criminal proceedings.

7. What about the new medical evidence provided e.g. that by Dr Walker ?
Lord Justice Stuart-Smith found that the evidence of Dr Walker and others
added nothing to that already given at the inquest. Therefore the view of
the CPS remains the same - that there is insufficient evidence to institute
criminal proceedings.



8. Does the new evidence of the structural engineer which criticises the
safety and structural aspects of the ground mean that the Club could be
criminally liable ?

The report does not suggest that this new evidence implies that the Club
was criminally liable.

9. Will you ask the police to investigate the state of the ground in the
light of the comments of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith?

No. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith made it clear that some evidence not
previously considered about the size of crush barriers and the capacity of
parts of Leppings Lane terraces do not give grounds for re-opening the
Judicial Inquiry or any other proceedings.

10. Why will you not publish your advices?                  ____       ihjtdSLO &l

CPS advice is subject to legal privilege(?). This is because decisions
about prosecutions frequently involve the interests and reputations of
witnesses, the victim and the accused or suspect. Publicly calling into
question decisions about prosecution could amount to a trial of the suspect
without the safeguards which criminal proceedings are designed to provide.

11. Will you meet the relatives ?

We have a publicly stated commitment to meet the relatives of deceased
victims to explain the basis upon which our decisions are taken. We will,
of course, be prepared to meet relatives, if they think that would be
helpful.

12. Surely it must be in the public interest to prosecute somebody ?

There are two stages in the decision to prosecute. First, we must be
satisfied that there is enough evidence to provide a "realistic prospect of
conviction". If the case does not pass this evidential test, it must not go
ahead, no matter how important or serious it may be. If a case does pass
the evidential test, the Crown Prosecutor must then consider the second
stage test to decide if a prosecution is in the public interest. In cases
of any seriousness, a prosecution will usually take place unless there are
public interest factors tending against prosecution which clearly outweigh
those tending in favour. The Crown Prosecution Service will only start or
continue a prosecution when the case has passed both tests.

13. Has the DPP herself been involved in considering the case?

The DPP has been consulted about the decisions made and of course been kept
informed of key developments.

14. If the relatives bring a private prosecution, will the CPS take it
over, given that you think there is no merit in bringing a prosecution ?
The Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 allows individuals to bring a private
prosecution. We have not received any formal notification that a private
prosecution has been commenced and therefore at this stage cannot speculate
what our action, if at all, would be. ????

Guidances The CPS has some responsibilities in relation to private
prosecutions, which includes a duty to take over prosecutions and
discontinue them where there is insufficient evidence to proceed.

Guidance: The Prosecution o f Offences Act 1985 allows individuals to bring a private
prosecution. The CPS has some responsibilities in relation to private prosecutions, which
includes a duty to take over prosecutions and discontinue them where there is insufficient
evidence to proceed, to allow some private prosecutions to run, and sometime to take over
private prosecutions and run them. Every case is considered on its own merits.

              Background Not e: Hillsborough Disaster


1.     On the 15th April 1989 at the Hillsborough R a d i u m ,   ^
       Sheffield 95 people died and over 400 were injured du
       gross overcrowding and crushing in the two P en^ e 1
       the goal at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.

2.     A public enquiry headed by Lord Justice Taylor     ^ ced
       an interim report in August 1989. The West Midlands
       Police assisted in the preparation of the report ana
       later conducted a criminal investigation which was
       requested by the D.P.P. The criminal investigation was
       extensive producing bulky documentation and a u
       transcript of the evidence given at the enquiry,
       police investigation was meticulous.

3.     A copy of Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report and a copy
       of Counsel's opinion by Gareth Williams Q.C. and Peter_
       Birts Q.C. are attached.  It would be useful to refer to
       the plans at Appendix 1 and Appendix 4 of the report.


Facts
 4.     There is little, if any, dispute as to what actually _
        happened,Chief Superintendent Duckenfield was the polic
        officer responsible for policing the match.

 5.     At 2.52 pm (8 minutes before kick-off) Duckenfield
        ordered one of the exit gates, Gate C, at the Lepping
        Lane end to be opened. This was to relieve passive
        overcrowding and crushing at the turnstiles caused by a
        build up of supporters arriving after 2.30 pm.      m th
        five minutes after the gate was opened 2000 supporters
        entered the ground and went into a tunnel unde
        stand which gave access only to the central pens 3 and .
        Those pens were already full. There            P^rolled
        way in which supporters were allowed in to the             T
        additional influx caused intense pressure and ^ s u i t e d in
         the collapse of a crush barrier 124A near the front of
         pen 3. Many died from suffocation and cru®h^ f n^ d ®°the
        were trampled on. Perimeter gates were no        £.thout
         police partly because of orders not to do         aDnreciate
         permission and partly because officers did not ^ e c i a t e
         the severity of what was occurring m i t i a y.     mimber
         the emergency was appreciated the small size
         of the gates made evacuation extremely difficult.

  6.    The build up of fans outside the ground was due to the
        geography of the turnstiles, their marking
        and to a loss of police control of supporters outside
        becoming keen to get inside before the kick-off.
7.    The three major causal factors were:-

      i.   the layout of the ground
      ii. the opening of the exit gate (gate C)
      iii. the build up outside the ground

Layout of the Ground

8.    The club were advised by a structural engineer, Dr
      Eastwood.  The Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 required
      expert advice to obtain a safety certificate under the
      Act from the local council.  Dr Eastwood advised
      additional crush barriers, these were installed in 1979.
      A certificate was granted.

9.    The safety certificate did not specify maximum numbers
      for the pens.  This, with turnstile monitoring of
      numbers, would have limited entrance to the pens.

10.   It was the policy of the police at semi-finals to allow
      movement of supporters between pens before the kick-off
      after which the radial gates would be closed and locked.
      Hence without a control on the numbers entering the
      tunnel access pens 3 and 4 were liable to become grossly
      overcrowded.  The police had accepted responsibility for
      monitoring the pens and their policy of "letting the fans
      find their own level" was severely criticized by Taylor.

11.   The exit gate C, opened following Duckenfield1s
      instruction, is opposite the tunnel. No steps were taken
      to cordon off the tunnel or divert the fans around the
      sides of the West stand.  The supporters had nowhere to
      go but the already crowded pens 3 and 4.

12.   At 3.04 pm a surge forward in pen 3 caused the crush
      barrier 124A to break. This appears to have been a major
      factor in the deaths since there were far fewer deaths in
      pen 4 where no barrier collapsed.  Barrier number 144 had
      been removed in 1986, its absence meant there was no
      retarding structure as fans emerged from the tunnel into
      pen 3. There was unbroken diagonal pressure from the
      mouth of the tunnel down to barrier 124A. the collapse
      of barrier 124A was a major factor in the cause of the
      deaths.  Barrier 124A was slightly corroded but it had
      been tested in July 1988 and had passed loading tests
      specified in the Government's Green Guide. Taylor found
      that corrosion played a part in the collapse but the
      effective cause was the excessive unanticipated pressure
      exerted at the time of the forward surge.

13.   The crushing in pens 3 and 4 was not recognised by police
      either in the control box or on the perimeter of the
      pitch.  Even supporters nearby, broadcasters and stewards
      were not immediately aware.

14.   Even after the crush, and until 3.06 pm, the main police
      concern was to prevent a pitch invasion.
The build up outside the Ground
15.    The opening of gate C which precipitated theJJj^fter was
       made necessary by the massive build up o      PP so ran
       the Leppings Lane turnstiles between 2.30 and 2.50 p .
       As kick-off time approached the crushing
       police lost control of the crowd. The crush b           ff
       unmanageable, many feared for their lives. Th<e
       was not postponed.  This course was only to b
       there was a major cause of delay e g . a motorway   .
       or fog. Taylor concluded that the kick off shoul
       been postponed.
16.    There was considerable evidence that people would be
       killed if gate C was not opened and that Duckenfield
       no alternative but to do so. That being so neither
       Duckenfield nor other officers took any steps to deal
       with the consequences of opening the gate. The tunne
       was not closed off even though such action had been taJcen
       by the police in 1988. Duckenfield did order the influx
       at gate A, which had been opened earlier, to be
       monitored.  His omission to do so at gate C was said by
       Taylor to be "a blunder of the first magnitude . This
       was the immediate cause of the crushing in pens 3 and 4.
       It was not the sole cause.
17.    The layout of the turnstiles, inadequate space for the
       formation of orderly queues and the limited extent of th
       waiting area combined with poor designation and marking
       of turnstiles contributed to slow turnstile operation.

18.    There were only 7 turnstiles to admit 10, 100 fans Jt: the
       other end of the ground there were 60 turnstiles to admit
       29,800.  Taylor concluded that the police and club should
       have foreseen potential queuing and waiting to admit
       fans.
 19.   Many supporters arrived after 2.30 pm. Tickets advised
       arriving 15 minutes before kick-off.   S o m e arrived
       without tickets.   The evidence shows many :  had
       drinking.   Taylor concluded the majority had not been
       affected by drink.   Unruliness contributed to the pushing
       effect.   This contributed to the loss of control by
       police.
 20.    The main factor in the police loss of control ™as
        ineffective strategy planning for the large number °
        arrivals. Taylor concluded that by controlling the fans
        and postponing the kick-off gate C could have remained
        closed.

 Responsibilities
 21.    The layout of the ground was the responsibility of the
        Club, Eastwood, the Council and the police. No one
        foresaw that up to 2000 fans would ever be a l l o w d t j
        enter pens 3 and 4 when they were already o           hinq
        No one anticipated gate 3 being opened or the crushing
      outside the ground.  The police must take the main
      responsibility for letting the fans "find their own
      level , however, the Club must share responsibility for
      the way in which supporters were allowed to fill the pens
      at semi-finals.
22.   The opening of gate C was Duckenfield1s responsibility.
      In the circumstances his decision was correct. His
      failure was to give no order to deal with the sudden
      influx of fans. Had the tunnel been cordoned off the
      disaster would almost certainly have been averted.
23    The layout of the turnstiles, their numbers and marking
      are primarily matters for the police and the Club, but
      the Council have a partial responsibility to ensure safe
      access to the ground.

Criminal Offences

      The two        ences would be Manslaughter and Culpable
      Misfea        i. These potential/offences were considered
                 all parties, ie. t^'club, the Council, the
                and the structural/engineers (Mr Eastwood).



      The Club's responsibility for the layout and alterations
      inside the groupra and for the layout of the/€urnstiies is
      where any        itial liability exists.   i y i s clear that
      these were        the sole, or even the rna^or causes and
      that any         is and omissions by th^/club only partly
                :ed to the crushing and de^^hs. The Club not
      only relied on its own consultarrfc'engineer Dr Eastwood
      but/Tt responded to the suggestions and advice of the
         cice in important matters.

      There is insufficient evidence to establish the aj
      reus of manslaughter ag&inst the Club. Ad         Lly the
      evidence does not shpw either the reckless         gross

               ^           v,   difficulties of large scale admission to
        tne ground should have been foreseen. However, the
                    faJlu res occurred as part of a complex sequence of
        ®Y®£-S/,°ften outside the control of the police. The
        difficulties at Leppings Lane were partly geographical
        and resulted largely in the arrival of vast numbers of
        supporters after 2.30 pm. Those matters were beyond
        problems°ntr01" Unruly behaviour by a minority created

31.     Responsibility for the failure to postpone the kick-off
        and to cordon off the access tunnel is confined to
        Duckenfield. As an organisation the police cannot be
        said to have caused the deaths by their strategy and
        operational shortcomings.  Whilst there were errors of
        judgement and practice there is no evidence that the
        police acted recklessly or in a grossly negligent manner
        as an organisation.

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield

32.     The failure to cordon off the access tunnel and not to
        postpone the kick-off were bad errors of judgement.  They
        were his ultimate responsibility.  He failed to notice
        the overcrowding in pens 3 and 4. He was recently
        promoted and had little experience for this semi-final
        match.  His slowness to respond to what was happening was
        a result of is lack of experience.
33.   His failures significantly contributed to the crowd
      pressure which caused the crushing and collapse of
      barrier 124A. Had Duckenfield the requisite intention to
      support a charge of manslaughter? Clearly there was no
      unlawful or dangerous act on his part.  In failing to
      postpone the kick-off or order closure of the tunnel
      after opening gate C did he do an act which created an
      obvious and serious risk of causing personal injury
      either not giving thought to the possibility of such risk
      or having recognised that there was some risk involved
      nevertheless gone ahead and taken it?

34.   There are difficulties in proving that he intended to do
      an act which created an obvious and serious risk of
      causing personal injury. The Director and Counsel
      concluded that it was not an obvious risk at the time.
      It is easy with hindsight to judge, but there must be a
      grave doubt as to whether the omissions created a risk
      which was obvious to anyone on the ground at the time.

35.   The Director concluded that there was insufficient
      evidence under the recklessness head of manslaughter
      against Duckenfield.  Nor was there evidence that he was
      grossly negligent in his failures to act.

36.   Counsel” and the Director concluded that there was no
      evidence that Duckenfield was wilfully neglectful of his
      duty or was culpable so have to committed the offence of
      Culpable Malfeasance by a public official.

Conclusions

37.   The Director's decision not to issue proceedings was
      reached solely on the basis of an insufficiency of
      evidence to prove any criminal offence against any
      individual or body corporate ie. the City Council, the
      Police, the Engineers. The decision was reached in
      accordance with the Director's code for Crown
      Prosecutors. The Public Interest factor was not one
      which came into play as the evidential sufficiency
      criterium had not been established in respect of any
      potential defendant.  Full consideration was given to the
      possibility of the proseuction of each of the bodies
      involved despite their corporate status.

38.   The disaster was caused not by one single error or
      failure but by the combined effect of a series of
      mistakes, misjudgments and poor decisions, made by groups
      of people both over a period of time and by individuals
      on the day of the disaster.

Coroner's Inquests

39.   The Inquests began after the disaster and were adjourned
      when the Director requested a criminal investigation.
      The Coroner is obliged to adjourn an inquest when the
      Director makes such a request under the Coroner s Rules.
                                 7.

      Once the Coroner has received notification that the
      Director has decided not to issue criminal proceedings
      (or after such proceedings have concluded) the Coroner
      may resume the Inquest hearing. The Hillsborough Inquest
      recently recommenced in November 1990. The latest
      estimate is that the Inquests will continue hearing
      evidence and are likely to conclude in March 1991.

40.   The point made by Kenneth Hind MP about the matter being
      forgotten if action is not taken against those
      responsible can be answered by pointing to the detailed
      interim and final report of the Public Inquiry conducted
      by Lord Justice Taylor, the civil proceedings at which
      the police admitted liability and the fact that
      disciplinary action is being considered by the Police
      Complaints Authority against various officers.

41.   The Coroner's jury may be influenced by the publicity
      surrounding the Director's decision. The criminal
      investigation and any prosecution must take precedence
      over the Coroner's Inquisitorial hearing where no
      individual can be held responsible. The Public Inquiry
      itself has been widely reported and such publicity can
      also be said to influence the jury's conclusions.

ISSUE

1.1     What action should this department take following the approach made by the
        Hillsborough Family Support Group and their legal representatives in their
        correspondence of 4th March 1997.

ACTION REQUIRED

2.1     A decision should be made taking into consideration the CPS Central
        Casework Report and its appendices of the 20th March 1997 (Appendix 1 to
        this briefing note).

2.2     A co-ordinated approach is required by the various legal departments involved
        in reviewing the HSFG representations.

TIMING

3.1   A substantive answer should be given to the HSFG as soon as possible.

BACKGROUND

4.1   The background is fully set out in Appendices 1 and 2 to the attached Central
      Casework Report.

KEY CONSIDERATIONS

5.1   The Central Casework briefing note of 29th January 1997 mentioned three
      crucial questions that fall to be considered

5.2   Has any "new" evidence come to light arising from the TV screening of the
      Hillsborough Drama/Documentary on the 5th December 1996.

5.3   Does this evidence support the view that one or more police officers may have
      committed perjury at the Coroner’s Court or otherwise attempted to obstruct
      the course of justice.

5.4   Is there now sufficient doubt for the Attorney General to be asked once more
      to consider exercising his powers under Section 13 of the Coroner’s Act 1988
       to require a fresh inquest to be held.

RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1   That the Central Casework Report of the 20th March 1997 attached at
      Appendix 1 be adopted.
MOTES
             6.2   The evidence put forward by the HFSG concerns two separate aspects of the
                   Hillsborough disaster enquiry, that is, alleged suppression of video evidence
                   which would go towards proving criminal misconduct by police officers and
                   the suppression of medical evidence that would show grounds for the re­
                   opening of inquests based on a later cut off point for the death of the victims.

             6.3   On the first point there has been no suppression of any video evidence and the
                   inquest jury were able to consider the relevant videos and compare them with
                   the observations made by police during the giving of their evidence under
                   oath. The jury’s verdict was therefore made after all the relevant material
                   was put before them. There is insufficient evidence to conclude that police
                   officers committed perjury at the Coroner’s Court or were involved in
                   Perverting the Course of Justice.

             6.4   On the second point, the credibility of the medical witness put forward by the
                   HFSG is greatly weakened by the mistakes and discrepancies in the evidence
                   that doctor would put forward. Similar evidence was considered by the
                   Divisional Court during judicial review of the Coroner’s Hearings and was
                   found to have little merit.

             6.5   There are no grounds for asking the Attorney General to consider exercising
                   his powers under Section 13 of the Coroner’s Act 1988 in requiring a fresh
                   inquest to be held.

             6.6   It is understood that both the Police Policy Directorate at the Home Office and
                    the Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers have come to the same conclusion.

7            CONCLUSION

             7.1   That a co-ordinated approach should be taken by the various departments
                   involved as to how the HFSG representations should be actioned.

Central Casework: PR3
21 March 1997




MMS/J6J.97
1.    ISSUE

1.1   What action should this Department take in the light of the
      transmission of the Hillsborough drama/documentary on the
      5 December 1996.

2 .   ACTION REQUIRED

2.1   Present position to be established with the South Yorkshire
      Police and all other interested parties. A response is
      required to an enquiry raised by David Alton MP on behalf
      of the Hillsborough Family Support Group.

3.    TIMING

3.1   Response to David Alton is required by   31 January 1997

4.    BACKGROUND

4.1   The Hillsborough Disaster was      and still   remains  an
      unparalleled occurrence of our time and lead to not only^a
      fundamental re-appraisal  of safety at public events, but
      has since resulted in precedence being set in the Civil
      Courts as to what might constitute post traumatic stress.

4.2   For a detailed understanding of what then followed the
      original background note prepared for the then Attorney
      General together with its accompanying annexes remains
      valid.

4.3   These documents have therefore been attached to this note
      to avoid both duplication and repetition.

4.4. At the conclusion of the re-commenced inquest verdicts of
     accidental death were returned on all the victims.

4.5   The proceedings at the Coroner's Court were challenged by
      way of Judicial Review. The Divisional Court however found
      nothing upon which they felt that they could question the
      actions of that Court.

4.6   On Thursday 5 December 1996 the independent television
      network screened a drama/documentary based on the disaster
      written and produced by one James McGovern.

4.7   The screening of this programme and in particular certain
      parts of its content has resulted in eight of the deceased
      families writing both to this Department and in some cases
      to either the Home Secretary, the Attorney General or both
      asking that both the original inquest be set aside and that
      a new criminal investigation be commenced in the light of
      the new evidence disclosed in the programme. In addition it
      would appear that Hillsborough Family Support Group has
      also written to every member of Parliament, which appears
      so far to have only lead to David Alton MP. forwarding a
      copy of the same to the Director.

4.8   On the 17 December 1996 the Home Secretary was required to
      respond in the House to an Adjournment Debate specifically
      on this matter. A transcript of what then took place is
      attached.

4.9   Following on from this debate the Home Secretary wrote to
      the Chief Constable for South Yorkshire Police asking him
      to express a view on certain issues that have been raised
      by the programme and the answers to 10 specific questions.
      A copy of this letter has been obtained via LSLO and is
      attached.

4.10 A copy of the programme has been obtained and this has been
     viewed by this office. Contact has also been established
     with the South Yorkshire Police Officers who are dealing
     with this matter and they have been invited to attend these
     offices on Monday 27 January 1997 so that we can be briefed
     as to what the current position is.

5.    KEY CONSIDERATIONS

5.1   The three crucial questions that fall to be considered are
      has any "new" evidence come to light arising from the
      screening of the TV programme ? Does this evidence support
      the view that one or more POlice Officers may have
      committed perjury at the Coroners Court and is there now
      sufficient doubt for the Attorney General to once more be
      asked to consider exercising his powers under Section 13 of
      the Coroners Act 1988 to require a fresh inquest to be
      held.

6.    RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1   At present it is recommended that this Department has
      insufficient evidence upon which any substantive decision
      can be m a d e .

6.2   Once the Chief Constable has reported to the Home Secretary
      it is recommended that a meeting is held between this
      Department, the Home Office, the LSLO and South Yorkshire
      Police so that it can be established whether or not a
      further enquiry is to commence and if so in what form and
      to agree how any further enquiries either from the HFSG,
      relatives of the deceased or the media generally will be
      handled so as to avoid any possibility of confusion between
      u s   .
6.3   A detailed reply either to David Alton MP or the families
      would therefore seem inappropriate at this stage. It is
      therefore recommended that any present response draws upon
      both the existing letter that has been sent previously by
      the Law Officers on behalf of the Attorney General, a copy
      of which is attached, together with their amended version
      created in the light of the additional points that have
      been made in the HFSG circular.
/
7.    CONCLUSION
7.1   That until such time that this Department is either asked
      or is satisfied that a further criminal investigation is to
      take place, that no action is taken from which it could be
      misconstrued that this Department either has or intends to
      re-open the Hillsborough Enquiry.
                                  RE: HILLSBOROUGH


1        ISSUES

         1.1   I have been asked to review the Hillsborough Family Support Group letter of
                4th March 1997 and the attached Counsel’s Opinion with supporting
                documents. The letter requests the Director to convene a meeting with the
                above group and their legal representatives (Alun Jones QC and Ann
                Adlington, Solicitor) to discuss their ‘new’ evidence and the legal advice
                based upon it.

         1.2   A meeting was held at the Home Office on the 10th March 1997 with
               representatives of their Operational Policing Policy Division, of the Legal
               Secretariat to the Law Officers and of CPS Central Casework. It was decided
               that each of the three groups should report back to the OPPD having
               conducted separate reviews of the allegations made by Mr. Trevor Hicks and
               Alun Jones QC.

         1.3   Our Chief Crown Prosecutor, Dru Sharpling, has asked that she be given an
                indication of the likely time-scale for consideration of the papers by the 17th
               March 1997.

         1.4   On the 13th March 1997 I held a full days conference with Chief
                Superintendent Lowe and DC Greenaway of South Yorkshire Police at their
               offices in Sheffield. I was able to view original video tapes exhibited to the
               Taylor Enquiry and to the Coroner’s Hearing. I had access to the transcripts
               of those hearings and original witness statements.

2        BACKGROUND

        2.1    A copy of the Background Note concerning the Hillsborough Disaster and
               prepared for the then Attorney General in 1990 is attached (Appendix 1). It
               sets out the facts of the incident together with a precis of the CPS decision
               prior to the conclusion of the Coroner’s Hearings.

        2.2    The CPS Central Casework Briefing Note of 29th January 1997 (author Peter
                Pearson) gives the detail of the events up to that date (Appendix 2).

3        ALLEGATIONS

         3.1   The HFSG letter enclosed a further letter and a draft statement from Mr.
                Trevor Hicks, the opinion of Alun Jones QC and their Annexes A to G
                (comprising 7 volumes and 3 video tapes).
                                      •

         3.2   The Director has been asked to examine the material and the key issues which
                are said to be involved, that is, fresh evidence proving suppression of
                evidence, Perjury and a Conspiracy to Pervert the Course of Justice in the
MMS/150.97
               legal process following the disaster.

         3.3   Mr. Hicks states that he has viewed certain video material provided to him
               from Yorkshire Television Archives (which had been supplied by South
               Yorkshire Police originally). He says that the videos clearly show that the
               scoreboard camera (No. 5) was working so that it could pan, tilt, zoom and
               show a picture clear enough to identify individuals. The clarity of the image
               was more than satisfactory and showed that therefore P.C.s Ryan and Bichard
               perjured themselves when giving evidence at the inquiry and inquest.

         3.4   He believes that the editor of the ‘Compilation Video’ shown to the Jury must
               have known of the existence of the extensive footage from Camera 5, and that
               this footage was not produced despite several requests from the Jury. This
               was the suppression of critical evidence that would have totally changed the
               Jury’s view of what the police could see.

         3.5   The Opinion of Alun Jones QC sets out the skeleton argument presented at the
               Divisional Court in 1993 at the application for Judicial Review of the Inquest
               Verdicts. The relevant points for the purpose of my report are those at 2.1
               and 2.2 concerning the 15.15 evidential cut-off point and exclusion of
               evidence that was said to indicate the later time at which many of the victims
               died.

         3.6   The Divisional Court rejected all the grounds put forward (and in fact stated
               that the overwhelming burden of evidence was that there was no prolongation
               of life beyond the period of about 10 minutes from the occurrence of the
               injury which led to asphyxia, and that there was clear evidence that bodily
               functions may continue and give a semblance of life when the prior occurrence
               of brain death renders the existence of life unlikely, if not impossible).

         3.7   However the Opinion states that the HFSG have a deep conviction that the
               legal system failed them and that they have been deceived about the
               circumstances of the deaths.

         3.8   Attached to it is the affidavit of a Roger Houldsworth, the engineer who
               repaired and maintained the football ground’s camera equipment on the day.
               His evidence is that Camera 5 specifically gave clear pictures of the Leppings
               Lane Terraces where the deaths occurred. If this evidence is correct then it
               is said that the video tapes and Houldsworth’s evidence were deliberately
               suppressed and that officers therefore committed perjury (concerning the use
               which they could make of pictures from Camera 5). The point is made that
               Camera 5 pictures were visible on the police monitor between 14.30 and
               15.00 (although no video recording of them was taken).

         3.9   Alun Jones describes a video shown to him that depicts very badly duplicated
               and blurred pictures of individuals escaping from the stricken pens shortly
               after 15.00, and in which it is not possible to identify individuals. He has
               been told that this is the tape that was shown to the Jury. I agree with him
MMS/150.97
                that it appears to be a copy at several generations removed from the original
                video tape (Exhibit TB/2 to the Taylor Enquiry), but one that presents only
                the events after 15.00.

         3.10   He says that a central issue at the inquest would be whether or not the police
                could and did notice the pressure on the Leppings Lane pens before 15.00.
                The evidence from the police (including P.C.s Ryan and Bichard) was that
                none of them noticed problems in the pens until 15.00. He believes that the
                existence of the evidence would have been of crucial significance to both the
                Divisional Court and the Inquest Jury.

         3.11   The Opinion then considers the evidence of a Dr. Walker which came to light
                in February 1997. The Doctor’s letter of the 8th February and the 13th
                February 1997 state that he was voluntarily involved in resuscitation efforts
                of many of the Hillsborough victims who arrived at the Northern General
                Hospital. He says that the boy Philip Hammond was the first victim to arrive
                at the hospital and the first one that he attempted to resuscitate. He goes on
                to query of a senior hospital consultant why he was not contacted by the West
                Midlands Police to provide an official statement nor asked to appear at the
                Inquest. He states that in his statement (of 1989) he said that Philip had sinus
                rhythm and cardiac output which was at odds with the evidence given by a
                Dr. Slater to the Inquest. This undated statement describes the arrival of the
                first child in cardio-respiratory standstill and the instigation of routine cardio­
                pulmonary resuscitation. He continues that as far as he could recall sinus
                rhythm and (unidentified word) output were established at one stage although
                the boy’s pupils were fixed and dilated throughout. He believes that the boy
                has since died. He then gives detail of a second child arriving, also in a state
                of cardio-pulmonary arrest. Similar measures were carried out and this child
                was also brought back into sinus rhythm with a good output, though again
                with fixed dilated pupils throughout and subsequent death. This statement
                does not give patient names.

        3.12 Alun Jones says that Dr. Walker’s statement shows serious criticisms of the
             reaction to the disaster, and that other victims were alive. Dr. Walker was
             asked by a consultant, Mr. Wardrope, to stand by to make a statement to the
             West Midlands Police. Dr. Walker was not called at the Inquest. Counsel
             considers that it would be difficult to exaggerate the significance of the
             concealment of Dr. Walker’s evidence which especially disagrees with that of
             Dr. Slater (where the evidence discloses the same pattern of rapid
             unconsciousness of victims leading to rapid death).

         3.13 The conclusion of the Opinion is that these new pieces of evidence call for a
              full Police Enquiry or Public Enquiry, that Exhibit Tapes should be secured
              and subjected to Forensic Analysis and witnesses must be identified.

4        VIDEO EVIDENCE

         4.1    The allegations are of Perjury by P.C.s Ryan and Bichard who were attending
MMS/150.97
               to the radio communications and camera monitors, of a Perverting the Course
               of Justice by way of suppression of vital video evidence of the crushing in the
               Leppings Lane Terraces and of Houldsworth’s evidence.

         4.2   P.C. Bichard’s evidence to the Taylor enquiry details the problems that had
               occurred with Camera 5 (the camera which gave the best view of the terraces)
               involving a loss of picture due to an electrical fault. He said that on the day
               the quality of the picture had improved but was still not up to the mark. He
               agreed that control facilities, for example, zoom, were fully available, but that
               because of the cameras position and angle of view there was a false
               impression created of the crowd and a difficulty in assessing overcrowding.
               It was said that the camera was not used as much as it normally would be
               because of these substandard pictures. There was some discussion about the
               accidental knocking of the video recorder control so that a particular recording
               ended earlier than it should have done. He told the Coroner that his
               recollection was that camera 5 was not really being used, just left in position.
               He first realised that there was anything untoward when people were seen
               climbing over the fence, but thought it was a pitch invasion. It would not
               have been sound judgement to make a decision on overcrowding based on the
               monitor. Because of what had been happening on Leppings Lane he did not
               get the chance to view the terraces until after 15.00

         4.3   P.C. Ryan’s evidence to the enquiry was similar to that of his colleague. The
               (monitor) picture was said to be very distorted and Houldsworth had worked
               on the equipment for some considerable time. As far as the officer recalled
               the picture was never satisfactory and it was its quality that was the problem.


        4.4    P.S. Goddard, another officer in the control box, said in evidence that it was
               not possible to tell that the pens were full from the control box. Nothing
               unusual was seen until people were seen climbing over the pens fence at about
               15.00

        4.5    Roger Houldsworth 1989 statement includes his perception of the crowd at
               Leppings Lane turnstiles seen from club CCTV end room monitors of the
               views taken from both the club and the police camera systems. He describes
               the pressure building up at the outside gates and turnstiles, the initial opening
               of Gate C and later the radio conversations regarding the likelihood of persons
               dying if a gate is not then opened. He saw the gate opened and a huge
               number of fans flooding in. Believing that a dangerous situation was being
               created he went down to the pitch. As the match was being stopped by the
               referee, he believed that a pitch invasion was in progress. It was not for two
               or three minutes before he surmised the correct situation that of crashing.

         4.6   His 1996 rebuttals of the police evidence concerning Camera 5 are:-

               •       Having checked Camera 5 and repaired the electrical fault it was
                       working correctly.
MMS/150.97
                •     He would have shown Ryan and Goddard that the cameras were
                      working correctly.

                •     The quality of Camera 5’s picture was never a problem (although he
                      admits that there was ‘flaring’ or whiteout of the picture).

                •     When watching the view from the police cameras he could clearly see
                      that the pens were full to the point of over-crowding when the order
                      was given to open the gates.

                •     Camera 5 was working perfectly.

               •      Facial features can be identified from the Camera 5 pictures except
                      while events are happening.

               •      P.C. Bichard’s assessment of camera angle and crowd density does not
                      make sense.

               •      He disagrees that it was difficult to assess that the pens were getting
                      over-crowded.

               •      It is highly unlikely that P.C. Bichard could have knocked the video
                      buttons and impossible that a switch could be flicked as claimed.

               •      Houldsworth makes further comments on police evidence concerning
                      their qperation of other cameras in the system.

        4.7    There is no evidence to support the allegation that video evidence has been
               suppressed, only the belief of Mr. Hicks as to what was seen by the Jury.

5        REVIEW OF VIDEO EVIDENCE

         5.1   I have viewed the Taylor Enquiry Exhibits TB/1 and TB/2 and the Coroner’s
                Exhibit C 539.

         5.2   The latter is a large part of Exhibit TB/2, Part 4 which is a recording from
               Camera 5 between 15.03 and 15.25 of the front of the pens on the Leppings
               Lane Terraces. There are two original master copies of C 539 (taken from
               master copy of TB/2) and while they are reasonably clear the position and
               angle in my opinion makes any assessment of over-crowding to be difficult if
               not impossible. If the camera had been panned or its width of view increased
               then more might have been seen in those crucial minutes after 15.03.

         5.3   As TB/1 and 2 were available to the Taylor Enquiry, it cannot be said that
               they were suppressed. All of the enquiry exhibits were known to the legal
               teams involved in the inquest. I am satisfied that while TB/1 and 2 were not
               themselves shown to the Jury, the ‘compilation video’ and C 539 video were.
               The compilation included elements of both TB/1 and 2 tapes as well as the
MMS/150.97
               more colourful and harrowing media film.

         5.4   C 539 covers most of the Camera 5 footage between 15.03 and 15.25 and was
               shown to the Jury during the evidence of P.S. Killoch. A copy of the relevant
               part of the Inquest Transcript is attached (Appendix 3). However it can be
               seen that the officer makes a mistake when he describes the Exhibit as having
               the original identification of TB/1. My viewing confirms that it comes from
               the Exhibit TB/2 and agrees with the relevant schedule (Appendix 4).

         5.5   The video evidence has not been suppressed and I am satisfied that Alun
               Jones’ instructions about a poor quality copy of C 539 being shown to the
               Jury are incorrect. No mention is made in the transcript of any failing in that
               video, and the original copy held by the police is of a satisfactory quality.

         5.6   The HFSG case therefore depends on the perception of the value of any
               Camera 5 pictures whether seen on the monitor or as recorded by video
               taping. Houldsworth has one point of view based on his observations of all
               the monitors seen in the club CCTV room). His evidence in 1996 is that he
               could clearly see that the pens were full to overcrowding when the gate was
               opened leading to the fatal crushing. In 1989 his evidence is not so precise,
               only that a dangerous situation was developing. Here he says that it was not
               for two to three minutes after going down onto the pitch and viewing the pens
               that he realised there was not a pitch invasion. His later evidence is therefore
               at variance with his perceptions in 1989 and may well have been contaminated
               by later events.

         5.7   The HFSG would say that the control room police officers must have realised
               that crushing in the pens would occur just after 15.00 because there was a
               monitor able to show the camera view of those pens. Because this evidence
               of the ‘police view’ was deliberately not shown to the Jury then there was a
               Perverting of the Course of Justice and the Jury and Divisional Court would
               have come to a different verdict if it had been shown.

         5.8   My conclusion is that as the Jury did see Exhibit C 539 tape then they were
               able to assess what the police officers perceptions were said to be as against
               the Camera 5 pictures. There is no evidence to rebut the police account that
               they were concerned with a serious incident at the turnstiles and disregarded
               what they thought of as poor quality pictures from Camera 5. The Jury were
               able to compare the police account and the relevant video pictures and still
               come to a verdict of Accidental Death.

         5.9   I consider that the new allegations made concerning videos and what the
               officers must or should have perceived is not supported by evidence of
               sufficient quality to even pass the civil standard of proof.

6        MEDICAL EVIDENCE

         6.1   While any application by the HFSG for a re-opening of the Inquest based on
MMS/150.97
               new Medical Evidence is within the province of the Home Office rather than
               the Crown Prosecution Service, Alun Jones QC does allege at paragraph 11
               of his Opinion that Dr. Walker’s evidence was concealed. In which case there
               must be a consideration of any evidence going towards the offence of
               perverting the course of justice. It is said that very serious questions arise as
               to the process by which evidence was selected by the West Midlands Police
               who assisted the Coroner. Alun Jones considered that one of the most striking
               aspects of the history of the case was the way in which the evidence presented
               at the Inquest was evidence which tended to exculpate the South Yorkshire
               authorities and the police from blame. The intimation must be of a conspiracy
               to pervert the course of justice between at the very least the two police forces.
               Following the conclusions of the Divisional Court in the Judicial Review of
               the Coroner’s Hearings it would be difficult for further allegations to be made
               against the Coroner without sufficient supporting evidence. That only leaves
               the two police forces as possible offenders.

         6.2   Dr. Walker’s evidence which is contained within Annex ‘F ’ of the HFSG
               papers has been described previously In essence he is saying that
               Hillsborough victims arrived at the Hospital, where he had volunteered to do
               emergency duty, in a state of cardiac and respiratory arrest. Because the
               hearts of a number of these persons were re-started, although they
               subsequently died, the intimation must be that for the purposes of the Inquest,
               death occurred after 15.15.

         6.3   The question for me to consider is whether or not the alleged omission in
               taking a statement from him was done with the intent to suppress that evidence
               because it would have embarrassed the police and/or led to a different verdict
               from the Jury.

7       REVIEW OF MEDICAL EVIDENCE

        7.1    The Judicial Review of the Medical Evidence found that Drs. Gumpert and
               Slater and Professor Usher were as one in that once a victim’s chest was fixed
               (when crushing occurs) then irrecoverable brain damage will ensue in 4- 6
               minutes. It was submitted before the Divisional Court that the Coroner
               wrongly refused to call evidence of the two doctors because that evidence fell
               after the cut-off point. This evidence also concerned alleged signs of life in
               victims after 15.15. The court stated that this other evidence would not have
               made the slightest difference to the result if it had been given at the Inquest.
               They commented on the plain and virtually unchallenged evidence of the
               pathologist. That new evidence would not have caused the Coroner to change
               his cut-off point. There was clear evidence that bodily functions may continue
               and may give a semblance of life when the prior occurrence of brain death
               renders the existence of life unlikely if not impossible.

         7.2   The court held that the inquisition was correctly completed and that there was
               no good reason for ordering a new inquest or for merely quashing the existing
               verdicts. The purpose of fresh inquests was queried. If it was to get a verdict

                   criticising the police, then such criticism had already been firmly levelled by
                   the Taylor Report. The police had admitted fault and paid compensation.
                   Further there was no evidence to justify criticism of the emergency services.
                   The words of Turner J at page 42 of the Court Transcript shows the detail in
                   which the Coroner led evidence that might have persuaded pathologists to
                   form different conclusions from those expressed at the preliminary inquests.

             7.3   I do not consider that Dr. Walker’s observations as made in his personal
                    statement of 1989 and the letters of 1997 comprise such vital new evidence as
                   to show that the life of Philip Hammond continued after the cut off period of
                    15.15.

            7.4    Dr. Walker contends that he was not asked to make a statement by the police
                   (whether it be the West Midlands or West Yorkshire Police as he states in two
                   different letters). However the police file which I have seen contains Dr.
                   Walker’s manuscript statement of the 20th July 1989 as obtained by the West
                   Midlands Police. Each page is signed by him and witnessed by two other
                   persons. It is somewhat different to his undated personal statement which is
                   said to have been made in 1989. In the police statement he says that he
                   attended to the first casualty to arrive, a boy he knows only as "Lee", and
                   who he believed was declared brain dead in the Intensive Care Unit two days
                   later. The patient was in cardio-pulmonary arrest with fixed dilated pupils.
                   The heart had stopped beating but the medical team managed to re-establish
                   normal rhythm. While the boy was being treated the second victim arrived
                   also in cardio-pulmonary arrest. This boy was also established in a normal
                   sinus heart rhythm but again the pupils were fixed and dilated throughout and
                   it is believed that the boy has since died. The description given by Dr.
                   Walker of this second boy fits that of the victim Philip Hammond.

            7.5    The Doctor’s evidence concerning these first two victims shows that both
                   arrived without signs of life apparent. Although a normal heart rhythm was
                   established it could not be sustained and the two boys eventually died. I
                   understand that Lee’s bodily functions were maintained for two days as he was
                   to be an organ donor.

            7.6    However, the Doctor’s letter of 8/2/97 to Mr. Wardrope says that Philip
                   Hammond was the first victim that he attempted to resuscitate and that
                   recollection is presumably based on the undated 1989 personal statement.
                   Here he describes the establishment of sinus rhythum and cardiac output in the
                   first two victims he treated (no names are given) and that both had fixed and
                   dilated pupils throughout and subsequently were believed to have died. The
                   HFSGT Annex F concerning his evidence is attached at Appendix 5. This
                   includes the part of Mr. Wardropes evidence that applies to Philip Hammond
                   where his interpretation of the Medical Notes is that a cardiac tracing at the
                   time showed no cardiac activity, and a typed copy of Dr.Walker’s police
                   statement.



    MMS/150.97
         7.7   P.C. Taylor was at the football ground and gave evidence that he approached
               a youth who was identified as Philip Hammond who was laid on the ground
               and appeared to be unconscious. He took the boy to an ambulance and
               attempted to revive him with the assistance of others. Heart massage was
               performed and they were able to re-start the heart and feel a pulse. However
               it is said by the officer that later at the hospital the doctor could not detect
               signs of life after 20 minutes of attempted resuscitation.

         7.8   Having reviewed the papers, I again considered that there has been no
               suppression of evidence by the police or others. Dr. Walker’s statement does
               little to advance the proposition that a proper cut off point for the Inquest
               would be later than 15.15. The Pathological evidence is still overwhelming
               and fully supports the Coroner’s original decision as to that cut-off.

        7.9    Consideration should be given to allowing either Dr.Slater or Professor Usher
               to comment on what Dr. Walker is now saying.

8       RECOMMENDATIONS

        8.1    There are no grounds for the Crown Prosecution Service to recommend to the
               Home Office that there should be further investigation of criminal allegations
               against the police or others.

        8.2    Alun Jones has requested a meeting with a senior lawyer of the CPS to allow
               him to expand upon his advice. I note that the CCP’s initial re-action is to
               refuse based on the fact that there are only powers to invite the police to
               investigate the matter further. I appreciate the difficulties which the HFSG
               has where the allegations of criminal conduct are made against the two police
               forces involved in the Hillsborough investigation. My overall view is that no
               new material evidence has been put before us. It would be politic to explain
               any reasons for our decision to the HFSG or at least to their legal
               representatives. However perhaps this should be done through the offices of
               the Police Policy Directorate at the Home Office.

    1.    ISSUE

    1.1   What action should this Department take in the light of the
          transmission of the Hillsborough drama/documentary on the
          5 December 1996, and subsequent correspondence.

    2.    ACTION REQUIRED

    2.1   Present position to be established with the South Yorkshire
          Police and all other interested parties.

    2.2   A response is required to an enquiry raised by David Alton
          MP on behalf of the Hillsborough Family Support Group.

    3.    TIMING

    3.1   Response to David Alton is required by   31 January 1997

    4.    BACKGROUND

    4.1   The Hillsborough Disaster was and       still  remains  an
          unparalleled occurrence of our time and led not only to a
          fundamental re-appraisal  of safety at public events, but
          has since resulted in precedents being set in the Civil
          Courts as to what might constitute post traumatic stress.

    4.2   For a detailed understanding of what then followed the
          original background note prepared for the then Attorney
          General together with its accompanying annexes remains
          valid. (Appendix I)

    4.3   At the conclusion of the re-commenced inquest verdicts of
          accidental death were returned on all the victims.

    4.4   The proceedings at the Coroner's Court were challenged by
          way of Judicial Review. The Divisional Court however found
          nothing upon which they felt that they could question the
          actions of that Court.

    4.5   On Thursday 5 December 1996 the independent television
          network screened a drama/documentary based on the disaster
          written and produced by one Jimmy McGovern.

    4.6   The screening of this programme and in particular certain
          parts of its content has resulted in eight of the deceased
          families writing both to this Department and in some cases
          to either the Home Secretary, the Attorney General or both
          asking that both the original inquest be set aside and that
          a new criminal investigation be commenced in the light of
          the new evidence disclosed in the programme. In addition it
          would appear that the Hillsborough Family Support Group has
          also written to every member of Parliament generally, and
          in particular to David Alton MP. who has forwarded a copy
          of the same to the Director.
39I1/97
4.7     On the 17 December 1 996 the Home Secretary was required to
        respond in the House to an Adjournment Debate specifically
        on this matter. A transcript of what then took place is
        attached. (Appendix II)

4.8     Following on from this debate the Home Secretary wrote to
        the Chief Constable for South Yorkshire Police asking him
        to express a view on certain issues that have been raised
        by the programme and requesting answers to 10 specific
        questions. A copy of this letter has been obtained via LSLO
        and is attached. (Appendix III)

4.9     A copy of the programme has been obtained and this has been
        viewed by this office. Contact has also been established
        with the South Yorkshire Police Officers who are dealing
        with this matter and they have been invited to attend these
        offices during the week commencing 27 January 1997, so that
        we can be briefed as to what the current position is.

5.    KEY   CONSIDERATIONS

5.1   The three   crucial    questions that   fall   to   be   considered
      a r e :-

5.1.1       Has any "new" evidence come to light arising from the
             screening of the TV programme ?

5.1.2       Does this evidence support the view that one or more
            Police Officers may have committed perjury    at the
            Coroners Court; and

5.1.3       Is there now sufficient doubt for the Attorney General
             to be asked once more to consider exercising his
            powers under Section 13 of the Coroners Act 1988 to
             require a fresh inquest to be held.

6.      RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1     At present this Department has insufficient evidence upon
        which any substantive decision can be made.

6.2     Once the Chief Constable has reported to the Home Secretary
        it is recommended that a meeting is held between this
        Department, the Home Office and the LSLO (as LSLO propose)
        so that it can be established, 1) whether or not a further
        enquiry is to commence and if so 2) in what form and 3) to
        agree how any further enquiries either from the HFSG,
        relatives of the deceased or the media generally will be
        handled so as to avoid any possibility of confusion between
        us.

6.3     A detailed reply either to David Alton MP or the families
        would therefore seem inappropriate at this stage. It is
        therefore recommended that any present response draws upon
        both the existing letter that has been sent previously by
        the Law Officers on behalf of the Attorney General, a copy
        of which is attached,(Appendix IV) together with their
        amended version created in the light of the additional
points that have been made in the HFSG circular,    sight of
which is awaited.

CONCLUSION

That until such time that this Department       is satisfied
whether a further criminal investigation is     justified or
not, that no action is taken from which         it could be
misconstrued that this Department either has   or intends to
re-open the Hillsborough Enquiry.

       The Chief Constable proposes to prepare his response to the Home Office by 31
       January 1997 and then send it to the Home Office. He is likely to advise the Home
       Office that the programme contained no new material.

4.9   We have an understanding with LSLO that CPS would not ask for enquiries at this
      stage. Once the Home Office have the police response, LSLO would like a tripartite
      meeting at officials level to consider a co-ordinated way forward.

4.10 The screening of this programme and in particular certain parts of its content has
      resulted in eight of the deceased families writing both to this Department and in some
      cases to either the Home Secretary, the Attorney General or both asking that both the
      original inquest be set aside and that a new criminal investigation be commenced in
     the light of the new evidence disclosed in the programme. In addition it would appear
     that the Hillsborough Family Support Group has also written to every member of
     Parliament generally, and in particular to David Alton MP. who has forwarded a
     copy of the same to the Director.

4.11 The Attorney General has also received a copy of the same letter from David Alton
      MP. Furthermore, a letter in the same terms has been forwarded to him by Dennis
      Skinner MP.

4.12 LSLO has advised Private Office that their reply to David Alton MP will also respond
     to his letter to the Director.

5.    KEY CONSIDERATIONS

5.1   The three crucial questions that fall to be considered are:-

5.2   Has any "new" evidence come to light arising from the screening of the TV
      programme ?

5.3   Does this evidence support the view that one or more Police Officers may have
      committed perjury at the Coroners Court or otherwise attempted to obstruct the
      course of justice; and

5.4   Is there now sufficient doubt for the Attorney General to be asked once more to
       consider exercising his powers under Section 13 of the Coroners Act 1988 to require
       a fresh inquest to be held.

6.    RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1   At present this Department has insufficient evidence upon which any substantive
      decision can be made.

6.2   Once the Chief Constable has reported to the Home Secretary it is recommended that
       a meeting is held between this Department, the Home Office and the LSLO (as LSLO
      propose) so that it can be established, 1) whether or not a further enquiry is to
      commence and if so 2) in what form and 3) to agree how any further enquiries either
      from the HFSG, relatives of the deceased or the media generally will be handled so
      as to avoid any possibility of confusion between us.

6.3   Since the Attorney General’s response to David Alton MP will be on behalf of both
      himself and the Director, the Director need not now reply to the MP (Draft at
      Appendix IV)

6.4   Subject to any instructions to the contrary, Prosecutions Branch 3, Central Casework,
      York, will respond to the private correspondence in terms similar to the Attorney
      General’s letter.

6.5   If any further MPs correspondence is received on this point, it should first be
       established whether LSLO have likewise received a letter and consequently who
       should respond.

7.    CONCLUSION

7.1   That until such time that this Department is satisfied whether a further criminal
       investigation is justified or not, that no action is taken from which it could be
       misconstrued that this Department either has or intends to re-open the Hillsborough
       Enquiry.

1       ISSUE

         1.1    To consider the expanded report prepared by Mr. Croston following his
                 further review of material supplied by the Hillsborough Family Support Group
                 (HFSG) and their recent correspondence.

2       ACTION REQUIRED

        2.1     Response to the HSFG re allegations of criminal misconduct by the Police.

        2.2     The above response to be co-ordinated with that of the LSLO and the Home
                 Office.

3       TIMINGS

        3.1     A preliminary indication of our views has been given to the Police Policy
                Directorate at the Home Office in the latter part of last month, to the effect
                that we had not found any new evidence as alleged by the HFSG.

        3.2     The HSFG had been told that while a full response could not be given within
                 14 days, the matter was receiving our immediate consideration.

4       BACKGROUND

        4.1     For those unfamiliar with the Hillsborough disaster or requiring the refreshing
                 of their memory, the background note prepared for the Attorney General in
                 1990 is attached at Appendix 1. It sets out the facts of the incident together
                with a precis of the CPS decision prior to the conclusion of the Coroner’s
                Hearings.

        4.2     The CPS Central Casework briefing note of the 29th January 1997 (author
                Peter Pearson) gives the detail of events up to that day. See Appendix 2.

        4.3     The latest correspondence relevant to this review is contained within the
                report.

        4.4     Peter Pearson’s briefing note of 3rd April 1997 (Appendix 3) is still relevant.

5       KEY CONSIDERATIONS

         5.1    There are 3 crucial questions that need to be considered.

                5.1.1          Has any ‘new’ evidence come to light arising from the
                               screening of the TV programme?

              5.1.2         Does this evidence support the view that one or more police
                            officers may have committed perjury at the Coroner’s Court?

              5.1.3         Is there now sufficient doubt for the Attorney General to once
                             more be asked to consider exercising his powers under Section
                             13 Of the Coroner’s Act 1988 to require a fresh inquest to be
                             held or other form of enquiry.

6       RECOMMENDATIONS

        6.1   That Mr. Croston’s recommendation, namely that there are no grounds for
              asking the police to re-open the investigation, be accepted.

        6.2   That the CPS write to the HFSG informing them of our decision on the
              criminal aspects.

        6.3   That in accordance with earlier requests by Stephen Wooler at LSLO, the CPS
              response should be co-ordinated with those of LSLO and Home Office.

        6.4   That other than for a public relations exercise, no useful purpose would be
              served by CPS representatives meeting the HFSG or their counsel.

        6.5   Whilst it may be useful, having regard to continuing concerns for public
              officials to meet the HFSG to explain the decision, since the Home Office
              have already had at least one meeting with them it would be appropriate, in
              order to avoid any possible risk of giving conflicting signals, for any further
              meetings to take place under the auspices of the Home Office.

7       CONCLUSIONS

        7.1   There is no new evidence as alleged by the HFSG and their legal
              representatives.

        7.2   There are no grounds for re-opening the police investigation into the
              Hillsborough Disaster.




GEORGE R. CROSTON
Principal Crown Prosecutor
7th May 1997




MMS/247.97
1.    ISSUE

1.1   What action should this Department take in the light of the
      transmission of the Hillsborough drama/documentary on the
      5 December 1996, and subsequent correspondence.

2.    ACTION REQUIRED

2.1   Present position to be established with the South Yorkshire
      Police and all other interested parties.

2.2   A response is required to an enquiry raised by David Alton
      MP on behalf of the Hillsborough Family Support Group.

3.    TIMING

3.1   Response to David Alton is required by   31 January 1997

4.    BACKGROUND

4.1   The Hillsborough Disaster, was and still       remains  an
      unparalleled occurrence of our time and led not only to a
      fundamental re-appraisal  of safety at public events, but
      has since resulted in precedents being set in the Civil
      Courts as to what might constitute post traumatic stress.

4.2   For a detailed understanding of what then followed the
      original background note prepared for the then Attorney
      General together with its accompanying annexes remains
      valid. (Appendix I)

4.3   At the conclusion of the re-commenced inquest verdicts of
      accidental death were returned on all the victims.

4.4   The proceedings at the Coroner's Court were challenged by
      way of Judicial Review. The Divisional Court however found
      nothing upon which they felt that they could question the
      actions of that Court.

4.5   On Thursday 5 December 1996 the independent television
      network screened a drama/documentary based on the disaster
      written and produced by one Jimmy McGovern.

4.6   The screening of this programme and in particular certain
      parts of its content has resulted in eight of the deceased
      families writing both to this Department and in some cases
      to either the Home Secretary, the Attorney General or both
      asking that both the original inquest be set aside and that
      a new criminal investigation be commenced in the light of
      the new evidence disclosed in the programme. In addition it
      would appear that the Hillsborough Family Support Group has
      also written to every member of Parliament generally, and
      in particular to David Alton MP. who has forwarded a copy
      of the same to the Director.
4.7     On the 17 December 1996 the Home Secretary was required to
        respond in the House to an Adjournment Debate specifically
        on this matter. A transcript of what then took place is
        attached. (Appendix II)

4.8     Following on from this debate the Home Secretary wrote to
        the Chief Constable for South Yorkshire Police asking him
        to express a view on certain issues that have been raised
        by the programme and requesting answers to 10 specific
        questions. A copy of this letter has been obtained via LSLO
        and is attached. (Appendix III)

4.9     A copy of the programme has been obtained and this has been
        viewed by this office. Contact has also been established
        with the South Yorkshire Police Officers who are dealing
        with this matter and they have been invited to attend these
        offices during the week commencing 27 January 1997, so that
        we can be briefed as to what the current position is.

5.    KEY   CONSIDERATIONS

5.1   The three   crucial    questions that   fall   to   be   considered
       a r e :-

5.1.1       Has any "new" evidence come to light arising from the
             screening of the TV programme ?

5.1.2       Does this evidence support the view that one or more
             Police Officers may have committed perjury at the
            Coroners Court; and

5.1.3       Is there now sufficient doubt for the Attorney General
             to be asked once more to consider exercising his
            powers under Section 13 of the Coroners Act 1988 to
             require a fresh inquest to be held.

6.      RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1     At present this Department has insufficient evidence upon
        which any substantive decision can be made.

6.2     Once the Chief Constable has reported to the Home Secretary
        it is recommended that a meeting is held between this
        Department, the Home Office and the LSLO (as LSLO propose)
        so that it can be established, 1) whether or not a further
        enquiry is to commence and if so 2) in what form and 3) to
        agree how any further enquiries either from the HFSG,
        relatives of the deceased or the media generally will be
        handled so as to avoid any possibility of confusion between
        us.

6.3     A detailed reply either to David Alton MP or the families
        would therefore seem inappropriate at this stage. It is
        therefore recommended that any present response draws upon
        both the existing letter that has been sent previously by
        the Law Officers on behalf of the Attorney General, a copy
        of which is attached,(Appendix IV) together with their
        amended version created in the light of the additional
      points that have been made in the HFSG circular,    sight of
      which is awaited.

7.    CONCLUSION

7.1   That until such time    that this Department   is satisfied
      whether a further criminal investigation is    justified or
      not, that no action    is taken from which     it could   be
      misconstrued that this Department either has   or intends to
      re-open the Hillsborough Enquiry.
                             HILLSBOROUGH

ISSUE

1.1     To consider briefing note and minute prepared by Mr. Croston following his
        review of material supplied by the Hillsborough Family Support Group and
        their recent correspondence.

ACTION REQUIRED

2.1     Response to Hillsborough Family Support Group in co-ordination with LSLO
        and Home Office.

TIMING

3.1     The HFSG will be expecting a response about the 8th April.

BACKGROUND

4.1     This is detailed in Mr. Croston’s minutes.

KEY CONSIDERATIONS

5.1     These are set out in Mr. Croston’s briefing note. In responding the HFSG,
        the CPS have 3 options.

        5.1.1         If it is now concluded that there are grounds for believing that
                      criminal offences may have been committed, to ask the police
                      to re-open their enquiries;

        5.1.2         If it is concluded that there is no fresh evidence to cast doubt
                      upon the original decision, to decline to take the matter further;

        5.1.3         Before making any final decision as to 5.1.1 or 5.1.2 above, to
                      take up the request of HSFG to see their counsel Alun Jones,
                      QC and representatives so that they can explain their reasoning
                      personally in more detail.

RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1     That Mr. Croston’s recommendation, namely that there are no grounds for the
        CPS asking the police to re-open the criminal investigation, be accepted.

6.2   That the CPS should write to HFSG informing them of our decision on the
      criminal aspects.

6.3   That in accordance with earlier requests by Stephen Wooller at LSLO, the
      CPS response should be co-ordinated with those of LSLO and Home Office.

6.4   That other than for a public relations exercise, no useful purpose will be
               served by CPS representatives meeting HFSG or their counsel.

         6.5   Whilst it may be useful, having regard to continuing concerns, for public
               officials to meet HFSG to explain the decision, since the Home Office have
               already had at least one meeting with them it would be appropriate, in order
               to avoid any possible risk of giving conflicting signals, for any further
               meetings to take place under the auspices of the Home Office.

7       CONCLUSIONS

        7.1    The following observations are pertinent to points made by HFSG:

               7.1.1          The use of the BBC film in preference to the police film at the
                              enquiry was presumably because it gave a better impression of
                              what had been happening. This, of course, gives some
                              credence to police claims of not appreciating the disaster
                              unfolding albeit that the BBC reporters did. The police
                              monitors did not give as clear a picture (metaphorically) as the
                              BBC’s. There is nothing sinister in not using the police
                              footage if the purpose was to show what actually happened
                              rather than what the police could see was happening.

               7.1.2          Having regard to the article on new video evidence in the
                              Yorkshire Evening Post of 1st April 1997, I am satisfied that
                              the "new" video mentioned in the Daily Mirror and other
                              papers in the last few days was the one recently considered by
                              CPS, LSLO and Home Office; it therefore contains nothing
                              new.

               7.1.3          As pointed out by Mr. Croston, the current recollection of so
                              called new witnesses differs from that in 1989.         Their
                              credibility would thus be destroyed under cross-examination.

        7.2    Finally, for the sake of completeness, I should add that having regard to the
               recently reported signs of recovery by one of the victims said to be in a
               persistent vegetative state, the HFSG could be expected to renew with
               increased vigour their criticism of the Coroner’s decision to impose a 3.15 pm
               cut off. Whilst we have some sympathy with their concerns, they have not
               produced any expert evidence to cast doubt on the conclusions of the
               pathologists at the inquest and whilst it may be argued that it raises questions
               which the Coroner by his decision excluded, that is a matter for the LSLO.
               It does not affect any criminal liability.

1.    ISSUE

1.1   Hillsborough

2.    ACTION REQUIRED


2.1   In order to prepare handling arrangements for the publication of Lord Justice Stuart-
       Smith’s report, George Croston is to review the report and advise the Director on the
       following points:-

              •      what the Home Secretary can properly say about the Director’s
                     decision (that the material presented to her prior to the scrutiny would
                     not justify fresh proceedings):

              •      whether there is any part of the report which would cause us concern
                     if it was published;

              •      the extent to which the material which the judge has considered can or
                      should be put into the public domain;

              •      whether there is anything in the report that may give rise to
                     suggestions that there ought to be further police enquiries regarding the
                     amending of police officers’ (or other persons’) statements;

              •      whether the state of the terracing requires further enquiry;

              •      the extent to which the report discloses new information not previously
                      considered that may reflect on the potential criminal liability of the
                      football club.
2.2   The Home Secretary’s letter of the 9 February 1998 addressed to the Attorney
      General (and copied to the Director) asks for his views on certain points concerning
      issues involving the Director. I have been requested to advise on these points as
      follows:

             •      whether advice considered by the Director in 1990 and 1997 as to the
                    evidence needed to support criminal proceedings, could be placed in
                    the Library at the House and therefore be in the public domain;

             •      whether or not the Director agrees that having considered the
                    conclusions of the report, and on the basis of the material it contains,
                    there is no basis that would justify fresh criminal proceedings;

             •      whether anything in the process by which police officers submitted
                    statements to the Taylor Inquiry might amount to misconduct of a
                    criminal or disciplinary nature, and thus require the instigation of a
                    police investigation;

             •      whether the new information concerning the condition of the terraces
                    and the overestimation of the crowd capacity would have affected the
                    conclusions of the Taylor Inquiry and by inference the Director’s
                    original decision not to prosecute any person;

3.    TIMING

3.1   A public announcement will be made by the Home Secretary on the 18 February
      1998.

3.2   This advice is required as soon as possible.

4.    BACKGROUND

4.1   Following the submission of the Central Casework review note to her, the Director
      wrote to the Attorney General on the 9 May 1997 advising that there was no new
      evidence and no grounds for re-opening the police enquiry. That review, dated the
      8 May 1997, should be read in conjunction with this briefing note as it gives more
      comprehensive details of the allegations and evidence that were examined.

4.2   On the 13 May 1997 the AttorneyGeneral endorsed theDirector’s view.

4.3   After consultation with the Director and the Law Officers, the Home Secretary
      announced his independent scrutiny on the 30 June 1997.
CPS co-operated fully with Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s enquiry. His enquiry has seen:

        •     the schedule of documents considered by the CPS in this case;

        •     the opinions of counsel;

       •      George Croston’s recent review note, leading to the Director’s decision
              on the 9 May 1997.

Chapter 1 of the report covers the background to the disaster in detail.

KEY CONSIDERATIONS

The scrutiny terms of reference appertaining to the CPS were "To ascertain whether
any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough Stadium on 15 April
1989 which was not available to the Director of Public Prosecutions ... for the
purpose of discharging ...(her)... statutory responsibilities ... and to draw to (her)
attention any evidence not previously considered by (her) which may be relevant to
(her) ... duties".

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith was also to consider the existence of evidence in relation
to police disciplinary matters.

For the purposes of the scrutiny he received evidence both orally and in written form
from relatives of the victims, members of the public, police officers and others (for
a full list see Appendix 1 to the report). He examined the papers from Lord Taylor’s
Inquiry and most of those from the Inquests. He looked at the body files and
submissions from the counsel for the Hillsborough Family Support Group (HFSG)
and members. He considered all the above evidence whether previously available or
not. ‘Previously available’was defined as being within the public domain or known
to the legal advisers of the parties or families. He read the joint opinion of counsel
( of the 6 August 1990) who advised the DPP that the police investigation had not
changed the findings of the Taylor Inquiry. The report does not mention that the CPS
review note of 1997 was taken into consideration or indeed read.


The report’s covering letter, which was addressed to the Home Secretary, says that
the report was written with publication in mind following the Minister’s stated
intention to publish the evidence considered during the scrutiny. Lord Justice Stuart-
Smith gives categories of that evidence which he does not think should be disclosed.
It includes:

       •      Reports from Drs Bums and West (relates solely to the death of one
              particular person).
       •      Report of N.Bume (copyright problem involving privileged material
              although his oral evidence is in the public domain).
       •      Details of consultations as listed at paragraph 6 of Appendix 1,
              including the Coroner.
       •      Transcripts of private discussions with relatives of the deceased.
The report consisted of seven chapters and ten appendices. The key points from each
chapter will be considered in order.

Chapter 1: BACKGROUND: Paragraphs 25 and 26 of the report state that counsel
for the HFSG only invited a recommendation (as to criminal prosecution) in the case
of Duckenfield and Murray, who were the two main senior officers on the day. The
Judge opined that the fresh evidence would have to be of sufficient significance that
in considering it there would be a real possibility that the DPP might change her mind
and institute proceedings for manslaughter, or any other offence, against one or both
of the officers. At paragraph 56 it was said that any prosecution of an individual
police officer would have to establish his individual responsibility. It would not be
enough to prove the composite failure of the police operation.

Chapter 2: VIDEO EVIDENCE: The Judge found that there was considerable
confiision and misunderstanding about the video evidence of the disaster. All four
police video tapes (including the one that was supposedly missing) were made
available in their entirety to the Taylor Inquiry and to the Coroner. There was no
evidence for the suggestion that the theft of two video tapes from the club’s Control
Room was part of a police ‘cover-up’. Submissions to him by counsel for the HFSG
were:

        •     Police evidence that their failure to see overcrowding in the pens was
              due to a defective camera was deliberately false.
        •     Evidence from video tapes was deliberately suppressed and concealed
              by the police because it would have revealed the above falsity.
        •     The Coroner failed properly to pursue the question of the ‘missing
              footage’.
        •     PCs Bichard and Ryan, and PS Goddard deliberately gave false
              evidence about camera 5 not working properly.
        •     The evidence of Mr Houldsworth, the club CCTV technician, that the
              pens were overcrowded, was deliberately withheld from the jury.



He says that if the first two submissions are made out they might affect the verdict
of accidental death and the decision of the DPP not to prosecute for manslaughter.The
third submission is a grave allegation against the Coroner which could also affect the
verdict. On the fourth submission consideration would have to be given to prosecuting
the officers concerned. The fifth shows a further criticism of the police failure to
appreciate a dangerous situation. His brief findings on each point are shown below:

5.7.1         Submission 1 is quite untenable.

5.7.2         As submission 1 is misconceived, number 2 must fail also. There
              never was any disappearance or concealment of video footage from
              camera 5. The allegation is completely unfounded.

5.7.3         Submission 3 is unfounded as there was no missing footage.
       5.7.4          The evidence on submission 4 is wholly insufficient to warrant
                      consideration of criminal proceedings against any police officers.

       5.7.5          Mr Houldsworth’s evidence is rejected. His explanation as to why it
                      was only in 1996 that he realised his evidence was important is not
                      convincing. What he now says is inconsistent with what he said
                      before.The importance of his evidence has been exaggerated out of all
                      proportion.

5.8    Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s final comments on the video evidence is that there is
       nothing in the submissions that calls for any further inquiry or consideration by the
       prosecuting or disciplinary authorities.

5.9    Chapter 3: MEDICAL EVIDENCE: The Judge said that the Coroner’s reasoning has
       been widely misunderstood and misinterpreted. In considering the question of how
       someone died it is not usually relevant to consider matters subsequent to the infliction
       of injuries which obviously result in death. There was no new intervening cause
       which might break the chain of causation between the crushing injuries and death.
       The Coroner did not say that all those who died did so before 3.15. The cut-off time
       was necessarily imposed to to keep the Inquiry within reasonable bounds. It is
       difficult to see the relevance of further evidence that a person was alive at 3.15pm
       but died subsequently.

5.10   The scrutiny considered the evidence of Dr Walker among others. It was suggested
       by counsel that the medical conclusions and assumptions made by the Coroner as to
       the cut-off time were false, and that on an application for judicial review it would be
       open to the Divisional Court to hold that the (inquest) verdicts had been procured by
       fraud, suppression of evidence or insufficiency of inquiry. Further that the non­
       presentation of Dr Walker’s evidence (like that of Mr Houldsworth) could amount to
       fraudulent concealment.

5.11   Lord Justice Stuart-Smith found all the submissions on the medical evidence to be
       unfounded. The relevant part of his reasoning was that the evidence of Dr Walker and
       others added nothing to that given at the Inquest. The suggestion that the evidence
       now put before him was deliberately suppressed and concealed and those concerned
       acted in bad faith, was in his opinion wholly irresponsible.

5.12   Chapter 4: ALLEGED IMPROPER INTERFERENCE WITH WITNESSES: These
       allegations were not made to the CPS in the HFSG letter of 4 March 1997 or at any
       other time, except by way of a general remark that "one of the most striking aspects
       of this history is the way in which the evidence presented to the Inquest was evidence
       that tended to exculpate the South Yorkshire Authorities and the police from blame.
       Very serious questions arise as to the process by which evidence was selected by the
       West Midlands Police who assisted the Coroner". The allegations were either of
       pressure being brought by police officers to bear on witnesses in order to prevent
       certain evidence being put before the jury, or of the way in which South Yorkshire
       Police obtained evidence about the disaster from their own officers (specifically the
       amendments made to their witness statements).
5.13   The Divisional Court did not find it necessary to investigate the allegation concerning
       the police putting improper pressure on civilian witnesses. The scrutiny did look into
       this matter in great detail. The first conclusion was that the suggestion that police
       officers brought pressure to bear on witnesses as part of a biased and incomplete
       investigation was clearly untenable. Secondly, that for the most part the suggestions
       made by the solicitors (acting for the police) for amendments were not open to
       criticism. In a few cases it would have been preferable if a deletion had not been
       made. At worst it was an error of judgement, it was not unprofessional conduct. Any
       amendments made by the police themselves were unexceptionable. The Judge is quite
       satisfied that the exclusion of comments (in the statements) could not possibly have
       affected the DPP. The allegation of irregularity and malpractice is not substantiated.

5.14   Chapter 5: OTHER MATTERS OF CONCERN: Families of some of the victims
       raised concerns about alleged inconsistency in police evidence, failure to disclose
       documents, and police bias. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith was not able to resolve all the
       concerns about conflicts in evidence. However he would be surprised if the criticisms
       about families being unable to obtain copies of relevant documents were true. He saw
       no reason to differ from Lord Taylor’s conclusion as to the impartiality of the West
       Midlands investigation.

5.15   Chapter 6: MISCELLANEOUS: The state of the ground: New evidence was heard
       from Mr N.Bume, a structural engineer who advised on the safety and structural
       aspects of the Hillsborough ground in 1990. It had not been available at the time of
       the Taylor Inquiry and he was not called to give evidence at the Inquest. In October
       1990 Mr Bume gave evidence before a High Court judge in the contribution
       proceedings (when the apportionment of liability was decided as between the police,
       the Club and others). However these proceedings were settled before his evidence was
       complete or could be tested in cross-examination. His report criticised, among other
       things, the inadequate number of turnstiles, the lack of a control system for
       monitoring numbers in each pen, the overestimation of overall capacity on the
       Leppings Lane Terraces, inadequate emergency signing, and the inadequate standard
       of crush barriers. There were said to be many breaches of the advice and
       recommendations contained in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds. The scrutiny
       found that all but two of the criticisms were fully considered by the Taylor Inquiry.
       These were the height of the crush barriers which were too low, and the overall
       capacity of the terrace which was overestimated. The conclusion was that these
       matters did not give grounds for re-opening the Judicial Inquiry or any other
       proceedings. The Judge considered that had Lord Taylor known about them he might
       have criticised the Club, their consultant engineers, and those responsible for the
       licensing of the ground in more stringent terms than he did. He did not consider that
       the central conclusion of the Inquiry would have been changed, in that the primary
       cause of the disaster was a failure of police control. However, if the responsibility
       of the other parties was somewhat greater than had earlier been appreciated, that
       might have a bearing on any reconsideration of criminal proceedings against officers.
5.16   Chapter 7: SUMMARY: Lord Justice Stuart-Smith does not consider that there is any
       material that should be put before the DPP or Police Complaints Authority which
       might cause them to reconsider the decisions they have already taken. There is no
       occasion for any further investigation into the circumstances in which alterations were
       made to some of the self written statements of South Yorkshire officers.

5.17   The conclusions from the scrutiny report mirror the relevant comments from my
       review.Indeed the Judge’s observations on the allegations and submissions put to him
       on behalf of the HFSG are often more stinging than mine.

6.     RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1    The recommendations on the points requiring action in paragraph 2.1 above are:

       6.1.1 The Director’s decision: The Home Secretary stated to Parliament on the 30
             June 1997 that the Director of Public Prosecutions takes the view that the
             material so far presented to her would not justify fresh criminal proceedings.
             My review of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s scrutiny report is that he comes to
             the conclusion that, having heard fresh evidence, there is nothing that should
             be put before the Director to cause a reconsideration of previous decisions.

              Therefore I recommend that the Director can quite properly say that the report
              does not change her stated view.

       6.1.2 Publication of the report: I have read the report a number of times and am
             unable to find any point of evidence or conclusion which is adverse, unfairly
             or otherwise, to the CPS. While there is a quote from counsels’ joint opinion
             of 1990, and therefore strictly speaking privileged, the way in which the quote
             and comment are used is supportive of our decision making process in the
             case.

              I recommend that no objection be taken.

       6.1.3 Material for the public domain: Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s covering letter to
             the Home Secretary said that the Minister’s stated intention was to publish the
             evidence which was considered during the scrutiny. That letter makes certain
             recommendations to the Minister about specific categories of evidence and
             which do not involve the CPS. By inference it could be said that other
             material, for example, the 1990 joint opinion of two leading counsel, should
             be put into the public domain by being deposited in the House Libraries. This
             opinion was read by the Judge who commented favourably on it. He did not
             say that he considered in any way whatsoever the 1997 report to the Director
             from myself. Neither of the two reports could be classed as evidence, fresh
             or otherwise. They are legally privileged or subject to Public Interest
             Immunity and not normally subject to disclosure unless previously in the
             public domain or where that privilege or immunity is waived. Neither have
             been disclosed publicly. The basic rule is that reasons for prosecuting
             decisions are given in only the most general terms. The view is normally
             taken that the public discussion of a decision not to prosecute could amount
       a trial of a suspect, in this case certain police officers and others, without the
        safeguards which criminal proceedings are designed to provide. The Judge’s
       comments on our decision in 1990 should be sufficient for the interests of
       justice to be served. Similarly, the above reasons should also apply to the
        1997 review.

       I recommend that it is not in the interests of justice for the disclosure of the
       two advices.

6.1.4 Further police inquiries re amended statements: The report conclusions are
      that there was no improper pressure put on witnesses and that a small part of
      the amendment procedure involved at worst an error of judgement on the part
      of solicitors. As we have not seen the evidence available to the scrutiny we
      have no reason to consider going behind the conclusions made.

       I recommend that there should be no further action on this point.

6.1.5 Further inquiries re the terracing: Paragraph 5.1.4 above covers Lord Justice
      Stuart-Smith’s opinion that the new and valid evidence concerning the crush
      barriers and terrace capacity would not have affected the central conclusion
      of the Inquiry. He might have made stronger comments about the Club and
      others. This new evidence was extremely relevant to civil liability claims and
      was before the High Court for those proceedings. It must be right that when
      the scrutiny report is published a more fair apportionment of blame can be
      acknowledged. My assessment of the comment that the appreciation of a
      greater responsibility of other parties might have a bearing on any
      reconsideration of criminal proceedings against officers is that if there had
      been a decision to prosecute it would have been affected by the new and
      mitigating evidence.

       I recommend that no further action is required as to any more inquiries.

6.1.6 Potential criminal liability of the Club: I can find nothing in the report which
      can be seen as a suggestion that the new evidence goes towards criminal rather
      than merely civil liability. The Judge considers that ther are no grounds for
      reopening the Judicial Inquiry or any other proceedings.

       I recommend that no action should be taken by us on the new evidence now
       seen.

The recommendations on the points requiring action in paragraph 2.2 above are in
accordance with what I have already said:

6.2.1 Disclosure of our advices into the public domain should be resisted, not least
      on the ground of ‘candour’.

6.2.2 There is no basis for the instigation of criminal proceedings against police or
      others or for any further investigation into allegations of purported criminal
      liability.
CONCLUSION

There have been        detailed and comprehensive investigations of the grave
circumstances that lead up to the disastrous consequences in the Hillsborough
Stadium. It should now be considered that UK judicial procedures have been fully
explored and satisfactorily exhausted for the purposes of the CPS. I have no doubt,
based on my dealings with the HFSG, that the matter will not end here.

There are a number of matters contained in the Home Secretary’s letter of the 9
February 1998 which do not fall within the CPS remit and I have therefore expressed
no view. They concern any applications to the High Court for a new inquest and the
role of a Coroner following an inquiry into a major disaster.

A draft letter is being prepared in case it is required for a response to the Attorney
General based on the Home Secretary’s letter.

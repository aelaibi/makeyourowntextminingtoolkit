 than        I had expected.                                             By 2 , 2 0pm the             crowd outside           the    turnstile         had

 become                very heavy                                and     customers                  were       coming       in hot and bothered and

 very       3. r , g r y             ,                I was        beginning               to be s u bjected to a lot of verbal                        abuse

 people were                                   coming              m     saying            people are          dying      out here.

 I could see that                                            the         crowd was            heavy outside           but     I     couldn't    see how

 many         or what                                 was    going            on.

  in without                              tickets.                     There was             nothing         I could do        I could not send tht

  back,            there was                                only one way to go.                            Others     came        in and jumped over

  the      t u r nqate without                                           showing           their         tickets.         On about 7 or 8 occasio?

see due             to the density                    of the         crowd.           The    one on the      inside      1    can say

was     still             there         up until          2.30pm.           They were          still     trying    to    check

 people             and do their job                   but they             had no chance          because     they were

 were        very d i s t r e s s e d and that something                                 had gone      seriously wrong              but

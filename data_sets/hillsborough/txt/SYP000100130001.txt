    Back of North Stand packed with men urinating against the wall when shouted

    at by myself, carried on regardless.                            At this time my attention was drawn to

    back of      turnstiles          for North Stand where                 Police Constables           from my serial

    had come through the turnstiles.                       Entrance gates          'A' were shaking violently.

    Fans    coming        through turnstiles drunk and hostile shouting                               'THEY'RE GETTING

    KILLED OUT THERE,               THERE'S GOING TO BE ANOTHER HEYSELS,' and screaming for

    gate 'A' to be opened.

    Gate    'A' opened and crowd surged                        forward     through      the   gate.      The    gate was

    closed again only seconds later.

    Back on turnstile duty only a few Liverpool                                 fans coming through suddenly a

    crowd appears at main gates to turnstiles which are closed.                                        Only people now

    attempting           to   get    in   are     very     drunk      Liverpool         fans.    Turnstiles       closed

    scuffling breaking out between Liverpool fans and in one occasion a drunken

    Liverpool fan lashed out at a Mounted Officer with a broken bottle. Suddenly

    Special      Inspector beckons wildly at m e .                       I ran to gates          'B' where I saw an

    obviously dead boy being put                   in an ambulance, passed a near naked dead man

    at    gate     'B'    and   into      the   area       between       gate    'B'    and     the    tunnel   for   the

    terraces.        In this area approximately 10 dead people were strewn about.

    I    checked     these      to    ensure    they       were     dead    then    assisted      with    the    injured

    people some of who were also lying in this area.                                    I then,       after seeing the

    arrival of ambulance crews,                   ran through the tunnel to the terraces where I

    was met by a wall of Liverpool fans, looking over them I could see the pitch

    had been invaded,               people around me in the tunnel began moaning,                           I assisted

    to    escort     these      people      out     of     the      tunnel      where    if     they    were    injured,

    directed ambulance crews to them.

    Myself and Police Constable 809 carried the body of a young fair haired boy

    in a Liverpool shirt and light trousers in the lane running adjacent to the

River Don, we then went onto the pitch.

People were being carried away but no bodies were on the pitch.

Attention      called     for    Leppings Lane     terraces    where      Liverpool    fans     were

attacking another Liverpool fan               who they say was picking up belongings from

the terraces and putting them in              his pocket.

Called by another officer            to go       to Leppings    Lane.     On the way assist to

remove    bodies      from back of terrace         tunnel to lane running adjacent            to the

River    Don   then    form     cordon   helping   fans   to   leave    ground,   stream of urine

running down from North Stand like a waterfall.

Fans leaving ground violent and asking if the match is off.

Ambulances convey bodies away.

Liverpool fans leave, then instructed to go to North Stand for de-brief.

Throughout these events I felt nothing, I just helped where I could.

It seemed as though nobody really knew what to do but help with the dead and

inj ured.

I have worked at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club on numerous occasions and

usually have policed the same turnstiles without any trouble.

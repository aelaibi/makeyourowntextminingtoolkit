( 14 3 5) .     I cl i m b e d        up a n d        stood       on t o p        of    the    barrier           to        start     some       of

the    la                       igi ng .

I i^jot                          JLhe t e a m s        were       announced             over       the     tannoy.           I could           not

get    do                        th e      barrier          where       I had          been    bef o r e ,       because            there

were      too m a n y          people       pressed          up a g a i n s t          the    barrier.           I got           down     by

pushing         people          forward          and    sliding             down       to    stand with             my      b ack a g a i n s t

the    barrier.            All     the      time       I was          holding          onto    the        dividing           fen ce.

The    crowd ar ou n d             me      were       being       pushed          towards          the     dividing              fence and

forwards,            this       caused       my       feet       to    le a v e    the       ground.          I hung         onto       the

dividing         fence          and     I ended         up a l m o s t           parallel          to     p e o p l e ’s s h o u l d e r s .         I

c a n ’t s a y w h a t          time       it was       because             of    the       position          I was         in    I could

not    see      the       pitch a nd         I didn't             know       if th e         game       had    kicked            off.

I had       noticed            that     there         was    the       usual       sway       of     the      crowd         forward,           but

no    backward            movement          the       crowd       had m o v e d         forward           quite        a    1 ong    way.

People        t hat       had    been       behind          me    sh ot      past       me.    I was          hanging            onto     the

dividing         fe n c e , which            s t o p p e d me          shooting             forwards          like         everyone        alse,

when      the    forward           pressure            eased          off    I was          able     to     pull       myself        back

down.

I turned         around          and       saw a       lad w h o        was                         Va o a f i n s t       the    barrier

b e h i n d me,       he w a s        sort       of    s 1umped         over       the       barrier          but      was       being

supported            by    the     crowd,         if    there          h a d n ’t b e e n a n y           crowd        he    would

have      fallen          to    the     ground.

I could         see       the    lads       face,       it was           like a         pale       b lue      colour         and     his

lips      were       a distinct             blue.

                                                                                                                       There        was

another         lad s t o o d         by me       I d o n ’t k n o w w h o              he    is,       with     his        help we

managed         to    get       underneath             the       barrier,          push       people          b a c k as         most     of

the    surge         had       finished,          and       get       the    lad,       who    had        turned           blue     away

from      the    barrier.             As    we    pulled          him awa y            I noticed           his      body was            limp,

his    eyes      were          open and          there       was       no m o v e m e n t .        Together            we    got     him

              out       through       the     tq/frye W 7 a s      s o o n as     we    got     out      of    the    t u n n e 1 we        laid

                                             while       I undid        his     tight    clothing.             Then     whilst         the       other

               lad      did mo ut h        to m o u t h    resuscitation               I did       cardiac

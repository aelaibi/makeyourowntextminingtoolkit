 I LOOKED AFTER ONE LAD WHO WAS VERY DISTRESSED HE WAS ABOUT 2QYRS, DARK,

 HAIR.      SOME   FANS THEN CAME UP WITH A HOARDING AND TOOK HIM UP TO AN

 AMBULANCE AT      THE FORREST E N D K S P I O N K O P .        I THEN JOINED THESE FANS

 CARRYING BODIES FROM LEPPINGS l \               TQ THE ENTRANCE TO THE GYM.           WE TOOK

 THREE TO THE AMBULANCE AND ONE TO THE STAND, THEN I WENT TO BITS.

 OR THE INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 THE PERIMETER FENCES CAUSED PEOPLE TO BE CRUSHED, THE SEGREGATING FENCES

 WOULD NOT ALLCWNTHE CROWD TO SPREAD                OUT AND AVOID THE CRUSH.          POLICE

 WERE SLOW IN G I V I N G X J R ^ AID.

 NO

 G53

DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 A     WAS SO OBVIOUS WHAT WAS HAPPENING BUT VERY LITTLE WAS BEING DONE.

THE POLICE SHOULD OF S E E K WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND HELPED THE INJURED

RATHER THAN KEEP PEOPLE O F F ^ k g J p i T C H .   THERE WERE SOME GOOD OFFICERS

AT THE LEPPINGS LN END, WORKING HARD BUT THE OTHERS LACKED LEADERSHIP.

NO MEDICAL EQUIPMENT NOT ENOUGH TRAINED STAFF.              PEOPLE COULD HAVE BEEN

 INFORMED EARLIER.

           I am a sirrrile man and live at the above address with my mother                     On

           Saturday 15th April          1989 (150489),      I went to Hi 1 lsborougJf Football

             iund for the Liverpool v Nottingham ForestJFA Cup Semi Final.

                              We trave 1 lea to Sheffield by car
               z:
           We are all Liverpool §^fpporters and I got my ticket from Anfield.

           I am a season t i j ^ k e t holder and paid £6.00 for the Leppj^J^s^Ln

           standing area.

           On the way to Sheffield the only place we stopped was at a small

           caravan on the A59 which was selling hamburgerj

           We were subjected to travel delays on the^?T63 near to Stockport and on

           the M&E7 on the way to Sheffield.
                                                                       PAGE       2

I saw a few Liverpool supporters drinking cans of beer in other

vehicles.

We got to Sheffield at about 1415 hours and I parked our car somewhere

off the Penistone Rd North.

On arriving at Sheffield and making our way towards the ground,         I saw

a lot of Police Officers but they weren't giving any directions and we

d i dn ’t need them as we were j^Silowing the crowds towards the grouj

We got to the Leppings J/Tentrance to the ground at about 143x hours

and there wasn't any'organised queues at the turnstiles,             a ^fffa'ss

of peop-^ewaiting to get into the ground^/
    ~ />                              JC  mcsitxrV <A
I s^tw about five Police Officers on/norseback trying to direct the

crowd but they were not sueceecting very well.      I didn’t see any

Stewards outside the ground.

Once I got to the turnstile area I saw a letter 8 above the turnstiles

so I knew it was the turnstiles     I had to queue to gain entry.

I joined the back of the mass of people just inside the perimeter

gates, after about three or four minutes I realised I wasn't going to

get through the turnstiles as the crush was bad and the wall to the

left of the turnstiles didn’t look too safe.       At this time I realised

I had to get out of this crush it was getting bad and it didn’t feel

saf e .

I couldn't turn around so I had to walk backwards and I pushed a

couple of people out of the way to get out of J J r fe crush.
                                                        Qsfcs C.
I saw a Police Officer trying to close a r ^ n t r a n c e gate with another

man about twenty yards from the turnst i 1 e ent ranee.    I hel pg^'them

close the >^ate and then I   went to the right hand side of the mass of

peo pi e<

At this time the re was a lot of people actually in Leppings Ln.          The

feeling of the crowd was of frustration they were beginning to shout

at the Police on horseback to do something you could sense the danger,
                                                                        PAGE     3

the crowd of people who had come out of the main mass queuing to the

Leppings Ln turnstiles including myself were shouting at the Police to

do something about the situation which in my opinion had become

dangerous«

Then a Policeman with a grey moustache on horseback went into the

crowd to try and force some room but his colleagues on horseback

didn't go to assist him, when he went in he made a little room but it

was soon swallowed up by the crowd swarming around him*/           n
                                                                C «=ninj
I looked alongside the right of the turnstiles anj^saw an exit gate     I

opening a few people began to walk in and I followed in behind them,
                                            Urppufias Ln.
there were two or three Police officej^s just outside the gate telling

the people walking through the oparff e;:it gate not to rush but to take

their time,       they didn't ask to look at anyones ticket, they were just

letting them walk in.
                       Cj2n-+)Cl<£i
I didn't give up my ticket w h i c h ^ still have (number L.L1 941).      I

walked through the gate and towards a tunnel there were no-one to give

any direction and this was the only entrance I could see,         I looked

down the tunnel and I could see a piece of the pitch,         I got to the

mouth of the tunnel,       I waited for my friends I'd seen my friends c o m e

through the same gate as what I had come in and we had brief

conversation and one of my friends had his shoelace, there had been

quite a few supporters enter at this time in a continuous f><fw but

              walking in an orderly manner they all walked/towards the



    then went down the tunnel ourselves and three quarters of the way

down the tunnel we stopped waiting to queue up until we got onto the

te r rac in g .

We got to the bottom of the tunnel and went to thg/right, the crowd

was really packed at this time we        decided it hasn't the place to be

so I tried to make my way to the right, my friends and I were split

up at this p o i n W they were pushed forward,            I could feel a contini^us
                      c
surge from p i e          back and was being pushed forward,       it was about /£.55 pm

and I         wjtfs pushed forward towards a barrier,      the pressure was bad but

there was nothing I could do you just had to go wherever the crowd let

you.
                                                                      <431 pG<>r>OLi jtn c e
Three or four minutes later I looked up^affid saw the gatej^at the front

of the pen open and two or three ygafng lads got pushed o truant o the

pitch ar^a cinder t rack, they were then pushed back                    by Police

Of f ij z S e r s .

At this stage this gate at the front was continually being pushed

open,       people were shouting to let them out, eventually the gate got

opened and people were t r y f n g to make for it. I got pushed onto,
                       /
young lad about 20 ye^fs ~ 22 years of a g e , fair haired sho    straight

hair wearing a b e p g e        top, he looked- healthy with a fre s p r :omp 1exion,

his back was against a crush p 4 r r i e r ,       the pressure was getting worse

by now and I saw two of my^friends                           and                  go

through the gate and onto the cinder track, other people got out and

then the gate was closed.

At this stage I couldn’t move at all I could feel intense pressure,                         r

the lad in front, his face was in absolute agony he was trying to

scream but he couldn't his face had turned red*it was obvious he was

in a bad w a y , I felt the crash barrier b & t f i n      to give way slowly the

lad in front of me, his back sea* to bend at 90 degrees,                  1 then went
                             C fc,(cuer\ bame/
forward with the barrier breaking,               I don't know what happened to this

lad, he just di sappear e<

Next thing I knew I was fairly close to the fence,                  I don't know if I

was standing up or leaning but I had hold of the fence,                  I thought then

I was close to the gate and I was safe I expected to be dragged out at

any mi nute, but notbody was movi ng 1 looked over to the gate and I saw

it was open again and people were being dragged out by the Police,                      one

          lad was stuck    in the gate he was trapped by his legs, he was

          stoutly built    about 28 - 30 years, his shirt had been ripped from him,

          he was still alive.

          Around me at this time I saw an ambulance pull up, it was still very

          compact and I couldn’t move I was having problems getting my breath

          and staying level headed I can't remember, anymore screaming and a lad

          grabbed my throat, he was down by m y j f e g s ,   I looked down     and I saw

          was below me,    I couldn't say if h>r was lying down,

                          fir was aged aboya 22 wearing a whi teyshi rt, he Kad short

          mousey cur      hai r, I just /ouldn’t do anything ^ T o r hi m.

                                                                               I had ho 1d of

      ^       f e n c e ' ancj feared if I let it go I could fall myself.       Next thing I
    ?I•


          knew I was trying to keep his hand up by biting his finger, he then

          stopped calling, his hand left my throat I assumed he had died.

          I looked around I could see people with their mouths open and the eyes

          closed, their bottom lips also seemed to be turning blue.                 I was

          thinking     to myself I was going to die, “Is this      what it was       like at

          Heysel". I was concent rating on breathing as by now it             was   getting

          very very difficult.      I then saw a Policeman put this fingers through

          the fence and try to     grab a lads mouth in order      to free his       tongue,

          his face     was against the fence but his body was      further back with

^         other people trapped underneath him.        The Policeman tried to slap his

          face and 1 tried to punch to bring him back to life I grabbed his hair

          and shook his head, he was lifeless        I thought he was dead.           By now my

          hands had come off the fence and I just didn't care the majority of

          people around me looked dead.       I don't know how long I was there I

          shut my eyes and concentrated on breathing I was then aware of a

          policeman walking on my head and shoulders in order to get to people

          at the back of me.     Eventually the pressure seem to ease gradually

          and I gained feeling of my leg. I felt it was jammed against the crash

          barrier.

               A Police officer grabbed a hold of my hand I said to the Police

               officer to grab hold of the boy next to me, his mouth was open, his

               eyes rolling, he was just about alive, the Police officer pulled him
~v>ca          out I would describe this boy as aged around 18 - 20 dark hair, slim,

               I can't remember what he was wearing.         I was still about a yard away

               from the open gate and I looked around, the pressure had eased

               slightly I saw a young boy aged 13 - 14 years up against the fence his

               hand was imbeded in the fence,        I grabbed his hand and there were all

               sorts of criss cross marks in his hand, there didn't seem to be any

               life in him.      I presumed he was dead,    I would describe him aged 13 -~14

               5*6 tall dark hair slim build wearing a blue top.          I placed his hand

               in front of the gate and began to wave it, a Policeman saw it and

               grabbed a hold of his hand and pulled him out.
A - —
% J c +>       I then looked around again and realised there wasn't any one else I

        S'*'-an-'-rs-" could help, everyone seemed either dead or unconscious.   I felt very

(f^            tired I waved my hand towards the gate a Policeman took hold of it and

               pulled me towards the gate,       I took two steps forward and it seemed I

               was    walking on bodies.       I was then lifted out onto the cinder track

               where m y    legs gave way,   I was   then carried onto   the pitch andlaid

               down by the right hand side of the six yard box.          At this time my

               breathing was still difficult I was gasping for breath,           I was gulping

               for air in short breaths 1 was in extreme pain across my chest and my

               keys had been embedded into my legs, also my left ankle was swollen
               and had two indentations in it where it had been trapped by the

               bar r ier.

               Two    Policemen who had carried me to where I was        lying asked me if 1

               was    "OK" I said,    "Yes" I knew I was safe now.

               A Police officer then undid my shirt and put me in the recovery

               position.      I was lying there reflecting on how lucky I was,       I broke

               down in tears seeing the next two people lying beside me with Police

officer banging on their chests attempting to revive them.          I then

closed my eyes I didn't want to see anymore.

I was lying there for sometime when two lads (Liverpool supporters)

came up to me and they were carrying a makeshift stretcher an

advertising board, they tried to roll me onto it but I told them I was

alright and go and help someone     esle.

Someone else came a short while later and picked me up and told me to

try and walk.   I walked to the centre of the pitch where my legs gave

way again, then my breathing was still as bad,       I was then lying near

the centre of the pitch, where it wasn't two crowded.         I could see a

line of Police officers along the half way line.

I lay down on my back trying to get myself together when two lads came

up to me picked me up and helped me walk a bit, we walked towards the

South Stand when I saw                Iand               they were alright

and came up to me and said to the lads,      its alright we'll   look after

him now.   I remember sitting on    the side of the South Stand and        a

Nottingham Forest supporter who     said he was a Policeman offered        us a

drink of orange squash.     By now my breathing was beginning to improve.

I had been out of    the crush about 15 - 20 minutes.      I was sitting on

the cinder track with my back to     the wall   I was still crying.    I sat

there for ages and about 4.30 pm to 4.45 pm (1630 - 1645) we left the

ground with         and       on our own accord and walked back to the

car.

1 would also like to add, why wasn't Liverpool given the Spion Hop end

of the ground as per ratio of supporters,       I thought the ticket

allocation was unfair.     When the gates was opened to let the

supporters into the Leppings Ln terrace was there a break down of

communications between the Police o u t s i d ^ a n d inside the ground.

I felt the Police    monitoring the terracing with Close circut

television should    have real is    ow packed pens three and four were
                                                                              PAGE      S
                                                                              £>1607

         and done something about it prior to the kick off.

         If only someone had of told us not to go down the tunnel when we come

         into the ground because we would have gone anyway we were directed it

         would of possibly averted this disaster.       Also once the disaster had

         occurred the emergency did their very best I wouldn't criticize the

         Police for dragging fans out they did their very best to he 1 p 7 they

         could see the pain on peoples faces and must have felt really

         helpless.    They couldn’t give any assistance because of the fence

         around the pitch.

         This fencing around the pitch should in my opinion be removed and

         replaced by stewards and Police Officers.

         Also I think that pens within the terracing should also be removed 1

         think the tragedy at Hillsborough would have been averted if the

        crowds had been allowed to sprea^. out towards the sides.

        Finally I went to, Whiston H^^pital, Whiston a t 9 am (09Q       ) on Sunday

         16th April LTO9 (160489 k where I received treatment for my ches;

         injury ami ankle/tnjury■       The Doctor X-rayed my chest and tj*ey said it

         was OK with >fust a bit of bruising and my ankle was OK.

         I have been off work since' May 1st because of the trauma of

         Hillsborough.

 THE FRONT FENCE AS IF TO PREVENT A PITCH INVASION.           THIS IS WHAT I

 THINK THEY THOUGHT WAS HAPPENING.         AS I LEFT THEf'GROUND I SAW POLICE

 WALKING TO THE GROUND WHO APPARENTLY DID^XT KNOW WHAT HAD HAPPENED.

       APPEARED THAT THERE WAS A C O M P L E T E LACK OF COMMUNICATION.

THERE DIDN’T SEEM TO BE ANY ORGANISATION AT A L L , IT SEEMED TO LEFT TO THE

FANS TO ACT ON THEIR OWN INITIATIVE.          THE POLICE WERE SLOW TO REACT &

A NUMBER BEGAN TO HELP BUT THEY D I D N ’T HAVE ANY LgMfERSHIP & AGAIN ACTED

ON THEIR OWN INITI TATIVE.         I ONLY SAW ONE AM^#tANCE IN ATTENDANCE, THfci

BEING TOTALLY INADEQUATE FOR THE NUMBER OF CASUALTIES IN NEED OF HELP.                          x

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?                                        /

 THE BASIC CAUSE,      I   FEEL, WAS THE DISORGANISATION/OF THE FANS OUTSIDE THE

 GROUND.     I   WAS STOOD BY THE LARGE GATES FOR 1/4 \qUARTER) HOUR WITH NOTHING

 HAPPENING & THE CRUSH THERE GOT STEADILY WORSE THROUGHOUT, AS MORE

 FANS ARRIVED. THE OPENING OF GATE B SOLVED THE PROBLEM OUTSIDE THE GROUND

 BUT DUE TO LACK OF COMMUNICATION THE FANS WERE NOT SHOWED TO GO

 ROUND THE STAND & THEY WENT THROUGH THE CENTRE TUNNEL CAUSING THE PROBLEM.

 I    HAVE TO SAY THAT I WAS STOOD DIRECTLY BENEATH /HE POLICE BOX & IT WAS CLEAR

 TO ME AT FIVE TO THREE (1455) THE CENTRE AREA WAS OVERCROWDED AND PEOPLE

 DO W U    HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDEI^T WA:

 HANDLED, AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 I WAS AMAZED THE AUTHORITIES WERE UNAWARE OF THE CROWD/NG & CRUSHINGJCN

 THE PENS, GIVEN THE GROUND HAS CCTV & WITH THE LARGE/ AMOUNT OF POLICE
                                                                            t^a/u ■
 PRESENT AT THE GAME.

 I THINK THE POLICE THOUGHT INITIALLY THERE WAS CROWD TROUBLE; BUT EVEN

 WHEN THEY DID REALISE,    IT WAS THE FANS IN THE MAIN WHO WERE ASSISTING     fHE

 DEAD & THE INJURED.     MOST OF THE POLICE WERE STOOD IN A LINE! ACROSS THE

 PITCH.

 I N H E R E ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD Wl/ICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I FEEL THE CROWD SHOULD HAVE BEEN DISTRIBUTED MORE EVENLY IN THE LEPPINGS

 LANE LOWER TERRACES.     I ALSO THINK THAT THE SEPARATING FENCES IN THE

 TERRACES ADDED TO THE CRUSH.     NO RELEASE OF PRESSURE.

                                                     $0T COMPARABLE WITH LAST

 YEARS.   LAST YEAR WE WERE STOPPED AND OUR TICKET ''CHECKED BEFORE THE TURNSTILE,

 WE ALSO WERE SEARCHED AND HADE TO FORM QUEUES TO/GET IN.           I ALSO NOTED THAT

 LAST YEAR THERE WAS POLICE AND STEWARDS IN THE /NNER COURT YARD,WHICH WERE
                                                                           PAGE    9

                                                          /
 MISSING THIS YEAR.   I ALSO WISH NOT TO PLACE ALL THE STLAME ON THE POLICE,

 SOME OF IT NEEDS TO BE PLACED WITH THE F .A .   THEY WERE COMPLAINED TO LAST

 YEAR BECAUSE THERE WAS CRUSHING AND THE TICKET ALLOCATION WAS FAR TOO SMALL

 FOR THE NUMBER OF LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS AND THEY AJLLOWED THE SAME THING TO

 HAPPEN THIS YEAR.

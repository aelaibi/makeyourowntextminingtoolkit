Dear Sirs,

Hillsborough, April 15th 1989

I am writing to record my experiences and observations on the above, from the
point of view of a spectator in the North Stand.


The journey across to Sheffield turned out to be a difficult one.         The traffic
hold-up at the Stockport end of the M63 delayed us for 20/30 minutes, which
might have been longer if I had not taken a diversion to avoid thenext section
of the jam.    It was clear that there were a number of cars carrying      Liverpool
supporters in the hold-up, which I believe to be a relevant factor in the
subsequent events.


When    we got closer to Sheffield we were   running behind time, and at just after 2
p.m.    were still some 8 miles or so from the city centre, and in a nose-to-tail
traffic queue.     We were lucky in finding a parking space at about 2.20 p.m., and
walked to the Stadium, arriving in Leppings Lane at about 2.40 p.m.         Although we
were    behind time, there were still many people behind us, both on the road and
walking to the ground.


I attended exactly the same fixture last season, i.e. Liverpool v. Nottingham
Forest at Hillsborough in the Semi-Final.      On that occasion we were in the West
Stand seated accommodation and queued in an orderly fashion for 4/5 minutes to
go through the turnstiles, having arrived at 2.20 p.m.


I was surprised to find a milling mass of fans outside the ground.         We joined
not a queue,     but quite simply a crowd outside the entrance to the North Stand,
for which we     had tickets.   My party comprised myself, and three lads, one 15 and
two 14, both     the latter beingsmall and slightly built.    After 10 minutes it
became clear     thatthe crush was getting worse and there was precious little
progress being made at the turnstiles.       I heard a policemen on foot nearby
shout that he wanted to "get a horse in here" to his colleagues.          I don't know
whether a horse was moved in or not.
                                                             Continued:
I was aware that a number of the fans around me were holding tickets for the
West Stand and apparently had been directed to this particular entrance by the
police.    The crowd was shouting and appealing for the exit gates on our
left-hand side to be opened to give entrance to the ground, and relief from the
crush.    At this point I was firmly convinced that the kick-off would be delayed
and mentioned this to one or two people close to me.


Shortly before 3 p.m. when the intensity of the crush had increased and the
                  I
crowd was moving around alarmingly, I decided it would be safest to send the two
youngest boys over the heads of the crowd, through the turnstiles and out of
harm's way.     I am very thankful to the Liverpool fans close to me for the help
they gave me in doing this, it was certainly not easy to release the lads from
the crowd.


Just after this the exit gate was opened and the crowd moved through this gate
in a reasonably ordered fashion, our party was re-united within the ground, and
we got to our seats to watch the match.       The rest of the events that day are
well-documented.


I have no wish to set myself up as an instant expert on crowd control, but I do
feel that there are a handful of observations I could make which I hope will be
useful in identifying what went wrong on that occasion and preventing such a
disaster happening again.


1.   The route from the North-West to Sheffield was extremely well-policed in my
     opinion, with officers, cars and motorcycles at every significant
     intersection, plus motorcycles on patrol on the A61 approach road into
     Sheffield.       Wouldn't the police have noted, with their many years of
     experience of staging Semi-Finals at Hillsborough, an early warning that
     the "convoy" was behind time, with the inevitable result of a surge of
     latecomers at the stadium?


2.   The entry arrangements through the turnstiles to the North Stand were
     chaotic.     In contrast to last year, there was virtually no direct police
     supervision of the queues and there was no sign of the queue demarcation
     tapes and barriers.       In addition, there was no attempt to search fans on
     nearing the turnstiles, as there had been previously.


     Added to this there were only 4 turnstiles attempting to deal with the
     crowd.     Can it be that the North Stand at Hillsborough, capable of holding
     (I would guess) 10,000 people is accessed by only 4 turnstiles?


                                                                     Continued:


                                                                                     4
                                            - 3 -
'3.   I have already commended the Liverpool fans for their co-operation in
      getting my    two youngest boys out of        the   crowd.   I was equally grateful to
      the police    who opened the exit gate        and   so saved us,in our position, from
      the very real danger of being crashed outside the ground.        This I believe
      to have been a strong probability as a result of the panic that would have
      ensued from the crowd surging forward when it realised the match had
      started.     The opening of that gate into the North Stand was very definitely
      a sound decision.


4.    I have been to football matches before, where, because of problems of late
      arrival of    fans, the kick-off has been delayed.     The reaction to this has
      never been    describable as positive,        but   is generallytolerated, particularly
      in a situation where there is good crowd segregation.        Why, oh why was this
      action not taken?


      By virtue of the monitoring of the movement of Liverpool fans into
      Sheffield, I believe that the writing was on the wall as early as 2.00 -
      2.15 p.m.r and that the police, with all their experience must have seen
      it, and anticipated that surge of late arrivals.


      In the area where we were, it would have made a considerable difference to
      the demeanour of the crowd outside if a policeman with a loud-hailer had
      stood on top of the turnstile wall and told everybody that the kick-off
      would be delayed 20 minutes and that it would not start until everybody was
      in the ground.    As I suggested above, I do not believe that the
      announcement would have brought a bad reaction from the spectators inside.


5.    One final point, not particularly related to this catastrophe, but
      nevertheless important.     In our seats, Row 39, seat numbers 31-34, we just
      could not hear the public address announcements above the general crowd
      noise.     Only when everybody hushed each other could the messages be heard.
      One day, that factor could be vital, in a different sort of crisis.


This is a long letter, I hope you have found the contents useful.        Should you
wish to contact me for any reason, then my address and telephone number are at
the head of this letter.


Yours faithfully.

Dear Sirs,

Hillsborough, April 15th 1989

I am writing to record my experiences and observations on the above, from the
point of view of a spectator in the North Stand.


The journey across to Sheffield turned out to be a difficult one.            The traffic
hold-up at the Stockport end of the M63 delayed us for 20/30 minutes, which
might have been longer if       I had not taken a diversion to avoid thenext section
of the jam.    It was clear     that there were a number of cars        carryingLiverpool
supporters in the hold-up, which I believe to be a relevant factor in the
subsequent events.


When    we got closer to Sheffield we were    running behind time, and at just after 2
p.m.    were still some 8 miles or so from the city centre, and in a nose-to-tail
traffic queue.     We were lucky in finding a parking space at about 2.20 p.m., and
walked to the Stadium, arriving in Leppings Lane at about 2.40 p.m.           Although we
were    behind time, there were still many people behind us, both on the road and
walking to the ground.


I attended exactly the same fixture last season, i.e. Liverpool v. Nottingham
Forest at Hillsborough in the Semi-Final.       On that occasion we were in the West
Stand seated accommodation and queued in an orderly fashion for 4/5 minutes to
go through the turnstiles, having arrived       at 2.20 p.m.


I was surprised to find a       milling majss of fans outside the ground.     We joined
not a queue,     but quite simply a crowd outside the entrance to the North Stand,
for which we     had tickets.   My party comprised myself, and three lads, one 15 and
two 14, both     the latter beingsmall and slightly built.     After 10 minutes it
became clear that the crush was getting worse and there was precious little
progress being made at the turnstiles.       I heard a policemen on foot nearby
shout that he wanted to "get a horse in here" to his colleagues.            I don't know
whether a horse was moved in or not.
                                                               Continued:
I was aware that a number of the fans ar6und rpe were holding tickets for the
W^st Stand and apparently had been directed to this particular entrance by the
police.    The crowd was shouting and appealing for the exit gates on our
left-hand side to be opened to give entrance to the ground, and relief from the
crush.    At this point I was firmly convinced that the kick-off would be delayed
and mentioned this to one or two people close to me.


Shortly before 3 p.m. when the intensity of the crush had increased and the
                                                                I
crowd was moving around alarmingly, I decided it would be safest to send the two
youngest boys over the heads of the crowd, through the turnstiles and out of
harm's way.     I am very thankful to the Liverpool fans close to me for the help
they gave me in doing this, it was certainly not easy to release the lads from
the crowd.


Just after this the exit gate was opened and the crowd moved through this gate
in a reasonably ordered fashion, our party was re-united within the ground, and
we got to our seats to watch the match.     The rest of the events that day are
well-documented.


I have no wish to set myself up as an instant expert on crowd control, but I do
feel that there are a handful of observations I could make which I hope will be
useful in identifying what went wrong on that occasion and preventing such a
disaster happening again.


1.   The route from the North-West to Sheffield was extremely well-policed in my
     opinion, with officers, cars and motorcycles at every significant
     intersection, plus motorcycles on patrol on the A61 approach road into
     Sheffield.     Wouldn't the police have noted, with their many years of
     experience of staging Semi-Finals at Hillsborough, an early warning that
     the "convoy" was behind time, with the inevitable result of a surge of
     latecomers at the stadium?


2.   The entry arrangements through the turnstiles to the North Stand were
     chaotic.     In contrast to last year, there was virtually no direct police
     supervision of the queues and there was no sign of the queue demarcation
     tapes and barriers.     In addition, there was no attempt to search fans on
     nearing the turnstiles, as there had been previously.


     Added to this there were only 4 turnstiles attempting to deal with the
     crowd.     Can it be that the North Stand at Hillsborough, capable of holding
     (I would guess) 10,000 people is accessed by only 4 turnstiles?


                                                                    Continued:
3.   I have already commended the Liverpool fans for their co-operation in
     getting my two youngest boys out of the crowd.     I was equally grateful to
     the police who opened the exit gate and so saved us, in our position, from
     the very real danger of being crushed outside the ground.     This I believe
     to have been a strong probability as a result of the panic that would have
     ensued from the crowd surging forward when it realised the match had
     started.     The opening of that gate into the North Stand was very definitely
 i   a sound decision.


4.   I have been to football matches before, where, because of problems of late
     arrival of fans, the kick-off has been delayed.     The reaction to this has
     never been describable as positive, but is generally tolerated, particularly
     in a situation where there is good crowd segregation.     Why, oh why was this
     action not taken?


     By virtue of the monitoring of the movement of Liverpool fans into
     Sheffield, I believe that the writing was on the wall as early as 2.00 -
     2.15 p.m., and that the police, with all their experience must have seen
     it, and anticipated that surge of late arrivals.


     In the area where we were, it would have made a considerable difference to
     the demeanour of the crowd outside if a policeman with a loud-hailer had
     stood on top of the turnstile wall and told everybody that the kick-off
     would be delayed 20 minutes and that it would not start until everybody was
     in the ground.     As I suggested above, I do not believe that the
     announcement would have brought a bad reaction from the spectators inside.


5.   One final point, not particularly related to this catastrophe, but
     nevertheless important.     In our seats, Row 39, seat numbers 31-34, we just
     could not hear the public address announcements above the general crowd
     noise.     Only when everybody hushed each other could the messages be heard.
     One day, that factor could be vital, in a different sort of crisis.


This is a long letter, I hope you have found the contents useful.     Should you
wish to contact me for any reason, then my address and telephone number are at
the head of this letter.


Yours faithfully,

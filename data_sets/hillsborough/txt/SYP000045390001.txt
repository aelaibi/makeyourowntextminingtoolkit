          Mr. M. Jones,
          Assistant Chief Constable,
          West Midlands Police HQ,
          P.O. Box 52, Lloyd House,
          Colmore Circus Queensway,
          Birmingham. B4 6 NQ..

          Dear Mervyn,                                                 y 2>

          I enclose the letter f r o m t o g e t h e r with a
          copy of my reply. I assume that you do not have a statement
          from this gentleman, but if I am wrong perhaps you would let
          me have a si^it of what he says.

          It does not look to me as if he has anything to say which is
          relevant to the coroner*s inquiry, but if you feel differently,
          you will no doubt let me know.     ^

          Yours sincerely,




        I/ s.Tj.-fc'opperj

Thank you for your letter of the                              5   th of January.

I can not of course comment on what action or otherwise
the Public Inquiry took in relation to the matters which
you mention.

Prima facie, it seems to me that what you describe is not
a matter which would fall within the terms of the coroner's
Inquest and in those circumstances I do not think that there
would be any opportunity for you to be invited to give evidence

BasciaMy the Inquest is concerned with establishing who the
deceased was, when they died, where they died and how they died
Unless you are able to convince me that evidence which you have
is relevant, I do not see how I can help you.

 Yours sincerely,



 S.L.Popper,
 H.M. Coroner.

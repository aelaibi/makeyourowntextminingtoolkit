   Dear Attorney General,
   re:        The Hillsborough Football Tragedy
   As you will rec a ll on 15 April 1989, a d i s a s t e r occurred a t the Hillsborough
   Stadium, Sheffield during a football match between Liverpool and Nottingham
   Forest. As a r e s u l t , some 96 supporters were crushed to death and very many
   more were injured.
   L ia b i l i t y f o r the deaths and i n j u r i e s has been admitted by the Chief Constable
   of South Yorkshire Police, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and a firm of
   Consulting Engineers Eastwood & P arters, who have a sharing agreement in respect
   of such l i a b i l i t y .
   There were many police o f f i c e r s on duty a t the stadium a t the time of the
   d i s a s t e r , and others were drafted in subsequently to a s s i s t the rescue
   operations, in the case of the injured and dying, and the disposal of the dead.

   The deaths and physical i n j u r i e s occurred in two pens a t the end of the ground
   occupied by standing Liverpool supporters. Some police o f f i c e r s entered the
   pens to rescue the dying, some were stood a t the fence attempting to t e a r i t
   down, others were on the pitch attempting to r e s u s c it a te the unconscious, others
   c arried dead and dying supporters to a temporary mortuary in the gymnasium,
   where yet others were tending to the dead bodies. Later other o f f i c e r s attended
   a t the permanent mortuary.
   We were subsequently in stru c te d by the Police Federation on behalf of 147
   o f f i c e r s ranging in rank from Inspector to Constable, a ll of whom had suffered
   p sy c h ia tric i l l n e s s as a r e s u l t of what they had seen and done a t the ground and
   in the mortuary. Their i n ju r i e s ranged from the very serious ( i . e . completely
   disabling) to more temporary conditions. Many had already been invalided out
   from the Police Force and some where unemployable.
   At the request of the Federation, we obtained the advice of Mr. B. A. Hytner QC
   on the v i a b i l i t y of claims fo r damages by those o f f i c e r s against the Chief
   Constable and others. He advised t h a t some o f f i c e r s , depending on where they
   where and what they were doing, had a good case, others l i t t l e of a case,
   and the remainder were of varying stre n g th . We were in stru c te d by the
   Federation to issue Writs.

   P rior to the issue of Writs, approximately h a lf of the Clients decided not to
   proceed. Amongst the reasons were things said to them by senior o f f i c e r s in
J.M . Webber T.D.B. Taylor I.J. Walker A.F. Whitehead I.R. Fletcher G.C. Solly W.D. O â€™Brien P J . Davis R.C. Langton D.R. Louw E J.O . Cooper S.G. Ingram N.B. Holroyd

the force. Consequently, only 52 Writs were issued. Subsequently, a f u r t h e r 25
P l a i n t i f f s f o r reasons which included those already s t a te d , decided not to
continue. Thirty seven P l a i n t i f f s wished and s t i l l wish to proceed.
I t is c le a r however, t h a t P l a i n t i f f s such as these are vulnerable to pressure
even i f i t is merely persuasion.
The actions of the t h i r t y seven having proceeded, Mr. J u s ti c e Waller one of the
presiding Judges of the North Eastern C irc u it, ordered t h a t the actions of all
but 7 of the P l a i n t i f f s be stayed and t h a t the cases of those 7 should proceed;
a date fo r hearing has been fixed fo r the 27 March 1995 a t Sheffield High
Court. The 7 P l a i n t i f f s have been chosen as r e f l e c t i n g all the categories of
place and task indicated above. The hope i s t h a t the decision of the Court will
enable a ll outstanding claims to be s e t t l e d .
On the 5 January 1995 the Defendants n o tifie d us t h a t in respect of 14 of the 37
o f f i c e r s , they were admitting l i a b i l i t y . At f i r s t sight i t would appear, th a t
though they have not said so in terms, t h a t they admit l i a b i l i t y in respect of
the o f f i c e r s who entered the pens.
On 3 February 1995, two a r t i c l e s appeared in The Daily Telegraph newspaper,
copies of which are provided with t h i s l e t t e r . We draw your a tte n tio n in
p a r t i c u l a r to the leading a r t i c l e e n t i t l e d "moral blackmail".
As you will appreciate, the suggestion t h a t we and our Counsel have been
"imaginative and unscrupulous" in pursuing these claims may be d i f f i c u l t fo r the
newspaper to sustain in the l i g h t of the recent admission of l i a b i l i t y .   i
However, i t is the final sentence of the a r t i c l e with which we feel you, as      \
Attorney General, should be concerned.                                                   \
There i s of course no jury in the cases to be heard a t S heffield, and we are
advised by Leading Counsel t h a t Judges and Lawyers are expected to be f a i r l y
sta lw art and immune from pressure not to do t h e i r duty in the former case
without f e a r or favour to anyone, in the l a t t e r to t h e i r C lien ts.
"Claimants" are however in a wholly d i f f e r e n t category and they may well succumb
to pressure not to pursue t h e i r legitim ate actions in the Courts i f the public
a t the behest of a newspaper "heaps excoriation."
We are advised t h a t there cannot be a more c la s s ic example of contempt of Court
as described by Lords Diplock and Simon of Glaisedale in Attorney General v The
Times newspapers (1974) AC 275 HL. We would r e f e r you in p a r t i c u l a r to the head
note a t page 274 g - h and the observations of Lord Diplock a t page 310 f - H
page 313 a - b and page 314 c.
In respect of your own powers, we would r e f e r you, though we doubt whether i t is
necessary to do so, to the head note a t page 275 d and the consequent page
references.

In r e l a ti o n to the caveat of Lord Cross of Chelsea a t page 326 c, we would
r e s p e c tf u lly suggest terms lik e "unscrupulous" and "madness" apart the
a lle g a tio n t h a t our Clients are indulging in moral blackmail and deserve to have
excoriation heaped upon them by press and public a lik e i s hardly one t h a t is
expressed temperately.
We look f o r you to take such action t h a t may be necessary to protect our Clients
from t h i s abusive pressure. Quite apart from the damage to an individual
Client who gives up his claim, i f any of the "representative" P l a i n t i f f s were
to discontinue a t t h i s stage, i t would play havoc with the t r i a l due to commence

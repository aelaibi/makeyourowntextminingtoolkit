            from my         home    address.                 We    stopped             once     on    the    way and          that       was    in

            Huddersfield            at a        public            house       on       the    main     road,       we    had a          shandy,       use!

            the     toilet      and      continued                on   our        journey        after       about       15 m i n u t e s .

            When      we    arrived         near        to    the H i l l s b o r o u g h            football       ground             w e parked         in

            parallel         with       it.        Al l      seven       of       us    then     walked       towards             the    football

            g r o u n d , arriving            within          ten minutes,                    Eric     and    I separated                on a r r i v a l

            from      the    other       five          lads       as    our       tickets        were       for    the       same       standing

            area.          I saw    that        it w a s          very       b u s y at       the     entrance          to    the       g r o u n d at

            Leppings         Lane       and     I remember               looking             at m y w a t c h a n d          noting          that    it
    A
I           was     2.25pm.

            Eric      Hughes       and      I got         our      tickets             out    ready     and       joined          the    queue       at

            Leppings         Lane.          I noticed              that       there          w e r e ,police       officers             in

            attendance          and      two       mounted             police          officers        a s you      approach             the

            turnstiles,            a third mounted                      police          officer        removed          his       horse       from    the

        Y   crowd      to    the    s i de.            There       was       no    orderly           queue    at    the       turnstiles             just

            one     large     crowd.

            As a      result       of    the       jostling             by    the       c r o w d Mr    Eric       H u g h e s and           I got

            separated         before          we       entered         through           th e    turnstile.              I was          being       pushed
                                                                                                                                         PAGE

against         what        I believe            wa s     a    blue       metal          wall,        by     the    pressure            of    the

cro w d .             We   just were                 not m o v i n g       forward,              so    I justpushed my                  way       out

around            the      s i d e by a              little          can al              and     in    front        of s o m e    metal       barrie

where        I lit a          cigarette.                 There       were       some       police            officers            standing

behind        these         small        metal       barriers.                       x /

As    I stood           alone,       1 saw          large          pale    blue          concertina             type      metal         gates

being        opened         from     the       inside.              I would          estimate              this     to    be a b o u t        5

minutes         before           3 prn.       I could          not       see    who       opened           this     gate.

I was        aware         of at     least          two       police       officers              inside        the       gate,        who     were

wearing         helmets           and also           a    steward.

These        gates         appeared           to me       to       open    slightly              at    fi r s t ,     then        close       and

then     were         fully         opened.          As       these gates                were       fully       opened           I just

walked                i n s i d e . As    I         got i n s i d e       I           saw Eric             H u g h e s ,w h o     had    got       insid

through         a turnstile               waiting             for me.           I approached                 Eri c ,      we     both        went

to    th e    mens         toilets        situated             below       the       West        Stand.            I must        say     that       I

believe         1 was         one    of       the    first          to    e nter         the     ground        through           this'open

gate.
                                                                                                  V—
Eric     and      I came          out     the       toilets          and       entered           the       tunnel        leading         to       the

terracing.                 I saw a        sign       saying          STANDING.,                1 believed             that       by     going

down     t h is       tunnel        was       the    single          entry          point        to    gain access               to     the

terracing             below       the     West       Stand,          and       that       once        inside        we    could         move

towards         the a r e a         n e ar     to    the       corner          flag       that        Eric     and       I liked         to

stand        n ea r     to.       I saw        no    other          signs       pointing              out    access        to      the

terracing             by a n y      other        means,            other       than       the       tunnel.           1 never           saw any

stewards          or       police        officers             present          as    Eric        and       I entered            the     tunnel.

Eric     and      I walked           through             the       entry       tunnel          in     comfort,           not      running,

the    tunnel          was       busy     but       not       to    the    point          of     being       uncomfortable.

When     we     reached           the     end       of    the       tunnel          I could           se e    that       both      teams          were

on    th e    field         of    play w a r m i n g           up    p r i or       to    th e      game     starting.                Eric        and

I were        able         to m a k e     ou r      way       forward          into       th e      crowd      a short           way.         At

this      point        I said           to E r i c        " W e ’ve      got     to    get        over       here"       motioning

towards         the       right         hand       side       and       Eric     nodded           towards          me.         Even        at    this

t i me,    I wa s         s t ill       under        the      impression              that        we     could        get      to     th e      corner

area      of    the       terracing             by      just       walking        towards              it.     I st ill          h a d n ’t

realised         t h at        t h is    area        was      sectioned           off        by    fencing.              There         was       a

terrific         surge          from         b e h i n d me a n d E r i c             wh o    had        been      standing            to my

left      in a       position            just        b e h i n d me       and     I got           s e p a r a t e d.        We      all

appeared         to       be    leaning            on     each      other        as    we     fiwved f o r w a r d             t o w a r d s the

perimeter            fence        area.            You       c o u l d n ’t s t o p y o u r s e l f ,           you      just         had       to    go

with      it.        I remember               passing           the      side     of a        barrier           and a young                  lad wa s

screaming            as    his      back       was        being         bent     over        this        metal        barrier.

The    result         of       this      surge          was     that      I ended            up w i t h        b o t h my        hands          on    the

perimeter            f e n c i ng,       holding             myself       of f    a young              lad of a b o u t             10 y e a r s ,

who    was      right          against         the        wall.          I d o n ’t k n o w            if a n y o n e       was       with       t h is

young      lad or          not,         or    if     he      had    been       separated               from     someone.               This          was

i ri p e n 3     beside           the        exit       gate.           This     young        lad w a s         screaming              out.

People         were       shouting            for       the     policemen nearby                       to    open      t h is       gate        and

get    the      young          lad out.              Th e     policewoman              standing              beside         the       policeman

opened         this       gate      a nd th e           policeman          struggled               to       free      the      young         lad

from      the    crowd.             He m a n a g e d          to    get     him       out     through           the      gate         and       I d o n ’t,

know      what       happened            to    him after                that.         I grabbed              the      g at e     by m y         left

hand      and managed               with       a slight             struggle           to     get        myself        out

through         this       gate         onto       the       running       t ra c k .         The        game      had      started             by-

now,      I d o n ’t k n o w            if a n y o n e        followed           me    ou t       th e      g a te.      The        po1 icewoman

who    opened         the       fence         gate        motioned         me     towards              the     corner          area        of    the

terracing            near       the      police           box,      when       I walked            there        another             policewoman

opened         another          perimeter               gate       at    that     location               and    I went           into        the

t e r r a c i n g.        I had         plenty          of    room       in t h i s      location,              there          wa s    plenty          of

room      for    everyone.                   People          were       shouting        at        the       police       box        fo r     the

gates      to    be       opened         and       that       people       were        being           crushed.

As   I looked         towards           the       area        I had         been    in    I saw a man              being         passed

over    the     heads        of    the       crowd,           the      perimeter          gate       was     opened and                he wa s

taken    out.         I think           it w a s           his    family        that      wa s    trying         to     revive             him

once    he     had    been        brought             out.        I saw a          policeman           walk      past       the

Liverpool        goalkeeper                 onto       th e      pitch,       he was       waving          his     hand       in the

direction        of     th e      referee,             and       p l a y w as      stopped.

I kept       watching,            other          people          were       being       brought        out    of      this       gat e ,         and

I saw a        part     of     the      f enci ng           had     been      rjipped a w a y.

As   I continued             to w a t c h         I saw my             friend Eric             Hughes        being         carried            out

by f a n s     and a     couple             of    policemen             took       over    when        they      reached           the

pitch.         Eric     had a          l i g ht       coloured          pair       of    trousers          and a        red      'ADIDAS8

t o p , he     referred           to    this          as    his     match       kit.

I made       my way      towards             the       p i t c h a n d Eirie,            and     when      I got        there          a

policewoman           wa s     administering                     the    kiss       of    life     to E r i c , w h i l e           a

policeman        wa s    rubbing             Eric          in t he      ch e s t a r e a ,       under       his      red     shirt,

which    had     been        raised          up.           I was       rubbing          Eric's       hand,       he wa s         on        his

back.

After    about        10 m i n u t e s           the       policeman and                policewoman,             wh o      were        both

crying       stopped and               the       man apologised                 to me,         saying        there         was     nothing

more    that     he     could          do    for       Eric.           The    policeman asked                 me      to    stay           with

E r i c , so    that     he       could          be    identified             to    someone,           and    they         left        me     with

After    a few minutes                  a fan          put a        blue      jacket       over        Eric's         fac e .          Some

other    fan     carrying              an advertising                   b o a rd    came       and     placed Eric               on        the

flat    board and            we    ran       the       length          of    the    pitch,        where       the       ambulances

were    entering         from.              The       fans       left       Eric    and    I at        that      point        and          some

ambulancemen            or     police            came       and Eric          was       taken     by    stretcher             to a

clothes        approached              me,       he    had a        badge       label      on     his      jacket,          and        he

         me     some     questions.                    I identified                Eric    to     t h is     man      at    that           t i m e.

                     Shortly       afterwards             the     man     explained         that    Eric       would    be    taken      to a

                    RE: HILLSBOROUGH - YORKSHIRE T.V. DOCUMENTARY


     I have been approached by Helen Magee of Yorkshire T,V. for help and
assistance in producing a documentary film which they aim to have ready
to go out around the time that the Enquiry reports. Their route into the
film was via the West Midlands Police who have been collecting evidence
for the Enquiry, but they would like to pursue a second theme in the documentary
which would be quite separate and distinct which is the response to, and
services provided, for disaster victims. I spent a couple of hours talking
with Helen Magee, and was impressed by her grasp of the issues, and would
suggest that we proceed with the discussion prior to filming on the same
basis that we have worked with the Warner Sisters organisation in producing
their film for B.B.C. Can I assume, if I do not hear to the contrary, that
I can give to Helen Magee the names of the contact people who we have used
for Warner Sisters? I would also, with your encouragement, ask her to follow
up those people who Lavinia Warner has not yet spoken to.

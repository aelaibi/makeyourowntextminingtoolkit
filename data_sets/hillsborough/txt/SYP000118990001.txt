               I commenced           duty       on S a t u r d a y ,    15 A p r i l ,     1989     (150 4 89 )    at 8 . 3 0 a m

               I was        detailed       to      serial       28 i/c P o l i c e S e r g e a n t W i l s o n f r o m A1

              Doncaster,

              We     a r r i v e d at H i l l s b o r o u g h at 9 . 4 0 a m         (0940)       and    paraded         in the N o r t h

              stand         for    briefing         at     10am     (1000).

              On     completion           of    the      briefing       we    remained         in the N o r t h      stand where           we

               consumed a           p a c k e d meal .

              At     11am     (1100)       I commenced              d u t y at    the     j u n c t i o n of L e a k e    Road and

              Leppings            Lane    in    c o m p a n y w i t h DC 2 3 9 9 W r en .          The    purpose         of    our    duty

              was      to    prevent       n o n - r e s id e n t s    from      entering        Leake    Road and         non­

               residents           cars    from       parking         in this       street.        Barriers        were        placed

              across         the    junction          to    restrict         access.

              For      the    first       h ou r    or     so   things       were    quiet       but    by about         12.30pm

               carrying           cans    of    beer,       bottles        of w i n e     or   cider.       Some     were       standing

               in small           groups       on L e p p i n g s     Lane    drinking.

               It w a s      also    noticeable             that m an y       having       reached       the    ground         were

walking         back      along       Leppings         Lane       asking         directions             for       the       coach

parks.          These       f a ns    were      wanting          tickets.             They were             also    approaching

other       f a ns a s k i n g       for    ’s p a r e s ’ .

B y Ho ' e l oc k        (1400)       the      flow    of      fans      along        Leppings          Lane       wa s

continuous            and      traffic         was    having          difficulty making                     progress.

I could         see      from       the    faces      of    the       f an s    as    they       passed       t h at        m any were

the      worse     for      drink.          T h e y w e r e n ’t f a l l i n g         down       drunk       but       had

obviously          been drinking.                    I thought           to m y s e l f      at    the       time       it     seemed

t ha t     many    of     these       supporters            had       tried      to    get       ’as m u c h a l e ’ as

possible          down      their         necks      before       the      start       of    the m a t c h .

Opposite          the     junction          of L e a k e     Road and Leppings                     Lane       is a s m al l

alleway         t ha t    l e ad s    to    s o me    bungalows            and       following          a    complaint            t ha t

supporters            were      using       the a l l e w a y as           a to i l e t ,        I positioned myself

at    the m o u t h       of    it to       prevent         further            nuisance.           Whilst          I was

standing          here      I s a w one         youth       stop       in L e p p i n g s        Lane       and    he       b e p a n to

urinate         openly         in full         v i e w of      everyone.              I moved        towards            him       but he

ran off         his      actions          cheered      by o t h e r        supporters.

During       my    t im e a t        this      location          I was visited b y my serial sergeant

Police       Sergeant           Wilson and also                  my    serial         Inspector             whose       nam#      I do

not      know     except        that       he w a s    based          at W o o d s e a t s .       He       spent       a    f ai r

amount       of    time        in    company with            us.

I was       not    in     possession            of a       radio       and was         surprised             to    sefe S p e c i a l

Constables            who were            patrolling           in p a i r s      each with           th e     latest           personal

radio.

At    3 o ’clock         (1500)       the      crowd       had d w in d l e d         to    just    a few          but       up to 3 p m

(1500)       the      flow      of    supporters            had       remained         continuous.

At    3.03pm       (1505)           together         with my          serial         Inspector          I began               to w a l k to

Claywheels            Lane      for       lunch      leaving          DC W r e n      on the       junction.

As    we w a l k e d      along       Leppings         Lane       I could hear mes sa ge s                        on his P o l i c e

r a d io    but    couldn't           h e ar    what       was    being         said       but    it w a s        obvious         by the

tone     of w h a t       was     being         said       t h at    there       were      problems             somewhere            a n d we

listened         carefully.              We      then       heard a message                 to the          effect            that

everyone         was      required         on the           running         tra c k.

On    hearing         this       we    immediately                turned     round and               began        to w a l k        quickly

b a ck   to    the L e p p i n g s       Lane         e n d o f the         ground.           Whilst          we        were       making

our way        back       the     Inspector            attempted            to     contact Po li ce                 control          for

instructions              but     could         not    get        through.          The mess ag es                that        were     being

transmitted              sounded        to me         to    be      very    badly        garbled.               I s a w t h at         other

officers were also                     hurrying            along Leppings                Lane        on    f oo t       and    in v a n s .

On    reaching           the L e p p i n g s      Lane        end     of    th e    ground           I saw a            large       number

of o f f i c e r s       waiting.            Instructions were                     given        to    form a            cordon across

th e L e p p i n g s L a n e          entrance.                                                                                v

There      were       very       few    supporters                about     at     this     time          outside         the

ground.          These        supporters              were        ushered        outside th®               c o r d o n 1 inf.-

At    t h is    t im e    no on e       knew what             was     happening            or w h a t       had         haj^sljwd»

Whilst         I was      standing           on t h i s       cordon        I overheard a                  conversation                to

the      effect       that       there       were      casualties            inside          the      ground            and    ever?

people         dead.        As    I seemed            to     be     serving        no    useful           purpose         together

w i t h PC 2-127 S m a r t             I made         my way         into    the L e p p i n g s           Lane         end    cjf t he

ground         by w a y     of    the     turnstiles.                 On making            my way across                  th# open

r ival      fans.

I made my way               onto       the      terracing            by w a y      of     the    tunnel           under        the W e s t

 certain amount                      of a b u s e       from       the       crowd.

 On    reaching              the a r e a at             the    rear          of    the       goalmouth           in    front        of the      West

 had    happened.

There         were       a     large        number        of       civilians             on       the     playing       area       some

wa s   then         removed             by o t h e r s        away       onto          the    pitch.

Whilst          this         wa s     going        on    civilians                were       screaming           abuse       at    s om e

officers,            others             were       just       wandering                about       clearly        distressed.

T h e r e was        no       direction             or    control             at       this       en d    of    the    ground,          the

whole         thing was               just        out    of    control             with       people           picking       up t m d i e a

putting          them         onto         boards        and       carrying             t h e m a w ay.          We    had    no    idea

where         the    casualties                   were    being          taken          to.

There         was    a       p o i nt      when     the       spectators                in the W f s t           stand       began       jeering

and    roaring               and      I feared           that          there       would          be a f ul l         scale       pitch

p it c h.       I saw        no       casualties             in    this       paddock            but       was    subject           to a

certain         amount           of    abuse       from       the      crowd.

On     reaching            the    area       at    the        rear       of      the g o a l m o u t h in          f ro n t    of     the

West      Stand,           I saw       that       t h e re    w er e    a number                of b o d i e s     lying           all    o v er

this      area.            I realised             then       that      something                of    an e x t r e m e l y         serious

nature         ha d    happened.

There       were       a large          number          of    civilians               on    the       playing        area,          some

attempting             to r e s u s c i t a t e         unconscious              people,              other       evacuating

people         by     using       boards          torn       from      the      edge        of pitch.

T he     situation           was       absolute             chaos.        I sa w           at    this       time     approximately

15 b o d i e s        lying       in    the       area        at       the     r e a r of        the      goalmouth.           I     then

w e nt    to    the        gate       that    gives           access           f ro m the         p i t c h to     paddock           31

where       I could          see       bodies          lying       towards            the       bottom       of    the        terracing.

Together            with     other       officers             I helped            to r e m o v e           these     bodies

through         the        gate       onto    the       running          track.             This          evacuation           was       done

by     officers            carrying          the       body       to   the      gate        where          myself      an d        some

other       policemen             took       the       body       and m a n o e u v r e d            it    through        the       gate.

Th e     body       was     then       removed          by    others          a wa y       onto       the    pitch.

Whilst         this        was    going       on       civilians             w er e    screaming             abuse        at       some

officers,             others          were    just          wandering           about           clearly          distressed.

There       was       no    direction             or    control          at     this        en d      of    the    ground,           the

whole       thing          was    just       out       of    control          with         people          picking        up       bodies,

putting         t he m      onto       boards          and    carrying            them          away.        We    ha d       no    i de a

where       the       casualties             w e re     being          taken      to.

There       was       a point          when       the       spectators            in       the       West    Stand        began

jeering         and        roaring       and I f e a r e d              that      th ere         would       be     a full          s cale

pitch       invasion.

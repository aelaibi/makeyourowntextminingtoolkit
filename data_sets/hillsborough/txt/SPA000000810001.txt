 JOINT REPORT OF THE CHIEF CONSTABLE AND THE CLERK AND FINANCIAL OFFICER


 HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER

 1     Matter for Consideration

 1.1   To note the present position regarding claims             for   compensation
        arising from the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster.

 2     Background Information

 2.1    At the meeting of the Finance and General Purposes Committee held on
        15 September 1989, it was resolved that in view of the potential
        expenditure which the Authority may be involved in, and as agreed by
        the Municipal Mutual Insurance Company Limited, officers of the
        Authority were requested to "shadow" the Insurers in the conduct of
        the claims for compensation and report back to the Committee on
        developments as they arise.

 3     Comment

 3.1   Writs have been issued     against the Chief Constable, Sheffield
        Wednesday Football Club and Eastwood and Partners on behalf of 50
        individuals who were serving police officers at the time of the
        Hillsborough Disaster.

 3.2   They have been received      and   forwarded   to   the Police Authority's
        Insurers for attention.

 3.3   The Chief Constable is to resist the claims           on the grounds        that
        there is no proper cause of action.

 4     Recommendation

 4.1   The Committee is asked to note the present position.

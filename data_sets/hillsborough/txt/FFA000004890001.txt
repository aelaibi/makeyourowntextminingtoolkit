 : sDQka to .1  ^     and referred to her fax which I
 received shortly before lunch enclosing the fax from
 Sheffield Wednesday to^Graha®;:!

I asked if there was any precedent for such a payment from
the FA to a club like Sheffield Wednesday in these
  ircumstances. |       [said there was not, I asked what
         |was minded to do. She said that he wanted to know
whether he should consider the letter or whether we had any
problems with the FA making any donations.       1 said I could
not see any reason why if it was considered appropriate some
sonsy ought to be paid but we would have to look at the
method of how it was done,       I did not think the Inquiry
y o u Id ba prejudiced by any payment to compensate for the
loss of revenue Wednesday suffered as a result of the
semi-final being cancelled,       It was a matter for
'ihefcher he wanted to make any payment,

Subsequently speaking to ______[again. She had received
5 note froitT \         Ion the fax" from Sheffield Wednesday
saying that ha ’wanted an itemised bill of costs they had
incurred and whether they had any consequential loss
insurance covering the loss they        suffered ie revenue, ^ I
said that was entirely sensible.I had a message for              in
Sheffield that we ought not to be making any payment until
ha had had the chance to discuss        it with the FA tomorrow, I
had spoken to 1 ___________ and passed the information on
about the Sheffield Wednesday request, Apparently Julian
■/anted to dia£u*ss i-te-~#ar any payment that was made.
Obviously no payment was going to be made today and perhaps
vs could take the opportunity of discussing it tomorrow,
     (said that would be a crood idea.

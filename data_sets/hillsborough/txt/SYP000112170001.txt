up    the    fencing        and     begged         f a ns     to m o v e     back    unti l       I wa s     hoarse,        1

remember          shouting,         “Get      back       people        are    dying     at the        front".            More

and    more       fans     from     the      back       climbed        towards       the      front     o v er     the    bodies

and    up    the     fencing,          my    initial          thoughts        were     to     get   hold      of     these      and

thump       t hem.         I couldn't            b e 1 ieve     what      they    were      d o i n g , as    t h e y got

closer       to me         I realised            the     look    of    terror        in t h e i r    faces         and pulled

them over,           a number          of them snagging                 their       clothing        on the         fencing,

but    glad to be           this       side..

the meshing,              then    I saw       the       face     of a young          girl        in the      crush near           to

the    front,        she    looked about                12-14 years           old,     she was        begging         for help

but    couldn't           move,     that was           enough       for me,         more and more             people were

blue     in the          crowd,    there         must       have    been      10-15 dead at             the      front,

ihis was a nightmare,                       the only thing              on my       conscience at             that t ime

Was    getting           into    that ter r a c i n g and             getting        that young            girl     out and

 at    the    same     time        passing       her     back     up the terracing,                 everyone        Ipassed

 just     looking       for       signs       of life,         digging       and digging        until        I could

 find someone w i t h              life       in them,         then for        some    reason my          thoughts

 returned to the young                    girl     lying        on the terracing,              I picked           her up

 and     carried       her       to the       entrance         gate     onto    the    pitch,       which     by that

 time     had been          cleared and a line                  of    bobbies       formed a chain            to effect

 the     removal       of those          dead from the               t e rracing      onto    tne    pitch.         Having

 passed her           over,       recall       a person g r o aning             in the heap of bodies                    still

 p iled up a g a i n s t           the    perimeter            fencing,        I couldn't     believe         it,    1

 located a man              in     his    early     twenties,           eyes open,         groaning,        at    the

 b o t t o m of that         lot,, together              with other          officers        he was       reco vered and

 d rag g e d 'up the         terracing,.           I remember            shouting, " G e t          your     fuckin'

 eyes     open and          breathe,          breathe,"         he    seemed to        respond,       he was        taken

 directly           to the       front    gate and         carried          out.

• 1 have      no     idea how       long       I spent         in that       terracing,        it seemed an

                     those at        the front, must             have    been    phenomenal.

                    Once      the    t e rracing         had been       cleared    of bodies          I wa l k e d    back       onto    the

                     pitch and         looked          back    in disbelief,       people       had    come to w a t c h a game

                     of football           on a pleasant           afternoon,          what a disaster,              WHY DID       IT HAVE

                    TO HAPPEN.

                    All      ar o u n d me were          Liverpool      fans, .sqme drunk venting                    their anger

                    y o u open the gates."                     “Why did you       let    people       in without           tickets."

                     "My dad's        dead."            It rang    in my ears,           WHY was       the blame           being

                    apportioned            to the Police,           other       fans    rallied       round    comforting

                    back at         the      Leppings          Lane Stand,      saying        to myself,      why did          it have to

                    happen,         and      t h i nking       of the young      girl    I d i d n ’t save,          I     will never

E.l SUB-DIVISION,
HACKEllTHORPE.
ON DUTY 8.30 a.m. E.l



Arrive at Hillsborough Football Club, briefing in North Stand.

Serial 5, duties to include security of car park and BBC units

situated in Leppings Lane car park.



Barriers erected and manned by Police Officers at two points

creating Sterile Area, free from supporters.    1. End of South

Stand at a point level with turnstiles E.      2. Blue steel gates

side of main entrance to Leppings Lane.     Reasoning for sterile

zone, protect T.V. units, cars and prevent clashing Nottingham

and Liverpool fans.



Steady flow of fans, no problems, fans entering or attending

at wrong entrances escorted through sterile area.



Approximately 11.30 a.m. group of about half a dozen Liverpool

fans walking through sterile area, challenged by myself and PC

Ron Craigie.   Not a ticket between them, enquired where they

could locate spares, informed none available and directed back

into Leppings Lane.     Stressed to them, no ticket, no entry.



Approximately half an hour before scheduled kick off (2.30 p.m)

sudden increase in volume of Liverpool fans at steel gates side

of main entrance to West Stand (Leppings Lane).     In company with

other Officers assisted in crowd control at barriers as many

wished to come through sterile area and enter at other points

in ground in order to see kick off, becoming agitated,    I could
foresee problems arising, young Liverpool fans climbing over

turnstiles to effect entry, because of build up large number

being pushed into blue gate, arrival of Merseyside and Notts

Mounted Section clears gates forcing fans back, mounts directing

fans back from gates and turnstiles, met with anger, disapproval

of late comers, majority by this time arriving the worse for

drink, became aware by word of mouth that kick off time to be

delayed by 15 minutes, this relayed to queuing fans, horses

managed to clear gates for a short time.          It became apparent

that problems were arising at the main gate and turnstiles to

the West Stand as mounted manpower suddenly depleted leaving one

Officer on horse back to cope with growing number of fans, once

again      ••   •       -   aingat e .    Recall short time later the
                e>N ?ur»i
side gate being opened and a sudden surge of Liverpool fans

pushing through them, not a chance of preventing the rush, only

lasted for seconds before they were again pushed too.

Difficult to estimate numbers who entered the ground at that

time, would say about 200 - 300.          As gates opened recall seeing

Police Officers inside and Stewards taking refuge along inner

walls to avoid being injured.            Not aware of any tickets being

checked.    When gates pushed too, wide enough for only two fans

maximum to enter the ground, Police Officers at that point

including myself, PC Lewis, PC Craigie and others manoeuvred

the barriers into such a position so as to allow fans in twos,

they were instructed to have their tickets for examination by

Police Officers, no sign of Stewards, those producing tickets

permitted access, others without, turned away.           Must stress at

this stage do not recall any Police Officer taking counterfoils.
The mood of the fans generally was one of anger,       "Why wasn't it

properly organised".    "You couldn't organise a piss up in a

brewery" etc. etc.     Personally I couldn't understand why fans

arrived late, majority of them worse for drink and no doubt

getting tanked up in local boozer right up to kick off.



At 3.00 p.m. recall jeering from the fans inside ground and

assumed that the game must have gone ahead as scheduled, this

seemed to agitate the fans more so, however steady flow of fans

through gate maintained.



Approximately ten-fifteen minutes later directed by Inspector

Harvey, Sergeant Hodgett, to get into ground, difficulties and

fans on pitch.   In company with PC Lewis, PC Craigie, ran

through sterile area to gates adjacent to turnstiles E, South

Stand described earlier, hammered on gate, given access by

Steward, passed under Police Control Box down gangway and onto

pitch, immediate thoughts were a pitch invasion, a lot of

shouting and fans on pitch (Liverpool fans).         Attempted to clear

and push fans back towards the terracing, before one fan said,

"Better get down there mate".      He indicated to the terracing

directly behind the goal Leppings Lane West Stand.

Couldn't believe what I was seeing, incredible volume of fans in

meshing, packed in like sardines crying out for help, it was

choca all the way back no chance of moving.     I recall seeing one

young girl about 12 - 14 years, her cheeks pushed into the

meshing struggling for air, she was blue and I could see

pitch.    A number of them fell causing the remainder to do the

same and before much longer the gate was jammed solid with

bodies begging to be pulled through.      Officers assisted all

they could including myself before returning to the meshing

where I had seen the young girl, fans were climbing over those

at the front and scrambling over the fencing to get onto the

pitch.   I realised then that it was a serious incident, I

realised that there was a steady gradient from the back of the

terracing to the front and a toddler of approximately 3| to 4

feet stood at the front of the terracing would just be able to

rest his chin on the concrete base and that there was a large

number of people under the young girl.     It was an horrific

sight, I could see people dying in front of my eyes and I

couldn't get in to help, the gate was crammed, I climbed up the

fencing and begged fans to move back until I was hoarse, I

remember shouting,   "Get back people are dying at the front".

More and more fans from the back climbed towards the front over

the bodies and up the fencing, my initial thoughts were to get

hold of these and thump them.      I couldn't believe what they

were doing, as they got closer to me I realised the look of

terror in their faces and pulled them over, a number of them

snagging their clothing on the fencing, but glad to be this

side .

                               - 5 -



Police Officers were yelling out for wire cutters to get into

the terracing,    I recall seeing a number of officers punching,

kicking at the meshing, then I saw the face of a young girl in

the crush near to the front, she looked about 12 - 14 years old,

she was begging for help but couldn't move, that was enough

for me, more and more people were blue in the crowd, there must

have been 10 - 15 dead at the front.     This was a nightmare,

the only thing on my conscience at that time was getting into

that terracing and getting that young girl out and didn't give

a damn how I went about it.       I couldn't get over the fencing,

ran back towards the gate where officers continued to free

those trapped in the entrance, I dived over landing on a number

of others.      Other Officers followed, the next thing I recall

is pulling body after body away from the fencing, passing them

back to a group of bobbies who were resuscitating, where was

that girl, I couldn't see her anywhere, then after what seemed

an eternity, she was there,    I pulled her free, but it was no

use, she was blue in the face,

she was dead.     I just broke down crying, at the same time

passing her back up the terracing, everyone I passed back was

dead, I couldn't believe it.     It got to a stage where I was

just looking for signs of life, digging and digging until I

could find someone with life in them, then for some reason my

thoughts returned to the young girl lying on the terracing, I

picked her up and carried her to the entrance gate onto the

pitch, which by that time had been cleared and a line of bobbies

formed a chain to effect the removal of those dead from the

terracing onto the pitch.     Having passed her over, recall a

person groaning in the heap of bodies still piled up against

the perimeter fencing,    I couldn't believe it, I located a man
                                                                   I'C \ M \ s ?


in his early twenties, eyes open, groaning, at the bottom of

that lot, together with other Officers he was recovered and

dragged up the terracing.     I remember shouting,   "Get your

fuckin' eyes open and breathe, breathe", he seemed to respond,

he was taken directly to the front gate and carried out.



I have no idea how long I spent in that terracing, it seemed

an eternity.    I do recall Officers being abused from the Stand

above by Liverpool fans, comments like "You murdering black

bastards, why did you open them fuckin' gates".       I couldn't

believe it, bobbies were breaking their backs to rescue and save

lives and at the same time subject to that kind of abuse, why?

I recall a bottle breaking on the terracing nearby towards the

end of the clearance.     Angry fans on the terracing tore down

advertisement boards to use as make shift stretchers, others

assisted Police Officers.     Even abusing their own fans hurling

abuse towards Officers shouting,    "What the fuck are you doing

to help."

As the terracing was clearing,    I recall seeing a blue barrier

laid on the steps buckled and twisted, it had more or less

sheared off at the base.     I realised then this must have been

the cause of the crush at the front, with all the fans pushing

their way in from the back, this must have sheared off and

caused   those to fall and create a knock on effect.      It was a

nightmare, the pressure that must have been on those at the

front must have been phenomenal.
Once the terracing had been cleared of bodies I walked back

onto the pitch and looked back in disbelief, people had come

to watch a game of football on a pleasant afternoon, what a

disaster, WHY DID IT HAVE TO HAPPEN.



All around me were Liverpool fans, some drunk venting their

anger towards Officers who just stood in silence.     I could

hear,   "Why did you open the gates".   "Why did you let people

in without tickets."    "My dad's dead."    It rang in my ears.

WHY was the blame being apportioned to the Police, other fans

rallied round comforting others, trying to calm them and

escorting them back to the terracing.



I recall returning back to the North Stand where only hours

before we were being briefed.    I sat and cried like I have

never cried, gazing back at the Leppings Lane Stand, saying to

myself, why did it have to happen, and thinking of the young

girl I didn't save.    I will never ever forget her face as long

as I live.

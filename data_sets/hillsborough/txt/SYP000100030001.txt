Dear Ian

HILLSBOROUGH FAMILY SUPPORT

I am enclosing for your information a copy of a letter which I have today sent to
Ann Adlington of the Hillsborough Family Support Group following a telephone request for
information concerning the Authority’s register of delegations to officers and the basis
upon which the public were excluded from the Authority’s meeting in February of this year.

W e have also received a request for annual reports and budget information which
            is responding to. I have asked him to send you a copy of his reply.

Yours sincerely

     Dear Madam,

     I refer to our recent telephone conversation and enclose for your information a list of
     delegations made by the Authority and its Committees.

     The list does not include any reference to the decision of the Authority authorising the
     Clerk and Treasurer to deal with applications for financial assistance from officers (serving
     and retired) in connection with the Hillsborough Disaster. The reason for not including this
     particular delegation is that it was not viewed as a delegation which would extend beyond
     six months. The terms of the delegation are, however, specified in the minutes of the
     meeting (of which you have a copy) at which the delegation was granted. The public were
     excluded from the meeting when this matter was dealt with, and the grounds relied upon
     were as specified in paragraph 14 of Schedule 12 A to the Local Government Act 1972.
     Paragraph 14 refers to information relating to, “Any action taken or to be taken in
     connection with the prevention, investigation or prosecution of any crime.”

     ! have enclosed a copies of Home Office Circulars Nos 77/87 and 4/1998, relating to the
     provision of Financial Assistance to Police Officers in Legal Proceedings.

     Yours faithfully

                S T A T E M E N T OF A C C O U N T I N G PO LI CIE S

General

The ac co u n ts have been prep are d in acc or da nc e with the Code
of P r a c t i c e on Local Au t h o r i ty Accounting, issued in July
1987 by the Ch a r t e r e d I n st itu te of Pub lic Fin an ce and
A c c o u n t a n c y (CIPFA), and also with gu id an ce no tes issued by
CIPFA on the a p p l i c a t i o n of acc ou nt in g st and ard s (SSAPs).

Fixed Ass ets

Fixed ass et s are reco rd ed in the acc ou nt s at hi st o r i c a l cost.
In the c o n s o l i d a t e d bal an ce sheet, fixed assets are shown net
of 'capital dis charged': that is net of the amo unt which has
al re ad y been c h a r ge d to rev en ue by way of loan re pa yme nt or
direct rev en ue c o n t r i b u t i o n , o r fin an ce d from re se rv es or
cap it al r e c e i p t s .Where capital gra nts have been received
to wa rd s the cost of a project, th ese have been app lie d to
reduce the total cost of the project.


Basis of Char ge s for Capital

The A u t h o r i t y' s b o rr ow ing is man ag ed thr ou gh a C o ns ol id at ed
Loans Fund. The Loans Fund makes advan ces to capital accounts
and cha rg es the Po li ce serv ice with principal re pay men ts and
inter es t at the av er ag e rate for the Fund. The aver age rate
of inte res t cha rg ed by the Fund was 9.95% in 1989/90 (9.87%
in 1988/89). The adva nce s are repaid over a num ber of years,
the per iod de pe ndi ng on the nature of the asset
(eg. land SO years; con st ru ct io n 40 years). The Loans Fund
means that loans are raised on ad va n t a g e o u s terms,
a d m i n i s t r a t i o n costs are min im is ed and v a ri at io ns in interest
rates are sm oo the d out.

Ca pital   Receipts

Capital recei pts from the disposal of assets are held in the
capital recei pts u n ap pli ed ac co unt s until such time as they
are used to fin an ce other capital ex pe nd it ur e or to repay
debt.

Deb tor s and Credi tor s

5.1    The reve nue ac co unt s of the Aut ho ri ty are ma int ain ed on
       an ac cr ual s basis in acc or da nc e with the Code of
       A cc ou nt in g Pr ac tic e and SSAP2, that is sums due to or
       fr om the Au th ori ty during the year are incl ude d whet her
       or not the cash has actua lly been rece ive d or paid in
       the year. An ex cep tio n to this princ ipl e relates to
       e l e c tr ic it y and sim il ar quarterly payments which are
       charged at the date of meter reading rather than being
       ap po rt io ne d between fi nan cia l years. This policy is
       c o n si st en tl y appl ied each year and th ere for e does not
       have a materi al eff ect on the year's accounts.

5.2    Pu rc ha s e of capital items are reco rde d on a cash basis
       and the re fo r e no debtors or credi tor s have been
       included.

      valued at the latest price paid with an al lo wan ce made for
      o b s o l e s c en t and s l o w - m o v i ng items. The basis of valuing
      st oc ks of c l o th in g and un if or ms is based on ave ra ge price.
      T h e s e m e t h o d s of va l u a t io n are dep ar tu re s from the
      r e q u i r e m e n t s of the Code and SS AP9 which req uir e st oc ks to be
      show n at actual cost or net r ea li sa bl e value, if lower.

7.    Cost   of Support Ser vi ce s

      All c os ts of ma na g e m e n t and a d m i ni st ra ti on have been fully
      al lo ca t e d to the Po li ce Service. The basis of a ll oc at io n usee

             The following is a statement of the
             Authority's accounts for 1990/91 in
             accordance with Regulation 7 of the

I certify that I have completed the audit of the Authority's
accounts for the year ended 31 March 1991 in accordance with Part
III of the Local Government Finance Act and the Code of Audit
Practice.
In my opinion the statement of accounts set out on pages 4 to 16
presents fairly the financial position of the Authority at 31
March 1991 and its income and expenditure for the year then ended.

Explanation of Financial Statements
The Authority's accounts for the year 1990/91 are set out on
pages 1 to 16. They consist of:-
the Summary Revenue Account - setting out the Authority's
    revenue income and expenditure for the year
the DSO Revenue Account - setting out the DSO's income and
    expenditure for the year, and its financial position at
    31 March 1991
the General Fund - setting out the financial position of the
    Authority at 31 March 1991
the Consolidated Statement of Revenue and Capital Movements
    - summarising the total movement of the Authority's funds
These accounts are supported by the Statement of Accounting
Policies, which follows this Foreword.
New Legislation
There have been a number of legislative changes effective
from 1 April 1990 which have had a significant impact on
local government.
The Local Government Finance Act 1988 introduced new local
government financing arrangements under which the Authority
no longer receives Revenue Support Grant in its own right. ^
Instead, grant entitlement is paid directly to the Collection
Funds administered by the South Yorkshire district councils
on which the Authority now precepts for its net estimated
requirement.
The Local Government and Housing Act 1989 established a new
system of capital finance. Under the new system, the
Authority is issued with an approved level of capital
spending, on which 51% grant is paid by central government.
The Authority also receives a credit approval which limits
the amount that can be borrowed from external sources to
finance capita] expenditure.The Authority must therefore
finance the balance of approved capital expenditure from
internal resources. Capital spending above the level of
approved expenditure does not attract grant, and so must also
be internally financed.
The Authority still receives revenue grant for debt charges
on capital expenditure incurred prior to 1 April 1990, and
will continue to do so until the payment by the government of
a lump sum to clear the grant element of borrowing
outstanding at 31 March 1990.
There are also rules on the use of capital receipts, and the
minimum debt repayments which must be charged to the revenue
account.The impact of these changes on the preparation of the
Authority's accounts are explained in the Statement of
Accounting Policies.
Changes in Accounting Policy
As a result of the above legislation, there have been a
number of changes in accounting policies.
Minimum Revenue Provision
The Authority's revenue account has been charged with a^
principal repayment equal to the minimum revenue provision
required by statute, that is 4% of the Authority's credit
ceiling. This replaces the requirement to charge the revenue
account with loan charges based on statutory loan periods
related to the lives of assets acquired. The minimum revenue
provision has been set aside to repay debt.
Capital Receipts
The Authority is required to set aside 75% of capital
receipts for repayment of debt, leaving only 25% available as
usable capital receipts to finance new capital expenditure.
Provision for Credit Liabilities
The Provision for Credit Liabilities Account comprises
amounts set aside for loan debt redemption, and has therefore
been credited with the minimum revenue provision and capital
receipts set aside. When sums are utilised to reduce external
loan debt, they are written down to capital discharged in the
accounts.
Consolidated Advances and Borrowing Pool
The Authority's borrowing is now managed through a
Consolidated Advances and Borrowing Pool (CABP), rather than
through a Consolidated Loans Fund (CLF). The CABP is similar
in operation to the CLF in that it raises external loans, and
makes advances to the Authority's capital account to finance
capital expenditure. However, as amounts are set aside as
provision for debt repayment, the total advance outstanding
from the CABP to the capital account is reduced, thereby
giving the Authority's credit ceiling. The accounting
treatment of financing capital expenditure from usable
capital receipts, capital grant or revenue contributions
remains unchanged.
Capital Discharged
The accounting treatment of capital discharged has changed.
Under the CLF method, principal repayments made by the
capital account were credited straight to capital discharged.
Under the CABP method, principal repayments are credited to
provision for credit liabilities, and only taken to capital
discharged when external debt is reduced. Also, since
principal repayments are related to the overall debt of the
Authority and not to specific assets, capital discharged is
now only shown as a global figure.
Where the money comes from
Approximately 45% of the Authority's income now comes from
precepting upon the Collection Funds of the four district
councils within the South Yorkshire area, with 44%coming
directly from the government in the form of a specific grant.
The balance of income is mainly employee contributions used
to finance the Police Pensions (5%), fees and charges and
interest on temporary investment of surplus funds.
What the money is spent on
Employee costs account for more than 85% of total
expenditure. Running expenses such as maintaining buildings,
operating vehicles and purchase of supplies and services take
up just over 12%, with capital financingcharges accounting
for the balance of 3%.
Revenue Budget
The main components of the budget and howthese compare   with
actual expenditure are set out below:

Capital Expenditure
The Authority spent £4,081,080 on capital expenditure in
1990/91 compared with an approved limit of £4,081,000, on
which £2,081,000 is payable as capital grant.The Authority
was issued with a credit approval of £902,000, which was
fully utilised by external borrowing, and the balance of
£1,098,080 was financed from internal resources.

                          SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE AUTHORITY
                          STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES
     1.    General
           The accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Code
           of Practice on Local Authority Accounting, issued in April
           1991 by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and
           Accountancy (CIPFA), and also with guidance notes issued by
           CIPFA on the application of accounting standards (SSAPs).
     2.    Fixed Assets
     2.1 Fixed assets are recorded in the general fund balance sheet
          at historical cost.
     2.2 Capital expenditure on fixed assets can be financed either by
         borrowing from external sources and paid for over a number of
         years, or can be discharged immediately by utilising capital
         grants, usable capital receipts, or revenue contribution. The
         total of capital discharged, representing the extent to which
         assets are paid for is also shown in the balance sheet. Net

•
         fixed assets therefore represents the external debt
_        outstanding on those assets.
     3.    Basis of Charges for Capital
     3.1 The Authority's borrowing, both external and internal is
         managed through a Consolidated Advances and Borrowing Pool
         (CABP). The CABP makes advances to capital accounts to cover
         capital expenditure on fixed assets not funded by internal
         resources or capital grant. These advances are authorised by
         the Government in the form of a credit approval. Outstanding
         advances are reduced when amounts are set aside as provision
         for credit liabilities (note 4). The amount outstanding at 31
         March between the CABP and the capital accounts represents
         the Authority's credit ceiling.
     3.2 The Authority's revenue account has been charged with an
         amount as principal repayment equal to the minimum revenue
         provision required by statute, this being 4% of the credit
         ceiling (note 3.1) at the end of the previous financial year.
0)   3.3 The revenue account is also charged with the interest which
         has been paid by the CABP in financing capital expenditure,
         and in 1990/91 the average rate paid was 10.04% (9.95% in
         1989/90).
      3.4 The Authority has also made a contribution fromrevenue to
          directly finance a proportion of capital expenditure.
      4.    Provision for Redemption of Debt
      4.1 From 1 April 1990, the Authority must set aside various sums
          for repayment of debt as provision for credit liabilities. A
          Provision for Credit Liabilities account has been set up and
          credited with the minimum revenue provision (note 3.2), and
          the required proportion of capital receipts (note 5). The
          provision has been partially used for the repayment of
          external debt in the current financial year.

                                             - 4 -
5.   Capital Receipts
5.1 From 1 April 1990, the Authority is required by statute to_
    set aside 75% of any capital receipt it receives as provision
    for credit liabilities (note 4). Any capital receipts
    received before 1 April 1990, but unapplied at this date,
    must be treated as if they were received on 1 April 1990.
5.2 The remainder of the capital receipts are held as usable
    capital receipts until such time as they are applied to
    finance capital expenditure.
6.   Debtors and Creditors
6.1 The revenue accounts of the Authority are maintained on an
     accruals basis in accordance with the Code of Accounting
     Practice and SSAP2, that is sums due to or from the Authority
     during the year are included whether or not the cash has
     actually been received or paid in the year. An exception to
     this principle relates to electricity and similar quarterly
     payments which are charged at the date of meter reading
     rather than being apportioned between financial years. This
     policy is consistently applied each year and therefore does
     not have a material effect on the year’s accounts.
6.2 Purchase of capital items are recorded on a cash basis and
    therefore no creditors have been included.
7.   Stocks and Stores
7.1 Other than clothing and uniforms, stocks and stores are
    valued at the latest price paid with an allowance made for
    obsolescent and slow-moving items. The basis of valuing
    stocks of clothing and uniforms is based on average price.
    These methods of valuation of stock are departures from the
    requirements of the code and SSAP9 which require stocks to be
    shown at actual cost or net realisable value, if lower.
7.2 At 31 March 1991, the Authority had significant stocks of
    fuel, which have been valued at latest price paid and
    included in the balance sheet for the first time.
8.   Cost of Support Services
8.1 All costs of management and administration have been fully
     allocated to Services. The basis of allocation used for the
     main costs of management and administration are outlined
     below:-
      Cost                         Basis of Allocation
      Joint Secretariat            Actual time spent by staff
      Democratic Processes         Actual costs
      Computing                    Actual use




                                   - 5 -
9.    Provisions
9.1 Under section 41(3)(b) of the Local Government and Housing
    Act 1989, the Authority has the power to set aside various
    provisions from revenue, firstly for losses or liabilities
    which are likely to be incurred, the amount of which cannot
    yet be determined accurately, and secondly to equalise the
    charge to revenue between financial years on irregular but
    recurring expenditure.
9.2 A contribution has been made for the first time to a Football
    Overtime Provision during the year. This has been set up to
    enable a consistent annual charge, related to a football
    season, to be made to the revenue account in future years.
    The revenue account in 1990/91 therefore includes football
    overtime from April 1990 to May 1991, that is, to the end of
    the 1990/91 football season.
9.3 An amount has also been set aside from revenue towards the
    liability for computer development costs temporarily waived
    by Doncaster MBC, but now payable as a result of a new
    contract for the provision of computer services. It is
    uncertain at this stage as to the total sum due to Doncaster
    MBC.

10.   Pensions
10.1 Pensions for Police Officers are not funded but are charged
     direct to the Authority's revenue accounts. Employee
     contributions are credited to the revenue accounts.
10.2 For other employees, the Authority pays an employer's
     contribution of 1.4% of superannuable employees' reckonable
     pay into the South Yorkshire Pensions Fund. The costs of non-
     statutory benefits to pensioners of the Fund are charged to
     the services in which pensioners were working immediately
     before their retirement.
11.   Government Grant
11.1 Revenue grant due for police and civil defence is estimated
     and credited to revenue in the financial year in which the
     expenditure is incurred.
11.2 From 1 April 1990, the Authority receives a capital grant
     from central government equal to 51% of new capital
     expenditure, provided that this does not exceed Home Office
     approved levels. The grant due in the financial year is
     applied directly to finance capital expenditure.
12.   Investments
12.1 Investments are shown in the balance sheet at cost, and
     consist of deposits of temporary surplus funds with banks or
     similar institutions.

             SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE AUTHORITY
            NOTES TO THE SUMMARY REVENUE ACCOUNT

Pensions
In 1990/91, the Authority paid an employer’s contribution of
£113,081, based on 1.4% (4.75% in 1989/90) of employees'
pensionable pay, into the South Yorkshire County
Superannuation Fund, which provides members with defined
benefits related to pay and service. The contribution rate is
determined by the Fund's Actuary based on a triennial
actuarial valuations, the last review being on 31 March 1989.
Under Superannuation Fund Regulations, contribution rates are
set to meet 75% of the overall liabilities of the Fund.
Precept Income
From 1 April 1990, the rate support grant previously paid
directly to the Authority by the government was replaced by
the revenue support grant which is now paid into the South
Yorkshire district councils' Collection Funds. The Authority
now precepts on the Collection Funds for its total estimated
requirement, and this accounts for the large increase in the
precept between the two financial years reported in the
accounts.
Publicity
Under section 5(1) of the Local Goverment Act 1986, the
Authority is required to keep a separate account of its
expenditure on publicity. In 1990/91, the Authority spent
£14,473, which consisted mainly of advertising for
recruitment of staff.

1.1   It is only possible to analyse gross fixed assets into the categories shown
      with effect from 1 April 1986, when the new Authority was formed.
1.2 Capital Discharged is shown as a global deduction from gross assets, and
    consists of the writing down of the value of assets as external debt is
    repaid, or as other resources, such as capital grants, capital receipts,
    revenue, or reserves are used in place of external borrowing. Capital
    discharged is no longer allocated to individual, or classes, of assets.
1.3 The main items of capital expenditure during the year were:-

      DISTRICT AUDITOR'S CERTIFICATE ON COMPLETION OF AUDIT



I certify that I have completed the audit of the Authority's
accounts for the year ended 31 March 1992 in accordance with Part
III of the Local Government Finance Act and the Code of Audit
Practice.
In my opinion the statement of accounts set out on pages 3 to 16
presents fairly the financial position of the Authority at 31
March 1992 and its income and expenditure for the year then ended.

                  EXPLANATORY FOREWORD

Explanation of Financial Statements

The Authority's accounts for the year 1991/92 are set out on
pages 1 to 16. They consist of:-
the Summary Revenue Account - setting out the Authority's
    revenue income and expenditure for the year
the DSO Revenue Account - setting out the DSO's income and
    expenditure for the year, and its financial position at
    31 March 1992
the General Fund - setting out the financial position of the
    Authority at 31 March 1992
the Consolidated Statement of Revenue and Capital Movements
    - summarising the total movement of the Authority's funds
These accounts are supported by the Statement of Accounting
Policies, which follows this Foreword.

Where the money comes from

Approximately 44% of the Authority’s income comes from
precepting upon the Collection Funds of the four district
councils within the South Yorkshire area, with a further 44%
coming directly from the government in the form of a specific
grant. The balance of income is mainly employee
contributions used to finance the Police Pensions (5%), fees
and charges and interest on temporary investment of surplus
funds.

What the money is spent on

Employee costs account for 86% of total expenditure. Running
expenses such as maintaining buildings, operating vehicles
and purchase of supplies and services take up approximately
12%, with capital financing charges accounting for the
balance of 2%.
4.   Revenue Budget
     The main components of the budget and how these compare with
     actual expenditure are set out below:

     1991/92 compared with an approved limit of £3,525,000, on
     which £1,798,000 is payable as capital grant.The Authority
     was issued with a credit approval of £1,016,000, which was

               STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES

General
The accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Code
of Practice on Local Authority Accounting, issued in April
1991 by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and
Accountancy (CIPFA), and also with guidance notes issued by
CIPFA on the application of accounting standards (SSAPs).

Fixed Assets
Fixed assets are recorded in the general fund balance sheet
at historical cost.
Capital expenditure on fixed assets can be financed either by
borrowing from external sources and paid for over a number of
years, or can be discharged immediately by utilising capital
grants, usable capital receipts, or revenue contribution. The
total of capital discharged, representing the extent to which
assets are paid for is also shown in the balance sheet. Net
fixed assets therefore represents the external debt
outstanding on those assets.

Basis of Charges for Capital
The Authority's borrowing, both external and internal is
managed through a Consolidated Advances and Borrowing Pool
(CABP). The CABP makes advances to capital accounts to cover
capital expenditure on fixed assets not funded by internal
resources or capital grant. These advances are authorised by
the Government in the form of a credit approval. Outstanding
advances are reduced when amounts are set aside as provision
for credit liabilities (note 4). The amount outstanding at 31
March between the CABP and the capital accounts represents
the Authority's credit ceiling.
The Authority's revenue account has been charged with an
amount as principal repayment equal to the minimum revenue
provision required by statute, this being 4% of the credit
ceiling (note 3.1) at the end of the previous financial year.
The revenue account is also charged with the interest which
has been paid by the CABP in financing capital expenditure,
and in 1991/92 the average rate paid was 9.85% (10.04% in
1990/91).
The Authority has also made a contribution from revenue to
directly finance a proportion of capital expenditure.
 Provision for Redemption of Debt
 The Authority must set aside various sums for repayment of
 debt as provision for credit liabilities. A Provision for
 Credit Liabilities account has been set up and credited with
 the minimum revenue provision (note 3.2), and the required
 proportion of capital receipts (note 5). The provision has
 been partially used for the repayment of external debt in the
 current financial year.
Capital Receipts

The Authority is required by statute to set aside 75% of any
capital receipt it receives as provision for credit
liabilities (note 4).
The remainder of the capital receipts are held as usable
capital receipts until such time as they are applied to
finance capital expenditure.
Debtors and Creditors

The revenue accounts of the Authority are maintained on an
accruals basis in accordance with the Code of Accounting
Practice and SSAP2, that is sums due to or from the Authority
during the year are included whether or not the cash has
actually been received or paid in the year. An exception to
this principle relates to electricity and similar quarterly
payments which are charged at the date of meter reading
rather than being apportioned between financial years. This
policy is consistently applied each year and therefore does
not have a material effect on the year's accounts.
Purchase of capital items are recorded on a cash basis and
therefore no creditors have been included.
Stocks and Stores

Other than clothing and uniforms, stocks and stores are
valued at the latest price paid with an allowance made for
obsolescent and slow-moving items. The basis of valuing
stocks of clothing and uniforms is based on average price.
These methods of valuation of stock are departures from the
requirements of the code and SSAP9 which require stocks to be
shown at actual cost or net realisable value, if lower.
Cost of Support Services
All costs of management and administration have been fully
allocated to Services. The basis of allocation used for the
main costs of management and administration are outlined
below:-
Cost                         Basis of Allocation
Joint Secretariat            Actual time spent by staff
Democratic Processes         Actual costs
Computing                     Actual use
9.    Provisions

9.1 Under section 41(3)(b) of the Local Government and Housing
    Act 1989, the Authority has the power to set aside various
    provisions from revenue, firstly for losses or liabilities
    which are likely to be incurred, the amount of which cannot
    yet be determined accurately, and secondly to equalise the
    charge to revenue between financial years on irregular but
    recurring expenditure.
9.2 The Football Overtime Provision has been set up to enable a
    consistent annual charge, related to a football season, to be
    made to the revenue account in future years. The Revenue
    Account in 1991/92 therefore includes football overtime for
    the 1991/92 season which runs from September 1991 to May
    1992.                                                  J
9.3 A further amount has also been set aside from revenue towards
    the liability for computer development costs temporarily
    waived by Doncaster MBC, but now payable as a result of a new
    contract for the provision of computer services. It is
    uncertain at this stage as to the total sum due to Doncaster
    MBC.

10.   Pensions
10.1 Pensions for Police Officers are not funded but are charged
     direct to the Authority's revenue accounts. Employee
     contributions are credited to the revenue accounts.
10.2 For other employees, the Authority pays an employer's
     contribution of 1.4% of superannuate employees' reckonable
     pay into the South Yorkshire Pensions Fund. The costs of non-
     statutory benefits to pensioners of the Fund are charged to
     the services in which pensioners were working immediately
     before their retirement.
11.   Government Grant
11.1 Revenue grant due for police and civil defence is estimated
     and credited to revenue in the financial year in which the
     expenditure is incurred.
11.2 The Authority receives a capital grant from central
     government equal to 51% of new capital expenditure, provided
     that this does not exceed Home Office approved levels. The
     grant due in the financial year is applied directly to
     finance capital expenditure.
12.   Investments
12.1 Investments are shown in the balance sheet at cost, and
     consist of deposits of temporary surplus funds with banks or
     similar institutions.

            NOTES TO THE SUMMARY REVENUE ACCOUNT

Pensions
In 1991/92, the Authority paid an employer's contribution of
£121,903, based on 1.4% of employees' pensionable pay, into
the South Yorkshire County Superannuation Fund, which
provides members with defined benefits related to pay and
service. The contribution rate is determined by the Fund's
Actuary based on a triennial actuarial valuations. The latest
review, due on 31 March 1992, is currently being undertaken.
Under Superannuation Fund Regulations, contribution rates are
set to meet 75% of the overall liabilities of the Fund.

Publicity
Under section 5(1) of the Local Goverment Act 1986, the
Authority is required to keep a separate account of its
expenditure on publicity. In 1991/92, the Authority spent
£12,729, which consisted mainly of advertising for
recruitment of staff.

Where the money comes from

Approximately 46% of the Authority's income comes from_
precepting upon the Collection Funds of the four district
councils within the South Yorkshire area, with a further 44%
coming directly from the government in the form of a specific
grant. The balance of income is mainly employee
contributions used to finance the Police Pensions (5%), fees
and charges and interest on temporary investment of surplus
funds.

What the money is spent on

Employee costs account for 85% of total expenditure. Running
expenses such as maintaining buildings, operating vehicles
and purchase of supplies and services take up approximately
13%, with capital financing charges accounting for the
balance of 2%.

                         SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE AUTHORITY
                         STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES

    1.    General
          The accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Code
          of Practice on Local Authority Accounting, issued in April
          1991 by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and
          Accountancy (CIPFA), and also with guidance notes issued by
          CIPFA on the application of accounting standards (SSAPs).

    2.    Fixed Assets
    2.1 Fixed assets are recorded in the general fund balancesheet
         at historical cost.
    2.2 Capital expenditure on fixed assets can be financed either by
        borrowing from external sources and paid for over a number of
        years, or can be discharged immediately by utilising capital
        grants, usable capital receipts, or revenue contribution. The
        total of capital discharged, representing the extent to which
        assets are paid for is also shown in the balance sheet. Net
        fixed assets therefore represents the external debt
        outstanding on those assets.

    3.    Basis of Charges for Capital
    3.1   The Authority's borrowing, both external and internal is
          managed through a Consolidated Advances and Borrowing Pool
          (CABP). The CABP makes advances to capital accounts to cover
          capital expenditure on fixed assets not funded by internal
          resources or capital grant. These advances are authorised by
          the Government in the form of a credit approval. Outstanding
          advances are reduced when amounts are set aside as provision
          for credit liabilities (note 4). The amount outstanding at 31
          March between the CABP and the capital accounts represents
          the Authority's credit ceiling.
A   3.2 The Authority's revenue account has been charged with an
        amount as principal repayment equal to the minimum revenue
        provision required by statute, this being 4% of the credit
        ceiling (note 3.1) at the end of the previous.financial year.
    3.3 The revenue account is also charged with the interest which
        has been paid by the CABP in financing capital expenditure,
        and in 1992/93 the average rate paid was 9.84% (9.85% in
        1991/92).
    3.4 The Authority has also made a contribution from revenue to
        directly finance a proportion of capital expenditure.




                                      -3-
  4.     Provision for Redemption of Debt
  4.1 The Authority must set aside various sums for repayment of
      debt as provision for credit liabilities. A Provision for
      Credit Liabilities account has been set up and credited with
      the minimum revenue provision (note 3.2), and the required
      proportion of capital receipts (note 5). The provision has
      been partially used for the repayment of external debt in the
      current financial year.
  5.     Capital Receipts
  5.1    The Authority is required by statute to set aside 75% of any
         capital receipts it received between 1 April 1992 and 12
         November 1992 and 50% from 13 November 1993 to 31 March 1993,
         as provision for credit liabilities (note 4).
  5.2 The remainder of the capital receipts are held as usable
      capital receipts until such time as they are applied to
      finance capital expenditure.
  6.     Debtors and Creditors
^^6.1    The revenue accounts of the Authority are maintained on an
         accruals basis in accordance with the Code of Accounting
         Practice and SSAP2, that is sums due to or from the Authority
         during the year are included whether or not the cash has
         actually been received or paid in the year. An exception to
         this principle relates to electricity and similar quarterly
         payments which are charged at the date of meter reading
         rather than being apportioned between financial years. This
         policy is consistently applied each year and therefore does
         not have a material effect on the year's accounts.
   6.2 Purchase of capital items are recorded on a cash basis and
       therefore no creditors have been included.
   7.    Stocks and Stores
   7.1   Other than clothing and uniforms, stocks and stores are
         valued at the latest price paid with an allowance made for
         obsolescent and slow-moving items. The basis of valuing
         stocks of clothing and uniforms is based on average price.
         These methods of valuation of stock are departures from the
         requirements of the code and SSAP9 which require stocks to be
         shown at actual cost or net realisable value, if lower.
   8.    Cost of Support Services
   8.1 All costs of management and administration have been fully
       allocated to Services. The basis of allocation used for the
       main costs of management and administration are outlined
       below:-
         Cost                             Basis of Allocation
          Joint Secretariat               Actual time spent by staff

9.    Provisions
9.1 Under section 41(3)(b) of the Local Government and Housing
    Act 1989, the Authority has the power to set aside various
    provisions from revenue, firstly for losses or liabilities
    which are likely to be incurred, the amount of which cannot
    yet be determined accurately, and secondly to equalise the
    charge to revenue between financial years on irregular but
    recurring expenditure.
9.2 As a result of changes in the insurance market the Authority
    changed its policy on insurance cover for 1992/93. A degree
    of self insurance is now provided through two funds:-
    a) Public and Employees Insurances Fund.
    b) Motor Insurance Fund.
9.3 Based on latest information, the Authority is likely to have
    a liability for outstanding claims for the Hillsborough
    disaster which is in excess of the Authority's insurance
    cover. Provision has, therefore, been made for the estimated
    "excess".
9.4 The Provision for Bad Debts has been increased specifically
    relating to income from the policing of football matches.
10.   Pensions
10.1 Pensions for Police Officers are not funded but are charged
     direct to the Authority's revenue accounts. Employee
     contributions are credited to the revenue accounts.
10.2 For other employees, the Authority pays an employer's
     contribution of 1.4% of superannuable employees' reckonable
     pay into the South Yorkshire Pensions Fund. The costs of non-
     statutory benefits to pensioners of the Fund are charged to
     the services in which pensioners were working immediately
     before their retirement.
11.   Government Grant
11.1 Revenue grant due for police and civil defenceis estimated
     and credited to revenue in the financial year in which the
     expenditure is incurred.
11.2 The Authority receives a capital grant from central
     government equal to 51% of new capital expenditure, provided
     that this does not exceed Home Office approved levels. The
     grant due in the financial year is applied directly to
     finance capital expenditure.
12.   Investments
12.1 Investments are shown in the balance sheet at cost, and
     consist of deposits of temporary surplus funds with banks or
     similar institutions.

            NOTES TO THE SUMMARY REVENUE ACCOUNT

Pensions
Uniformed Police
In 1992/93 the net costs of pensions and other benefits
amounted to £10.612 million, representing 17% of pensionable
pay. Using research information available it is estimated
that if the cost of pensions under the scheme had been
determined in accordance with SSAP 24 "Accounting for Pension
costs" the regular cost of the scheme would have been £12
million, representing 20% of pensionable pay, while the cost
of spreading the unfunded accrued liability over 40 years
would have been an additional £17 million, representing 28%
of pensionable pay.
Other Employees
In 1992/93, the Authority paid an employer's contribution of
£131,533, based on 1.4% of employees' pensionable pay, into
the South Yorkshire County Superannuation Fund, which
provides members with defined benefits related to pay and
service. The contribution rate is determined by the Fund's
Actuary based on a triennial actuarial valuations. The latest
review being at 31 March 1989.
Under Superannuation Fund Regulations, contribution rates are
set to meet 75% of the overall liabilities of the Fund.
The Fund's actuary has advised that the pension costs that it
would have been necessary to provide for in the year in
accordance with SSAP 24 "Accounting for pension costs" are
£723,432 representing 7.7% of pensionable pay.
Further information can be found in the South Yorkshire
Pension Fund's Annual Report which is available upon request.
Publicity
Under section 5(1) of the Local Government Act 1986, the
Authority is required to keep a separate account of its
expenditure on publicity. In 1992/93, the Authority spent
£34,269, which consisted mainly of advertising for
recruitment of staff.

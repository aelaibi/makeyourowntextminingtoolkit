                   attended matches,            three in all, at Wembley Stadium.

                                      and m y s e 1f decided that we w o u 1d attend the F.A. Cup semi­

set off         in my    car to Sheffield.            The only stop we had en route was at

the    first      service     station on the Ml m o t o r w a y north of the Mil                      to

purchase         petrol.     We did not have a n V delays en route w ha ts o ev e r                        due

I have      been shown a diag ra m            illustrating          the H i ll s bo r ou g h stadium and

from that         I can say        I parked the       car about       ten to fifteen minutes'

He was a white youth.                 He had another man w ith him.

This man who had a Liverpool                   a c c e n t of^sst^ed us      'standing*       tickets        in

w a l k e d away.

This     man was        in a group of men,          one of who m        ran after      us and told us

that     for an extra £ 5.00 we              could have      ’s t a n d i n g ’ tickets    for the

The    tunnel    was       empty w hen we went               through       it and I recall             us going to

the    left    on coming         out     of    it.     Very few people were                in that         particular

pen,    Pen 4, at that time,
                \               c a t .
I recall       twoXLub         stewards standing                  near    the tunnel       entrance, an d a few

others    by^^sjpt^ turnstiles                A to G .

I lay on the terrace                sunbathing           reading my m atch              programme.           All     three

of us had            walk      round looking for the best spot                          to watch the g a m e .

At about 2.00             pm   ( H P O > the same date,               due to more spectators                   entering

the Ground,          we took      up\he          position we were             going      ter watch the game

from.     This       position was about                ten feet          to the    left of the tunnel                  when

looking at       the       pitch from the tunnel and about                         one third of the

distance       down the         terrace        from the tunnel.

Fro m this time what              I w ould        call       normal      crowd surges o cc urred where

you were       pushed forward towards                    the      pitch    in a tight        group.          ihe

pressure w ould then              release and you                 could get       back to your           original

position.           I think      these        surges were          occurring       when    chanting was

surge took       place.        I was    scared stiff.         I was    carried along with John

and D avid further down the terrace.                    D avid got      caught on a barrier and

Joh n was     next to him.

I was    carried on past the side of the barrier                       for a distance           of about

eight    to ten feet down the terrace and sligh tl y                      left towards Pen 5.

J. could see David and J oh n but not talk to them properly.                                  The

pressure was        terrific and         people all     round were        fighting      for their

lives    to get o u t .

I was    having     d if fi cu lt y breathing at times           but    I mana ge d to work my

wa y back to Ds^vid and John.

I saw that                was    pi nned by his stomach off the               barrier

Shouts were       coming from the          crowd,     resembling       " S o m e o n e ’s died h e r e 5',

I could not move an             inch.     The     pressure was    enormous.           People were

                      A man of about 35 years,                 white and very tall,              w e aring     blue jeans,          blue

                      fshirt and a        light brown j a c k e t, was           gassed over my head from behind

                      somewhere.          His    face was      blue and he was motionless,                     I believe        he was

                      dead.       His   shirt was       up and       I could see a lot of bruising                    to his

         $            s/tomach and        che s t „    He was       passed over      the fence          to Police Officers

                      who    then just      stood at the fence again.

                      sjtraight hair.            He was wearing a dark blue                 jacket.         His    stomach was

                      was    dead

              a       About    two feet         in front      of me to my        right    I saw a white            lad in his

                      c o l o u r ed tracksuit        top.     The    crush was      now spasmodic and              in one of the

                      times    the      crush lessened        I saw      this lad slump out of sight.                      It was

                      as    if the      crowd    was holding         him up.       I do not know whether              he    was

                      dead,    but      he d i d n ’t reappear.

                      The    crowd      eased and I got         back to the barrier             where       I saw the       lad

                      draped over         it.

             carried      over      the heads       of the    crowd,      over the fence         onto the        pitch.       1

             then w orked my way over               to the fence between Pens 4 and 5 and found a

              Race of about              three   feet    in width empty against              the fence.         This    gap

             e xt ended from the            pitch fence       for about         ten feet     up the terrace.

             I saw      people      sitting      on the terrace and others               being   sick.          I passed a

             lad of about           19 -- £0 years        over   the fence        to the Police        on the other

             I was      joined by a white            lad of about 28              30 years.      He was well           built

             and w a s wearing a blue and white hooped                          rugby type shirt.

             The    crowd started           passing      dead people       to us w hi ch we handed over                the

             fence.       I have        no doubt that        these      people were      dead.      All    of them had

             a bluish         tinge      to their   faces and were silent and motionless.

             I would describe              'UTenTN^s^ follows:                                             ^

             The other        two were white males.                 I cannot      describe     them any further.

             pick                 up, w hich     he did.

             The    er&Wjl was          trying   to move     over      to a gate      that had been opened             in

             wearing      jeans an d a^dark             blue Jacket.        This man was         located about          one

the fence        to Pen 5 and \ h e       nearest      goal   post.       I think this man rpay

have     been the one        I had earlier         seen slum pe d over         the b a r r i e r .

I fell      onto    this man and got up onto my knees                   but was knoc ke d over

a ga in by the       crowd.     It was at this time             I thought       I was going          to be

t ra mp le d to deaths^       However,         a big S c o t ti s h man    pulled me to my feet.

He held my head ab ov e\ th e           crowd because         I was     struggling        to breathe.

E ve ry on e    seemed to be     rushing        to get to this         gate over      by Pen 5 that

was     open.

The S co ts m an was asking me            if I was      okay.     I felt dizzy and sweltering

hot.      I recovered from this and made my way over to the fence to Pen 5

and then up the terrace               u nd er ne at h the seated stand above.                 People

w e r e b e i ng lifted up i n t o t h e        seated area.

I 'SriHjld say that the         period of time that             had    passed from the first                  bad

lost     both ofNqis        shoes.     We made our way up the terrace towards                         the

tunnel.         It was   tVqw becoming         quite easy to move about.

All     three    of us went    through the tunnel             where     I saw lots        of people

lying     on bla^nkets being a t t en d ed to by memb er s                of all     the E m e r g e n c y

Outs id e      the turnstiles was a police              cordon by a fence.               Be hi nd the

    Whe n             was    leaving       to go to the a mbulance           I got up to go

    to the hospital           by car,       I saw a ma n of about           forty years ask one of

    the Police Officers              in the    cordon    if he could         look after       his    son.

    The P ol i c e ma n said that          he had to stop      i nthe       cordon so I offered.                 The

    man went       off to try and get help for              his son.

    The     lad was about          14 years    old;    in fact he told me that and                  I think he

    told me his        name was                     He was wearing a black and white                  thin

    hooped T-shirt and b l u e jeans.                  He was white with short               dark   brown

    I. chatted to him for a while about footbal 1 and he talked back.                                       He

    was     shaking    badly so       1 a sked a P o li ce ma n for         his jacket       to put    round

    I carried on talking              to him.       He stopped shaking and ws talked about

    football.         I began talking          in detail    to him about            games    I ’d been to

    when an A m b u l a n ce m an     came up       iNi me and said,        "You are a little          late

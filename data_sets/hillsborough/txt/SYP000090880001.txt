              I am a m a rr ie d man and           I live at the above address wit h my wife and

              two       children.      have    been                                       for   the    pa         three and a

              half years




              I support Liverpool            Football         club/and have a season ticket                          for   the

              stand at Anfield,         for    the Ke ml em Roa d entrance.                          I have       held a season

              ticket at A n fi el d since           1968 or          1969.       I usually a tt e nd home               games

              that Liverpool         play,    but g enerally do not travel                           to awa y games,         in

              fact,       I d o n ’t even go to G oo di s on Park,                when Liverpool              play E ver to n

              there.

              On Satur da y      15th April        1989       (150489),        Liverpool         were       due    to play

              N o tt i n g h a m Forest,' in the      semi          final     of the FA Cup.                The    game was to

be    played at the H i l l s b or o ug h Stadium,                   in    Sheffield.      I have been         to

Hi 1 1 sbo rough S ta di um several             timear in the              past and was there for the

FA Cup Semi Final              t he previous Reason.                  I was seated       in the N orth

S ta n d    in the semi        final     in 19f

For    the game          on 15th April        1989    (150489),            I had obtained       from

Liverpool          Football       Club a ticket         for the West S t a n d .          I believe       that

this       ticket was       priced at £12.00.

I am a member             of Liverpool        football        supporters           club and    I tra ve ll ed to

S h ef fi el d on one         of their booked           coaches,           I don't    know the    name of the
                                                      c-~>\ . ^
bus    company.

31 t r a velled      in company w^ith

and his son                             and

The    coach departed*'from outside                  the Liverpool                supporters    club,    early

in the morn i ng           I'm not sure        of the exact               time.     We did not stop on the

jour n e y and a r ri ve d          in S he f fi e ld at about             12 noon    (1200).     We    parked

in a long          line of other         coaches,      all with Liverpool               fans aboard.           I

think       it was       near a police        transport area,               and not far from the

football       ground.         There were       several           uni fo rm ed     policemen    in this area

and one       came onto our            coach as      it parked and made a general                  statement

abou*t not abus in g           the alcohol        restrictions at sporting                    events.    AS we

started to          leave     our    bus,   people were            being     searched at       random,    in

particular          the younger         lads were      searched.,

In my       company of friends,             I wa lk ed towards              the football       ground.     Due

to the       police       presence you        could not walk               to the Forest       end of the

ground,       or    into    the     centre of Sheffield,                  you were more or       less

directed towards              the football        ground,

T o g ether w i t h my friends we made our way to a public                               house for a d r ^ n k

and something             to e a t .    I can't      remember         the name of this          public

house.        It was       not f.ar from the football                     ground,    and we sat outside at

the back.           We    left the      put! and w al k ed back towards                the ground and
                                                                                                       PAlaE         C
                                                                                                       S3514

a r r i v e d outside     the    turnstiles at about 2 .30                 pm (1430).        The street

was    very busy w ith supporters,                   it was a nice dry day and the

a tmos p h e r e amongst        the -fans was        really good.            People were       singing and

laughing and joking,              and enjoying          themselves.           I remember some

N ot t i n g h a m Forest      fans wal king along            in the    crowd of m ai n ly Liverpool

fans,    and there was a lot of good natured banter going                                on amongst          the

fans.      I d i d n ’t see many            policemen as       1 wa lk ed down the hill              leading

to the ground.            As    I got       to the bottom of the hill                there was about a

dozen or so Police O f ficers                  standing ar ou nd and           checking      people     to

make    sure they were           not going        to take      cans of alcohol          into    the ground.

At about 2 . 3 Q ^ m          (1430)    outside      the t urnstiles          entrance,      I saw some

p o 1 i c m e n , but   not    too many,       the   police were        not A x recting        the

supporters        to particular             turnstiles,       I r emembered that         last y e a r , that

you had to show your              ticket       to g et /b ey on d ifhe gates          leading    to the

t u r n s t i l e s , but this    t i m e , the f a 1 i ce w»fe        not    in such    large numbers

in this area and were                 not    che/king       thfif supporters        to see   if they had

tickets.        C o n s e q u e n t l y the area b e y / n d    these    gates       leading    to the

turnstiles was a mass              of       people. / T h e r e was     no recognisable          queue       that

you    could join.            I didn't       have a clue w hich turnstile               I should make

for,    there was a surge              in the     crowd      and                         and

who were      going      to the L ep pings Lane              terrace area, got s eparated              from

the    rest of us.            I only saw one         pol icrnan standing            beside the

turnstile.         Once you got             over the    initial     pushing         beside the gate

area,    and made your w ay towards                  the turnstiles           for    the West Stand,           the

crowd was       not     too b a d .     I never      even saw any moun te d Poli cmen I

had not found the              crowd outside,          at    tj/at time,     to have    caused me too

muc h of a problem             in getting        inside^

I entered the ground through the\yproper turnstile                                  and handed           my ticket

to the turnstile              operator.

I never saw any           of the       large gates at the football                   ground being       opened
at any time.

I remember           that while    I/was still       outside       the ground that a               loud

speaker a n n o u n c e m e n t/was made asking             people     to stop pushing whether

this a n n ou nc em en t ^ a s made        from    inside     the ground or outside,                  I c a n ’t

say.

Once     inside       the ground,    I saw a lone           p olicewoman         I showed her my

ticket and a sk ed her            if I was going        in the       right d i re ct io n and she

told me       that     I was.     I never    saw any stewards             in this a r e a .

In company w ith my friends we entered the West Stand and as                                       I got       into

the    stand,        I saw a steward at this          point of         control.          I showe d him my

ticket and asked him where my seat was,                         this    steward just            said to

me,    !'It’s up there."           I said,    “Where,        up t h e r e ? ”     and he just said              "Up

there."        This     steward did not appear              to know exactly where my seat

was.      This man had a Liverpool                accent and       I w on de r ed       if he     could have

been a Liverpool           steward.        I walked towards            the a rea this           steward had

indicated and saw another                 steward.      I asked this man where my seat was

and on checking my ticket,                 this stew ar d at once d ir ected me to my

seat.       It was about S . 50 pm          (1450)    by the time            I got to my seat.                 The

teams were           not yet    out on the field.

I ’ve just          r emembered that while         1' was    queuing at the turnstile,                    an

incident        took    place.     This    involved 3 lads,            and      it a pp ea r ed   to me that

they had tickets           for another       part of the ground and should not be

a tte m p t i n g    to use this    turnstile       entrance.          In any event,            the

turnstile           operator    let the first 2 or the 3 lads                    into   the ground

through his turnstile              but    refused a dm i ss i on to the             third lad.         The

third      lad was a coloured youth.

I settled down to w atch the                game,    I saw nothing              unusual    inside the

ground.         It was about 2 .50         pm (1450).         I saw the teams             come out and

the game        kick    off.

1 continued to watch the game and                    remember Peter B EA R DS L EY hitting a

                                                                                                                   S3514

                shot against       the N o tt i n g h a m Forest       cross    bar.

                It was just       following        this    incident     that    I first     realised that          there

                was a problem inside              the ground.        This was when        I saw the Liverpool

                goalkeeper      go behind his goal,             while    the match was         still    in progress

                and watc h e d as     he was       talking     to an official,          possibly a policeman.

                My a t t en t i o n was    now d ir ec te d to the L ep pings Lane             t er racing    in front

                of the West S t a n d .          I could only see the           front    section of the

            ,   terracing     from my       position.         I could see  people trying to c l i m b over
£>.H.                                                                     ---------
                the    periveter     fence,       from this     terracing, some policemen w/re hitting

1               out at these       fans and        pushing     them back       into the terracin/g.           I also

                saw other     policemen          pulling at the fence with their handXi at the same

        •       time,    and trying        to    rip the mesh fence off.

                The    game was    stopped and the            players were        rounded up and taken off the
        i.      field of p l a y .

                I saw fans being           pulled       into our stand from the terracing                below.          I

                wasn't    sure why this was happening.                   I left my seat and went             out to

                the    toilet and from there              I could see a lot of ambulances,                 fire

                engines and       police        cars all    filling     up the Leppings Lane.              I came out

                the toilet and saw some                 p o 1i cmen in the     passagewawy.        I a sk ed one         of

                the    policemen what was going               on and he told me that the m at ch was

                a ba n do n ed and a d v i s e d me to      rejoin my     party and make my way out of the

                ground back       to our transport.             I went    back     to my seat and just

                then an a nn ou nc e me n t was          broadcast     that    the m at ch was a b a n d o n e d    I ’m

                not sure of the           rest of the message.

                Wit h my friends we             left    the ground about 4 pm <1600)             and wa lk ed back

                to our    coach.      I had no involvement with                 injured or d ec ea se d       persons.

                Once    down the stand staircase               I was    i mmediately outside           the ground.

                I was very a ng ry at the events                I had witnessed,          The full     horror       of

                what was happening was                 beginning   to sink      in with me.        I was     crying and

                angry.     I saw a lot of              po licemen about       it was    very noticeable        that
                                                                                                       PAGE         i
                                                                                                       S3514

    there was       so man y around,            much more    than we had seen earlier.                 The

    crowd was       very quiet,          even the       police   seemed down.

    V ir tu al l y straight awa y outside                the ground,    I saw a policeman,             that    I

    believe was an          Inspector,          other    policemen were      in the area.         As    I was

    so angry       I shouted at this man and he told me to calm down,                            but    I

    shouted back       telling          him to “fuck off."           I was   distraught     by this          time

    and    crying and                   just    led me away.

    At the    coaches       I saw       another man        I believe to      be a Police    Inspector.

    This man held a clip                board and he a pp ea re d to         be giving   instructions

    to other Policemen.                 I shouted towards          this man and we e x ch an ge d a few

    words and       I sat    in the bus.           I ’ts   not   like me     to have any    outbursts,

    even my friends were                sur pr is ed at me,

                            and                    didn't    show up after a time,          so    I walked

    back    to the    corner of the entrance                of the    road we were       parked    in and

    stood waiting       for them.              After about 5 or       10 minutes    they both          came up

    the    road.     This was a great             relief    to me.     We went    back    to our bus

    a nd waited to be e sc orted to the motorway.                       Our bus had a phone on

    board which were were a l lo we d               to use on the       return journey,          to let our

    families       know that we were             safe and well,       we were    going to use the

    m ot o r w a y services       telephone,       but the Police       had blocked off          the

    entrances an d the            bus    could not get       in.

    I was    not    injured       in any way.           I did not    lose any property.

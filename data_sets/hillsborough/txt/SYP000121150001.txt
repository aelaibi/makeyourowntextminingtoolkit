             At 0945 am on Saturday,       15th April    1989,   (130489)   I commenced duty at

             the Hillsborough Football Ground,          briefing   commenced at   1000 am in

             the North Stand,       conducted by Chief Superintendent Ouckenfield,             and

             other senior officers.        I was under the supervision of PS Chapman

             serial one which covered the track area of the ground.               After

             completion of the briefing       1 took up post lion on the track under the

             North Stand near to the West Stand 7 Leppings Lane end,              Usually 1

             always work the track below the West Stand but for some              reason I

             stayed at the North Stand on this          particular match.      1 then commenced

             patrol around the track area noticing a few Liverpool              fans were

             already within the central       pen of the West Stand-        The Spion Kop was

             also beginning to get a trickle of Nottingham Forest fans in.

             At approximately       1.43 pm (1343)    X went to the gymnasium on direction o-

             PS Chapman for a hot meal.        I returned about S . 13 pm (1413)      to see

             that the Spion Hop was almost full with Nottingham Forest fans, as 1

             walked past the first gate of the Hop I was called back by several

             Liverpool    fans    requesting that 1 escort them to the West St avid so

             that they could be with their own side.             1 asked them where there

             ticket allocation was for within the ground,            they stated the Spion

             Hop.   1 refused them stating that they should stand to the left of
                                                                                                                PAGE
                                                                                                                R 4 7 1>

the Kop       in a p a r ti ti on ed area           set a side         for Liverpool           fans,

a p p r o x i m a t e l y t w en ty L i verpool       fans     came     to ask the same                question

whi l s t    I was      speaking        to this    p articular          youth,      a gain they were all

refused.          I told them           to return       to their        places,       they then became

abusive       and      I walked a w a y .        I took       up my     position a r o u n d           the    track

an d   remained there a w a it i n g             kick off.           I could see that all                    area of

the ground were             full apart         from the        extreme        pens s i t u a t e d      in the West

S t a n d where L i ve rp oo l         s u pporters          were,     but I did not tend to take

m u c h notice as          I c on c e n t r a t e d on       the N o r t h Stand where           I was stood.

The    crowd was          very    noisy?      chanting and           singing and          I could not           hear

an y   radio t ra ns mi s s i o n s       whatsoever.

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 . 5 0    pm (1450)       the Liv e r p o o l     fo o t b a l l e r s   came out

o nto t he       p it c h , a ga in     I d i d no t t a k e a ny       no t i ce of the         p i% chi a rea

only     the N o r th S t a n d where          1 was.         As kick      off took         place       1 saw

Liverpool         fans     climbing       over    the fencing           from the        central         pen    in the

lower West S t a n d          into the extreme               pens.      The    central        peri now        looked

ov e rc ro wd ed and        I could see          that        there was still room              in the         outer

a re a s .    1 a g a i n d i d n o t g i v e i t a s e co n d t h o u g h t and             ca r r i© d o n w i th

my own duties.

At 3 . 0 5 / 6    pm    (1505)      I was aware          of Po l i c e Officers           coming onto           the

pitch and         could see L i ver pool            fans      from the West Stand                spilling           onto

the    pitch,       1 i m m ed i a t e l y thought        that N o t t i n g h a m Forest          fans       had

m a n a g e d to get      into the West Stand and that                        fighting was             taking       place

a n d that P o l i ce O f f i ce rs were            bringing         them out       to transfer              them to

the S pion Kop.             I still       could hear          no   radio      transmissions             taking

place.        I remember          an a nn ou n c e m e n t    being made        on the tannoy                by Police

C o n s t a b l e Rya n   in the       control      box      but   I c o u l d n ’t hear any of               it due

to the       noise     and m ay h e m on the         pitch.          N o t t i n g h a m Forest        fans were

chanting         towards     the West Stand,              it became        obvious       from w a t c h i n g        that

there was a m ajor               problem w i t h o v e r c r o w d i n g and fans were                  now

                                                                                                                                         R476

straying          onto       the       pitch       area where            the       match       was      taking           place,          I saw

a    senior       officer          run       onto     the     pitch and                take    hold         of    the      referees             arm

and    obviously             ask       for    p lay      to   be    stopped.                This       he    did and           the

footballers                ran    up    the     players        tunnel.                 I then      saw a y o un g              man with

his    arm       totally          broken        as    though        it       had       been    embedded            around           the

steel       barriers             within       the     pen.         He    was       taken       by a St.            John

Ambulanceman                towards          the     gym area.               It    then       struck         me    t hat       not       only

was    there          overcrowding              but      casualties               as    well.          Still       there          was      no

command          or    none       heard       as     to w h a t     we       as    police         officers            should          be      doing

at    this       stage.           I then        saw      hoardings            being         ripped          from aro un d             the

track       by    both       police          and     football           fans,          casualties            were        being        carried

on    these       hoardings             wh ic h were          being          u s e d as       stretchers              towards            the

gymnasium             area.        There        were      hundreds            of       police      and       f an s      on    the       pitch

but    s t i ll       no    instructions              were     made          and       it wa s     a case          of      doing         what

everyone          thought          they       s h o u l d at, the            time.          I tried          to    calm        drunken

Liverpool             fans       down who          had    come      to       the       front      of    the       North        Sita n d       in

order       to    jump       over       onto       the    pitch,         1 was          explaining               that      there         was

enough       problems             at    the     moment        and       they       would       only         contribute              to     that

further          by    going       onto       the     pitch,        this          they      ignored and               became          very

abusive          and        I expected             getting     a s s a u l t e d at           t his     stage         by      them       so     1

left     them and             walked          up     to the W e s t       Stand         area      to    see        if     1 could help

anyone.           As        1 approached              1 saw a dr unk en Liverpool                            youth         run      down

lot    of    shouting             and    abuse        going        off       around         the    pitch          area        by all

concerned             and    1 remember              thinking           t hat      besides         trying          to      deal       with a

major       incident             there       was     going     to       be    a pitch          invasion            a n d a full

with- c o a t s / j u m p e r s         o ver      their      heads          and       it   only       then       struck         me      that       a

   m ajor      disaster          had happened.             I helped        injured      people     to the       gym

   area,       a w o m a n who        was       frantically       looking     for her h u s b a n d       came and

   grabbed ho 1d of me and begged me to                                look for       her husb a n d w ith her

   which       I    did and we e v e nt u a ll y found him safe and well                           at    the    gym

   area.           She    t h an ke d and hugged me and they went                       on their way-             Whilst

   at    the gym area              I s ta rt ed together w i t h another                  p o l i c e w o m a n obtaining

   names and a d dresses,                      phone   numbers     if possible          of    casualties        being

   t ra n s p o r t e d to hospital               by amb u l a n c e    so that       some    reference        could be

   made       to    people       e nq ui r i n g about      relatives/friends.

   A fter a short while                   l'*m not       sure of the        time      I went    into the

   g y m n as i u m area and saw the extent                       of what     had happened,             dead    bodies

   were       beginning          to be         laid    in rows    into some        type      of order     if that was

   possible.              A Detective Sergeant                724 H a l l o w s a p p r o a c h e d me whilst           in

   would       be dealing w i t h this                  sudden death.

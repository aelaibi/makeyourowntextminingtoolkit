Thank you for vour letter of 18 June to Jack Straw, enclosing one from

         \   in support of calls for a new inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster.

As you know, the Home Secretary has been considering whether there is a
case for a further public inquiry into the disaster in the light of the many
representations which have been received. Concerns that a number of issues
relating to the disaster remain unresolved received renewed attention following
the Granada television documentary drama "Hillsborough" last December.

The Home Secretary has had the opportunity to consider fully the material
which has been put forward, calling for a new public inquiry. He has decided,
in all the circumstances, that there should be an independent scrutiny to ensure
that no matter of significance is overlooked before a final decision is taken.
To this end, as you will know, he announced in the House on 30 June that he
had invited Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior Lord Justice of the Court of
Appeal to conduct the scrutiny. I enclose for your information a copy of the
Home Secretary's statement to the House, which includes Lord Justice Stuart-
Smith's terms of reference. You will see that he has undertaken to make public
the advice which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith gives him.

It is our earnest hope that the independent scrutiny will finally bring an end to
the uncertainty over the events of that terrible afternoon.

Dear Jack


RE: Hillsborough Justice Campaign


Please find attached a copy of a letter I have received from one
of my constituents requesting that a new enquiry be held into the
Hillsborough disaster.

I am sure that you are receiving many letters on this subject and
would be grateful if you would let me know if you are thinking of
setting up a new enquiry into this matter.

I look forward to hearing from you.

With best wishes

Yours sincerely




Andy Love MP

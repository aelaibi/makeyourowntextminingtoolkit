RE-EXAMINATION OF ALL-SEATING AT FOOTBALL GROUNDS

I am enclosing with this letter a copy of today's announcement by
the Secretary of State that he has been re-examining the all­
seating requirement for Football League grounds. Mr Mellor is now
inviting further representations from a number of interested
organisations before taking a final decision.

Today's announcemnt focuses on the shape and scope of the re­
examination. You will wish to note in particular that the
Secretary of State has ruled out any review of the principle of
or timetable for all-seating at First Division grounds in the
Football League (the new Premier Division). He is also firmly
committed to the principle of all-seating for the majority of
Second Division clubs.

The main focus of the re-examination is therefore likely to be
whether there are compelling reasons not to proceed with an all-
seater requirement at all Third and Fourth Division clubs in the
Football League. It is also looking at Second Division clubs
with very low average attendances, with a view that there should
be as few anomalies as possible. The more detailed issues which
are being addressed are set out in the annex to this letter.

It would be helpful to have your views on these points by Friday
3 July. A list of bodies from whom views are also being elicited
is attached.

ISSUES TO BE CONSIDERED DURING THE REVIEW OF THE GOVERNMENT'S
ALL-SEATER POLICY IN ENGLAND AND WALES


The Government has decided that it would be wrong to review
either the principle or the timetable for all-seating at First
Division grounds in the Football League (the new Premier League).
The Government also remains committed to the principle of all­
seating for the majority of Second Division clubs who attract
large numbers of supporters and who aim to join the Premier
League.

The Secretary of State is therefore focusing his examination on
the following issues:

     i.    whether standing accommodation should be allowed at
           some Third and Fourth Division grounds. If so, should
           this be:

           a.   in all cases (subject to the FLA determining that
                the terracing is safe) ; or

           b.   on the basis of a fixed capacity threshold (say
                10,000) above which clubs must go all-seating;


     ii.   whether, in view of average attendances at some Second
           Division clubs being significantly lower than at some
           Third Division clubs, standing accommodation should
           also be retained at those Second Division grounds;

     iii. under what circumstances could an extension of the
          August 1994 deadline be relaxed for any Second Division
          club.
     iv. what transitional arrangements, if any, will be
           appropriate for clubs which are promoted;

     v.    whether any special arrangements should be made for a
           match in a cup competition where a big club is due to
play "away" at a small club where all-seating is not
required, or for a league match between two small clubs
but where a large attendance is anticipated.

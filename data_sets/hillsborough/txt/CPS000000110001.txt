 essence o f h er argum ent m ay be expressed very shortly, as follows.
    (a) Section 6(1) confers no powers o f any kind. All the pow ers possessed by                    T he role o f the Secretary o f State is principally given by ss36 and 37(1).
 police authorities are conferred elsew here in the 1996 Act and by th e local                       Section 36(1) provides:

                                                                                                           ‘T he Secretary o f State shall exercise his pow ers under the provisions o f

                                                                                                         this Act referred to in subsection (2) in such m anner and to such extent as
 objects', in the language o f Padfield's case, as they apply to police authorities. If
                                                                                                         appears to him to be best calculated to prom ote the efficiency and
 this is right, it w ould contradict M r Baker's first argum ent, that s 6(1) alone is
                                                                                                         effectiveness o f the police.’
 enough to em pow er the SYPA to fund D and M.
    (b) Section 111(1) cannot be read as enabling the authority to do anything                  f    Section 37(1) provides:
 w hich is n o t ancillary to a p o w er w hich is elsew here conferred upon it. If this is
 right, then taken w ith (a) it contradicts Mr Baker’s second argum ent w hich relies                    ‘The Secretary o f State may by order determine objectives for the policing o f the

    T here is no do u b t th at express pow ers are conferred on police authorities by a             As regards the Secretary o f State's position, I should notice also these provisions
 raft o f statutory provisions. Miss Baxendale says that such provisions support                _    o f the 1996 Act.
 proposition (a) w hich I have set out, by application o f the canon o f statutory
 construction expressed by the Latin maxim ‘expressio unius est exclusio alterius’.                  Section 38(1):
 Thus, she subm its, w here Parliam ent has seen fit to confer a range o f specific                         ‘W here an objective has been determ ined under section 37, the Secretary

 limits on w hat such an authority m ay do and it cannot be supposed th at s 6 ( 1)                      (‘‘perform ance targets") to be aim ed at in seeking to achieve the objective.’
 provides an undefined and open-ended p o w er to do anything else w hich the                   ^
 authority m ay choose, m erely o n the ground th at in som e w ay it may be said to                 Section 39(1):

     I shall have to look in a little m ore detail at s 88(4). I have concluded, however,
  that the correctness or otherwise o f proposition (a) is not in the end at the centre of                 ‘(2) In discharging its functions, every police authority established under

   In feet I think the b etter view is th at s 6 ( 1) enables the police authority to do     (in administrative receivership) v
things which reasonably support the function w hich s 6 ( 1) confers. Such a pow er          Michael Gerson (Finance) pic [Ch Dl                          [9]     811
is by no m eans open-ended. It w ould n o t allow the authority to invade the
provinces o f the chief constable o r the Secretary o f State; and this is an im portant
and considerable constraint.
   In the course o f argum ent som e tim e w as spent, in feimess at the
encouragem ent o f the court, in seeing w h eth er the specific provisions in the
 1996 Act o r the local governm ent legislation, conferring specific pow ers o n the
police authority, left gaps w hich only s 6(1) could fill. Points w ere made about
low er ranks' rights o f representation in legal proceedings, w hich are covered as
appropriate by the Police Federation; and about the representation o f higher
ranks in various forms o f legal proceedings. But the answ er to the question we
m ust decide, w hether the pow er to fund D and M in principle lies in the hands o f
the SYPA, cannot in m y ju d g m en t depend on a traw l through all the things a
police authority is expressly em pow ered to do. T he provisions w hich expressly
confer and im pose pow ers and duties o n police authorities do not constitute an
independent code. T he police authority's functions are, to use a questionable
 m odernism , symbiotic w ith those o f the chief constable and the Secretary o f
State. So judged, and for the reasons I have given, they allow the use o f s 111( 1)
 to fund officers in the defence o f private prosecutions and in judicial review
proceedings.
    I w ould allow this application.

FA - Hillsborough
Attdg Adrian Titcombe o/t. AT phoned to tell me he had
looked at the first draft of the proposed letter to the
League clubs. He was happy with the content of the letter,
but there were a couple of things* the FA wanted to change.
Firstly, the FA wanted to take out all references to the
Popplewell report and also take out the appended
recommendations from the Popplewell report. Secondly, the
FA wanted a positive feedback from the clubs on any
difficulties the clubs encountered with the enclosed

contact   him when he got back from holiday.             j

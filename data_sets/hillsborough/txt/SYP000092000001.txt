                I am a single                   man and       I live at         Jdie a b o v e    address       with my       parents       and

               my younger                 brother.



                I support             Liverpool             footba         XUD n       I do      not    have    a season        ticket      for

               Liverpool              and       o n l y a t tepc/ a b o u t     3 Liverpool            games    each     season.          I do,

                however,             go    to    see    Peterborough            play    sometimes.              I also    play     football

               and        this       prevents          me    from attending            games      on a    regular        basis.




               On Saturday                 15th April            1989    <150489) Liverpool               were     to    p la y N o t t i n g h a m

               Forest        at H i l l s b o r o u g h S t a d i u m         in S h e f f i e l d     in the     semi-final         of    the

               FA Cup        competition.                    I ha d     never    been       to   this    football        ground      before

                that       day.
I decided           to    go       to S h e f f i e l d w i t h a f riama,                                                           of

                                                             tried/fo           obtain           tickets        for       this       game       and

he    t o l d me     that          he    had w r i t t o f f              to    try       to     obtain        tickets          but w a s

unable        to    get       any                          and     I decided              to     travel        to S h e f f i e l d        in

                                         tickets          once    we      got       th e r e .                       t o l d me       that        h

went     to    the       same/fixture                the y e a r       before          and       h ad m a n a g e d       to    bu y a

ticket        outside          the       ground.                           t o l d me          that      he    knew where             the

ticket        touts       hang          about       and    that      we    would          get     tickets           in S h e f f i e l d ,




I left        my    ho u s e ,      on m y         own,    at a b o u t        9.15 am           (0915)        on    15th A p r i l            1989

<150 4 8 9 )       and    drove          to                       house,            where        I collected              him.        I wa s

driving        my    blue          V a u x h a l 1 Nova         car.       We       left S t a m f o r d        straight             away

and    travelled              on the          A1    road.        I did         get     a bit         lost      in N e w a r k        on the

journey        to S h e f f i e l d .              I stopped         once       on the           journey,           on    the A 1 , at           a

little        "Happy Eater,"                      this was ab out              9.30 am           (0930)        on    the       road       to

Grantham.            We       stopped             there    for a b o u t        1/2       (half)         an    hour       for       something

to    eat.




I continued              to    drive          to S h e f f i e l d     and      entered           the     City       via       the A 5 7

road.         This       would          be a b o u t      1 1 .1 5 am.          (1115)            T he    roads          were       quiet,

and    only        got    busier             as    I approached            Sheffield.                  There        were       no    traffic

hold-ups.            I saw Police                   Officers         in the          area,        as     though          they were

getting        ready          to    deal          with    the    build         up    of       traffic.




I drove around                 for       a    little       while.          1' s aw a           road,      I don't          know       the

name     of    it,       it wa s         opposite          a s c ho o l        and     I could           see    cars       parked          on

one    side        only       of    t h is        road.      I approached                 a    policeman and               I asked             h im

if    I could         park         my    car       on the       cle a r    side        of      the     road,        and    he       said       that

would     be a l r i g h t .             I parked my             car      in    this          side     road,        c l os e    to    li t t l e

houses.            It w as         no w a b o u t        1 1 .3 0 am.          (1130)

                           and       I then made            our      way    to a       bank       cashpoint        where        I withdrew

          some       money        f r o m rny a c c o u n t .         We    then walked             back      towards         the    ground.




          It wa s         a sunny          day,    when        the    sun went          in,       I felt      quite       cold,      but     once

          it     came      back       out,     it w a s        very     sunny.          It w a s      a dr y      day.

          .the man,          he      told     us    he    only       had    two       tickets       left/and         he w a n t e d      £25

          each       for     the      tickets.            These       tickets          were       foi/the      Leppings          Lane

          this       man,      to     reduce       the      price       but      he w g « l d n * t so we          walked        off,       to    try

          to     find another                ticket       seller.           As    ^     walked around              we     d id m e e t      other

                        and       1 decided           then       to    go    into       the     football         g r o u n d a n d as          we

         walked       off        I looked         towards          this      group       of     lads       to m a k e      certain        we     were

         turnstiles.




         There       wa s    a    fair     few       people        outside         the L e p p i n g s       Lane       turnstiles.

         was    formed           outside        each       one.        The       mood    of     the     crowd      outside         w as     good,

         with a good atmosphere.




         Just    prior           to   going       into       the      ground                         went    off      to    buy    some        chips

         and    when        he    returned           he was        with another                person       that      he    knew       from

By    now    the     terracing            was    getting          busier           but      I w #s     fine

squashed.            People         were       cheering/but                  others        were       shouting           at    the

Police       outside          the      fence     to yffpen the               ga t e s .      I^p^ver          saw     the      gates

As    I l o o k e d at        the      front     1 saw young                 lads      f r o m 8 to          10 y e a r s      upwards,

they were          screaming            and     c r ying.         People           were      shouting           don't         panic.           I

never       sa w a n y o n e     on     the     ground.            I never           saw a n yo ne           tu/n     blue.




I decided          to     climb        the     fence     out    of the t e r r a c e , / o n t o the tr a c k , to

landed       on    the     other        side     of     the      fence,           a / p o l i cerpan d i r e c t e d          me    towards

the    corner        of    the      terracing,           where          another           p/il i / e m a n    stood       by a n         open

through        this       gate.         There     wa s      a    little           qu^ue      of    people          going       in

through        this       gate.         The     game     which          was/still            being         played        when       I first

Pen 6       I saw       the     players         walking          off        the     field.         In t hi s        pen 6          it w a s

busy,       I wa s      near     the      front       and       h ad    room        to m o v e     alright.              It w a s n ' t        as

I stayed          in P e n 6 a b o u t          10 m i n u t e s        or     so,     looking         for                         but    1

c o u l d n ’t see        him.         I could        see       people         spilling           o nt o     the    pitch and
                                                                                                                                   PAGE

others         being       pulled           into     the W e s t        S t an d .




I. d e c i d e d     to    go     on    the     pitch        to    tr y    to     find                             I went      back      out

through            the    open     gate.            I told        the     policeman manning                     this     open      gate     of

pen 6 t h a t            my mate        was     on    the        pitch.         The    policeman              directed        me

towards            the    front        of    the N o r t h S t a n d         to      look       for m y       friend.          1' w e n t

and    stood         in t h i s        area.         I decided            I would          be    safer        on the       pitch

than     on the           terracing.




I      stood         on m y       own, all          the    time     I was         on the         pitch.




I      sa w a n a m b u l a n c e a p p r o a c h i n g            from      the S p i o n H o p             end.



I      saw         people       l y i n g on    the       ground.          There       was a       line        of P o l i c e O f f i c e r s

across         the       halfway            line.         Th e    perimeter           fence       wa s       beingk i c ke d       down,

fans     and        police        were       doing        this     at     the L e p p i n g s      Lane         terracing.




After     about           1/2     (half)       an     hour        I me t                        on the        pitch.        The      lad

that                       h a d m et        outside         the    g ro un d was           with       him.         This    was      just

before         4    pm.      (1600)




I did      not       get     involved           with       the     injured           people       or     carry a n y o n e         on

stretchers.                I wa s       too     far       from     the     Leppings             Lane     goal       area     to    see

clear ly what              w as    happening.



The    three         of    us     left       the     ground,        vi a P e n 6,           about        4    pm    (1600)        and

returned            to m y      car,




I drove            towards        the       centre        of S h e f f i e l d       and    dropped           off

f r ie n d ,       who    was     going        to    c a t c h a train.

                            and        I then     came      home.          I stopped         outside        Sheffield       a n d we     both

             telephoned            our       families       to    let      them    k n o w we       were    safe,      I arrived         home

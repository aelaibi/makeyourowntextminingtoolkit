The H om e Secretary spoke to the Attorney-General yesterday. The Attorney-
General has agreed to everything in our letter. How ever his one concern, which the
H om e Secretary thinks we should meet is that we should not publish:

• The advice received by the D PP from Counsel (Lord Williams) in 1990

• The papers on the CPS internal review 1997.

Please let me know if you are content for us to proceed in this way.

I have spoken to Trevor Hicks who has been very helpful - he will tell the majority
of families on Sunday and contact others on Monday. I will give the firm details to
Mrs Williams on Monday.

T hank you for all your help on this.

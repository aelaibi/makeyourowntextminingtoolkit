     Re:   Costs of the Inquiry by the West Midlands Police into the
                           Hillsborough Stadium Tradgey.

I am writing , following representations from Coventry City Council , to ask
you   for an urgent statement of clarification as to the costs the
Hillsborough Inquiry.

There has been growing disquiet in recent months , both in the city and
across the region , about the funding of the costs of this inquiry.Whilst
early assurances appear to have been given by the Home Office that no
‘additional ‘costs would fall on the West Midlands Police Authority , the
delays on defining ‘additional1 have caused considerable problems .


I understand the Police Authority , due to depletion of reserves and loss of
interest , have reluctantly sent an interim bill to South Yorkshire for
£1, 681, 402. The final costs of the inquiry are expected to be £4 million.


I feel that the only way in which assurances , that no       additional costs
would fall on the    Authority , can be translated into fact , is if you make
an early   and    definitive statement that the Home Office will meet all
associated costs.

An early reply is appreciated.

Dear Mr. Jones,

                Hillsborough Inquiry. Crush Barrier 12 4A

     I have read the draft report on the examination of barrier
124A prepared by P.F. Heyes and J.G. Tattersall of the Health and
Safety Executive, Research and Laboratory Services Division,
Sheffield. On the 29th November 1989 I visited the laboratory,
inspected the barrier and discussed the findings with Dr. Heyes and
Mr. Tattersall.

     I understand that plans are in hand for the laboratory to carry
out a bend test on a length of tube similar to one in 124A.
However, this will not require the presence of 124A at the
laboratory.

     The draft report is detailed and comprehensive, and I do not
think that it is necessary for the laboratory to carry out any
further metallurgical work on 124A.

     I can therefore see no objection should you decide to recommend
that 124A now be released from the custody of the Health and Safety
Executive laboratory.

                              Yours sincerely




                              P.B. Wilson

        HILLSBOROUGH IN Q U IR Y -              RELEASE OF CRUSH B AR RIER        124A

        Further to our telephone call of this afternoon, you will recall some
        weeks ago we discussed release of crush barrier 124A for the purpose of
        tests to be carried out by parties to the civil proceedings. Although
        these civil proceedings, set for 19 .June 1 9 9 0 , are unlikely to go ahead
        there is still considerable interest in access to the barrier for the
        purpose of tests.

        I have since written to Lord Justice Taylor, the Health and Safety
        Executive, HM Coroner in Sheffield and Forensic Science Service. You
        will see attached replies from each of these parties indicating that
        they are quite happy for the barrier to be released for such tests.

        Accordingly I have now written to each of the parties, including of
        course the owners, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, indicating that
        the barrier is available. I have arranged for all enquiries about
        access to be made to me so that T can ensure that our representive is
        available to monitor the tests, take any photographs and receive early
        copy of their results. This is in accordance with your original letter
        on this subject.

        I have choosen as our representative Mr P B Wilson, Principal Scientific
        Officer at the Home Office Forensic Science Service Laboratory at
        Wetherby (see attached letter). Mr Wilson has been particularly helpful
        to us and would seem to be the ideal choice from a technical point of
        view. I will also arrange for one of my senior officers to be present.




  PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE A T                         t,loyd H o u s e , Birmingham
Whilst I would recommend to you that we release the barrier for tests,
we would not want to release total custody of the barrier until such
time that a decision has been reached by the Director of Public
Prosecutions and the Coroner has concluded his inquests. In other word
the release of the barrier for testing will only be on a temporary and
supervised basis.

                   HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER ENQUIRY: ELECTRONIC MONITORING



                   Thank you for your note of 8 November to Miss Lenaghan asking for

                   the up to date position on the evaluation of the electronic

                   monitoring trials.



                   All three trials are now under way and the collection of

                   statistical and other evaluative material is progressing.                                                 The

                   full evaluation will not be completed until Spring 1990.                                                  There

                   will, however, be an interim evaluation which is to be submitted

                   to Ministers in mid December.

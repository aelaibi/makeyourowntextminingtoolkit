             I am a Detective Constable                      in the South Yorkshire P o l i c e , presently

             s tat ioned at Woodseats Pol i«.e Station.

             At S.00am       <0800)       on Saturday          iDS^pril   <150489)    I commenced duty at

             Woods eats Police Station in u n i f o><c.                   I was transported to the stadium

             where upon arrival              I attended th&-^4?ri ef ing in the North S t a n d .            My

             duties were to work with se?ial                      16 a t t"he Leppings Ln end of the

             ground.        After the briefing I, saw Inspector PURDY to whom I was

             reponsible at the Lappings Ln endb of the grounds, where he outlined to

             the serial          how the area would be policed.                  The tim^j was

             about 11.15 am <1115). \ o r the next few hours I accompanied Inspector
              M ( i
             PJJRDY' in his supervisory in¥-pect,ions of the turnstiles at this end of

             the ground.           (He instructed other officers to work in pairs).                         We

             also stopped and searched fans who were attending at the ground and
                                                                                                                PAG E           £
                                                                                                                SI 362

h e l pe d others with               tickets and dir e c t i o n        enquiries.           The    fans a t t e n d i n g

were     at    this      point       good natured,         offering          s w e e t s , chips,    pop etc and a

good a tm o s p h e r e       prevailed.

During        this    period         I had thought         that more          fans w o u l d be a r r i v i n g       and

it . u p r t . ^            that great           numbers were        not attending.                At about 2. 3 5          -

2.. 40 pm     ( 1435 - 1440)            greXter      numbers     did start            to a t t e n d and at       this

time     I was       standing         inside      riqe rai 1 ings     near         to Tur n s t i l e G.      The

pressure          star t e d to build up in this a r e a to G between the                                 railing and

a blue        concertina         type     door     opposite me.           As a result           of this        I was

pushed up against                 the    railing.         This   caused         c o n s i derable    discomfort

and    I slid u n d e r ne at h using              the    railing \ o         protect myself            from the

pressure.            It was      obvYqus         that    people were )in great distress                       in the

crowd w h i c h       c o ntinued to               11    rapidly.       inspector          PURDY     climbed on

the    r a i 1 ings and a p p e a l e d to the             crowd to stop              pushing as        people were

being       crushed.          T hey     either     d i s r e g a r d e d him or did not hear               him.       In
                                                                         \
a ny   event       the     pressure       c o ntinued      to m o u n t . \ P e o p i e    were     shouting         from

sthe crowd to the Po l i c e               to do something.                  I pdSLled people           from the

crush and as they                 came out        they said the         same        things     "People are           dying

in there - do s o m e t h i n g . "

The y were         gasping       for air an d holding              their       chests.         I began to fear

they were          right and that               people were      not m e r e l y       being    injured a n d

frightened           but    crushed to death up a g a i n s t                 the    t urnstiles        and    the    gate

A yousnq boy was              passed over          the top to the             e d g e s , I thought        he was

dea^l, his arms were                  d a ngl ings      like a doll's.              F o r t u nately,     on taking

hold    chf him wit h other               of f i cers     I saw signs          of     life and he was           taken

to a F i rst Aid Post.

People        continued         to    cry for a c t io n saying              "do    something,       do

som e t h i n g   - people are            dy ing!"        I saw one e l d e r l y man just                out of

a r m ’s reach.            He a p p e a r e d    in great d i s tress an d was               being      swept along

 in the       tide     of people.          The moo d of the             crowd was        now a g g r e s s i v e and
                                                                                         'J/XiAjj .
 fearful.            The s it ua t i o n was      ext r e m e l y dangerous.             People were also

 climbing        over the g a t e s \ n d         w a l ls .

 Near     to the       railings a young             boy was       being       crushed against              it wit h his

 neck. His      face was        red and he was            crying and obv i o u s l y            frightened.                    X

 t ried       to take hold of him to pul 1 him from the                             press.        His      father

 s h ou t e d at me       aggressively           "Fuck     off         you * re not       chucking         him o u t 11        I

 t ried        to tell him his            son was       in danger and he just                said     “Fuck          of f ,

 w e ’re going         in t h e r e 11.    He was a g it at ed and aggressive,                       his    son was           in

 great     distress and           I could not            believe       he didn't want           to    come       out       from

 the    press.        He must     have     seen the young              lad    passed over         earlier.

 The    pressure was           still      mouting,        the    people       coming     in the       late       rush

 a p p e a r e d to be the        s te re o - t y p e    ’beer    swilling        f a n ’ obv i o u s l y       just

 tur n e d out        of the    pub.

 At    some    point      I looked to my            left and saw             Inspector PURDY,              he was

 making       his way t h ro ug h the           crush towards            the    outside       gates.            He

' s i g n al le d me to follow h i m .              I. did but         could     not    c a t c h ^ ' u ^ w i t h him due

 to t h eN^reat         numbers      of    people and Police                 horseV*.      I saw him talking

 to anoth er          man.     I did not        recognise         him but        saw hiV, gold braid on his

 hat.

 relieve       the     pressure      outside.           People     ran towa r d s        this     gate      to get          in.

 I pulled        people out        from the         crush area and d i r e c t e d            them to the              gate.

  Almost       all     of them made         the same        comments -            "people are           dying

 gate     shouVajig at         people      to walk        in,    not    run.      After a         short w hile             the

 gate was        closed a ga in and           the       pressure was          g r e a t l y eased.         I. looked

 in to the           crush area      for any sign of              injured        people     but      could       see

like     it could build up again.                     The    gatX.at      the    side was        re-opene^i but

this     time       barriers    and a m ou n t e d PolicemavH were                   in position. , I again

s tar t e d to       pull    people    out of the           crush area and direct                them to the

gate     but this time          they were entering                in single          file.     They were more

o rde r l y    but still       complaining           that    people were         being       crushed.          They

held their           tickets aloft as they went                   thro u g h the gate.             I do not            know

if the        counterfoils          were    taken.

the g a t e , but the are a was                  still    packed.       I looked        into the area

inside        the turns t i l e s     betw e e n the gates and the                   stand entrances.                  1 do

not    recall        seeing m a s se s      of    people.        I then heard a              message      over

someo n e s     radio saying          "all       personnel       to the    playing area,            all

personnel           to the    playing       area".        I saw    pol i c e m a n    running to the            right

of the stand to a passage which                          leads     on to the          pitch.      wtien I went

outside.

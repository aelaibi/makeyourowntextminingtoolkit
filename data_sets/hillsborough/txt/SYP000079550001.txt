                I have       been a Liverpool               supporter all my                 life and have        regularly-

                c o u l d n ’t afford the tickets.



                On S at u rd ay       15th April,           1989     (130489)       together w ith my friend

                                I t ravelled to the FA cup semi-final                                against N o t t i n g h a m

                Li ve rp oo l    Football         Club.         We   left Liverpool             at    11.30 am      </?13G hrs)         in

                the mo rn in g and tra ve ll ed along                    the motorways to Sheffield.              We did

                motorway        because of this               traffic       we did       not a r r i v e    in S h e f f i e l d    till

           a bout   2.20      pm (1420 hrs).            The    coach was      parked some distance             from the

           gr o un d and      it took us about           IQ^fiinutes to walk            from the        coach to the

           ground.       We a rr iv ed at the g&6und at about 2.3 0                      pm    (1430 hrs),      at this

           time     there was     no queue        for    the turnstiles,             just a large mass         of
  U
           people w hich we j o i n e d y p ut my mate                 said something          like     "Someone's

           going     to get hurt here,            I don't want            to be the o n e ” , so we        left the

           mass and went and stood on the                      bridge w h ic h was just at the side                  of

           the; crowd.         Two Police        horsjfs w hich were a l r e a d y           in the     crowd started

K / n rO
           about 30 feet         in front        M   the turnstiles.                One of the     riders    of the

           horses was         telling e v e r yb od y to calm down,                 and move^ back from the
c r f b
           gates,     but the     crowd was so big that they couldnVt                          really move      back

           opened.



           A Police Land Rover              then pulled up and using a loud hailer,                         it told

           the fans      to    calm down and move              back,      it said twice        that the     game     had

           been delayed and we w ould all                     get   in.     After a short         con ve rs at io n with

                    I turned around and the main body of the                           crowd had d is a p p e a r e d

           a nd only a few fans             remained.          It was about 5 to 3 when the Lan d Rover

           came     (1455 hrs).



           While     I was     standing      outside        the gates       by the     bridge     I saw the

           foll ow ing     happen,     there was a folding                 gate at     right angles        to the

           terrace     turnstiles       facing        the     river.       I saw this gate ope/T at about 2.

 c r r     40    pm (1440 hrs)        and    I saw P o l i c e m a n with a tall             hat qj( calling        people

           about 2.50         pm (1450 hrs)          the same happen/d again,                 the P o l i c e m a n opened

           I w al k e d up to the       turnstiles            for vtyr L ep pings Ln stand wit h my £ 6 . 0 0

              ticket.       The P o l i c e m a n at the    side    of the turnstiles was                 calling

              people aro un d to the side               gate,   but as there w a s n ’t a queues                for    the

              turnstile,       I went     in through the          turnstile.           Once    inside     the ground,         I

              could see the side gate was                 open.



              Once    inside    the ground          I could see a tunnel              a head of me,       with a few

              people walking          down    it.           told me that was                the way to the

              terracing,       but as we got down the              tunnel       you    could see the        other      end
 Ca   t   ~                                                                                          .•
              of the tunnel        was    solid because         of all     the       people    in -it.     We went

              about    three quarters           of the way down the tunnel ^afnd the decided that

              we w ould      not get a good view of the m atch s o ^ e                      went    back out of the

              tunnel    to find a better m atch viewing                  poirtic.       As we      left the tunnel           it

              was quite       is to get out,         and we     only had to dodge              in and out of          people

              to get out.        At this        stage    it was about 3.03             pm    (1503 hrs).
                                                                                 /



              We got out of the tunnel               and went      to t h e / N o r t h — West Lower       terrace

              where    there was       plenty of        room and spao4          to stand without           been   pushed

              about,        I looked at      the Leppi ng s Ln terrace,                centre      pens an d they were

              c ompletely full.           I could see       people     climbing         onto the fence and over

              onto    the    pitch.      Also    there were       people    climbing          up on to West Stand

              to get out of the terracing.                  G r a d ua ll y rn(/re and more          people went on

              to the    pitch and        I could see       bodies    on /he          pitch.     There were a few

              P o l i c e m e n helping w ith the fans,           but c/thers were            just standing a ro u nd

CAT           and did not appear             to be doing a lot I           We    stopped       in the ground until

              it was a n n o un ce d that        the game w a s M a b a n d o n e d , and then we          left   the
c o m M£*IT
              ground.



              I think       the main     reasons      the disaster       h ap pened were           that   the   pens    had

              got side      fencing and so the            crowds    could not spill             out sidewards.

             Also     there   should ha      teen signs and          people directing      the fans    to the

              side    terracing         stopping     them going       down the   tunnel.     Also   there

             was     not enough m e d i c a l l y trained       people available.    I think    the

             P o li c e   should have   done more     to help the       injured fans.

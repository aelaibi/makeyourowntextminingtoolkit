Dear Jack,
                                                                                                                   cJ<   I-€,*<^1
I write further to my oral question of 26 October 1998 regarding the Hillsborough evidence in
the House of Commons Library. I promised to write with some specific examples of missing
statements and other evidence.                                                ^      q  ^

Sgt M J Hemingway (Amended and unamended)
\               ^Amended and unamended)
                  [Amended and unamended)
PcGeoffrey Glave (Amended and unamended
Sgt Jack Cloke (Amended and unamended)

I do not believe this list to be exhaustive.

In addition, the following documentation relating to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's Scrutiny is not
in the Library:-

1. Correspondence from Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to:
      West Midlands Police (especially DCI Foster)
      South Yorkshire Police
      Hammond Suddards, Solicitors

      CPS                         )
      DPP                         )      These bodies may have been sent the standard
      Sheffield Wednesday FC      )      letter which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith
      The FA                      )      circulated upon the establishment of the
      Liverpool FC                )      'Scrutiny'.
      Nottingham Forest FC        )
      Police Complaints Authority )
2. Correspondence from the above to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith. The Hillsborough Family
   Support Group are in possession of two letters from Hammond Suddards dated 11
   November 1997 and 20 January 1998
                                                 Representing:
                 Allerton, Grassendale, Netherley, St. M ary’s, Speke, Valley and Woolton Wards.
3. Correspondence from members of the public to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith
4. Transcript of meeting with Dr David Slater
5. Written submissions from:
      Professor Phil Scraton
      Ms Sheila Coleman
      (please note the HFSG submissions are in the Library)

On a separate matter, I believe that you met some of the mothers of victims when you visited
the Police Authority Conference in Blackpool recently.

I understand that they raised with you the fact that Messrs Duckenfield and Murray's
defence, in the private prosecutions being undertaken by the HFSG, are being funded by
South Yorkshire Police Authority. This is despite the fact that one of these officers retired
under a cloud with disciplinary matters outstanding and the other had disciplinary
proceedings dropped upon the retirement of the first.

Neither are serving officers and Legal Aid is of course available to them as defendants in a
criminal prosecution if they qualify in the usual way. I could understand why their Trade
Union might want to assist them financially in such circumstances if they were still members,
but I see no reason at all why the SYPA would spend public money doing so. In fact I think it
is wrong of them to do so in the circumstances.

I would be obliged for your comments on this point.



Thanking you in anticipation.



Yqfurs sincerely,




MARIA EAGLE MP

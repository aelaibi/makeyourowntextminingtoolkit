On    a    number        of    occasions           I asked          members           of      the     mounted            section, who             j

were       maintaining              order        in the       queues          and     keeping           non-ticket            holders                j

away,       to     clear       the     footpaths.                                                                                                    j

Throughout             I maintained               more       or    less       the     same      position            in o r d e r    t ha t

members          of m y S e r i a l         could       find       me    if    they        required my              assistance.

It    is    difficult            to    recall        times         because          we    were       kept         extremely        busy,

but       around 2,00            pm    X heard a message                      on m y       r a dio     to     the    effect        that

fans       were     on      their      way       from    the       W a d s Iey B r i d g e          railway         station.

Sometime           l a te r    they        arrived       escorted             by    police          officers.             After     these

had       arrived        fans       started        arriving             in    large       numbers            f r o m all

directions             and     pressure           built       up at          the    turnstiles               and    started

backing-up.                 I could         see    that       mounted          officers             in f r o n t     of    turnstiles

A-G       were     being       trapped.

Inspector           Sykes        instructed             me    to    go       towards          the    A-G      turnstiles           to     try

and       assist       in     relieving           the    pressure.                 I asked          s om e    of    the    officers

a r o u n d me      to      follow         me.     1 eventually                got       to    the     perimeter           gates

would       guess        the    time        to    be 2 . 3 0       pm.

officers          to    go      onto        the    pitch         because          the       Liverpool             fans       were

climbing          onto        it.          I followed            the    other          officers             through          Gate     ’A"      to

the     north        stand and               e n t e r e d the g r o u n d         through             the       first       gangway.

When      I got        onto         th e     pitch       I saw a        large         number           of    officers             in f r o n t

of     the L e p p x n g s          Lane     fence       pulling            at    the       fe n c e.         I also         saw     the     gate

open      to     the    centre             north    enclosure.                   It w a s        apparent             that    a number            of

people         were     injured             and    th a t    it w a s        not       a    ’p i t c h      invasion".

Fans      started         coming            onto    the      pitch,          obviously                injured          although          some

of     them      not    seriously.                 They      sat       on    the       grass          at    the       side    of     the

track.           I requested                officers         to m o v e          them       further          onto       the       pitch      in

order      that        officers             could work            on    the       more       seriously                injured.

It     became        clear          that     there       were      many          casualties                and w h en        I saw a S o u t h

Yorkshire            Ambulance               in f r o n t      of the       kop       I went           to    it a n d        asked       the

crew     to a s k       them         to      contacttheir              Control             for m o r e       a m b u l a n c e s , if        it

had     not      been    done         already.              The    reason             I did       this w a s           because        our

radio appeared bloc ke d .

I then         returned         to         the    area      to    the       right       hand          side       of    the    goalmouth

when     facing         Leppings             Lane..         At    one       stage       a young             doctor       came       up to me

and     asked where             he         could    help.          I took             hold       of    his       arm    and       led h i m

through          the    fans        who      had    come         onto       the       pitch       to       the    rear       of    the     goal

n et   where       Police           and      fans       were      working          on a          number          of    casualties.                I

                                                                                                          RHS 'I

             shouted      to   them    that   I had a doctor         went    to   him an a s sisted.     As   I

             turned       round     I assisted    in   placing   a fan       onto   a make-shift   stretcher

             who    was   obviously       dead and     he wa s   taken      towards   the   gymnasium.

             I remained        on   the   pitch   until   it w a s    cleared.

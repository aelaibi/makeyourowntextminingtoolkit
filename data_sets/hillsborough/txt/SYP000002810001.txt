               Further         to       my    statement              dated          2 9 th    A^rlVi 1    1989       <290489) .

                 I did       not    see       the       crush        b a r r i e r j/rs P e n        3    break.           The       first      time,          I

               actually            saw       the       broken        ci             barrier         was    when       I was          picking         dead          and

                 injured       people          up       and     who       had       been      standing          in    front          of    me   in P e n           3,

               as      the    people          were         lifted         up    I    could         see    the    broken          barrier          beneath

               them,

                 It    was    at    a    later          time     that          I saw         the    extent       of    the       damage         to    the

               crush         barrier,          after          assisting              carrying            people       to       the       gymnasium         I

                 returned          to    Pen       3    and     at    that          time      the    terraces          were          clearer         and       I

               could         see    that       two         sections            of    the      crush       barrier          had       collapsed         the          two

               sections            furthest             away     from          the     dividing           fence       between             pen   3 and          p e n 2,

               I have         been       shown         a    plan      of       pens     3    and     4    indicating             the       positions                of

               the       crush      barriers.                 I have           marked         on    the    plan       the       positions            I believe
                                                                                                                                        S 2 8 1A

I was       standing              in a t      a    time       when       I belip^e             the       crush       barrier       was     still

in    tact.           (Position              1).        Position          Z/bn       the       plan       is    the    posiiton

I was       standing              in a t      the       time       immediately                after       I believe          the    crush

barrier          collapsed,

I am       u n a b 1e    to       be    p r e c i s e ,aoout          t i m e s , other             than       I looked       at    my     watch

on    entering           the       ground          and    prior          to    entering             the       terraces,       I saw        that

the    time       was        then       H. 5 5     pm.        F rom      entering             the    tunnel          I would       estimate

that       it   would         have          been    about          2 minutes             later       (2.57       pm)    by    the       time       we

were       gradually              pushed          forwards          to    position             1 on       the    attached          plan.

On    arriving          at        position          1 at       about          2.57       pm    because          of    the    position          of

the    people           in    front          of    me    it    is m y         belief          that       at    this    time       the     crush

barrier          in     front          of    where       I was        standing            was       in    tact.

Having          stood        at    position             1 for       no    more       than       2    or       3 minutes,          there      was

a    sudden       relief           in       the    pressure           arowsm         me,       as    previously             explained          it

is    at     this       time       about          2.59    pm       or/3.00          pm    that       I believe          the       crush

barrier         had      col l a p s e d ,         aljhoygh           I did         not       witness          the    barrier

c o 1 laps in g .

I    cannot       assist           any       further          in    relation             to    the       actual       timing       of    events

I was       not       aware        at       the    time       of    occur ranees               on    the       pitch    in    regards          to

the    game.

I    cannot       say        exactly          how       long       I was       in    Pen       3,    I looked          at    my    watch       at

2.55       pm   and      I did          not       look    at       it a g a i n      until          4.40       pm w h e n    we    got

outside          the     ground.              D Moore.

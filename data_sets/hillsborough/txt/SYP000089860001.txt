A    senior         officer          requested           that      ten me n         be    removed           from    the    cordon

around         the       bo d ie s ,     to    form a        cordon w i t h i n           the     courtyard area                to

prevent            other       f an s    from approaching                 the       exit     gate,

When      the       gate       opened         to a l l o w     the m e n       th ro ug h I saw              the    fans    walking

out      of    the       ground         through       the      turnstiles.                They        w\re    again       pointing

each      body.

At    t hi s       stage       I saw       officers          and an a m b u l a n c e m a n            start       to    resuscitate

a ma n who              had    been      laid     in the        section           for     the     deceased          wi th a shirt

h a lf    an       hour,       and      had a s s u m e d      that      he was          dead.

iiernbers          of    the    p ress        attend.e4 our           reception area                   a t this         time,    and

whilst         filming          or a t t e m p t i n g       t^Nfilm        procedures                had    to    be    hurriedly

d i r e c t e d a w a y as           fans      reacted         violently            towards           them.        I was    also

aware         at    this       time,       through        listening            to    other        officers

personal            r adios,         that      fights        were     occuj^ring            outside          the    ground and

ifficers            were       requesting           for      assistance.

pS    iwRBURN            then     directed          me    to    the      f ea r     of    the S o ut h        stand and          it was

o n l y at         this       stage      that     1' s a w     the    front         end     of    the       stand and       realised

the      full       extent        of     the     disaster.

              Approx.           4 stewards           were        seen     in the         vicinity         of    this g a t e , a l th ou gh           I

               I noticed           that       the    crowd seemed                to be        getting agitated,              and     t h ere    was

              At a p p r o x .       2 . 4 0 p m (1440) the c r o w d i n c r e a s e d t r e m e n d o u s l y a r o u n d                            the

              Leppings          Lane       turnstiles.                   The      area       became       a vast        se a      of    pushing        fa c e s .

              I saw       two    bobbies             stood        on t o p of           blue       railings          separating              our

              driveway area                from       turnstile              ar ea,         apparently           looking          over       the    c r o wd

              and attempting                to       direct          them.

              Officers          on       horses       were        trying          to    co n t r o l     the     crowd,        who      were       abusive

  AT          to    them.        The       horsemen             re-grouped              at     one     stage      and      I would           estimate
I— . L~
              that    there          were       approx.           10 of        them.           The     atmosphere            amongst          the    crowd

              was    volatile,             not       particularly amongst                          themselves,             but     towards          the

              Police.           I was       frightened.

              A    number       of y o u n g s t e r s          in the         crowd         had      climbed        up a      pole      on w h i c h a n

              official          banner          had       been       erected,           over       the m a i n       g a te s .        The    pole     was

              rocking       a n d at        one       p o i nt       I thought              it w a s     going       to b r e a k .

              A    number       of L i v e r p o o l           fa n s    climbed            up the       wall     n ex t     to    the

              turnstiles             - n e ar        to    l a rg e      wooden         sign with             ’S o u t h S t a n d ’ w r i t t e n

              thereon.           Once       at       the       top      of   the       wall       they    turned        to     f ac e    the       crowd

              and    raised          their       arms          in the air.                  The    crowd       cheered         t hem and a number

              of    other       f a ns     began          to    climb        the       w a ll.

^             At    one    stage          I saw a small                  group         of    fa n s    force      the c o n c e r t i n a          gate

              (adjacent          to       our    p o s i t i o n ) open.                Officers          who were           obviously

              p o s i t i o n e d at       the       other        side       of    the       g a te    within        the     ground          literally

              had    to m a n h a n d l e        them          back      out,      after          which       they     re-shut          the    gate.

              Members       of       the    crowd          in t h i s        particular               area     became        agitated          with        the

              Police       handling             of    the       situation.

              Fans     (N o tt s F o r e s t )            continued            to a p p r o a c h        our     barriers          as    they       had

              throughout             -    requesting              to     pass      through -             to    get    to     the S o u t h S t a n d

              entrance.              We    refused             them access              and       directed         them      to    the       other     side

              of    the    g r o u n d as        instructed.                   Again         the      fans     became        frustrated and

                  agitated            by this,             w h i c h was          understandable               under         the    circumstances                   as

                  A    number         of O f f i c e r s         helped           to    lift     a young boy            o v er       the t o p s of           fans

                  heads        to     safety.

                  A    couple         of    fans       also       approached               our       barrier       complaining                of    twisted

                  crowded with                  fans.        At       the m o s t        the a r e a      of      the       opening         was     only       used

I heard a message                    over       the      tannoy asking               fans      to be         patient,             to    remain

calm and           take       their       time,       as    there       was       plenty       of      room      inside           the

g round.

A s we       were       filtering          West       Stand       ticket          holders        through           the       exit       gate,

I turned           to     look      up    the    driveway          in the          direction            of    the S o u t h S t a n d

entrance           and       saw    that me mb er s          from my Serial                   and      other       Officers             were

running         towards            the    entrance.              I was       totally          unaware         of a n y        reason          for

t hi s    action.             I turned,          as      though        to    follow       them,         and was             told       by

PS N Q R B U R N        to    remain       in m y        current        position.              I did         so,      together              with

P C 861       WADSWORTH,             PC P E A R S a n d P S N O R B U R N .               I cannot            remember             whether

any      other me mb e rs            of    our S e r i a l        were       p r es e nt .

The      exit      gate       was ag ain         c lo s ed ,      although           there was           still          a    la rge

number        of     f a ns     in the         turnstile          area.           These       f an s    were       behaving             in a

more      orderly manner                  and were          generally milling                    around          or     passing

through         the       turnstiles.

I then heard a message                          o ve r     the    tannoy asking                for      f an s     to       c lear      the

pitch and m yself                   and    other         Officers           at    our    location were                  under          the

impression              that       there       had    been a       pitch          invasion.

Approximately                 five       minutes         after     this,          an ambulance               arrived          with          its

        a glass          section         in the          exit       gate ,     to    see     if t h e r e       was        any    problem

        within         the      ground.           I saw        t ha t    there was           a    l a r ge    crowd         of    people       in

        the      entrance         to     the      West      Stand        tunnel        and       f an s    were       milling          around       in

        the      courtyard area                 behind         the      turnstiles.               A number            of    f a ns     were    sat

        on the         floor       in the         courtyard             eating       sn a c k s ,

        The      exit     gate was           opened and a short                      time        l a ter a n u m b e r           of    fans

        appeared          to     the     left      of     the       gate,      carrying           a man who was                  apparently

        unconscious.                  They      took      him       towards         the a m b u l a n c e       a n d at         that    time

        f a ns    ra n t o w a r d s      me      shouting           and      swearing.             The      f an s    were       indicating

        for      me    to go      towards          the      tunnel.            I ran       into        the    courtyard area

        towards          the     t u n n e l ’s e n t r a n c e ,        anticipating               that      there was               a fight

        ocurring           i n si d e.       At    that        time      I feared          for m y o w n s a f e t y              in

        approaching              the     crowd,          because         of    their       hostility and                   the    general

        crowd atmosphere.                       I was       not a w a r e       that       other          officers          were       entering

        the      c o u r t y a r d a r e a w i t h me.

        As    I r e a ched        the     entrance             to    the      tunnel,        I saw a man app roaching                          me

wsr     carrying          a young         woman.            He      placed      her     on       the      floor       as    he    r e a c h e d me

        who      stated         that     sh e     wa s    an     off     duty       nur s e.        She      made      a brief

        examination              of    the w o m a n a n d           then      left      to a t t e n d       to      other       fans    who

        being         brought         from      the      tu n n e l .

        A m a n was          brought         from        the     tunnel        and     placed          on the         floor       beside       me.

        Other         Officers         immediately               gathered around and although                                th e      gave    him

        mouth         to m o u t h ,     it was          obvious         that       he wa s       dead and            they       placed a

Whilst       attending            to    the w o m a n ,           fans       were    shouting             abuse         at    INSP.        SYKES

and myself,            and accusing                us       of    being       murderers.                 I also         saw     two     fans

shouting         abuse       at    the O f f i c e r s            tending       the       d e a d m an ,        a n d at        one     stage

they    lunged         violently             towards             the    officers          and were             restrained             by

their      friends.

Other      fans      were     sa t      on the          floor          crying,       as       by this          t im e     other       injured

and    dead      people       had       been       brought             from    the    tu n n e l         and were            l a y e d on    the

flo or .

I was      not a w a r e      of       the    exact          time       that    these          events          began,         but     I would

estimate         that       it m u s t       h av e     been approx.                2.50pm          (1450).

As    I ha d     no m e a n s      of    communication                   I actually                thought          that      the     events

occurring         in the          c o u r t y a r d at           the    rear    of    the          stand was            th e m a j o r

incident.            I was        unable          to    contact          the C o n t r o l          Room       or    request          any

F i r e m e n a r r i v e d at         the    scene          a short          time    late r         with       oxygen          tanks.

The    off     duty     nurse          returned             to me       and    stated          t ha t a n o t h e r          ambulance

had arrived            in the          driveway and                I immediately                   enlisted          the      help      of PC

620 YATES and               other       fans,          to    carry       the w o m a n         to    the a m b u l a n c e .            We

p l a c e d her      in the        ambulance                and    I believe          she was             conveyed almost

immediately            to    the       hospital.

Once    b ac k    in the          d ri v ew ay area,               I saw       that       there          were       approx.         20/30

injured        persons        either          sat a g a i n s t          the w a l l          or    ly ing      on      the     floor.

The    dead were            carried          to    the       opposite          side       of       the    driveway and                placed

alongside         the wall             adjacent             to    the    river.           A    cordon          of    officers           were

stood around            this       area       to       shield          the    bodies          from       view.          The     injured

ranged       from      persons          with       broken          limbs,       to    others             who    were         obviously         in

a serious         condition.                 All       of    the m o r e       seriously             injured were                tended        by

at    least      one    officer,             ambulanceman,                   fireman          or    doctor          and      I k e pt

touring        the     line       of    injured             persons monitoring                      their       condition and

conforting           them.

I h e a rd a n a p p e a l o v e r the t a n n o y                           for    any      off    duty       doctors,           nu r s e s ,

etc.      to m a k e       themselves                  known and a              doctor        1 spoke          to    stated          that       he

had      been    in the W e s t                   S t a n d as a s u p p o r t e r .

The      concertina                exit       g a te    at     this       time      was      closed       but wa s          manned         by

officers,            who a l l o w e d             injured          parties         through         to    the       r e c e p t i o n ar ea.

A    senior      officer                requested             t ha t    ten men         be    removed          from        the    cordon

around         the       bodies,             to    form a        cordon within                the    courtyard area                   to

prevent         other          fa n s        from approaching                   the     exit       gate.

When      the    ga t e        opened             to a l l o w      the      men    through,         I saw          th e    f a ns    walking

out      of    the       ground          through          the       turnstiles.               T he y were           again        pointing

fingers         at       officers,                calling        them m u r d e re rs          and       shouting           abuse.

Eventually ambulances                              returned and               the     bodies        were       conveyed          from       the

scene - having                     been       searched           by a n       officer         who    had been al loc at ed                      to

each      body.

At    this      stage          I saw          officers           and an am bul anceman                    start        to    resuscitate

a m an who           had       been          layed      in the          section         for    the       deceased with a shirt

o ve r    his    face.              I had          seen       this      man     l y in g     in t hi s     section           for at         l east

half      an    h ou r     and          had assu med             that        he w a s      dead.

d i r e c te d away,               as    fans         reacted          violently           towards        them.

I was         also       aware          at    this      time,          through        listening           to    other        officers’

personal         r ad i os ,            that       fights        were        occurring         outside          the        ground and

officers         were          requesting               for a s s i s t a n c e .

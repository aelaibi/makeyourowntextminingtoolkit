                    INCIDENT AT HILLSBOROUGH 15.4.89.



                    With reference to the aboveT''\NAt 8.15am Saturday,                     15 April   1989

                    (150489)       I commenced duty at A r m t i W p e Pol Stn,        regarding the FA cup

                    s e m i - fi na l.      After the initial briefling at Sheffield Wednesday

                    football ground we took up our respective points.



                    I was one of the officers in serial 3 f \ u n d e r              the supervision of PS
                         alitos                                               I   z/7//|b
                    2881 Pearson, my partneNythat day was PC 2359 Woodcock.



                    PC Woodcock and myself took up fspot patrol duties on Halifax Rd near _

                    to the roundabout forming the junctions with Leppings Ln, Penistone Rd

                    and Herries R d .
                                                                                PAGE     2
                                                                                S2253



The majority of the people passing me enroute to the ground were

Liverpool    fans, although              apparent that some were under the

influence of intoxicants no incifS^nts of a public order took place.

A large proportion of fans were carryyne^ cans of beer/lager and were

advised re the laws relating to alcohol at sporting events.                 It is

fair to say that our advice was treated without any sort of back chat

or refusal to    comply.      However,    due to the    large crowds   it was

impossible to    seise any beer cans or hold people back who were in

possession of    any such items.



Whilst the crowds were making their way to the stadium a number of

people were noticeably walking along Halifax Rd in the opposite

direction asking for 'any spares*.            This was obviously tickets.           At

one point a group of approximately thirty people gathered on the road

surface.      I approached the group who split up on my arrival one of

the men put a    wad of bank notes in a wallet.          My    first impression was

that h&          * ’ -"ket tout.



Up to a             m ( 14 3 Q ) there were a group of about 25 men sat on a

wall on the opposite side of Halifax Rd.               These men were in

possession of a large number of beer cans which they were consuming.

I did not notice what time the men left the area.                During the period

I observed them they were in high spirits,             not causing any major

disturbance.     The trail of people passing my point seemed never

ending,    between 2.30pm   (1430) and 2.55pm      (1455)     people were running

along Halifax Rd towards the stadium.            The majority of supporters

were unsupervised and w^bk^d along the road.



About 3.00pm (1500)     I was di rected t V t h e stadium and approached it
                                                -------------
                                                                                PAGE      3
                                                                                SS253

 via LeppingsVyLn.

 although I was not told what the actual                problem was.



 On arrival at the main gates ©tf the ground at the Leppings Ln entrance

1^.1 helped form a cordon p r e v e n t i p e o p i e   entering the stadium.     I was

 then directed through the main gates along the access road between the

 River Don and Gate C.             There were about six people laid out on the

 road surface on this access area.              All were being attended to by

 Police Officers.         It was obvious that one man was dead,         his face was

 blue colour.                  w



                              at                    Inspector Sykes who   in my

                             as

 Policemen shielding the dead from fans who were leaving the ground.

 Anyone who was brought out of the ground dead was placed behind our

 cordon and any injured were placed opposite us against the perimeter

 wall.     At one point the number of dead              behind me would have numbered

 about fifteen.



 After about thirty minutes           I was told        patrol Leppinqs Ln in order

 to move the crowds of onlookers away to make room for the emergency

 services.       Most people ignored our requests stating they were             looking

 for friends,     relatives etc.



 I remained on Leppings Ln urrfcd1 the crowds had cleared and then

 resumed for a de-briefing           in the North Stand.



 At no time did I enter the ground other than the access road.                    I did

 not handle or assist any of the injured/dead.

                                                                            S2253

         It was not until the debriefing that I became aware of what was

         happening.      I did not realise how things were inside the ground and

         assumed all the problems had occurred at the turnstiles.



         I must add that prior to the match a great deal of supporters were

         asking directions to pubs and seemed more concerned over that than

         anything else.



         As I have stated I was totally in the dark as to events that were

         taking    place until the debriefing.   I was not in possession of a

         radio.     The manner of the fans   leaving the ground was abusive and

         extremely agressive,    I feel sure that if a prisoner was taken there

         would have been a large scale disturbance.

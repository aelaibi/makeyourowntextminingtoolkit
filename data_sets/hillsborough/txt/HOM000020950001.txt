HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY:   INTERIM REPORT


Mr Beattie wrote to the Home Secretary on 13 September reporting
that the County Council's Safety of Sports Grounds Sub-Committee
had considered Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report.

I understand that a formal reply to the letter will be coming
from the Department. But you might like to know that I have
shown it to Lord Justice Taylor. He was rather puzzled at the
reference that "there was no mention in the Interim Report of
crush barriers". For example, the whole of Chapter 12 in Part II
is concerned with the barriers in pen 3, and recommendations 11
and 12 relate to crush barriers. Other matters concerned with
crush barriers fall to be considered within a comprehensive
review of the Green Guide, which Lord Justice Taylor makes clear
(in paragraph 304) he will be considering in his final report.
The conduct of the second part of the Inquiry is for Lord Justice
Taylor to consider.  It will be for him to decide whether or not
to follow up the request "that the design of crush barriers be
fully^investigated during the course of the Inquiry" and I cannot
at this stage say how that particular area of work will develop.
But your Council can be assured that Lord Justice Taylor has
taken note of their letter.

   Dear Sir,

             Interim Report of the Inquiry into the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster


      The County Council's Safety of Sports Grounds Sub-Committee have considered
  the Interim Report by The Rt Hon Lord Justice Taylor into the Hillsborough
  Stadium Disaster with a view to considering the findings in relation to Norwich
  City Football Ground.  They were concerned to note that there was no mention in
  the interim report of crush barriers and they have asked me to write to request
  that the design of crush barriers be fully investigated during the course of the
  inquiry so that recommendations can be made to Authorities responsible for
  safety at sports grounds.   Can you please draw the Sub-Committees comments to
  the attention of The Rt. Hon Lord Justice Taylor.

                                          Yours faithfully,




                                    for Chief Executive and Clerk

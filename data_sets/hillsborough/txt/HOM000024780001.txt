  21st November 1989

  Dear Mr Whalley,

  Thank you for your letter dated 17th November 1989,
  addressed to Brian Wolfson.

  We both enjoyed meeting you and your colleagues. My team
  and I are at your disposal should you have any follow up
  points.

  During the visit I made a couple of points to Lord Justice Taylor
  concerning the Football Membership Scheme. We are
  particularly concerned at the safety aspect and the likely delay
  in admitting spectators. Perhaps uniquely among football stadia
  we have recently had direct experience of operating
  computerised access equipment. We installed such equipment
  in our 12,000 seat Arena and have experienced enormous
  problems in handling visitors, so much so that we have been
  forced to revert to manual operation.

  For your information I attach a paper I recently prepared for
  the F.A. and Football League, I leave it to you to decide whether
  this is of any relevance or use to your enquiry.

  Kind regards

  Yours sincerely




 Alan Coppin

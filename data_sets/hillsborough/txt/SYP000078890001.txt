(1530)      we    decided            to    leave         the     ground,          more     or     less    to      get    out    of      the

carried         out    and      l ai d     outside,            I saw       people         who     were    motionless            who       I

suppose         must       have      been         dead     but      I never        actually           saw anyone           die.

From     arriving           in S h e f f i e l d         to    when      the      disaster           occurred          I never       saw

anyone       drinking           or     causing           a disturbance               by     fighting         or    doing       anything

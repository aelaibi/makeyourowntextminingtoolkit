We    arrived           in S h e f f i e l d        at    1.00pm           (1300)          a n d we       caught         the     bus     outside

the      railway          station which                  took       us     straight           to      the    ground.               The     reason

we    caught         this         bus w a s        because          the P o l i c e         were       waiting           at    th e     railway

and      escorted            to    the    bus       and       in f a ct         two    Policemen             travelled             on    the    bus

with      us.           At    no    time       on th e         journey           di d a n y         supporters            on     the     train

or    th e     bus      consume          any alcohol                because           it w a s        not    allowed.




I saw        no     supporters            on       the    street           or    in    pubs         drinking.




We a r r i v e d        at    the       Leppings          Ln       entrance           to    t/n e     ground        at    about         1 . 4 5 pm

(1343)         we    got      off       the    bus       and went             straight           into       th e    ground.              At    t hi s

t im e    there         were       no    queues          at    the       turnst/i l e s .              We w e n t        s t rai ght

through           and     handed         our       tickets          in     to it/he s t e w a r d .                There       were      Police

around         but      they       were       not    giving             any     directions,               however         at     this      time

there        was     no      n e e d as       people          could        see    where          to    go.          We    had      no

difficulty              finding          our       entry       point          and went           straight           along        the/ t u n n e l

and      into Pen            3,    at    this       point          in    the     g r o u n d we        saw     no    other/signs

directing            us w h e r e        to    go    and       as       soon     as    you       come       through a h e

turnstiles              the       only    thing          you       see     is    the       tunnel.            We     had       free      passage

along        the     tunnel         but       we    did       not       see     any    Police          or    stewards            along        the

t u n n e 1.



When      we      got     into      the       pen w e         went         and     stood with               our     backs        Vo     one    of

the      crash       barriers,            I n ow         know       t ha t      this       was      the     barrier           liff'iat b r o k e .

At    t his       time       the    pens       were       fairly           empty       there          was    enougn           space      to

walk      around          a n d we       both       sat       on    th e      flo o r .



At a b o u t        2.15prn        (1415)          I became             aware      t ha t    more         people         were      entering

the      pen a n d we             stood       up a g a i n ,        even        though more               people         were      now

entering            the      pen w a s        st i l l    fairly           empty       a n d we        could        s t i ll     move      about.

                                                                                                                                           S 1 176

        During        this      t ime       I was      not      worried       because          we w e r e       not       being          squashed

         or   crushed         because           the     barrier        behind was             stopping          people

        from     pushing          us,      however          1 was      aware       that       something             was       happening

         behind       because          people         were      coming       under       the     barrier            to    get       in f r o n t      of

        us.          All    the      time       this     was     happening          th e      crowd was             swaying          backwards

        and    forwards           but      t hi s     was    normal.




        When     1 looked            to    the      front       I could       see    that        there         was       now a       lot       of

        people        in the         pens       but    I would         say    that       there        was      no    crush          at    t hi s

        time.




        As    th e    crowd was            swaying          1 w as     be ij/g p u s h e d       forwards            but       each       t i me

        could        get    b a ck     to m y       original         plaice.         Then        at    about         2.55pm          (1453)

        there        was    a massive            surge       forward         and    both myself                and                   were

        carried        forward            and    I became         crushed          against          the     person            standing          in

        front.                         turned         to me     and     said       not     to w o r r y        as    it w o u l d         ease       oft

        in a s e c o n d .             Even      at    this     stage        I was       not     worried            I f el t

        uncomfortable                but     di d     not    feel      in a n y     danger.




        After        a few     seconds           I was       aware      that       the     crush was            not       easing          but       was

        becoming           worse       and      I started         to    become       worried.                  Somehow          I managed             to

        turn    slightly             and     looked         behind      and    1 could           see      a white             male       about       35--

        40yrs        about     5*8        stocky       buil/ti d a rk        collar        length         h air      and       moustache

               suffering             and     this      is w h e n      I became          aware        t ha t    something                was

        really wrong              and      became        very    frightened.                   I heard                         shout       to me
                                                                                                                                           t

        but    I could         not        see    him,       X tried       to m a k e       my way         towards                         but

        could        not    m o v e,      all    the     time     I wa s      finding          it     harder         and       harder          to

        breathe.             I could            hear     people        screaming           for      the     g at e       at    the       front       to

I could       feel       the     crush      from       behind an d          I shouted,      ]            I ’m     going,

I heard a man             behind        tell      me    to    hang     on    but   I p a s s e d out,        t ha t   the      lad

1 remember          of    being        in   the    pens.




When    I came         r o und    I was      sitting          on the        pitch and                  was    sat     n e xt

to me,       I. was      in a     great      deal       of    p a in a n d    I can      remember       screaming

all    the    t im e     because        I thought            I was     dreaming       and   t ha t     someone        would

wake    me    up.        I can     remember                      crying       at   the   sid e    of me       and     saying

that    the    person          next     to me      was       dead.      I then      passed       out    again.




The    next    time       I c am e      round      I was       in the        players     treatment           room.

remember       b e i ng    very        cold and         in    paijf,    there      was   also     a young        boy     of

about    nine       years        old    in the         r o om /as w el l .

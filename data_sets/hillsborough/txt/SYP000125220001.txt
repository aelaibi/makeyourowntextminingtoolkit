 THAT HAVE CONSIDERATION BEEN GIVEN TO THE COMFORT AND SAFETY OF FANS AT

 FOOTBALL GROUNDS, AND IF NECESSARY TO REDUCE CAPACITIES ON THE TERRACES EVEN

 MORE.     EACH CLUB SHOULD LOOK AT THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL GROUNDS AND CONSIDER THE

 NEEDS OF THEIR PARTICULAR SUPPORTERS.           IN THE CASE OF THE FA CUP THE FA

 THEMSELVES SHOULD PAY PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE COMFORT AND SAFETY

 BEEN A GRADUAL INCREASE IN THE PRESSURE OF THE CRUSH I WAS EXPERIENCING

          *
     AS THIS PRESSURE GRADUALLY INCREASED I WAS PUSHED SIDEWAYS ALONG THE

     CRUSH BARRIER TOWARDS THE DIVIDING FENCE AND PEN NUMBER TWO.       WHEN THE

     SURGE OCCURRED I WAS PUSHED FORWARDS AND FURTHER OVER TOWARDS PEN NUMBER

     TWO.       AT THE TIME I HAD NO IDEA WHAT MAY HAVE CAUSED THE SURGE.


    Q18
!
     046

1    WERE YOU INJURED IF SO DID YOU ATTEND HOSPITAL IN SHEFFIELD?

     NO ALL I EXPERIENCED WAS PAIN IN MY BACK DUE TO BEING TRAPPED UP AGAINST

     THE CRUSH BARRIER, ALTHOUGH IT WAS PAINFUL AT THE TIME,      I SUSTAINED NO
i
     A^UAL       INJURY.

    019
    049

              YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR IN THE DEATHS, OR

    THE INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

     THE ONLY THING I CAN THINK MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO CAUSING THE DEATH AND

     INJURIES IS THE PRESENCE OF THE FRONT PERIMETER FENCES, WHICH PREVENTED

    PEOPLE FROM ESCAPING OR SPILLING OVER ONTO THE PITCH.

     050

Q20

 G5E

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO.

 G53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 IT SEEMED OBVIOUS THAT AT FIRST THE POLICE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING

 B ^ A U S E AS PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO ESCAPE FROM THE TERRACES BY CLIMBING

 OVER THE FRONT PERIMETER FENCE THE POLICE WERE TELLING THEM TO GET BACK

 INTO THE TERRACES.             ALSO IT SEfeW^D TO TAKE A VERY LONG TIME FOR THE FIRST

 AMBULANCE TO ARRIVE ALTHOUGH I DID N h s N O T I C E AT THE TIME, AFTERWARDS WHILST

 VIEWING TELEVISION COVERAGE OF THE DISACT0R I NOTICED LARGE NUMBERS OF BOTH

 POLICEMEN AND STEWARDS STANDING AROUND ON TOS PKiTH DOING NOTHING TO HELP

 W ITH THE DEAD AND INJURED WHO WERE LYING ON THE rITCH AT THE LEPFINGS LANE

 END OF THE GROUND.                                  ^

 053

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED„

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 ^ ^ T H E TIME I DIDN’T REALISE HOW SERIOUS THE INCIDENT WAS, THE ONLY THING

 I THOUGHT OF AT THAT TIME WAS THAT THE SITUATION BY THE LEPPINGS LANE

 END GOAL WAS CHAOS, THERE WERE TOO MANY PEOPLE WANDERING ABOUT, ALTHOUGH

 STEWARDS WERE TRYING TO CLEAR THE AREA.

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT-^QU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 ONE SERIOUS ERROR WAS THE LACK OF ^ G N S a TO DIRECT PEOPLE ENTERING THE

 GROUND TO THE TERRACES AT THE SIDES OF LEPPINGS LANE,    I AM SURE THAT A LOT

 OF SUPPORTERS LIKE MYSELF WHO HAD NOT BEEN TO THAT GROUND BEFORE WOULD HAVE

 F ^ S U M E D THAT THE CENTRAL TUNNEL WAS THE ONLY ENTRANCE TO THE LEPPINGS LANE

 TERRACES.

 DO W U   HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS H A N D L E D ,

 I DO NOT FEEL THAT THE POLICE APPRECIATED WHAT HAD OCCURED AND SO DID NOT GET

 I ALSO THINK THAT MORE USE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE OF THE P.A SYSTEM.

 IT WAS PERFECTLY OBVIOUS TO Hfes^Tj2.15PM (1415) THAT PEN NUMBER FOUR WAS OVER

 DIRECTIONS INSIDE THE GROUND,

 <353

DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS ORN^SERV AT IO N S ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED r

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPEO?S

MY OVERALL IMPRESSION WAS OF OV^R a L l CHAOS.        I DID NOT GET THE IMPRESSION THAT

 ^ONE        WAS ORGANISING THE EMERGENCY SERVICES.

 THE DEPLOYMENT OF A LARGE NUMBER OF POLICE ACROSS THE HALFWAY LINE GAVE THE

 IMPRESSION THAT THE POLICE WERE REACTING SOLELY TO A PUBLIC ORDER SITUATION,

 THE QUALITY AND USE OF THE PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM WAS TOTALLY INADEQUATE.

I THINK THAT YOU HAVE GOT T o \ | ^ E CREDIT TO THE POLICE OFFICERS ON THE PITCH.

IT SEEMED TO TAKE A LONG TIME FOR THE POLICE TO REALISE THAT SOMETHING WAS

t^pNG BUT ONCE THEY DID THEY ALL HELPED ALONG WITH THE SUPPORTERS.

054

IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

IN MY OPINION THE STORIES RELEASED ABOUT PEOPLE URINATING ON PEOPLE     &   THAT

FANS WERE LOOTING PEOPLES POCKETS ETC, ARE COMPLETELY UNTRUE.

I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT IN MY OPINION AN INCIDENT OF THIS NATURE WILL

HAPPEN AGAIN BECAUSE TOO MANY PEOPLE ARE STILL ALLOWED INTO THE GROUND,.

IT SEEMS THAT THERE ARE ONLY A FEW CLUBS; DERBY COUNTY & TOTTENHAM HOTSPURS

BEING TWO, THAT HAVE DECREASED THE NUMBERS ALLOWED ONTO THE TERRACES,

SUFFICIENTLY.

 I HAVE HEARD OF PEOPLE BEIKi CRUSHED AT FOOTBALL HATCHES SINCE HILLSBOROUGH.

 IN FACT MY SISTER WENT TO fc;EE PORT VALE   &   PRESTON PLAY AT THE PRESTON GROUND,

 A SHORT TIME AFTER HILL.SOBOROUGH & THERE WAS A SMALL FIRE UNDER THE STANDS &

 EVERY ONE RUSHED FORWARD & IT APPEARED OVER CROWDED.

 THE OLD TRAFFORD GROUND IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE WORST.          I THINK THAT THE

 PERIMETER FENCES SHOULD BE REMOVED UNLESS IT IS AN ALL SEATED GROUND,

 AFTER ENTERING PEN THREE WE INTIALLY TOOK UP POSITION ONE.     AFTER A COUPLE OF

 FORWARDS SURGE AMONGST THE PEOPLE TOWARDS THE FRONT OF THE PEN,    IN THE BOTTOM

 RIGHT HAND CORNER OF THE PEN,     AS BEST I REMEMBER, THE FORWARDS SURGE

 OCCURED WHILE THE GAME WAS STILL BEING PLAYED, NOT LONG BEFORE THE GAME WAS

 STOPPED.     I CAN ONLY ASSUME THAT THE FORWARDS SURGE MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY

        BARRIER BREAKING.

  NO

  Q43

  DID YOU WITNESS ANY CROWD CRUSH?

  IT WASN’T UNTIL I SAW PEOPLE CLIMBING OVER THE FRONT FENCE THAT I REALISED

  ^PT    IT MUST BE VERY PACKED IN THE PEN.   I WAS NOT ACTUALLY AWARE OF PEOPLE

  BEING CRUSHED.

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 PEOPLE IN PEN THREE COULD NOT GET OUT QUICKLY ENOUGH.     THE FRONT PERIMETER

 FENCE AND THE SMALLNESS OF THE GATE IN THE FRONT FENCE PREVENTED A QUICK

 EVACUATION OF PEOPLE FROM THE PEN.

 THERE WAS A LACK OF MEDICA;_ EQUIPMENT SUCH AS STRETCHERS.

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH^TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?                    N.

 THE ROADWORKS ON THE WAY TO SHEFFIELD CAUSED A LOT OF PEOPLE TO ARRIVE LATE.

 WHEN THEY DID GET THERE, A LACK OF ORGANISATION CAUSED THE PROBLEMS OUTSIDE

^ p E TURNSTILES.    ONCE INSIDE THE GROUND, THEw-JWERE NO SIGNS INDICATING THE

 WAY TO THE TERRACES, RESULTING IN MOST PEOPLE USING THE TUNNEL CAUSING THE

 OVERCROWDING.

 OLD TRAFFORD WOULD HAVE BEEN A MUCH BETTER VENUE.

 SPORTING EVENTS.      ALSO I EELIEVE THAT AROUND 90% OF ALL FOOTBALL GROUNDS ARE

 NOT OF A REASONABLE SAFETY STANDARD AND I THINK, UNFORTUNATELY, THAT AN

  INCIDENT OF THIS NATURE WILL HAPPEN AGAIN.

 WHEN I WAS WALKING P A ^ K T H E WEST STAND TURNSTILES (GROUND SIDE) TRYING TO FIND

 MY WAY AROUND TO THE NORTH^SqrAND SIDE OF THE LEPPINGS LANE TERRACES,        I SAW A

 SCUFFLE BETWEEN A COUPLE OF SuN^ORTERS? AND A COUPLE OF POLICEMEN, I THINK THE

 POLICE HAD CAUGHT THEM.

 NOTHING TO HELP.          I   CANNOT   SAY IF THEY WERE SUFFERING SHOCK   OR WAITING TO BE

 SUPERCEEDED ANY ORDERS AND             THOSE STANDING AROUND WOULD HAVE GOT INTO GEAR      )

 WITHOUT NEEDING TO BE TOLD.

                          QUESTION                 TWO

Why were there no barriers or cordons to filter the crowd and
prevent a build up outside the Leppings Lane end of the ground if,
as the fans insist, there were the previous year?


Chief Superintendent Duckenfield stated that the Operational order for 1989
Semi-Final was based on previous experience. Intelligence reports did not indicate
that there would be a lot of non-ticket holders. Police Operations had worked
previously with fans arriving over a period of time and obeying instructions in the
programme and press. It was never envisaged that a situation would arise where we
would have to change our operational plan.

Assistant Chief Constable Jackson stated that at all ticket matches it has always been
the practice for Police Officers to filter and weed out wherever possible. Those who
are boisterous and refuse to co-operate are dealt with by strict positive control,
however we would soon lose manpower if making wholesale arrests.



OBSERVATIONS
Please see pages 7 - 1 5 , Volume 2.



Lord Justice Taylor - Recommendation 46

46. The Operational Order for each match at a designated sports ground should
enable the police to cope with any forseeable pattern in the arrival of spectators at a
match and in their departure. It should provide for sufficient reserves to enable rapid
deployment of officers to be made at any point inside or outside the ground.

                                   So to deal with the problem of people arriving and packing
                                   that concourse, you would have expected the Police and the
                                   horses in helping  then to form people into queues? - A.
                                   Under normal circumstances sir, yes.

                              Q. Kow the non-ticket holcers.  As I understand your answers
                                 there is very little you can do to step sonebody v/ithcut
                          B      a ticket going to the turnstiles.  Is that './hat your view
                                 of vour duties is? - A. Ho, our role is to speak v/ith
                                  people and if possible ensure that ticket holders join
                                 the q u e u e s .

                              Q. Yes, now no problem about ascertaining who has get tickets
                                 because all ycu need is a man with a megaphone near the
                                 roundabout at the top of Leppincs Lane asking people to
                                 show their tickets, then ycu know who has got a ticket,
                                 don't you? - A. You can ask someone to c.o tr.at ana vou
                                 can believe that that would take         but that is total1"


                              O. You see, :ir. Duckenfield, at other grounds and other places
                                 the Police do use public address systems a distance from
                                 the ground to communicate v/ith fans.  Do you say that that
                      D          is not a possibility in Sheffield? - A. Are you suggesting
                                 that a man stand at the corner of Leppings Lane v/ith a
                                 meca^hcne and,can you repeat the latter part?

                              o. Yes, you don * i.u get into Leppings Lane unless yc u h a

                                 Lane you can do it halfway down if you like? - A. Can
                                 make the point, and what I said was a realistic situa
                                 rve drew an Oper ational Ord ar for this particular game
                                 based on previous experience.             was a successful orde:
                                 and worked very well.          Furthermore the intelligence did
                                 not indicate there would be a lot of non-ticket holders.
                                 If as you sugges.t-.we put a man v/ith a megaphone at the..

                                  iouth o; Leppings                that ooint is considerable.

                              0. Vie 11 vou don't have to do it at the mouth. - A. Let u£
                                 move it back 100 vards across the bridge.

                              O. i;o, not the bridge. - A. May I make     the point?  You are
                                 moving the goal posts.   We started off at the top of
                                 Lepoings Lane and because I said it was a difficult situation
                                 we"have moved down the bridge.   L e t ’s agree on halfway.

                              O.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  Mr. Duckenfield, nobody is
                                   talking about the bridge, as I understand it.   :?e are
                                   talking about the approach down Leppings Lane from the

         a cordon halfway down Leppings Lane then that is a totally
         different policing operation to the one we have been
         accustomed to and once you forva a cordon you create another
         problem because where do the people go that you stop at
         that cordon?   V.'here do the non-ticket holders go?  In the
         location I have described it is my understanding we are
g        between somewhere in the region of Vere Road and Bickerton
         Road, private housing, shops, commercial preraises.    There
         has to be an understanding and consideration for those local
         residents cxbout the build up of a crowd at that location
         and where they are going to go.     Those roads have been
         barriered off for very go.od reasons in the past and ;nanr.ec
         and I would say it causes another prohlea if there is c.
         build ut3 at that location by pushing the crowd further round

               HR. MYTUZR:  I am not sure that I folio*.; the problaa.
         Those with tickets simply walk on, they just hold then up.
         Those not holding tickets are told to “go back, you are not
         coainc through, push off." what is v/ronc with that? - A.
         In theory that is acceptable.  In practice cur experience
         has not been that this is necessary.

D   o.     am nappy to       "in theory11 it is practical because one
                        ;arlier
         answer giver, ec       in the Inquiry was that the Police
         would have no power to stop a non-ticket, holder going to
         the ground as a sightseer.     The fact is that if the Police
         v/grs having cirriculty controlling a crcwc, a ncn— ticx.ec
         holder would be interfering with the operation of the Police
         in croud control and there would be no problem about telling
         him to push off back up towards the roundabout, would there?
         - A. There would if he did not want to go.      He has a right
         to pass and repass.

    Q.   If he is obstructing the Police in the execution of their
         duties he can be told to "Push o f f 11 can't he? - A. He can
         if he insists on breaking through the cordon when you have
         given a directive.

    Q. Certainlv, so looking at the matter iron beyond tne turn-
       stiles, vou accept that a proper Police operation could
       have controlled the flow of people before it crushed
       into that concourse before the turnstiles? - A. The Police
       operation as envisaged had worked previously with fans
       arriving over a period of time and obeying instructions
       in the programmes and the Press and it was never envisaged
       that a situation would arise on this occasion whereby we
       would have to change our operational plans.

    n    By 2.30 - of course it is said it is much earlier but you
         have insisted on 2.3 0 so I accept it - by 2.30 this snail
         concourse between the railings and the turnstiles
         jammed full of people, wasn t it? - A. My view was from the
         camera and yes, there were a lot of peop

      If the Police operation in Leppings Lane had been an
      efficient one there never would have come an occasion when
      the whole cf that narrow little concourse was jammed full
      of spectators or potential spectators, would there, there
      v/ould      been cueues     :ne :urns' :ile£  - A. jl disagree
      sir.   We police by consent in eh:           v and you are
      laying the blame at the door of the Police Service.       The
B     general public who were approaching that location can
      see the situation and our operation was designed for co­
      operation and one would hope if they saw a crowd they
      v/ould wait and form a queue.

D     vlell generally            eaking people who approach a cinema queue
      who see a queue as they approach it along                      street stand
      ar.d wait.

      A cinema cueue is a queue.    T m s was not a queue.  !,v i : c ' . e
      seen it on the video and you have seen it. At 2.30, .cnc
      before you can talk about late-comers, there was a jam
      .v/hich had been permitted to form in that concourse.    Is it
      your considered view that Policemen can reasonably anticipc
       that oeople coming down Leppings Lane would then of their
      own volition halt and go no further until they saw the jam
      disperse? - A. I don't see why football supporters should
      have a different approach and mentality to queueing than
      anybody else and I v/ould have thought as they arrived on
      Lepoincrs Lane and -saw a situation and a queue they would-
      halt and form a queue.

    Q. Can you tell us in those circumstances, if that is what
       is reasonably to be expected of football supporters, why
       there is any need for Police presence at all at a football
       cround? - A. Because there is a minority of football
       supporters who don't behave themselves.

    O. And that is the only reason for having a Police presence,
       that is to deal with the minority who are hooligans? - A.
       There is an obvious policing presence for safety and public
       order, but x would suggest that we       :o deal v/ith the
       hooligan element in football.

    O. nobody has disputed tnat.  Are you saying other tnan
       hooliganism and public order there is no need for a Police
H      presence at a football match? - A. There is the matter of
       safety.
                                                                                         10

      But nothing to do v/ith crowd control or forming people into
      queues, they should do that themselves? - A. No, we have a
      responsibility there but I would hone that we can ask for
      the*assistance of the public to form orderly queues.

 Q. I'iov/ we come to the period before the gates were open. Is
    it your view now, still your view, that at 2.30 and 2.40 the
B centre pens 3 and 4 were not fully packed? - A. Yes sir,
    as far as I am aware.

    ). Uhat is your understanding of the density of a crowd on the
       terraces when capacity has been reached, so that if the
       capacity of the pen is 120 0 and 1200 are in the pen, what
       is'your perception cf the distribution of people.   Car. people
       out their hands in their pockets and reach their hanckerchiefs?
       Can they road their programme comfortably?    Are they jostled
       by the person in front or behind?   ‘’hat is the position as
       vour perception of it? - A. I v/ould say a shoulder to shoulder
       chest to back.

     . ;?hat chest to back touching? - A. Yes.

    2. Shoulder to shoulder touching? - A. Yes.
D
    2. Mo room to pick your programme up and look at it in front
        of your face? - A. Ito, I think if you are chest to back
       and shoulder to shoulder there v/ould be room., bul

   encourage people to come early? We actually wrote to the
   people who have the match programmes; we wrote to Chief
   Officers of Police; we went on the media; we asked people
   to come early so that they could get into the ground in
   plenty of time.

Q. Now, Mr. Jackson, a Police operation has got to deal with
   things as they develop.  We have heard much of this from
   Mr. Duckenfield about assessing the developing situation.
   By 2.30 it looks from the videos as though there were
   pretty crushed crowds within the turnstile area and
   arriving at the perimeter outside the railings.

          Can I now deal with how that perhaps should have beer,
    controlled.  You agree that the first essential’ is not
    to allow the turnstile area to be full? - A. Yes.

Q. You therefore need a cordon of some sort or a filtering
   system outside the turnstile area and at Leppings Lane
   the one advantage is that you have got the railings to
   enable you to filter.  Is that right? - A. Yes.

Q. But in addition you need control of the crowd down Leppings
   Lane.  That is right, isn't it? - A. Kell we had sufficient
   Police Officers on duty to take account of matters like
   that.

Q. Well that may be.     What I want to deal with is what can
   be done.  Whether it 'was done on this occasion is another
   matter, but l e t ’s see what can be done.,/

          Both from the point of view of traffic control, ,
    that is enabling traffic to pass and repass.along Lepplncs ■
    Lane and over the bridge, and from the point of view of
    controlling the crowd arriving at the railings, all you
    need do is what is done on match days in stadium after
    stadium up and down the country, that is a controlled
    crocodile" may be six, may be seven, may be four or five
    deeo, but a controlled crocodile walking on the pavement
    down Leppings Lane controlled by mounted Police? - A. Well
    I think that is what the mounted Police Officers were
    trying to do.

Q. Well whether they did or did not is again another matter,
   Mr. Jackson.  All I am asking from you is an acknowledgement
   that there are means of controlling a crowd arriving at
   a stadium whether late or early? - A. Yes, I accept that.

Q. So if the control of the crowd, whether they had arrived
  f a t 2.15 or 2.30 or 2.45, whenever the bulk of them had
    arrived, if they had been escorted down Leppings Lane
    - as we can see very clearly in photographs which I think
    were taken last year - escorted down in a crocodile and
    then onlv allowed into the turnstile area through the
    gates when there was room within the area, there would have
    been no crushing? - A. I think that is what the Police
    Officers were trying to do.
                                                                12

         the general briefing I think you spoke to your Chief
         Inspectors again? - A. Yes, I die.

    Q. That is Chief Inspector Waring and Chief Inspector Purdy
       and did you - and I am taking this from your statement -
       reaffirm what you considered to be the salient points of
       the duty, that is searching, coach reception and general
B      standards of behaviour? - A. That is right.

    Q. And did you indicate your intention which to patrol on foot
       throughout the sector until kick-off? - A. Yes.

    Q. And youwould end up, as I understand what you have told us,
       you always intended to end up at the Leppings Lane turnstiles?
       - A. Yes.

    Q. And you intended to get there at about quarter-past-2? - A.
       Yes.

    Q. You were not, as I understand it apart from not being directly
       responsible for the Officers on duty outside the turnstiles>
       you were a l s o not directly responsible for the mounted
       Officers? - A. Yes, I had some mounted Officers working for
D      uie. I had six at Wads ley Dridge Station; si>: at the turn­
       stiles and four in Kaliia:c Road.

    q   . y/ere they under your command? - A. They are under the command
         of their own Inspector, in fact, ilr. Hanas-Davis who was
         nominally in charge of the mounted Officers, but to an
         extent if I asked the mounted Officers to do something for
E        me cney woulci do i — .

    Q. Did you liaise v/ith Inspector Kands-Davis beforehand in order
       to work, out with him what use you v/ould-, or to what use you
       v/ould put the mounted Officers? - A. No.

    Q. It was a case, was it, if the need arose you could contact
       him? - A. Well I have worked very close v/ith Paul Hands-Davis
       over many years on football matches, crov/d control, and
       he v/ould not need me to tell him v/hat to do in a situation.
       He would know instinctively v/hat to do.

    Q. What did you understand, v/hat did you believe the mounted
       Officers in your sector v/ould be doing assuming you gave them
       no instructions? - A. The Officers in Halifax Road v/ould have
       the job of stationing themselves on the route from the
       station, Wads ley Bridge Station down to the ground.  The
       chaps up at the Station v/ould have the job of meeting the
       train when it arrived and forming the fans into a crocodile
       and then escorting the fans down to the ground.   The mounted
       Officers at the Leppings Lane turnstiles would have the job
       of maintaining the queues and doing a generally high profile
       role, the one that they are used to.

H   Q. Did you anticipate that there v/ould be mounted Officers in
       Leppings Lane itself at or before the perimeter gates to
       the ground?- A. Yes, they are usually there on match days.
                                                                           14

Controlling the crowds coming down towards the ground? - A.
Yes, what we try to do is to get people that come from the
Station to queue on the right-hand side of Leppings Lane,
outside the sweet shop which I think appears on the photo­
 graphs and queue along there until they actually get into
the turnstile area.

So the idea of controlling by queueing in Leppings Lane is
one which you understood was long standing? - A. Yes, you
appreciate that some teams in the lowly reaches of the
First Division don't bring too big a crowd and so queueing
does not present a problem, but when you get the likes of
Man. U t d ......

You knew you were getting a full house? - A. I knew there
would be a queue.

And therefore you knew that there v/ould be a need for
arranging queueing even before, or likely to be a need
for arranging queueing even before you reached the perimeter
cates? - A. Oh yes.

You I think began your own foot patrolling a b o u t q u a r t e r -
to-11 in the morning.  Is that correct? - A. That is right.

You walked around to see that all was going v/ell, around
vour area.  I don't think we need take this in any detail,
but were you aware in the course of the norning and let's
take it now from v/hat. 10.45 up until about 1 o'clock .as
the general period, that there were obviously a large number,
of fans in the area.    Would that be fair? - A. Yes.

Wha.t about drinking.  Were you aware of drinking? - A. Yes,
there Was a lot of drinking going on.   I walked down as.
far as the precinct in Hillsborough because I made it.in
my mind to call at the off-licence in the precinct because ,
there had been a robbery there committed by Liverpool fans
last year and I went and spoke to the two ladies, who ran
that.   Outside there was a youth drinking from a can of
strong lager with another three cans of strong lager in his
possession.   I spoke to him and told him if he drank all that
lager he might have a job getting into the ground, but that
was fairly general.   I was being approached all the time by
young fans wanting to know the location of pubs that were
open and it was very much a carnival atmosphere. Despite
the drinking the fans were reasonably well behaved at that
stacre, but the drinking was continuing all over the area.

Can I put to you the summary which I think appears at page 10
of your statement and I hope I am right, it covers about
the sort of time I have been talking about, where you
summarise t h u s :

       "This time there was no trouble and despite
       v/hat seemed to me to be far too much drinking
       going on the fans were well behaved."

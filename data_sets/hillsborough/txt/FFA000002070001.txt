24th April 1989




Brent Safety Committee consisting of representatives of:
Brent Council as Licensing Authority under Safety of Sports Grounds Act.
Metropolitan Police and the
London Fire Civil Defence Authority
met on Friday, 21st April 1989 and agreed the following points in response to the concerns
expressed after the Hillsborough tragedy.
There are significant differences between design, structure and layout of the Hillsborough
and Wembley Stadium.
Final decisions on any necessary safety modifications at the Stadium will be made after
the outcome of the judicial inquiry.
In the meantime, for those events scheduled at the Stadium in the next two months:
        (a)   The pitch perimeter fence complies with the advice contained in the Home
              Office Guide to Safety of Sports Grounds.
        (b)   the pitch perimeter fence is demountable
        (c)   If it is used the Committee are satisfied that it is perfectly safe.
Following the tragic events at Sheffield it is hoped that fans will recognise that now is an
opportunity to dispense with such containment and any request by Wembley Stadium
Limited to remove the fence, will be sympathetically considered. There remains the
possibility to re-install the fence if circumstances so warrant.
It is stressed that the above are the views of the Safety Committee. Wembley Stadium
Limited may have their own views as to whether the fence should be in position.

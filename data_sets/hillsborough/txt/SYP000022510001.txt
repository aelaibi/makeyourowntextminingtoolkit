                       With reference to the above the attached correspondence
                  from Hill Dickinson & Co., (Solicitors) Equity Law House,
                  Liverpool, has been received at this office today
                  24th May, 1989.

                        The letter has been acknowledged, (copy attached).

                       The letter was hand delivered to HQ on 22nd May, 1989,
                  with a view to Constable Garrett attending the enquiry
                  today (24th May, 1989). In view of the urgency
                  Constable Garrett approached Chief Inspector Salisbury
                  on 22nd May, 1989, and a further copy of the letter was
                  "Faxed" to the Chief Constables Office. Assistant Chief
                  Constable Howe was approached on 23rd May, 1989, and
                  approval was given for Constable Garrett to attend on
                  24th May, 1989, on Special Duty. Chief Inspector Salisbury
                  is dealing now with the matter.

                       I have forwarded a copy of this file to The Hillsborough
                  Enquiry Team at Smithdown Lane and ask that this report
                  be forwarded to The Chief Superintendent ’F ' Division
                  for his information.

Dear Sir
                                                      HILLSBOROUGH

           We are instructed by the Football Supporters Association who
have been granted full rights of legal representation before Lord
Justice Taylor in the Public Inquiry into the events at
Hillsborough on Saturday, 15th April. The purpose of our client's
representation is to represent football supporters generally
in circumstances where Lord Justice Taylor was firmly of the view
that that body of opinion should have a voice at the Inquiry.


            In this capacity we have recently called one of your
Officers, Constable Garrett of Belle Vale Police Station, to give
evidence to the Inquiry.                             Although Constable Garrett's factual
 evidence as an eye witness has now been completed, it is clear
that there are a number of other matters of which evidence or
 advice from this Officer will be of importance to the Inquiry.


            Mr John Jackson of Counsel, who is instructed on our behalf,
 has consequently requested that facilities be made available to
 allow this Officer to attend the Inquiry as and when required,
 which may on occasions be on short notice.

      Obviously, we will try to limit Constable Garrett's
 involvement as much as possible, and we will not call him on any
 more occasions than are absolutely necessary. However, Constable
 Garrett's knowledge of football supporters and policing will, we
 feel, be of invaluable assistance in enabling the Inquiry to reach
                                   ROY G. HILL

await to hear from you.

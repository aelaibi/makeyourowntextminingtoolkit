  HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY

  As you may be aware, the Hillsborough Stadium
  Disaster Inquiry under Lord Justice Taylor is
  now in its Part II looking at the wider issues
  of crowd control and safety at sports events in
  general.
   Lord Justice Taylor has expressed interest in
   the research work being done on the causes of
   crime in inner cities and the role organised
   sport, especially football, can play in
   tackling the problem. It would be very helpful
   if you could advise us what stage the research
   has reached and the progress made to date.

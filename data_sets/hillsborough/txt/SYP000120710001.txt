               At     0943          am    that       date       I attended                a    briefing             in    the    North          Stand       at     t he

               ground.               I    was     in 5 e r i a l       60.           FS       2019       Thompson          was       in    charge          of    t he

               is B f i a l .


               The        briefing             was    concluded             at       about          1030       am    that       morning          and       after        it


                I had          my    first       meal       (provided)                in       the       North       Stand.

               At     approx,             1110       am    that       date       I     left          the       ground with my              serial            on f o o t

               to     take          up    duty       in P e n i s t o n e        Road          from       Borough          R o a d to      Burton

               Street.               We    worked          in    pairs       and          1 was          in    the       company          of    PC    76    Durhaw.

               Our        foot       patrol          was    mainly          done          between             two    public          houses          which       were

               open           on    Penistone             Road.        The       Royal          Hotel          was       one.        I    cannot          remember

               the        name       of    the       other.           It   was        apparent                to    me    from       the       start       of    this

               duty           that       large       numbers          of    football                  supporters were beginning                             to

               gather              outside       these          premises.                 TheL i c e n s e e         of   one         of   them           (the    one

                1 h a v e n ’t           named)       was       even       patrolling                with          his    rockweiller                dog.        It

               was        a    warm       sunny       day       and    there          was       a    lot       of    alcohol             being       consumed           by

               many           of    the    fans.           Outside          these             pubs.           The    bulk       of       supporters
                                                                                                                                                                   ^CAS-C\ \
appeared           to      be       coming             from       the       direction             of       the       city          centre          and       most

of    them       were       Nottingham                      Forest          fans.           Many          appeared             to       have       been

drinking,             scores             of       them       were          still       carrying             beer          glasses             with          beer

and    lager          still          inside*                others          were       drinking             from          cans          and       bottles             as

they    passed.                 In       the          event       I    never          once       witnessed                any       trouble.                 The

mood    appeared                good          humoured.                    Though       I was             told       that          the     Licensee               of

the    Royal          Hotel          was          suspected                of    selling          “crates             of       beer*          to       the       fans

from    the        ’b a c k         door          of       the    pub"          1 never          once       saw       him          doing          this.

Between          a p p r o x . "I p m                 that       date       and       H .45      pm       with       PC    Durham             1    performed

traffic          duty       at       the          junction             of       Pen!stone             Road       with          I    think          Owlerton

took    it       in     turns            to       stand          in    the       roadway.                 All    this          time        the         passing

fans    many          on    foot          and          in    vehicles                continued             to    be       well          behaved«

At    2.45       pm     ( 1 4 4 5 ) that                   date       we    left       our       traffic             point          and       together

with    PC       Durham             and       my       serial          we       started          to       walk       towards             the       ground

where       according                to       our          orders          we    were       to    boar d a            coach             w h i ch w o u l d            be

that    coach.              Within                a    few       yards          of    the     ground            (main          entrance                on

Penistone             Road)          PS       Thompson,                who       had    the       only          radio          in       the       detail

started          to     pick         up       a       distorted             message           from         ground          control                to    the

effect       that          there          were             serious          problems             inside          the       ground             and       would

every       available                officer                make       their          way     there,             I would                say       the       time

now    was       just       after             3       pm    ( 1 5 0 0 ).,        With       my    serial             we    walked             through             t he

main    entrance                sliding                doors          and       then    we       were       told          to       ’s t a n d b y * in            a

small       e n c 1o s u r e         between                the       N orth         Stand       and       th&       Spion          Kop.           T h e r e were

a    very     larg         number             of       other          officers          there,              I    could             not     see         the

pitch       and       for       a    time             nobody       was          quite       sure          what       was       happening,                    I

would       be     stood            in    this             position             for    about          5    to    7    minutes.                 We       were

then    instructed                   to       go       onto       the       pitch.            The         reason          was       not       made          clear

at    this       time,          and       1 did             not       know       what       I was          going          to       be    doing.              I
                                                                                                                                                              kCA&<\\
just,    followed             the        r e m a i n d e r of         my       serial           and       our    sergeant.                   As     we

walked        onto          the    pitch         I saw             large       n u m b e r s of       fans       together               with

police        officers,             f i remen,            first          aiders,           etc: t e n d i n g            to    scares          of

injured           persons          who       were        lying       on    the        ground.              Dozens             of    others          were

rushing           around          giving        what          assistance              they          could.           I saw          some       persons

being        conmforted             by       others           some       were       gasping           for       their          breath          and

others        had       a    ghastly           look       on       their       faces        which          were          either         very        pale/

white        or    purple          in    colour.               Many       were        holding             their          chests.             1 still

was     not       sure       what       our      duty         on    the    field           was       so    I went             amongst          many       of

the     injured             fans    to       see     if       I could          be     of    any       assistance.                    By      this

time     X was          in    the        region           of t h e       Liverpool goalmouth.                             By       this       time        it

was     apparent             that        all        those involved                   were being                attended            to    and      there

was     little          I    could       do.         I was          fortunate              that       the       worst          was       over       and      I


did     not       encounter             some        of    the       terrifying              scenes             of    people             being

trapped           up    against              the f e n c e     and        dying       that           have       been          described             to

me    afterwwards,                  I        di d not      witness             any         of       the    fans          pushing          o t h e r s in

the     Liverpool             pens           whilst,          I was       there.            Most,         of    them          seemed         to     be o n

the     field          and    this           was beginning                to     cause          another          problem.

I assisted              fans       tearing           down          advertising              boards             around          the       perimeter

to    use     as       make       shift        stretchers.                 I saw           that       a    temporary                first         aid

post     had       been       set       up     at    the       far       end     of    the          North       Stand          on    the       pitch

and     it    was       towards          that        point          that       many        of       the    dead          and       dying       were

being        carried.              It    was        at    this       point          that        I    realised             the       full       scale

of    the     disaster.                 It     was       hard       to    see       where           help       was       most       urgently

needed.            In m y         opinion           all       was    being          done        that       could          be       done      in     the

circumstances                 but       the      crowd         in    the       North        Stand          were          far       from

satisfied.                  There       were        constant             taunts        form          them       and       many       were

screaming              abuse       at    the        Police          on    the       field.            They          appeared            to     blaming

us    for     what          had    happened.                  1 felt       at       one     time          that       a    rather          dangerous

situation              was    developing                 in    the       crowd.            It       crossed          my       mind       for      one
brief        moment           that       fans        from       all     points          of    the       ground        were        going           to

rush     the        pitch          and    assault              and    cause        serious           harm       to     many       Police

officers.                Tension          and        feelings           w e re     running           ext remly            high.            Taunts

and     jeers        from          the     Nottingham                Forest        stand          (Spion       Hop)         caused          a     rush

of     Liverpool              supporters              across          the     field          and     at     this       point          I was

ordered         by       a    Superintendent                    together           with       a    large        number           of    other

officer's           to       form    a     cordon          across          the     whole          width       of     the     field,         to        keep

rival         fans       apart.            It    was       whilst          I was        doing        this       that        large          numbers

of     injured           and       dead     persons             were       carried           through          the      cordon          on       boards/

stretchers               to    the       North        Stand,            An    announcement                  was      then        made       to        t he

effect         that          the    match        had       been       cancelled              and     fans      were         to     remain             in

position            until          arrangements                 could        be    made       for       their        safe        e '•<it    from

the     ground.               At    this        point          I was       again        instructed              to     leave          the       ground

and     go     onto          Peru.stone          Road          outside        the       main       entrance            to     supervise

fans      b o a r d i ng       buse$        t a k i ng         them     into       the       c ity      centre.             ! his      w as       to

prevent         any          rush    and        further          injury           in    a    panic        situation.

It     was     whilst          I was        performing                  this       duty      that         I was a p p r o a c h e d             by

Detective            Inspector              Alan           V i m ms,.      By      this      time         I hia d b e c o m e         totally

detached            from       my    detail               D1    Timms        arrived          outside           the       ground           on

Peru.stone           Road          near     the       main       entrance              in    a Police           vehicle           and       tie

asked         that       I and       five        other          officers,              whose       names        I do        not       know

assist         him       in    carrying              a large          filing           cabinet          into       the      g y m n a s i urn f r o m

disaster            struck          me.     In       all       mytwenty           years       service                in     the       force          I

had. n e v e r       seen          death        on    such       a    large        scale.            I saw         well      over          60

bodies         on    I,he      gym       floor.            I was        saddened             to    see      that       many       were          so

young.          The          atmosphere              inside          the     gym       was    very        tense        and       unnerving.

When      I    left          I joined           PS    Sherratt.               He       asked       me     what       1 was        doing           I

told     him        that       I had        become             detached           from       my    detail          and      because             h is

men     were        also       depleted              he    instructed               I stay         with       him.          We    then          formed
                                                                                                                                                     t \ ^ \

  a    cordon    across       the    entrance              to    the    gym       preventing          unlawful             access

  to    the    building       which        was    being          used       as    a make       shift       mortuary.              Press

  in    particular         were     kept     well          away.        It       was    whilst       I was          there       that    I

  saw    many    more       bodies     being          taken       from       ambulances             and    then       carried

  into    the    gym.        Relatives           of    the       dead       and       injured       were       by    now

  beginning       to       gather     in    numbers.              It    was       a    very    distressing                sight.        1

  assisted       in    direction           some       of    them       to    a    nearby       desk       in    the       North

  Stand       which    had    been     set       up    as       a missing             persons       bureau.

  Eventually          at    about    6.30        pm    ( 1830)         we w ere         stood       down       from       our

  position.            I then      returned           to    Claywheels                Lane    and    to    M e x bo r o u g h

  Police       Station       via    Dors c a s t e r       DHG.        I retired             from    duty       at    8    pm    (2000)

           Dear

           Thank you for your recent letter to the Prime Minister
           which has been passed to this department in view of our
           responsibilities for the Safety of Sports Grounds Act.  I
           apologise for the delay in replying to you.

            Thank you for submitting your plan for terrace development and
            expressing your view that all seated accommodation at football
            grounds is not essential to solve the problems of crowd safety
            and control.   However, it is a view which the government does
            not share and which does not equate with the views expressed
            by Lord Justice Taylor in his Final Report on the Hillsborough
            Stadium disaster.   He recognised that there was no single
            solution to achieve total safety and cure all the problems of
            crowd control.  However, he was satisfied that seating does
            more to achieve these objectives than any other single
            measure.  Furthermore this is in line with the policies of
            both FIFA and UEFA.

                                                                         Yours sincerely




                                                                         MR S BILBE
                                                                         (Fire Emergency
                                                                         Planning Department)

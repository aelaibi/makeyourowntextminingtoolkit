      HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY: REQUESTS FOR STATEMENTS

      Thank you for your letter of 8th November 1989 regarding the
      likely requests from those parties involved in the civil
      action, for witness statements and information currently in
      your possession as a result of the Inquiry.

      I do believe that it would be proper to write to the parties
      involved confirming the policy on the non-release of material.
      If there are any difficulties in this regard or if Dr Popper
      disagrees please do not hesitate to contact me.

      I should like to take this opportunity on behalf of myself,
      Chris Newell, Michael Kennedy, Mr Williams and Mr Birts, to
      express our thanks for the kind and generous hospitality which
      you and your colleagues extended to us on Friday last.  I know
      that we all found the visit to the Hillsborough stadium and
      the Nechells police station, invaluable.  To have been able to
      see the "locus" and also the detailed extent of the
      practicalities of the Inquiry was extremely helpful.

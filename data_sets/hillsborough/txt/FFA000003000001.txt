Thank you for your further letter of 27 September regarding the
written evidence submitted for Part II of the Inquiry.  I am
sorry that you have not received an earlier reply.

Lord Justice Taylor has no objection to your being given a list
of contributors and I have attached a list to this letter.   It
should be noted however that this list is by no means
comprehensive since we are still receiving submissions. Nor does
it include the numerous submissions received from individual
members of the public. Nevertheless I hope it will be of use to
you.

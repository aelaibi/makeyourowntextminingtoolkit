and       told        him          what            I had          just       seen               take       place,             his        reply             was        "He          d i d n ’t

Whilst           I was             waiting                  outside          the          crowds              were          building                 up,        at      about             2

pm       you     c o u l d n ’t m o v e                     near     the       turnstiles                       due         to      the         amount             of      people

there,           there             were            no       queues,          just           a mass              of         people            all         gathered                  round.

I was           about          3     foot           away          from       turnstile                     *B'        in      the        crowd,               it      appeared

that       most        of          the       people               around           me       had         no      ticket              either               as     they          were

not       going        in,           only           the       ones        with           tickets                were          filtering                    through                 and

going           through              the           turnstiles.                      It      was         so^bad              that         for         every            one          that>

went       through                 the       turnstile                 with          a      ticket              I saw              one       without               Jump            the

turnstile              with             him         to       get     in.

It       '^as    then          that          the            police        on       horses,                 I believe                    there            was       three            of

them       began           to        force              their        way       through                  the^erowd                   in attempt/^to                        form            '

three           separate                queues               for     the       turnstiles                       as         there         were            people           jumping

from       one        turnstile                     to       another,                But          due        to       the          horses            coming             through

and       people trying                            to       get     out      of       the         way        the           crush         started                to      become

unbearable*                        I could                  not     move       my        arms           or      legs          and        found             I was          being

moved           around             with            the       crowd         involuntarily*                                  Eventually                    I managed                  to

get       to     turnstile                   8      where           I was          faced             by      the           policeman*                      I told            him          I

had       not        got       a      ticket                for     which           he      started                giving               me      a    lot        of      lip

saying           what          was          I doing               there        then*                 I told                him      I    had         no       choice*                1

ended           up    here            because                thats        where                 I had         been          pushed              by       the       crowd.                 I

told        the       bloke             on         the       turnstile                the         same          and         asked            if      1 could              pay        in,




                                                                                   3
crushed          up    against          the       wall    then         a    policeman             on    horseback             with        a    loud

haler       began          working       his       way    through            the       crowd,          he    was     saying         "Tickets

only"       but       again       the    crowd         were       trying          to    get       away       -from      his     horse         and

were    pushing,-               this    was       causing         people          to    fall       over       and       getting          trod       on

but    they       were          being    helped          back      up       by    others.              Again       1 was       being

crushed          up    against          the       wall    unable            to    move       my    arms       or     legs      and       again

having       to       go    with       the    crowd,          I    could          see       that       tempers          were       rising         as

the    people          with       tickets          were      being          told       they       could       not       get    in a n d         then

the    crowd          started          chanting          "Merseyside,                  Merseyside,             Mersey side'1 and

were    jumping             up    and    down       and      there          was    a    surge          for    the       turnstiles*                 I

saw    the       policeman             outside         the    turnstile                fall       down       and    some       lads       helped

him    back       up       on    his    feet*          I saw       people          punching             and    kicking             the    police

horses       which          caused       the       horses         to       bolt    ¥nci      run       through          the    crowd.             It^j

appeared          then          after    the       horses         had       gone       to    be    better          as    the       crowds

moved       back       and       I found          I had      room       to       move       my    arms       about.           It    was       then

that    a    rumour             was    spread       that      the          chap    in       the    turnstile             to    the       far        i

right       of    the       "S'       turnstile           was      paying          in>       in    othfer      Words          letting          us,7

pay    to    get       in,       then    1    saw      the    crowd          split          and    it    appeared             half       ran     to

the    flood          gates       and    half       including               myself          ran    to       this    turnstile.

Those       that       ran       to    the    flood       gates         were       banging             and    screaming             at    them

and    police          who       appeared          puzzled         by       what       was       happening          went       down       to     the \

flood       gates*              The    chaps      at     this      turnstile                then       realised          that       the

police       had       gone       and    said       "hurry         up,       hurry          up,    gis       your       money       and       ju m p ,

over*"           I saw          loads    give       him      money,          I saw          people       falling          over       in a n d            J
around       the       turnstile             in    the    rush         to    get       through,          they       were       handing

over    at       least          ten    pounds       to    get      in*           I just          put    my    hand       in    my    pocket
                                                                                                                                                                    S 1188




                  jcked,             you       were          unable          to       move          freely          and       had        to           push          your

way    around.                 I was       aware             of     about            two       hundred             people              who     like          me       paid

the    bloke          on       the    turnstile                   and       jumped             the       turnstile                to     get           in,

I    had    previous                knowledge                of     the      ground             and       wanted          to           get     into          terraces

via    the       tunnel.              It       was       about          2,45          pm       (1445       hrs)          and           I knew           the         match

would       be    starting                soon,          so       I began             to       push       my       way    through                 the        crowd

towards          the       tunnel*              I managed                   to       get       to    about          halfway              through                the

tunnel          and       could       go       no    further                due       to       the       amount          of       people              in     front           of

me*        I saw          that       there          were          two       or       three                icerfian        in        the        tunnel

against          the       side       walls          and          like       ourselves                   they       were          getting              crushed              as

well*           I commented                with          others             to       them       that       here          we       were         having

purchased             a    ticket          and       c o u l d n ’t          see          the       match,          but       they           were          unable           to

help       us    because             they       were          stuck          there             like       us*

I    could       not       go       back       either             as    other             fans       had       come       up        behind             me       and

were       now    trying             to    push          their          way          through             too       but    it       was         impossible*

Suddenly          I was             aware       of       a    surge          from          behind          and       the          crowd           in       front           had

to    move       because             of    the       pressure,                   a g a i n 11        was       t    r     a        p     p        e    d        b     y

                Thank you for your letter of 1$ November to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith.

                   Firstly, I can confirm that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will shortly be obtaining a copy o f PC
    *              Sherwood’s statement from South Yorkshire Police and will ascertain whether it contains any
                   information regarding Graham,

                   In your earlier letter, dated 20 October, you raised the issue of documents which you believe
                   are missing from the body file supplied by South Yorkshire Police. The Judge is currently
                   looking into a number of alleged inconsistencies between the information supplied to families
                   and that contained in the body files in the possession of South Yorkshire Police, and he will
                   be dealing with this matter in his report.

                   Yours sincerely
                                                                           M il,,

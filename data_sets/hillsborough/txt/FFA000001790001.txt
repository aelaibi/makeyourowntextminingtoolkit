Dear Mr Clark

Re:    F.A. CHALLENGE CUP COMPETITION
       SEASON 1988-89
       SEMI-FINAL TIES
       SATURDAY 15TH APRIL 1989______

Thank you for your letter dated 24th February regarding the
possibility of staging one of the Semi-Final Ties at Highbury
on 15th April.

Having just received a comprehensive report on the condition
of our pitch, it appears that major renovation work will need
to be carried out at the end of the season.  In view of this,
we feel that it would be unwise to delay work commencing which
might become necessary if we were to re-arrange fixtures.

In any event we are of the opinion that the present pitch
surface would possibly not do justice to either team partic­
ipating in the Semi-Finals.  Therefore may we ask you not
to consider us on this occasion, in the full knowledge that
next season we should have a pitch and of course Stadium,
fully worthy of this prestigious event.

With very best wishes.

Yours sincerely




Managing Director

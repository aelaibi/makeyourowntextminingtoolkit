Upon       alighting               from       th e    c o a c h whi ch w as              about       5 minute       walk       from    the

ground,          I di d         se e P o l i c e        Officers             standing        in      pairs,       pointing          which

direction             we     should           take,         but    none       of    them actually             escorted          us    to    the

ground.

On    route          to    the      ground           I n e ve r     witnessed any                 d i s t u r b a n c e ' or    commotion

involving             the       fan s .

I have          already            mentioned            that      my wife           and     m y s e l f are       Liverpool

supporters                and      due     to    t hi s      fact       we    d e c i d e d han            rather       stand with          the

Forest          supporters               we     would        try and          obtain        entry with            the    tickets       I had

bought          in the          Liverpool             End      (Leppiij^s Ln) ■                 So    we w a l k e d a r o u n d      the

ground,          and       upon         reaching            the L a p p i n g s      Ln,     approached            a Police

Officer,             and     explained               th e    4^uation              about     ou r     tickets.          He     directed

us    to    h av e        a word         with        one     of   the        turnstile          operators.

                 We     followed           his     advice,          we       joined a queue                of a b o u t         2 or 3       people       at

                 th e     turnstile             and     upon       reaching          the       turnstile             I explained             the

                 situation            to    the       operator,              who    in t u r n       seemed          to    look at       our

                 appearance,               then       studied           the    tickets          I gave          him       for a       couple       of

                 moments,          then         tore     th e      counter          foil       off    and       handed          the    remainder           of

                 the      tickets          back       to me.

                 We     entered         through          the       turnstile^at                 about        1.40         pm,    (1340)       noti cing

            due    to     th e     amount        of     people          getting         in,     it     became          a bit        uncomfortable.

            I thought            at     this     t im e      all    the       supporters             h ad     entered          the      ground and

            also     th e     time       I noticed my wife                     c r y ing,       I know           she     does       not    like

            being       in    c ro w d s      and      I tried          to    comfort         her,       but       I realised             that       the

            pressure          from       th e    c r o w d wa s         getting         worse,         although             it w a s      s t ill

            otherside            of     the     fence,        shouting          to      the     f an s      at     the      back     of    us      to     go

            push     back        and     noticed            my wife                        ijroing t h e           sam e .

            head movement                had     been        reduced          just      sideways.                Due     to    this       pressure             a

            sense       of    panic        entered           my mind          and    I began           to     scream          for    help,         as     did

            everyone          that       stood around               me,       the    only       thing         I wanted            to do w a s

            escape        from        this      position,           but       I couldn't.

            My wife          was      standing          next       to me       still,         I could            see     her      crying        and       hear

her     screaming,              she      appeared           to    be      in t e r r i b l e      pain.           Her       face was

turning           blue       and     then       s he    became         motionless             and      s i l en t ,      I did       honestly

on     noticing             this     condition           believe            that     rny w i f e       had       died.

I felt        helpless             and       guilty      because            she    had      only       come       to     the     match

because           of m y s e l f ,       and      it   had       been my          decision          to      enter        the    Liverpool

On     seeing          my wife          in her         condition            I became          more       hysterical,              and

shouted           to    the     police          and    stewards             to g e t     he r     out.

I remember              seeing          a Woman        Police          Officer         approaching                my                    from

the     other          side     of      th e    fence,       she a p p e a r e d         to      reach                            face

through           the       fence,       and      touch      her       on     seeing                              state        the    Woman

Police        O f f i c e r ’s f ac e           showed       both         fear     and      emotion

She     began          to    s c r e a m at       both      people          behind       us a n d        peoplo/'on the

segregation                 fence       to     get                     ou t i      Then       I no t i c e                           rising

out     of    the       crowd,          at     this     poi|<tx\I s t il l           b e l ieved /sr              to     be    dead and

all     I could             think       was     of     finding         he r    after.

Al l    the       time       I was       e:< pe r i e n t e i rfa p r e s s u r e        my Wreathing                  was     becoming

more     restricted                and       tremendous/ pain                 on m y     chest,          every         time      I breathed

th e    p a i n wa s         getting           greater.

Upon                         rising          in the air,            I was         able      to    get       my    right        arm    free

and     pushed                           upwards,           as    s o o n as                        disappeared                upwards,

her     space          was    taken          by a n o t h e r     person          forcing         my     right a r m ag a i n s t             the

mouth        through          the       fencing        to    help         ina b r e a / h e ,     I got          my    nose     through

against           my    teeth,          I could        feel       the       taste      of     the      p a in t       in m y m o u t h a n d

parts        of    the       p a in t    was     flaking          off       in m y     mouth.

         approaching                from       the       left     and    pulling           up    behind          the    goal.           Then        I saw

         which       cut       off       the       breeze        I had       been    feeling           against          my    face.             They

         began       pulling             at    the       fence,        which moved              away     fro m my           face       v er y

         I would          describe             the       girl      I helped         over        the    fence       as       follows:            about       20

         brown       jacket          and       blue       denim        jeans.

         the    grass          to    the       r i gh t     of    the    goal.         Once       he     had made            sure       I was        all

         right       he    walked             off.        Once      I could         ge t    my     breathe,            my m a i n       c o n c e r n was

         for    my wife                             , I walked           over       towards           the    North          Stand       I noticed

         bodies       lying          on       the    p i t c h al l      motionless,              some       with       their       faces

         first       aid       to    the       injured.             I c o u l d n ’t f i n d                           at    this       time       and

         still       expected             to       find     her     dead      lying        on    the     pitch.             I looked            in the

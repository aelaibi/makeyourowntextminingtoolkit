DATE OF BIRTH 8.4.1951
QUALIFIED AMBULANCE MAN


1.   I joined the service in January 1981 and have completed the
     Miller qualification at the Leicester training college.


2.   In addition to this I have attended the yearly course Post

     Proficiency at SYMAS H.Q and also at Leicester.



3.   This    is   an    up   date    course    on    the   new   techniques    and

     equipment for ambulance men.


4.   The Leicester training course had major incident training

     and    in    addition    to    this    I have    read   the    manual   "major

     incidents".         Also   on each       identification       card   for SYMAS
     staff there is information relevant to first crews on scene
     for major disasters.



5.   As    far as      I can recall        on the week     prior    to the major

     incident I was on afternoon shifts of 1400 to 2200.                       That

     week I was to have worked on Friday with Saturday and Sunday

     off. My Station Officer           asked me during the week if I would
     work my day off on Saturday 1000 to 1800 to cover the F.A.

     Cup semi-final.         I agreed to do so.



6.   On the morning of Saturday the 15th I arrived at 0945 at the
Middlewood Ambulance Station in Sheffield.                   Having booked in
I spoke to my crew member                                          We then both
checked the vehicle itself and the equipment which we have

in the emergency vehicles.            The vehicle was sierra 102 (the
fleet number is 422).



Having checked the vehicle we then went to the mess room and
waited for Control to contact us.               At this point the morning

crew 0600 to 1400 were out on calls.                   Also with us at the
station was qualified ambulance man                            and qualified
ambulance                      They were 1000 to 1800 shift.


Sometime later my colleague                            answered a call from
control for another job and asked Control if he wanted the
1000     to     1800    crew   ie          and     I    to    do    it.    Control
requested               and         to do it.


About 15 to 20 minutes later the morning crew came back in;

one of them was qualified ambulance man                                       Five
minutes or so later the phone rang again.                                 answered
the phone and control asked for the morning crew to go back
out, but               and I said that we would do it so that the
morning crew could have their breakfast.                     As far as I can

recall     it   was     an    admission   to     one    of    the     Sheffield

Hospitals.      Having completed this call I seem to recall we
had another job while we were out.                We returned to station
between 1300 and 1330.
We could      see   from our ambulance            station that there were

hundreds of Liverpool          supporters going to the match.                  The
majority of them were drinking with tins and bottles of beer

and then throwing them away when empty. We finished lunch at
about 1355 and the afternoon crew came on duty.                          They were

                         and


Around 1410 the Control rang with another job.

answered it and they requested the afternoon crew to go out
while we remain on station.



Just after 1500 we noticed on the T.V. that the Hillsborough
                irea to have
semi-final appeared     nave been
                             oeen stopped
                                  stoop   and that there was
                     At
some problem..      fihnrt-iy af+-o-r-                                    answered

              a u :Ttlt..
         from •6orrfcrd±’      I asked him what it was and he said

there was a bit or trouble down at Hillsborough and we had
to go to the Leppings Lane entrance.


Our station is approximately iafaC a mile from Hillsborough.

At the gymnasium entrance off Penistone Road/lwe were met by

a high ranking police officer.                  He asked me to reverse my

vehicle to the first aid room and the mobile police cell
        which I did.        When we arrived the scene was quite orderly

        and there was no indication at that time of the seriousness
        of the incident.


15.    We were met by St John's Ambulance staff.                There were three
       women, together with two or three young lads of about 12/13

       years of age.        They informed us that the casualties were in

       the   first   aid     room.    There      were   three   casualties       that

       appeared to be Liverpool supporters from their accent.                         The
       injuries were:-

        1 fractured ankle

       1 fractured arm

       I went to the ambulance for my first aid box and equipment

       and returned to the first aid, room to treat the injuries.

                                               sk there   e were at least two crush
       injuries laid out unconscious (beneath North Stand).



16.    We were unable to use the vehicles radio while we were in

       the North Stand area.          No calls could be made or received
       possibly because of the concrete overhead.


17.                  and I tended to the two crush injuries.              By that

       time the police and supporters were running into that area

       carrying dead and injured on boards and advertising boards.
      / A senior police officer asked me to move the vehicle to the

  I    front of the cell unit.         I did this and then more and more
  I casualties were brought into the area. I last saw

      7^               of                   QyQaJ%                      'I sLa o Co

      with the mobile resuscitation unit tending to someone who
      had stopped breathing.



18.   I then got my bag and mask and about a dozen airway tubes.

      I     went    from    casualty         to    casualty       checking       pulses    and

      breathing and inserting airways on unconscious patients^ edfea*


19    Shortly       afterwards        I     saw    the    first    of    other      ambulance
      personnel coming into this area.                       One of them was

                   of Parkway Station Sheffield.                   I took him to deal
      with an unconscious patient. Another crew then drove in.                               I

      told them to get their stretcher and follow me to the first

      aid area in order to deal with a possible internal injury
      case.


20.   I then       saw                             from   Longley Station Sheffield
      coming in the gymnasium entrance to the ground.AI presumed

      that because he was on his own he had come in off duty.                                I
      was helping                                 to get the stretcher out of his
      vehicle.           As we did so Superintendent Trevor Dale took us

      to    a   young      lad   of    about       11 years       of    age    near   to   the
      gymnasium      who     was      not    breathing      and    had    no    pulse.     We
      immediately started C.P.R.                   (artificial resniratinn).               we

      put    him on to the            stretcher and         into ^ the vehicle

                   and I were in the back and were working on the boy
      to revive him and we called a nearby police officer to drive

      us    to Northern General casualty.                    We    also       had   a police




                                                  201
officer in the back with us who had                   been with the boy as far
as I can recall.                                             La_JMr    <v^—oL     aJt
<aJco(aX I S S O .


On arrival at Northern General we                         were met by one of the
casualty doctors who took us straight round                           to one of the

resuscitation units.           We put the lad on the trolley for the

Doctors to deal with.              We went straight back to the vehicle

and returned to Penistone entranc^^                        We went via Herries
Road     turned      right   and    parked      up   on    the    ground   side     of
Penistone Road.          There seemed to be more supporters leaving
the ground than when we left for the hospital.



Ambulances appeared to be queuing up to take casualties and
I therefore left                                as driver and I returned to
the first aid area. The Vehicle that                                     and I had
arrived in had gone and was presumably in use at this time.

 An ambulance arrived to collect walking wounded from the
area.      Vehicles were coming in, backing up to the first aid
area and being loaded up and departing.



Trevor Dale, Alan Hopkins, David J o n e s - - I halpod transfer

the injured with drips who were housed in the far side of
the gymnasium to vehicles loading in the first aid area.



I spoke       to Alan Hopkins,             in the mortuary            section,    who

informed me that body bags were required.                        I went along the

line of vehicles waiting on Penistone Road.                           I went into




                                      Z   01+
about     a dozen collecting body bags.                 I returned       to     the
mortuary with them, but there was still not enough.                          I went

back     out    to the vehicles      collecting       blankets.        I got      a

couple of ambulance men to help me carry the blankets back

into the mortuary side of the gymnasium.                     On returning to
the gymnasium an ambulance man from Rotherham known as
helped me to wrap up bodies in blankets.



Shortly afterwards I spoke to Alan Hopkins                    who told me to
stay with him.          He was busy talking to high ranking police

officers and I had his portable hand-set radio to listen out
for any urgent messages.           The hand set seemed to be working
normally in the gymnasium and outside.                  I was with Hopkins
for     about   half    an hour    as     far   as   I can    recall     in    the

gymnasium.             By   that   time    the casualties          had all    been
cleared.        I      went   to   Penistone Road and        saw

returning.          I would estimate this was about 1745                I still
had the hand-set, but there was no activity.



Shortly after 1800 David Jones informed us that he wanted to

speak to all crews in the car park.                  He wanted to sort out

who was on duty, who was due to go on duty and who had come

in off duty.           The afternoon crews were returned to base for

normal duties.         These are 1000 to        1800 sfifts    and included

                and I.      The off duty officers were requested to
stay.
27    .                   and I returned to our vehicle and went back to
          Middlewood station.      As far as I can recall we contacted

          Control at about 1815 to say we were leaving Hillsborough to
          return to station arriving back at approximately 1825.


28.       Upon our return to station we re-kitted the vehicle as all
          the equipment had been used.                        contacted Control

          and said that we were re-kitting the vehicle and if required

          we could stand by on station.          Control then rang through

          with an emergency transfer from Northern General ward 3A to

          Hallamshire CAT SCAN.              and I went to Northern General
          ward 3A where the doctor was waiting for us.           The Doctor and

          his    assistant     accompanied    the   patient     to    the   Royal
          Hallamshire.


29.       On our return to the vehicle we contacted Control who sent

          us back to the Northern General ward 60 to collect another
          transfer for the Hallamshire for a CAT SCAN.               We collected

          him and again went to the Hallamshire.         Having transferred

          this   second    patient we contacted     Control    again and     they
          returned us to station.


30.       On our   return to the Station we contacted            Control.     We

          cleaned and re-fuelled the vehicle ready for the next shift.
          There was nothing further to do so                      and I signed
          off at about 2145.

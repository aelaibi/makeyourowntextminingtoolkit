Middlewood             Rd.        1 would          estimate           that         there        were          possibly 200                 fans.

There       was     no      problems             with     t hi s     c r owd       apart        from          them       being        merry.           I

met    up w i t h        the      two      other        Special           Constables                I started             off     with and

made    my way           to the          Leppings          Lane       a rea,         on    the        way       back.           I saw a

large       number          of    beer        cans      in C a t c h b a r         Ln.         They        were       obviously

everywhere             in the          road way           and       the    front          of    shops,           it w a s       not        just

cans.        There          were       glasses          and     bottles            included,               one      of    the     shop       owners

was    literally              shovelling               them away           from       his       frontlepiece.                     There       was

so many.            We      came       down       j ust    before          the       bridge           at      Leppings          Ln a n d

stood       at    that        p oint       for     s ome       fifteen minutes                      watching             the    crowd.

There       were       also       regular          Police           Officers          near          to     that       point.

Whilst       walking             down      there        was     a    large         number           of     fans       c omi n g       to    the

ground,          all     anxious           to     get     in a n d w o r r i e d           to       the       extent        t hat       they were

verbally agressive                       about         j ust    getting            into        th e      ground          on timf,            After
                                                                                                                                  /
leaving          the     last         p o i nt    we    made        our    way       to    the        perimeter             gjfte in

Leppings          Ln,       at    this        p oint      there       was       just       a sea           of    p e o p l e , all          anxious

to    get    into        the      gro u n d .          They were           bombarding                 us wiJch q u e s t i o n s             about

how    to    get       into       the      ground and where                     to    go       once        tmey       got      in ther e.

Controlling              the      perimeter             g ate       from what             I cou«d             see     were      three

mounted          o f f i c e rs a n d         I think          seven       regular              f ic e r s .          There       could       h ave

been    many more                but     because          of    the       h ug e     amylrnt          of      people        stretched

across       the       r oad      it was          impossible              to    s e V who           was       with       y o u a n d who

wasn't.           We w e r e          trying       to     get       through          in o r d e r          to    get      to    the        Police

r o om    but     it was       an     impossibility,                     it w a s       absolutely                swamped           with       fans

who      were     all    pushing           and       shoving          determined               to      get       into     the       ground          as

they      were        afraid       they were             going        to m i s s        the       kick       off.

Arou nd about            1455        hrs       we    were       verbally            directed             by one          of    our       Section

Officers          SWINDELLS           to       go    into       the      ground         via       the       Penistone              Rd    end and

into      the     Spion Hop           to a s s i s t        behind            the     goal        mouth.           W h e n we           got    in

the      match        itself       had     been       kicked          off a n d         actually             stopped.               The

players          had    left       the     pitch,          but w h e n         I initally                got      into        the       ground       I

w a s n ’t a w a r e     that        they       had a c t u a l l y           finished            or     even      started              the    game.

I was       totally          unaware           of    ev e n t s .        I saw a           lot      of P o l i c e        Officers             at

the      b ack    of    the N o r t h          stand and also                  at     the      entrance            of     the Kop,             we

were      then        instructed           to       form a       cordon across                    the       pitch        between             the

Notts       Forest       and Liverpool                   supporters             as      there          had       been what              we

thought          at    that    t im e      a    pitch       invasion.                 We     joined          the       cordon and after

some      minutes        I saw        people          being         brought           o nto       the       p i tch a n d          coats       being

put      over     them.        Liverpool              f an s     were         tearing          the       boards          of    the

perimeter             fence    and       putting           people         on    them.             The L i v e rp o ol              f ans      came

running          towards       us a n d w e r e            shouting            to     the F o r e s t            fans     to       say       that

peo p l e      were     dying        and       they      needed          help.         Some         of      us    t hen       realised

that      something           wa s    wrong         and     it      w a s n ’t a           p i t c h inv a s i o n .           We       t he n went

from      the     cordon and also                    pulled           off      the     boards realising                       that

stretchers             were    ne eded.             As     we    past         them      down        fans         w ere    picking             them

up a n d       running        to a s s i s t        o th e r s .         We    began         to m a k e          our     way       down       the

pitch       towards          the     terrace          end.          By    this        t i me      people          were        s c a t t e r e d all

over      the     place.           Liverpool             fans       were       running            all       over       the     p i tch

obviously             distressed and again                      we       thought           that        as    they were              running          to

the      Kop     that    they were              going       to        start         f i g h t i n g but          obviously              this

never       transpired.               I did          not    actually             get        into the             melee        by    the

terrace          at    any    time,        or a s s i s t       with          any     dead        bodies          or     injured.              There

were      that        many Police              Officers          up      the    top        en d     together             with Ambulance

men    a n d St      Johns        Amublance              assisting            that        we    broke       off     to    go    b ack    to

the    Kop     end,       for     fear      of a n y        fights         breaking             out    between           the    two     rival

fans    through           sheer       distress.                The       general          rnood was         quite        practitous.

Somewhere         around          the    time         1 545       hrs Mr                              took a f e w         of    us     to

the    Lepping         Ln      end as       there were               s om e     Liverpool             f ans    leaving          the

ground.         Whilst          at    this      point          I personally                and       other     officers

suffered        verbal          abuse       from         s o me     of    the    f ans         calling        us    "murdering

bastards"         and       the      like,      a     lot      of    them       continued             in this        vein and           the

scene    became           ugly.         I saw        no     physical            violence.              Other        fans       that

were    able      to      contain        themselves                 and assi st ed              to    get     those       who    were

distressed           away       from     the        g ro u n d .         I think          I was       at    this     p oint      until

about     1635       hrs       w h e n we     stood         down         from    h ere         and went        back       to    the     North

stand and about                 1 700    hrs        we w e n t       into       the N o r t h         stand        for    the    de­

briefing.            At     17.45       hrs     I left            the     ground          and went          back     to A t t e r c l i f f e

to    sign     off     duty.

1 believe         the w h o l e         incident            wa s     down       to    quite          simply        human       nature        if

you    like     all       the     fans      had      had a good               dri nk,          arrived        at    the    ground        too

late    for     the       k ick      off a n d        it w a s       a    case       of    too m a n y        peop l e     converging

on one       p lace       at    one     t ime       so    it      got     out    of       hand without              them       even

t hi nk i ng    of     the      consequences.

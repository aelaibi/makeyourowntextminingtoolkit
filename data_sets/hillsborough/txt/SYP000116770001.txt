                    At 8.0 0 a m on S a t u r d a y , "t~> April                    1989,       I had c o mmenced         duties at

                    Hillsborough Football                     Gr o u n d    for     the    semi    final       match    between

                    Liv e r p o o l     and N o t t i n g h a m Forest.              I was       part    of Serial        13 under         the

                     command of           Inspector        8ULLAS,           By     11,15 am 1 had taken up my

                     designated           p o s ition    in the West S t a n d w h i c h was at the                       bottom of the

                     steps       on the stand,           on the w a l k w a y           in front        of    row number       one,     and at

                    a position above                and s l i g h t l y      to the        left    of the Le piping a Lane

                    Ha v i n g w o r k e d at this            l o c ation on numerous               occasions          in the       past my

                     initial          thoughts      were      that    the t e r r a c i n g       had begun to fill             up

                    e x t r e m e l y quickly.           I had been           infor m e d       that     the gates w o u l d be

                    opened at           IS noon and           the    first        trickle       of s u pporters         came    into the

                    stand and onto               the    t e rracing         shor t l y after        12 noon.           Most, of the

                    s upp o r t e r s    coming        onto    the ter r a c i n g         st a y e d on the         central    portion

                    leaving ample               room on the          flanks.            W i t h up to an hour           before       the

                    start        of    the m a t c h the middle              sect i o n     of the t e rracing was

                    c o n s i d e r a b l y full,       however,           1 would        not   consider a n y t h i n g wrong with

                    this        or be    in any way unusual.                      The     crowd was          quite    noisy but

                    generally           in a good mood.               Wit h       f i f t e e n minu t e s     before    the    start      of

                    the game           the     central     area had          become        quite    compact          but yet again

    had    been       standing             with       Inspector            BULLAS            for        quite          some          time.

    I had       been       approached              by      members         of    the         Liverpool                 crowd          who       had       told

    me    on    two    separate             occasions              that        there         was        a       build       up       of    people             at

    the    Leppings          Lane          entrance           and     that       the         turnstile                 operators                w e re

    taking       ten       pounds          in    the       hand     for        people          who          had. a r r i v e d            without

    tickets.           On    one       occasion              I had        seen       a    supporter                   who       was       in    the       stand

    who    1 had       earlier             seen       in     the    terracing                and        had       gained             entrance             to

    the    stand       by     climbing             up      the     barrier           wall.              He       was       taken          out       of    t he

    stand       and    placed          back        in      the     terracing              where             he    took          up    position                at

    the    front.           He     was      not       drunk        but     had       obviously                   .been d r i n k i n g .

    At    approximately                2,55        pm      from     my     position               looking              onto          the       terracing

    I    sensed       and     could          see      an     increased           agitation                      in    the       crowd.              The

    supporters             were*      being        increasingly                 crushed                and       were       compact             right             to

    the    front.           At     this         point        Inspector           BULLAS                left       to       go    to       the       back          of

    the    terraces          and       see       what        the    problem              was.           At       this       point          the       gates

    on    the    track       were          not     open       but     people             were       attempting                   to       climb          the

    perimeter          fence;         and       also       trying         to    climb          the          wall       in       front          of    me       to

    the    West       Stand.           My       initial          reaction            was       to       prevent             this          but       as    I

    looked       down       towards             the     entrance           tunnel.           I could              see       a    large          number                of

    fans       pouring       in       from       the       back.         By     this         time           I    could          see       the       body          of

    a    person       being        passed         overhead            towards             the       front             of    the       crowd          and.         I

    was    b e ing     xnu n da t e d wit h                c r i e 13 f r o tn d i s t r e s s e ci p e 0 p 1 e                 in    the

    terracing          and       in    the       stand           appealing            for         me    to h e l p         them.,          At       this

    point       I radioed             to    control           saying           that      a     large             number          of       people          were

    down       and    injured.              I heard           over       the     air         that           the      match           had       been

    delayed          and    very       shortly          after         that       the         players              emerged.                 Lots          of

    assisted          in    this.           I    took        h o l d of    one       man          that          was    particularly

    seriously          injured             around          the     pelvic        region,               together                 with       another

supporter            we    took             him    out       of       the    stand        to    the       reception             area       at    the

back     of     the       Leppings                Lane       entrances.                  After       leaving          the       injured          man          i

immediately               returned                to    the       stand        and       found       it    impossible             to       make       my

way     to     the    front.                 As    1 tried             to    force        past       I was       receiving             lots          of

threats         to    my       person             and       being       called           a murderer.                 Because          of    this          I

thought         it    prudent                to    stay          at    the     back       of    the       stand       in    the       bar       area.

In    the      bar    area         at        the       back       of    the     stand          1 saw       two       injured          people

being        tended        by       Police             Officers.               After       consultation                with       these          I

went     to     the       reception                area          in a n      attempt           to    seek       medical          help.           This

was     not     forthcoming,                      so    I returned              to       the    bar       area       and    with

PC    1423      Newbould                carried             an    injured           woman       to       the    reception             area.

Whilst         in    the       bar          area       we    received           several             calls       of    ’m u r d e r e r s * .

The     first        trip          to       the    reception                area     1 saw          three       bodies          laid       out       with

blankets            over       them          and       two       other       people        who       were       obviously             badly

a    third      injured             person             to    the       rear.

At    this      point          a    call          went       out       that     a    man       was       going       berserk          in    the

West     Stand        I. w e n t            back       up    the       steps        to    be    met       in    the    bar       area       by       four

men.         They     confronted                   me       shouting           in    a    hysterical             manner          at    me

calling         me    a    murderer                and       saying          that        I was       to    blame       for       the

incident.             Their             manner          was       such       that        I was       beginning             to    fear       for       my

safety,         but       it       had       so    maddened             me     that       1 shouted             back       at    the       men

telling         them       to       make          themselves                useful        and       to    stop       hanging          around.

This     seemed           to       work       and       they          left     to    go    down          the    stairs,

we    went      to    a    young             man       by    the       stairway           who       was    in a       very       distressed,

irate,         emotional                mood,          by    the       look     on       his    face       he    was       no    longer          in

control         of    himself                and       from       what       people        around          him       later       said       he       had

eventually               convinced          he    should         leave     the    ground       and     was    escorted       out

by    his     friends.

At    this         point        1   could     see      the    mayhem       on    the    pitch,        people       around   me

were      showing             mined     emotions,            some    crying       openly       and     others       shouting

and     abusing           the       Police       or    stewards       or    anyone       in a u t h o r i t y .      I stayed

in a n d      around           the     back      of    the    West   Stand        until     it    cleared          and

returned            to    the       de-briefing            point     in    the    North     Stand,           Although       1 wa

aware       that         in    the     region         of   ten    people        had    died,     I heard       of    counties

numbers            of    bodies        being      taken       across       the    pitch     and       did    not    learn    of

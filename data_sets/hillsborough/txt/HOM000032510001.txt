  G H Mackrell Esq
  Secretary
  Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
  Penistone Road North
  Hillsborough
  Sheffield
  S61 SW                                                             9 February 1998




 As you may be aware, the Home Secretary is currently considering the report
 submitted to him by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith following his scrutiny of the evidence
 about the disaster at the Hillsborough Stadium in 1989. The Home Secretary hopes
 to publish the report and his response to it soon. We will let you know when a date
 has been set for publication. However, I need before then to clarify the status of
 some of the written material considered by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith.

 When the Home Secretary announced the establishment of Lord Justice Stuart-
 Smithy’s scrutiny, he said that he would publish the report and would publish the
 evidence considered by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, unless there was some particular
 reason why material should not be made public. Publication of the material
 considered by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith would be by way of placing a copy in the
 Library of the House of Commons, so it would not be “publication" in the
 conventional sense, but the material would in practice be publicly available through
 MPs.

There is one document which was considered by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, which I
understand is the property of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, and which has not
previously been made public. This is a report containing advice in respect of the
Hillsborough Stadium and the disaster on 15 April 1989, prepared for the club by
Sir William Halcrow and Partners in August 1990. I would be grateful for your
confirmation that you would be content for a copy of this document to be placed in
the Library of the House of Commons; or if the club would not wish a copy to be
made available in that way, your reasons for that view, so that I can if necessary
advise the Home Secretary.

Because the Home Secretary hopes to publish the report soon, I am afraid that time
is short, and a reply by the end of this week would be appreciated.

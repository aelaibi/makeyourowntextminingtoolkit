O L. S E L L E R S & CO. / w. L L O Y O W O O O L A N O




            MR. HYTNER:  In this application, I appear for the Plaintiff
                with my learned friend Mr. King.  The First Defendants -
A              the Football Club - are represented by Mr. Glasgow and Mr.
                Catchpole; the Second Defendants by Mr. Woodward and Mr.
                Payne.

           MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                              The Chief Constable is the First Defendant.

           MR. HYTNER:                    Yes.

®         MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                               Would you like to start again?

           MR. HYTNER:   I think I must.  The First Defendant - the police
                - is represented by Mr. Woodward and Mr. Payne; the Second
                Defendants - the Club - by Mr. Glasgow and Mr. Catchpole;
                the Third Defendants - the City Council - by Mr. Maxwell
               and Mr. Murray; and the Fourth Defendants — Dr. Eastwood -
q              by Mr. Fenwick, though as will appear, he is in the
               background led by Mr. Tilson.

                         I take it that your Lordship knows the background, and
                    although this is a hearing in open court, it is not
                    necessary for me to go through the whole of the background
                    facts.

D         MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                               Certainly not.

           MR. HYTNER:                    Can I start with all the matters that I propose to
               raise?

           MR. JUSTICE ROSE:  Are you going to from the order made                                                         by Mr.
               Justice Steyn, or from some other document?

E         MR. HYTNER:  In the order of the directions made. Can I deal
              with what I see at the moment as those matters that are in
              contention?

           MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                              Yes.

           MR. HYTNER:  The first matter which exercises the Plaintiff
               very considerably is the date of trial. Can I make this
               absolutely plain because it may be that Mr. Maxwell has not
               fully taken this on board:  there are four defendants.   The
               history of the litigation is simple.  The Plaintiff
               initially sued the city council, and the police and, the
               statement of claim was actually served. We then came
               before Mr. Justice Steyn - the club and the police - and it
               was then indicated to us that Dr. Eastwood and the council
P              were going to put the blame on one or other of the


                                                                     1   .



                                                                                                                                                     7

                    defendants, and that there were third party proceedings
A                   going to be instituted.

                         My Lord, the view we took was that it would simplify
                    the pleadings and would speed the litigation if we then, as
                    it were, took back our statement of claim and re-served it
                   not in amended form, but in original form, adding the two
                    further parties as primary defendants, and so that the
g                  pleadings could go from there.

                         Everybody thought that that was a good idea, including
                   Mr. Justice Steyn.   But it must be appreciated that when
                   you see those pleadings, which on the face of them make it
                   appear as though the primary case of the Plaintiff is
                   against four defendants cumulatively.   On the alternative,
                    that the thrust of the Plaintiff’s case is against the
r'                 first two defendants, and what we wish is if the other two
                   defendants are going to blame the second two, we adapt the
                   allegations accordingly: that is our position as against
                    the council and Dr. Eastwood.

                         In those circumstances, my Lord, the view that we took
                   was this: that without being over-confident or arrogant
                   about our case, looking at the pleadings, thus looking at
D                  the defence and what the defence say, it is if not
                   inconceivable, almost inconceivable, that the Plaintiff
                   will lose altogether; that is that they will not succeed
                   against one or more defendant. We therefore have the
                   adopted approach from the outset that if there was one
                   defendant, and there were'no defence, we could go by way of
                   Rule 111. There is no procedure if there is no defence.
                   We could then go for our damages to be seized my Lord.
E
                         It is a chink in the procedures of the court through
                    no fault of the court, but through the fault of Parliament
                    that where you have a Plaintiff who has a case against one
                    of two or more defendants, there is no means of that
                    Plaintiff getting his damages by way of order 14, or by way
                    of summary judgment; and therefore, the view taken by the
                    Plaintiff was this: that<it would be a scandal if in those
*                   circumstances the procedures of the court are not enabling
                    the Plaintiff to get this case on fairly quickly.

                         My Lord, I have to say that when this view was
                    initially put, there were only two potential defendants,
                    and Mr. Glasgow on behalf of the Club made it perfectly
                    plain, as I think it is only fair to say, that the Club had
q                  been indicating throughout the enquiry that they wished to
                    co-operate to get a very speedy hearing, because the view
                    taken by the Club, is that taken by the Plaintiff, that all
                    the facts have now been ventilated -—

            MR. JUSTICE ROSE:  The situation is that before Mr. Justice
                Steyn Plaintiff - and the Second Defendants then joined -
                contemplated trial either immediately after Easter or very
H              soon after Easter.

               MR. HYTNER:  That is right.  I start from there.  Two things
                   have now happened.  The first is that      Well three
                   things.  The first is the date has been moved to June.

               MR.        JUSTICE ROSE:                      By whom?

               MR.       HYTNER: I do not know, but                       it is now said that it is not
                         Easter; it is June
    B
               MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                             By whom?

               MR. HYTNER:                    I think the Court.

               MR. JUSTICE ROSE:  The Court has not said anything.                             We are
                   here to consider today.

    q          MR. HYTNER:                   I am grateful.
(              MR.        JUSTICE ROSE:                      The Court certainly never said that.

               MR.       HYTNER: I am very grateful and pleased to hear that,
                        because so far as we are concerned, we would still press
                        for Easter.

    D                        The two things, as I understand it, are now going to
                        be said: one by the First Defendants, and one by the Fourth
                        Defendants.

                              The Fourth Defendant wishes the case to be put over to
                        next October.   I leave Mr. Fenwick to deal with that, and I
                        leave Mr. Glasgow to put his case on that.   I anticipate
                        that he will support me in my application for a very speedy
    E                   trial.

                             My Lord, the next matter is rather more serious
                        because it has been raised this morning for the first time i
                        by Mr. Woodward.  I make no complaint about him.   It is the
                        first time, no doubt, that he has been able to raise it.
                        He does not want the case to be put off until October. The
    _                   South Yorkshire Police do not want the case on at all.
                        They wish to apply for a stay of the proceedings.

                             My Lord, I make no bones about this. One has to be
                        very careful of using the term "the police" because that is
                        a term which includes the police, for example, who did the
                        investigative enquiry on Hillsborough.   The policemen and
                        policewomen ---

               MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                             Go on, Mr. Hytner.

               MR. HYTNER:   The South Yorkshire Police through their
                    representative, my Lord, if one reads the report of Lord
                    Justice Taylor, it is perfectly plain that they have done
                    nothing to speed enquiries; to assist enquiries; or

 II -
 I                                  civil litigation - are going to be hindered in some way by
                                    the pending disciplinary proceedings, and the pending
 I                                  criminal proceedings, if they are brought against one two
                                    or more police officers in Sheffield.

                                         My Lord, the submissions that I make (and I anticipate
 I                                  they are going to be supported by Mr. Glasgow) are these:
                                   firstly this is simply an extension of the obstructive
             B                     attitude shown by the same party throughout the enquiry.
I                                  Secondly, all the relevant evidence has already been
                                   collected; and indeed not only collected by the West
                                   Midlands Police who investigated, but by'Lord Justice
I                                  Taylor in public.   It is, in our submission, inconceivable
                                   that it could now be said, unless South Yorkshire Police
                                   will say they failed to produce relevant evidence to Lord
                                   Justice Taylor, that there is no relevant evidence which
I    v   C                         cannot now be obtained because some police officers are
                                   being investigated.

1                                        My Lord, the submission that I make, and think with
                                    support, is this: that any investigation at the moment
                                    being made will be to interpret the facts already
                                    investigated publicly and considered by Lord Justice
I        D
                                    Taylor.

                        MR. JUSTICE ROSE:  In any event, questions from those can be
I                           put before whoever tries this case.

                        MR. HYTNER:   My Lord, what we would consent to concede is this:
jl                          that if anything is going to be said, or might be said, in
®                           interlocutory proceedings which could affect the mind of a
         _                  jury in the future hearing some criminal proceedings of
         ^                  which we do not yet know, so far as we are concerned, and I
                             suspect so far as Mr. Glasgow is concerned, we should
                             consent to interlocutory proceedings being in chambers
                             rather than open court. We say it would be indefensible if
                             the police can say now that the proceedings should be
                             stayed with this caveat: if it is accepted realistically by
                             those who are conducting the litigation on behalf of the
         p                  four parties that at the end of the day it is a question of
                             who pays the Plaintiffs, and not whether the Plaintiffs are
                             going to be paid at all, it would save a great deal of time
                             and money in costs, and would be far better for the
                             Plaintiffs, if the four defendants were jointly to say "We
                             consent to summary judgment.  The Plaintiffs can go away
                             and we can then at our leisure determine which of us is
                             liable, and in what proportions".  But my Lord unless that
         G                  is done, I propose a speedy trial.

                                        My Lord, going on, because I think it is only right I
                                   should indicate that in our submission it is possible for a
                                   speedy trial in this case.  Mr. Justice Steyn made a
                                   suggestion.  It was not a direction, and he was very
                                   careful not to elevate it, but we now ask for a direction.
                                   The direction that we seek follows his suggestion that the
         H                        facts found by Lord Justice Taylor should be prima facie


                                                                                                  6

        A                 evidence of these findings.  Any party who disputes the
                          findings has liberty to do so.  This is not civil
                          lititation, as it were, tried by Lord Justice Taylor in the
                          enquiry; but any party who disputes the findings of Lord
                          Justice Taylor must list these findings, and therefore each
                          party knows what is they are to be faced with.

                               My Lord, in those circumstances, it is anticipated
        B                 that in the test case; in the two test cases relating to
                          deaths in pens three and four, the Plaintiff would actually
                          have to call very little if any evidence.

                 MR. JUSTICE ROSE:  If I may interrupt there.  There was a
                     suggestion there would be a third test case.

                MR. HYTNER:  I am sorry, there is going to be such a test case.
    C               There are difficulties in selecting the right one.  My
                    Lord, it may be that the test cases in relation to those
                    injured outside the ground will not play much part, as
                    further investigation seems to suggest that there were few
                    people injured outside the ground or any thereafter injured
                    within the ground very seriously.

                MR. JUSTICE ROSE:  If there is to be a third test, and if it
    D               has not been selected, and if it follows that the pleadings
                    are not before me, it is difficult for me to give
                    directions as to when that should be tried.

                MR. HYTNER:  It was always hoped that would be tried
                    immediately following the test cases in relation to the
                    deaths inside the ground.

    E          MR. JUSTICE                  ROSE:          No doubt.

                MR. HYTNER:  I concede until we have selected the case and got
                    the pleadings before you, very little can be done, but what ,
                    I would say is that if there are test cases, a test case in
                    relation to injuries outside the ground, some evidence
                    would still have to be called by the Plaintiff.
    F
                 MR. JUSTICE ROSE: I am not minded, frankly, unless you see to
                      persuade me to the contrary, to contemplate doing anything
                      in relation to the three test cases today.

                 MR. HYTNER:  I agree.  I am not asking for any directions in
                     respect of a case that has not been brought.

    G          MR. JUSTICE                  ROSE:          Very wise.

                 MR. HYTNER:  It would not get very far; but in relation to the
                     two cases before you, we anticipate that it would not be
                     necessary if Mr. Justice Steyn’s suggestion is now
                     converted into a direction that there would be much, if any
                     evidence called by the Plaintiff.

A           MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                             Have I got the power to give such a
                direction?

            MR. HYTNER:  I am not sure without the consent of the parties
                that you can; and that is one of the problems now, my Lord.

            MR. JUSTICE ROSE: What you mean is that without the consent of
                the parties, I have not got the power?
B
            MR. HYTNER:   I think that is right unless somebody else can
                point to some procedure that I know not of.    I anticipate
                that Mr. Glasgow and the Football Club will support that
                direction.   In other words, they would consent.   We clearly
                consent.   The suggestion has been made by Mr. Fenwick that
                yes all right he does not really object to that, but he
                thinks it better for the Plaintiff to set out these
C               findings that he wants to be supported or wants to adopt,
                and then it is for the defendants to say whether they agree
                with those findings or not. That seemed to put it the long
                way round.   If that were the only wa y of getting this
                agreed, my Lord, we would naturally agree as a second best;
                but Mr. Justice Steyn’s suggestion seems to us to be
                sensible.

D                         There are those findings by Lord Justice Taylor.   Have
                     we really got to produce evidence?   To take one simple
                     example, m y Lord, it was found by Lord Justice Taylor that
                     a police officer, several police officers, made an error -
                     and a material error - in ordering the gates to be opened
                     to let in the influx of spectators without first closing
                     off the passageway into pens three and four. Have I really
                     got to produce evidence that that police officer admitted
E                    doing that when he was giving his evidence?   It is a
                     pointless exercise, and it would be a great shame if the
                     other three defendants did not support Mr. Glasgow in his
                     agreement with us that this should be done.   That is the
                     first thing.

                          The second thing we ask, which I anticipate will not
p                    be objected to by any of the parties, is that the
                     transcript of the evidence at the Hillsborough Enquiry
                     should be evidence of what was said at the Enquiry.  That
                     is a perfectly usual order made, and was made in relation
                     to the inquest notes ---

            MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                             Yes.   It is accepted as accurate?

G           MR. HYTNER:                    A true record not of the truth of what was said.

            MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                             Yes.

            MR. HYTNER:   Lastly, there are the pleadings. Nov, the reason
                 that perhaps in greater detail than should have been
                necessary, I made it plain at the outset that the primary
                case of the Plaintiff is against the first two defendants
H               is this: that in his statement of claim Mr. King, in a
                                                                                                CO




                                                                      6 .

                    manner which I would submit is perfectly usual and
A                   professional in this case, has simply repeated and adopted
                    against in a proposed amendment, my Lord, which we have
                    here.                              «



                        Can I turn to the Chapman case. What hr. King has
                   done is firstly he has adopted certain allegations made
                   against the First Defendant in the defence of the Second
„                 Defendant which Mr. King has not changed. I have to admit
                   my own had in case was to be included in the original
                   statement of claim. As far as I know, Mr. Woodward does
                   not complain about the manner of that pleading.  My Lord,
                   what has been said is that the Second Defendant says that
                   yes he may have been an occupier but, in the circumstances,
                   the First Defendant was also an occupier.  We had not
                   thought of that.
C
          MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                             Anyway, you are seeking leave to amend?

          MR. HYTNER:   Yes, but if your Lordship goes on, you see that in
               paragraph J, which is the particulars of the negligence of
               the Fourth Defendants that is ---

          MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                             Which page is that?
D
          MR. HYTNER:                   I am sorry.            Page 21.

          MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                             Page 21, paragraph J?

          MR. HYTNER:   No.  If you look at paragraph A, you see Mr. King
               has pleaded our own allegations against Dr. Eastwood, but
               we then see what is actually being said against him by
E             those who actually blame him, but now, turning to page 23,
               you see Mr. King has repeated and adopts — -

          MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                             Yes.

          MR. HYTNER:  Now, it appears that Mr. King slightly jumped the
              gun, because the second Third Party Notice apparently had
              that difference, and it may be that this difference has not
              actually been served, but this is a draft that we have
              seen, and I understand that Mr. Fenwick objects to that way
              of pleading the case against him. My Lord, I am not going
              to make   a great deal of fuss about this. If it appears
              that is an unfair way of pleading the case against him, and
              Mr. King has to sit down and write out all the allegations
              seriatim in the statement of claim, Mr. King will do so.
G
           MR. JUSTICE ROSE: Mr. King is entitled to know which version
               you are relying on and draft that.

           MR. HYTNER: That is not     a problem.  Mr. King that had been
               served.     It has been served now.  I leave Mr. Glasgow to
               deal with the interesting problems relating to the inter
               parties pleadings. They are not part of my concern.

            MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                             It may or may not have been served?

            MR. HYTNER:   I may have been served without leave.  I think
                that is the situation.   I simply say this: if at the end
                your Lordship is persuaded that this is an unfair way of
                pleading against Mr. Fenwick, we will, as I say, plead
                seriatim, but for the time being, all I need is to ask for
                leave to amend this statement of claim in the way in which
g               they have already been amended.   That is really all I have
                to say on the directions for the trial.

            MR. JUSTICE ROSE:  Before you go on, what is 'your estimate of
                length of this trial? It depends on what happens in Lord
                Justice Taylor’s report.

            MR. HYTNER:  Yes.  If the findings in the report can be relied
q               on, the Plaintiffs’ case should not last more than a day,
                day and a half, but the Defendants’ case again depends upon
                how much oral evidence they propose to test over and above
                the findings they actually had in the report.

            MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                             I am not concerned just with the Plaintiffs’
                case.

D            MR. HYTNER:  I have to say bluntly, I hope I am not being over
                 pessimistic about the First Defendant, but frankly, bearing
                 in mind the way in they conducted the enquiry, bearing in
                 mind the way in which they conducted themselves since this
                 litigation started, my Lord, I have to say this: it depends
                 on how far they are going to contest each and every finding
                 in the repeort.

E            MR. JUSTICE ROSE:  As at this stage, has there been any
                 exchange of experts reports?

            MR. HYTNER:  As far as we are concerned, we do not have any.  I
                do not know whether the defendants have exchanged reports
                or not.

P           MR. JUSTICE ROSE:  I tell you unless by the time I have heard
                everybody, I have an approximate view of the length of this
                case, it makes it impossible to fix it.

            MR. HYTNER:                    I agree, but all I can say is ---

            MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                             You are the one that wanted a speedy trial.

G            MR. HYTNER:    I know we wish the trial to proceed with some
                  speed because what we say is the facts before the court.
                 The findings are virtually incontestable unless one or
                 other of the parties is going to stand up and say "We
                 contest there is going to be a sort of technical issue in
                 relation to the barrier", I cannot assist on how long that
                 will take. There will be experts on each side talking
                 about facts that we know of: on what happened inside the
H                ground.   We all know.   If, as I say, the police will say
D.L. S E L L E R S & CO. / W L L O Y D W O O D L A N D




                    "Oh well, we don't accept the gates were open and floods
A                   people came in", the actual people in pens three and four,
                    it could last a year.  But if what they are going to say is
                    "Well, yes those are the findings a^d we accept this
                    happened but it was not our fault, it was the fault ofthe
                    club", I would have thought the case will not take more
                    than two to three weeks.

_          MR. JUSTICE ROSE:  The estimate that was given when the matter
               was before Mr. Justice Steyn by the parties appearing
               before him was six weeks.
                                                                                   *
           MR. HYTNER: Again, I do not know on what proposed evidence
               they based that estimate on. As I say ---

           MR. JUSTICE ROSE:   I may be wrong, but I assumed                           that was a
£              joint estimate.

           MR. HYTNER:                   Oh yes, I was party to that.

           MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                             That is what I thought.

           MR. HYTNER:   But looking at it sensibly, the barrier will take
                a little time.  It will not take any time for the Plaintiff
D              because we will not be taking any part in it.     M y Lord, I
                anticipate that experts called by the three parties or four
                parties in relation to the barriers will have to give
                evidence of that, and this could take a week for the
                remainder.  As I say, much depends on the approach of the
                First Defendants to the findings of Lord Justice Taylor.
                How far are they going to say he was quite wrong to find A,
                B, C, and D; or how far are they going to say "We agree
E              with that and we are not going to go through    that again but
                it was not our fault it was the fault of the Club.     It was '*
                the fault of Dr. Eastwood or the city council".     If that is
                their approach, I would have thought six weeks was a very
                fair and liberal estimate.

           MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                             Thank you.

^          MR. HYTNER:  Can I deal with one matter which does not affect
               my learned friends in any way.  They may think that this is
               wholly ambitious thing to be raising, but as your Lordship
               knows, there has been a public fund for the victims of
               Hillsborough.  The various Plaintiffs will be entitled to
               seek assistance from the fund, so that it follows that if
               any Plaintiff wins; if one Plaintiff wins they all win.
q              They will already have, or they may already have, if they
               are infants.  A trust deed has already been drafted by
               Chancery Counsel for the proceeds of the fund.

                         What my solicitors were considering was this: that in
                    the event of an infant Plaintiff succeeding in obtaining
                    damages, an application would then be made on grounds of
                    commonsense that since there is already a trust fund in
H                   existence for that infant, the damages should be
    D.L. S E L L E R S & Co. / W. L L O Y D W O O D L A N D




    .                 transferred to the trust fund rather than the court.   Now,
                       as your Lordship knows, there was a time not all that long
                       ago when it was common both for infants and parents that
                       trust funds were set up and judges, if they approved the
                       trust deed, would agree to the transfer of the damages to
                       the trust fund.  As your Lordship knows, the practice in
                       relation to parents has now been disapproved, but it has
                      not been disapproved in relation to infants.   Therefore,
g                     there is no reason why the damages for an infant still
                      cannot be placed in the trust fund.

                            My Lord, what I was minded to ask your Lordship was
                       this, not today because it would not be right or fair to
                      ask your Lordship to look at it today, but if your Lordship
                      were say minded       Would your lordship agree to an
                      application being made for approval of the trust deed
C                     which, of course, relates to the trust fund set up under
                       the bill that the approval of that be for the purposes of
                      damages being transferred to it in the event of damages
                      ever being recovered.   I only ---

              MR. JUSTICE ROSE:   I think it is hypothetical.  I am
                  sympathetic to the application you make, and it may be - I
                  put it no higher than that - it will be, in the special
D                 circumstances in this case, proper for any money which may
                  be recovered to go into such a trust fund, but at the
                  moment, I think there are several hurdles.

             MR. HYTNER:            I appreciate that.    I have made the difficulty
                 plain.           Obviously, in the ordinary way, it would be very
                 wrong to go in advance. We wondered if you would approve
                  the trust deed on behalf of this case, and the peculiar
k                c i r c u m s t a n c e s are that it relates to a trust fund that is
                  going to be set up. My Lord, it would be unfortunate if
                  the fund were set up on the basis of the deed, and then in
                  a years time your Lordship were to look at it and say well
           <     I would have agreed to transfer the damages to this fund
                  but I do not like that ---

p             MR. JUSTICE ROSE:  I can follow that, but I doubt if the
                  Court has power to deal with something which does not
                  immediately arise from these proceedings.

              MR. HYTNER:   It would be not in relation to matters that are
                   not affected by the proceedings, but yes if that were the
                   trust deed.  I can see no problems, but it is a matter for
                   the trustees of this fund what they do with their money;
G                 but if you are going to ask for evidence for the purposes
                   of damages, I do not like thatparticular clause. We could
                   then consider changing it.  That is the point.

              MR. JUSTICE ROSE:  Mr. Hytner, all I shall say is that those
                  responsible for drafting the trust deed must have in mind
                  the possibility that monies may come into it from another
                  source.
H                                                           .      12
d l. s e l l e r s   a Co   / w lloyo w o o d l a n d




            MR. HYTNER:   My Lord, that is what I wanted to know from your
                Lordship.   There is no purpose in putting the matter before
                your Lordship in due course without the power, without
                counsel present who has drafted the deed.

            MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                           Not yet is the answer to that.

            MR. HYTNER:  As long as I know.  Those are the matters I wish
g               to raise on the pre trial review.  I leave it up to my
                friends to deal with it.

            MR. WOODWARD: We came to Manchester to deal'with a pre trial
                review.  On arrival at Manchester, we met with a problem
                that gives rise to the first application that I make on
                behalf of the First Defendant.  I am applying for a stay in
                these proceedings.
C
                             Before coming to the detail of that, having listened
                      carefully to what my learned friend Mr. Hytner said, I
                      understand what he was saying concerning the conduct of the
                      police at the enquiry, I    am perplexed at what he is saying
                      concerning the conduct of the police in relation to these
                      proceedings, because as far as we are aware, there has been
                      no dragging of feet, and    no endeavour to hold up
D                     proceedings at all until     that which Iam now about to deal
                      wi th.

                           It is no secret that there are criminal investigations
                      being carried out by the,Director of Public Prosecutions,
                      and also there are investigations being carried out with
                      the Police Complaints Proceedure.   Those investigations are
                      criminal investigations and are in the hands of the West
k                    Midlands Police. My Lord, in the hand of the Assistant
                      Chief Constable Mr. Mervin Jones, m a y I hand to your
                      Lordship a letter that those instructing me received from
                      Mr. Mervin Jones concerning that enquiry, dated 23rd
                      October 1989. Substantially, that letter deals with and
                      arises from questions and enquiries concerning the
                      investigation, or the facility for investigation, of an
p                    examination of the barrier; but my Lord, if one looks at
                      the first paragraph through to the second paragraph

                                  "My Chief Constable's knowledge of the circumstances


                       in respect of the barrier is not yet determined".

G
                            My Lord, if one goes towards the bottom of that page,
                       the matter relates to investigation of the barrier.  My
                       Lord, it says:

                                  Once a decision has been ma de .............. ...........

                       it may be considered appropriate for a meeting to be
H                      called".


                                                                   11.
O L. s e l l e r s & CO. / w. l l o y o w o o o l a n o




                      Then we come to the final paragraph:

                                  "On Thursday, 26th October, before Lord Justice Rose

                      nor a decision made by the Director of Public
                      Prosecutions".

                          Ordinarily, my Lord, the Chief Constable is entitled
g                   to call upon all his officers and require them to co­
                     operate in relation to any investigation. He may be
                     involved in the conduct of civil proceedings, and the
                     officers would be required to comply and give statements.

                          Those instructing me have been in touch with the
                     solicitors for the Police Federation; Messrs Russell Jones
                    and Walker.   May I hand to you a letter which was faxed
£                   yesterday to those instructing me, although it is dated
                     24th October 1989,from those solicitors.  The date and time
                     are at the top according to the fax.   That letter reads:

                                                            (THE LETTER WAS READ)

            MR. JUSTICE ROSE:  Presumably the statements have already been
                tendered to your good selves?
D
            MR. WOODWARD:  May I also add that almost immediately the
                Hillsborough Disaster occurred, the West Midlands Police
                were involved in an investigation.  The whole of the matter
                was taken out of the hands of the South Yorkshire Police,
                and all the material and statements they had got was
                furnished to the West Midlands Police, whereupon the matter
                was investigated, and is still being investigated, as it
E               would appear from Mr. Mervin Jones* statement by the West
                Midlands Police.

            MR.       JUSTICE ROSE:   I follow. The information was handed over.
                      Are you saying no copies were kept?

            MR.       WOODWARD^   No. Statements were taken and the police got
P                     all they had as far as they could.  There then came a break
                      in the matter, and the conduct of the investigation was
                      handed over to others, and it was not carried out by the
                      South Yorkshire Police. They did what they could, and it
                      would be unreasonable for them to have sat back and done
                      nothing.  They did not do anything they got on with it as
                      far as they were able to my Lord.  The consequences of this
                      is that having regard in particular to orders of Mr.
G                     Justice Steyn     Does my Lord have before him section 4 of
                      the order of Mr. Justice Steyn?

             MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                            Yes.

             MR. WOODWARD:  Requiring the exchange of all statements of
                 witnesses relied upon within six weeks after the close of
                 pleadings.  In so far as such statements already given,
H                such exchange should be by reference to such statements.

                                                                                         14
                                                                     12.
O.L. S E L L E R S & Co. / W. L L O Y O W O O O L A N O




                      Now, the police officers did give evidence before Lord
^                     Justice Taylor.  Statements they had signed were available
                      and all the parties were furnished with them.

                            The enquiry took place within about four weeks of the
                      disaster happening.   Police officers did give their
                      evidence, and what they said I suspect is there recorded
                      for ever.   But given the situation, it is likely there are
n                     officers who would wish to stand qualified and modify that
                      which they have earlier stated.

            HR. JUSTICE ROSE:                             That happens in every civil litigation one
                can think of.

            MR. WOODWARD:  It does; as in all civil litigation one can
                think of, ordinarily enquiries are made and the witnesses
q              are seen, and the matter is taken up as a matter of
                procedure in order to deal with the points raised in so far
                as they can be anticipated, and deal with points as they
                emerge which have not been anticipated.

                            The effect of that letter from those acting for the
                       Police Federation is an indication that these officers will
                       not co-operate, and will not answer, and will not be
D                     prepared to give statements.   That severely embarrasses, in
                       our submission, the preparation and presentation of the
                       evidence of the First Defendant.

            MR. JUSTICE ROSE:   It goes further than that: it says they are
                 not prepared to advise the officers to give oral evidence
                 in a civil trial that might come in conflict with ---

E           MR. WOODWARD:  There might be difficulties over that, but one
                would hope one would not have to wait until the officer had
                taken the oath before it was known exactly what he was
                going to say.

                           This touches upon another point Mr. Hytner raises, and
                      that is the status of the Taylor Report, if I might call it
                      that, my Lord.  I will turn to our submissions in respect
                      of that in a moment, but it seems that what the Plaintiff
                      and everybody ought to put their minds to is the
                      identification of those facts and issues which will not be
                      in dispute.  That is a thing which we would support and
                      would do our utmost to attend to.

                            The position is this: given the tone of that letter,
G                     effectively the Chief Constable is unable to prepare for
                       his case - for his defence - to satisfy those matters set
                       out in Mr. Justice Steyn's order, being procluded from
                       being able to approach those officers identified, and that
                       is a serious embarrassment.

            MR. JUSTICE ROSE:   I do not follow that, Mr. Woodward, because
                 the direction of Mr. Justice Steyn relates to the mutual
H


                                                                     13.

                    exchange of statements already given at the Lord Justice
                    Taylor Enquiry.

          MR. WOODWARD: With respect, my Lord, I am not sure that is,
              with respect, the proper reading of it. The mutual
              exchange by parties of all statements or witnesses of fact
              relied upon within six weeks after the close of pleadings.
              As I understand the case, in so far as such statements have
g             already been given at the enquiry such exchange be by
              reference  to such statements.  In otherwords, they having
              given evidence, all you see is the statement he gave; but
              it is the first part of that order that wd will not be able
              to comply with.

          HR. JUSTICE ROSE:                              Yes.

C        HR. WOODWARD:   My Lord, that also affects the expert evidence.
              It does not touch so much upon the consultant engineer, but
             my Lord he will require to know, and does require to know
             certain details from certain officers.   It cannot touch
             upon metallurgists,   but it does touch upon questions of
              safety.  The third expert category allowed for in these
             circumstances.   My Lord, it is unlikely that we will be
             able to comply certainly with the category C type expert
D            evidence, but my Lord, to a lesser degree with the
             requirement concerning the consultant engineer's evidence.
             There is another difficulty in relation to that which I
             will come to, which does not arise out of this predicament
             presented by the decision-of the police officers.

                       My Lord, the application to stay, although that is
                  important here in that the purpose is to protect these
k                 police officers, that would be an application, having
                  regard to the case, which if they thought they were in
                  difficulty, they would have to make themselves. We do not
                  have, on behalf of particular police officers, to make that
                  application; but it is in relation to the preparation of
                  this trial.

F                      The preparation of* this is not entirely a D.P.R.
                  Future Limited type case, found at 1989 1 W.L.R, page 778,
                  when the court was concerned to deal with an application
                  for stay by certain directors of the company who considered
                  that they might be prejudiced in the criminal matters were
                  were there to be a trial of the action.   In that case it
                  was held they could be protected by other orders, by
                  matters being dealt with in camera, giving orders
G                 concerning confidentiality.   It is in relation to the
                  decision of the Chief Constable that we are finding
                  ourselves embarrassed, and with the prospect of being
                  unable properly to prepare our case, and unlikely to be
                  able to comply with the orders of Mr. Justice Steyn.

          MR. JUSTICE ROSE:   One problem is that there is no indication
              in either of the letters which you have given to me of how
H             long the enquiries may take.


                                                                14.

^                   MR. WOODWARD:  That is indeed right.  That is a grave problem,
        A               my Lord.  The director as written in part in relation to

I                       the question of inspecting the barriers because there was
                        some concern about the integrity of that material on 25th
                        October 1989.  Perhaps for completeness my Lord should see
                        that letter.  It gives no indication of the sort of time
I                       that these investigations may be expected to occupy.

        g           MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                            Thank you.
I
                    MR. WOODWARD:  It is really the first part of the letter if it
                        was possible,one might expect him to indicate it will only
                        be a matter of weeks, or it will be a long time, but he has
I                       not.  From the indication given by Mr. Mervin Jones, these
                        enquiries have a long way to go, so he cannot say there is
                       little prospect of this difficulty disappearing.  We are
I   /
    ■
        q              embarrassed, and it is on that ground that we ask for a
                       stay of these proceedings.
                                  I start with that application.  It is one that is
I                            necessarily important because in the circumstances, we
                             cannot properly prepare the case, nor can we comply with
                             the orders that have so far been made.
I
        D           MR. JUSTICE ROSE: Just reverting for a moment to the question
                        of expert evidence in relation to safety; was any evidence
I                       in relation to that advanced before Lord Justice Taylor on
                        behalf of the police?

                    MR. WOODWARD:  No, there was no evidence advanced; no positive
I                       evidence advanced by any of those who are now before my
                        Lord.  At the hearing, all the evidence was called by
                        counsel to the enquiry, and the matter was dealt with very
I                       quickly.  There was no evidence put before the enquiry on
                        the question of barriers or safety, save to the best of my
                        recollection, Dr. Eastwood himself.  There was material
    (                   from the Health and Safety Executive. Their investigations
I                       were not, at the time the enquiry concluded, complete.
                        There was evidence put before Lord Justice Taylor
                        concerning the ordinary standard of care and the degree of
                        skill that should have been exercised.

                    MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                            Yes.

                    MR. WOODWARD:   The Chief Constable wishes this matter to be
                         kept at that. No impediment has been placed by the Chief
                         Constable or those acting on his behalf, so far as we are
        G               aware, in the progress of this lititation until I rose to
                         my feet at this moment.

                                  The statement of claim was served on 11th August.
                             Defence was served on 22nd September. The reply, which the
                             Plaintiff asked for time to be extended, was served on 20th
                             October 1989, and so pleadings have not yet quite closed.
                             We have not sought to hold the matter up. We only make
        H                   this application because of embarrassment and fear that we


                                                                              15.          17

                       will not be able to properly present the case, or comply
                       with the orders. Would it be convenient if I went on to
                       deal with ---

              MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                             Yes, we will have each counsel in turn on
                  everything.

              MR. HYTNER:   It may save a lot of time if I ask Mr. Woodward to
  B               explain his first application to this extent: is he saying
                   that the Chief Constable will be embarrassed in the
                   preparation of the case against the Plaintiff, or the other
                   defendants, or both?

              MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                             He is putting it globally

             MR. HYTNER:   If he is saying against the Plaintiff, I wonder if
/ <2             he could assist us and your Lordship by indicating which of
                  the allegations that the Plaintiff makes against the Chief
                  Constable he is going to ---

             MR. JUSTICE ROSE:  I think you better let Mr. Woodward make his
                 application as he wishes to.

             MR. HYTNER:                    Very well.
  D
             MR. WOODWARD: We make it globally in respect of the proper
                 presentation of the Chief Constable's case.

                            If I may,                       with respect, draw your Lordship's attention
                       to Mr. Justice                       Steyn's order.  I have made the point in
                       relation to A.                        We would have hoped to be able to comply
                       with that, but                       there is a difficulty about it on the expert
  E                    evidence. May                        I shortly address your Lordship on that.

                            We anticipate a problem.  It may be that that problem
                        will be resolved.  Accordingly, I am not asking at this
                       juncture for departure from the order made by Mr. Justice
                       Steyn concerning any exchange of written reports. My Lord
                       will see from the two documents before you part of the
  P                   picture concerning the investigation and examination of    <
                       barriers.  The barriers are in the custody of the Health
                       and Safety Executive. We applied to them for facility in
                       order for our experts to be able to carry out an
                       examination.  My Lord, initially, the response was that the
                       Health and Safety Executive had been instructed by Mr.
                       Waly, secretary to the Lord Justice Taylor Enquiry, to
                       retain the broken barrier in it's present condition.
  G                   Samples could be made available to the parties involved in
                       the civil action.  I would refer such requests to Mr.
                       Mervin Jones.  That gives rise to that, or part of that
                       letter, is from Mr. Mervin Jones concerning the barriers.

              MR. JUSTICE ROSE:  Presumably that is a directional request
                  which is effective until such time the.final report of Lord
                  Justice Taylor is made.

O.L. S E L L E R S & CO. / W. L L O Y O W O O D L A N D




            MR. WOODWARD:  My Lord, one might have thought that was agreed
                in relation to the Health and Safety Executive observation,
                but my Lord, there is a letter from Mr. Robert Waly,
                secretary to the enquiry which those instructing me have,
                dated 24th October 1989.

            MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                             Thank you.

            MR. WOODWARD:  This is part of the Health and Safety Executive
                whose letter I was reading but a moment ago:

                                 "So far as the barrier is concerned.'...................

                     as further investigation of it may be necessary in respect
                     of this enquiry".

C                         The tenor of that suggests that it is not in relation
                     to anything Lord Justice Taylor has said. The rest of the
                     letter deals with the enquiry made concerning the technical
                     report.  Then, my Lord, the next document, in fact, is the
                     letter of 25th October which m y Lord has, I think, from Mr.
                     Dor from the Director of Public Prosecutions.

            MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                             Yes.
D
            MR. WOODWARD:  Laying down conditions, so it would seem.
                Looking at that correspondence, taking it as a whole, the
                official response was under n o circumstances can anything
                be done to this barrier,'and it would seem that we are now
                in a position, subject to certain conditions, and that
                requires some discussion because the director wishes to
                impose certain conditions upon making an examination.
E
                          The reason I am referring to this is that it is hoped
                     that by sensible discussion wi t h the director, the position,
                     can be made plain, and our metallurgist and engineer will
                     be able to make whatever examination in the proper frame
                     entitled, and not be made subject to terms and conditions,
                     for example, that all reports and date of supply to
P                    somebody else. Any other requirement or condition attached
                     to monitor the test, of course, would be reasonable because
                     it would be important to know exactly what happened to the
                     piece of the barrier.

                          I mention that because of the time requirement in
                     relation to Mr. Justice Steyn*s order. We expect to be
                     able to comply with it my Lord, but there is a chance that
G                   we may not. That is in respect of the consultant engineer
                     and metallurgist as to the safety of them. We may be able
                     to substantially comply with it, but not in relation to
                     such tests as I have been referring to as to the safety
                     matter.

                          My Lord the controlling, the policing the organisation
                     and running of crowds.  That is a matter in respect of
H                   which it would be necessary to have the co-operation of the

                       police officers; and if questions be asked of them and ttiat
A                      is a difficulty.

                            May I move on now, my Lord.  There was an application
                       before Mr. Justice Steyn asking for other actions to be
                       stayed. We have nothing more to add in relation to that.

                           May we move to 8 . That, in part, is coupled with 11(1)
g                    of the order that in part is coupled with the rider Mr.
                      Justice Steyn made, that the Taylor Report is not a matter
                      that can come before the court and constitute evidence in
                      the hearing. My Lord, the report is, o f ,course, a set of
                      facts that are known.   It sets out inferences drawn from
                      those facts; sets out matters and conclusions and matters
                      all known.

~                          In relation to that report it would seem that the
                      purpose that the Plaintiffs require it to be before the
                      court is really as a sort of aide-memoire; a list of facts.
                     Now, my Lord, in relation to that matter, I indicated at
                      the beginning that is an end which all the parties, vith
                      respect, I think in one way or another would seek to comply
                     with, having no interest in causing this trial to run on,
                      and on, and on.  They all have an interest in seeing what
D                    facts are common, and what can be agreed; so we respect the
                      suggestion that the Taylor Report should go before the
                     trial judge or it should be put in in evidence.   In so far
                     as it may not seem capable as a means by which one can
                     identify facts and indicate whether or not we agree or
                     dispute, that is the end which we would seek to assist and
                     encourage in the report to go before the trial judge.

E            MR. JUSTICE ROSE: What is it that you are suggesting? If it
                 be the case that the First Defendants are anxious to
                 identify as speedily as possible the material facts, and in
                 in relation to which there is a dispute, is not one
                 convenient way of doing that to follow the suggestion of
                 Mr. Justice Steyn?

P            MR. WOODWARD: Not that the report should go in, but my Lord,
                 the facts sought and the scale of the facts in the report
                 may be taken as the scale upon which one may proceed to
                 agree facts.

             MR. JUSTICE ROSE: What is it you are concerned about: that the
                 judge who tries this matter will be improperly influenced
                 by expression and view?
G
             MR. WOODWARD:  No, my Lord.  In so far as any conclusion of
                 facts before Lord Justice Taylor were cast upon evidence,
                 that evidence will be there; but at the trial it is not
                 inconceivable that other evidence - additional evidence -
                 will be given that will not be the same.

(


               MR. JUSTICE ROSE:  Of course that is what is contemplated in
                   what Mr. Justice Steyn said; but each party should be at
                   liberty to contradict any of the disputed facts.
                                                                           4


               MR. WOODWARD:  But it would also seem b y that proposal there is
                   an indication, or the intention to reverse the burden of
                   proof.

    g          MR. JUSTICE ROSE:  I do not view it in that way at all.  I view
                   it as being the Taylor Enquiry Report and the Taylor
                   Enquiry being a convenient summary of relevant facts, some
                   of which may well be in dispute.

               MR. WOODWARD:  My Lord, if the purpose is to leave the trial
                   judge untrammelled in so far as can be, by having agreed
                   facts or identifying those facts which are not agreed, then
(   C              a list in some form or other will have to be prepared.

               MR. JUSTICE ROSE: Yes.   Is not the Lord Justice Taylor Enquiry
                   a convenient starting point for such a list?

               MR. WOODWARD:  It may be a convenient starting point for the
                   purpose in order to prepare an agreed list, my Lord, yes.
                   It is a convenient starting point for the purpose of
    D              preparing their agreed list, or their list of undisputed
                   facts.

               MR. JUSTICE ROSE:  And the advice so far as the judge referred
                   to this is concerned.

                MR. WOODWARAD:                       It is unnecessary that he should look at it.

    ^           MR. JUSTICE ROSE:  If there are 200 facts found by Lord Justice
                    Taylor, of which 180 are common ground and 20 are in
                    dispute, is it said to be more convenient that they should
                    all be picked out of the report, separately typed,
                    separately considered, rather than that they should be seen
                    in the report.  Is that thought to be a more convenient
                    course?                   <

    F
                MR. WOODWARD:  My Lord, there are more than those facts in the
                    Taylor Report.

                MR. JUSTICE ROSE:  Of course there are.                        I plucked those
                    figures out of the air.

                MR. WOODWARD:                      Forgive me, I did not intent to ---
    G
                MR. JUSTICE ROSE:  Well, of course there would be expressed the
                    view it would not only not bind, but would not influence
                    the trial judge.

                MR. WOODWARD:  My Lord, we would submit he need not be
                    trammelled with them.

                                                                                                    ro




                                                                   19.

                    My Lord, whilst on it, we submit the report has no
               status for the purposes of the proceedings.  If it is to be
               taken as a whole by which the parties can identify issues,
               other considerations apply.

      MR. JUSTICE ROSE:  Mr. Hytner says unless everybody agrees, it
          cannot have any.  It would be very regrettable if time was
          spent by the trial just in this case investigating the
          outside facts about which there is no issue at all.

      MR. WOODWARD: With respect, if there were no issues, the trial
          judge would have told and no-one would h&ve been ---

      MR. JUSTICE ROSE: What is the procedure which you propose for
          the trial judge to be told of these facts which are agreed?

      MR. WOODWARD:  By a list of them, the way as in a civil
          action one party may give to the other a notice of facts,
          and they will then be admitted or not admitted.  This, with
          respect, seems to put it the other way round requiring a
          party to give notice of the facts it disputes.

     MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                             Yes.

     MR. WOODWARD: When the list of facts is drawn and prepared and
         the facts shortly stated, perhaps all the facts might be
         conveniently put on two sheets of A4. It is not the
         objective that is challenged, it is the mode of seeking to
         pursue it.

      MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                            Yes.

      MR. WOODWARD: My Lord, in relation to Mr. Justice Steyn's
          observation 11(1 ), the transcript, there is no issue about
          that.  It really is 11 (1), the last clause of that at
          which we have been looking.

      MR. JUSTICE ROSE.                            There is no issue as to 11 (1) B

      MR. WOODWARD: No my Lord, none at all. We agree that is a
          true record of what was said at the hearing.

      MR. JUSTICE ROSE: Do I take it then that the First Defendant
          is prepared to agree to submit before trial a list of those
          findings of fact contained in the enquiry report contested
          at trial?

      MR. WOODWARD: We are prepared to participate in the
          preparation of an agreed list of facts, or an agreed list
          of disputed facts.  The mechanics by which that may be
          reached by the parties should be unimportant.  It might be
          by looking at the Taylor Report.  It is the objective,
          therefore.  May I move to the third party matter.

      MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                            Yes.

A               MR. WOODWARD:   Does my Lord have before him the third party
                    notice.   It is strictly speaking, whilst called third party
                    notice given under order 16 third party in summary
                    proceedings and they are in relation to matters between
                    defendants.

               MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                              Just a moment.     Yes.

B               MR. WOODWARD:  My Lord, they have been prepared by my learned
                    junior in addition to the matters set out within the action
                    between the parties, my Lord, against the Football Club,
                    adding to the matters set out within the Plaintiff's
                    pleading a further allegation that they did not provide
                    sufficient means of escape for the crowd from the pens in
                    case of emergency.

C               MR. JUSTICE ROSE:   Just a moment.  I may not have     Oh yes, I
                    see.  It is at the end.   I was not sure if I had the right
                    document.   It is a very short document.

               MR. WOODWARD:                      Yes.

               MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                              I have it.

D               MR. WOODWARD:  And my Lord, in relation to the Fourth
                    Defendant Dr. Eastwood, recites and relies upon the matters
                    pleaded within the Plaintiff’s pleading, and with the
                    additional four or five points that are there raised. We
                    seek to raise these against our co-defendants, and that is
                    properly done by the procedure.

p                            My Lord, in respect of these, we have asked for
                        directions.  Does my Lord have that?  I have not had an
                        opportunity to discuss that with my learned friends, and
                        what their attitudes to this third party notice are. No
                        objection has been given but, my Lord, that may be because
                        they have not had a chance to speak to me.

               MR. JUSTICE ROSE: I will see what counsel say about that.   At
p                  the moment, you are asking for an order in the form of the
                   summons?

               MR. WOODWARD: Yes.  They are fairly standard.                               We ask for
                   these orders. Thank you, my Lord.

               MR. GLASGOW: There is very little I need to add on behalf of
                   the Club.  Is it convenient if I run through Mr. Justice
G                  Steyn's order with your Lordship. The pleadings and the
                   discovery ought to be dealt with. Might I advance to say
                   that I hope your Lordship has not got the impression from
                   any of the lawyers that there has been any delay.

               MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                              I have not got any impression at all.

                          operation.

                 MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                            I do not doubt that.

                 MR. GLASGOW:   I hope you do not, my Lord, because many do.  It
                      is right that the Court should be aware of that, and that
                      co-operation continues.
    g
                               My Lord, the pre-trial review was helpful, and that
                          indeed has been co-operated with.                            *



                               So far as my learned friend's position on the stay is
                          concerned, may I say that for our part we sympathise
                          ourselves.  We understand it is difficult if you cannot get
                         your hands on statements, but we do wonder, although we
    C                    have no forceful case to make of it, whether there is a
                          little problem here other than one of professional
                          difficulty with which one sympathises.

                               We accept and understand that the junior officers may
                         have been advised by their own solicitors not to provide
                         any further statements.    Is it in the interests of justice
                          simply to stay the whole of the action because of that?
D                        One would have thought that possibly the action could
                         proceed on the timetable that we had all agreed, and that
                         we all thought sensible on the last occasion, and the Court
                          should look favourably at any late application to serve the
                          statements from any quarter where there had been some
                          acceptable and reasonable delay of the matters.

                                I do not want to single anybody out by name or rank,
^                        but the fact that the senior officers who are clearly
                          thought most directly concerned for not only giving their
                          statements, but giving evidence, and there is no suggestion
                          that they would seek either to be advised, or they be
                          prepared to hide behind any procedural delay that might
                          arise in the future.

    p                          There can be no question of the criminal proceedings
                          going on, or the investigation continuing into the end of
                          next year, by which time we will know where we are going.
                          I do not think anybody would be enthusiastic about the
                          civil proceedings being embarked upon and people being
                          compelled into the witness box at this stage, putting the
                          matter at it's lowest. Would it be right to address your
                          Lordship on the basis that is a realistic prospect, and if
G                         that is so, perhaps all we know is understanding without
                          any separate order: that the order that witness statements
                          be exchanged within six weeks could be subject to the
                          caveat there may be supplementary statements which will be
                          served later, and that it should be a common understanding
                          that none of us will take any issue where it is clear there

                            That is all we say about the stay. We would be very
A                     unhappy there should be a stay because it has always been
                       the Clu b ’s case that the injured people ought to have their
                       remedy against those responsible as promptly as possible.

                            So far as the exchange of reports is concerned, we are
                       in the same position as the police, and I identify the
                       parties by name; it is easier. We cannot get our hands on
o                     the material and we very much like to. We understandthe
                       Health and Safety Executive, and we bided our time.   It is
                       difficult, and we may be a little late with our actual
                       service of the reports.  If that is so, and everybody
                       understands this is not through people playing games, but
                       because of wholly understandable and proper reasons.   In
                       the public interest, people have been prevented from
                       examination or doing destructive tests.  I suggest
q                     everybody will understand; and if we are late with our
                       reports, we can come to your Lordship, or whoever is
                       appropriate, and explain that.  One would hope it would not
                       be necessary, because nobody will deduct points against us,
                       but if it is, we will have to come back. At the moment,
                       there are enough problems of this nature without looking
                       for them.

D                           My Lord, so far as 8 m y Lord I think there is nothing.
                       The status of the report, again without criticism or
                       improper comment, we simply accept reluctantly as a fact
                       that if no consent is given the only procedure is for
                       statements of facts to be served and for them to be
                       distributed.  We would regret it should be necessary, but
                       we understand if on the professional and competent advice
                       people think it is necessary to direct that. We would
E                     accept that however regretable.    Our only wish has been
                       toensure that when it does come to service of notice of
                       agreed facts, that we all can exercise the measure of co­
                       operation we have tried to give everything else.   If we
                       have to go through the laborious exercise, which the public
                       may find very difficult to appreciate, for a second time -
                       these matters over which there is no real or substantial
F                     issue between us - one ventures to suggest that your      t
                       Lordship or another trial judge would obviously convey your
                       attitude towards that particular party in the form of costs
                       with some enthusiasm.

                             We will co-operate in that exercise, and one would
                       hope when the schedule of facts has been drawn, all
                        defendants, any single one of us, can give serious
q                      consideration to it, taking the lines considered helpful by
                        Mr. Justice Steyn.  I think your Lordship cannot order us
                        to, but we welcome and do our best to make sensible
                        compliance with it.

               MR. JUSTICE ROSE:  Is it possible to give any indication as to
                   what might be an appropriate time scale if there are to be
                   statements of facts served?

            MR. GLASGOW: My Lord, I anticipate the document rather like my
A               friend Mr. Woodward.   The schedule of the notice to admit
                facts, which one would have thought could have been done on
                two bits of A4 paper, because the knife cuts both ways.    I
                am sure my learned friend Mr. Hytner would be the first to
                accept that it is wholly unnecessary from the Plaintiff's
                point of view to list every single fact laboriously and to
                go through the Taylor reports.   One would expect Lord
g                Justice Taylor did; but to take out those facts that really
                matter, and to serve those.   If that cannot be fitted on to
                two sheets of A4 paper, some of us particularly those who
                sit behind us, will be extremely disappointed.   I would
                have thought that the exercise could be accomplished in 14
                days, and certainly in the time scale for the preparation
                of this trial.

C                         It would be sensible to allow a longer period because
                    the question of what is relevant, and what is likely to be
                    disputed is, to some extent, a reflection upon the view of
                    the expert and when the experts have had an opportunity of
                    looking at the barriers, they may tell us that there are
                    matters in the Taylor Report that are no longer material,
                    and it would be for fear of missing something out.   Surely
                    the sensible thing is to say in 28 days if it is to be done
D                   this way round, then the Plaintiffs could draw a schedule
                    of those facts clearly without prejudice them in any way at
                    all.  If they could make their list of what they regard as
                    important facts, we can then consider them in the same time
                    period.   It might make sense to them, although my learned
                    friend Mr. Woodward rightly reminds me that it might be
                    better to do that after the expert's report.   That is a
                    matter for your Lordship's timetable when you have heard
E                   us   .
                          If this exercise is to be embarked upon, then the
                     service of the notice of admitted facts can probably be
                    done.   He has probably got it in draft already knowing Mr.
                    Hytner,but it would be done within 28 days, with sensible
                     co-operation, as soon as the reports are ready, probably
P                   following the exchange.

                                 My Lord, so far as 9 is concerned, nothing turns on
                      that.        There has been ---

            MR. JUSTICE ROSE:   Forgive me. Before we go onto that,   I am
                 trying to calculate the numbers of weeks of the
                 presentorder in relation to experts reports.  They should
G               be exchanged within 10 weeks after the close ofpleadings
                 pleadings have not quite closed, so we are looking at the
                 middle of January.

            MR. GLASGOW:                     Yes, my Lord.   It is 12th January.

            MR. JUSTICE ROSE:  Thank you. So 31st January for an indication
                facts which were in dispute?

                                                                     h

           MR. GLASGOW:  It cannot affect anything that would alter the
A              length of trial at some time or anything like that.

           MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                          Thank you.

           MR. GLASGOW:  I think there is nothing further. We all agree
               about the transcript, that is the usual order. I think
               there is nothing on 9. The only other matter on which we
g              had any views were the third party directions. Provided
               that it is clear and ---
                                                                         \

          MR. JUSTICE ROSE:  Forgive me.  Before you go on to that, have
              you got a view as to the length of this case?

          MR. GLASGOW:  We all have. We all gave it and we all agree
              five to six weeks. We could all be wrong, but we did think
j             about it before we said it. We all know there will be co-
~             operation, and one or two people will be passive about one
              or two things.  That is bound to happen; but five to six
              weeks is our estimate, and nothing has changed to alter it.

          MR. JUSTICE ROSE:  Bearing in mind that the gap between Easter
              to the end of the first half of that term is barely five
              weeks, have you any view as to whether ---
D
          MR. GLASGOW: Again, there is co-operation and may I make one
               thing plain: nobody was seeking to go behind your Lordship
               in trying to find out what the situation was.  It was
               recognised that the Plaintiff's, on any view, would be
               extremely unhappy if my learned friend Mr. Hytner was not
               available.  My Lord, we all recognise that the Plaintiffs
               have said right through this enquiry "Can we get on with
E              the action", and so now, it is of paramount importance, and '
                                                                           •
               therefore we are unclear of whether it was likely, given
               that estimate, that autumn would be available. We looked
               at the calendar for hearing the case at this court as to
               when it could be fitted in. It was against that
               background, I think the three who tried to look at the
               situation together with staff, recognised it was possibly
P             not realistic to fit in the sort of timetable which Mr.
               Justice Steyn quoted infront of us and asked for our view
               upon.

          MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                           The first half.

          MR. GLASGOW:   Yes, and the danger of running into the vacation
               and or into problems with the break, and it made sense if
q             it looked as if it could be fitted in with the court, and
               Mr. Hytner, and it did, and the majority obviously to go
               for a safer date. That would allow for the sort of
               circumstances like the unavailability of the experts and
               material which we thought was likely to happen, even with
               the present hope with the speed we have shown so far, which
               is pretty commendable. That is why we thought of speaking
               to as many people as possible.  Mr. Hytner's suggestion
H             through his chambers is to have an early June fixture made


                                                                   25.

    A                  sense from the Plaintiff’s point of view.   If we can co­
                        operate with it and it was apporpriate ---

               MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                             Oh, clearly.

               MR. GLASGOW: We spoke of the five to six weeks we think it is
                   likely to be that in any event.

B              MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                             Yes.

               MR. GLASGOW:  The only other matter is the third party matter.
                   Nobody is talking technical words, but we are talking about
                   an order 16 rule 8 notice.

                             There is no new issue there is no third party notice,
                        and that is an important point because we all recognised,
C                      even before the hearing before Mr. Justice Steyn, that it
                       would be highly regretable if people started serving third
                       party proceedings in this case, because that would lead to
                       delays while third parties got involved.   We wanted
                       everybody to be equal defendants so the timetable could
                       run.

                             Mr. Justice Steyn, when he heard our reasons, agreed
D                      with us to the extent of saying if third party proceedings
                       were issued, he would not give leave for them to follow in
                       this trial.    They would have to take those at a later
                       stage; and we are most anxious that nothing should now be
                       done to upset the smoothness of that rhythm. If people
                       want to put their point later in the form of third party
                       notice, nobody can stop them. They are wholly unnecessary
F                      and extremely unhelpful because they lead people to take
                       points on them; and when we look at what are called third
                       party notice, which ought to be set out in a letter is
                       provided for now rules, there is no new issue between the
                       parties.   They do not require to know what our cases areas
                       pleaded in the Defence.    Those are joint. Nobody has
                        sought to take the independent contradictory point. These
                        so called third party notices are a bit of a nuisance when
p                      you look at them; drafted.

               MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                             What importance ---

               MR. GLASGOW:  Just ignore them.  They provide no useful
                   purpose. What is the point in telling us that police want
                   to be indemnified on the grounds of our negligence?  It is
                   not remotely helpful.  It was a good idea, but it will be
G                  ignored.

               MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                             So your answer is to make no order?

               MR. GLASGOW:                    None at all.

               MR. JUSTICE ROSE:  If I am asked to make an order, I have to
                   make an order of some kind.

              MR. GLASGOW:  That is why your position is so much more
                  difficult than ours; but we do not think there is any
                  advantage to them, and they do not --- '

              MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                               They do not add anything.

              MR. GLASGOW: They add nothing. They are potentially
                  introducing a complication which we wanted to avoid.  If
3                 there is some specific direction in relation to that my
                  friend wants, he could ask; but it is a wholly unnecessary
                  notice.

                             Unless I have missed something.                         Those are our
                        submissions.

              MR. MAXWELL: May I deal with matters in the                                 order in which
*2                they have been discussed.

                               The First Defendant application                       to stay: we have no
                          observation on make on that.

                            Secondly, the Plaintiff application for a direction
                       that Lord Justice Taylor’s report of facts should be priaa
                       facie evidence of such facts, and anybody who disputes a
D                      finding must list them. We find that to be an attractive
                       direction, not least because it looks as though it will
                       save so m uch time.  It is not a direction to which we feel
                       able to agree as matters stand, my Lord.

                           The reason for that is not that we wish to be
                      obstructive, but it is because we have not had a disclosure
                      of witness statements, and my Lord, we do not know,
E                     therefore,    the full extent to which any challenge of the
                      findings of fact may have to be made. We may know the hard
                      core of the challenge, but we do not know the full extent.
                      We find, therefore, that is not a direction to which we can
                      agree.  On    the other hand, we will respond constructively
                      to a notice to admit facts of the kind envisaged, and if it
                      is agreed the timetable which was proposed, my Lord, which
P                    was talked about to have a response by the end of January.
                      That would allow us an opportunity to reflect upon
                      discovery witness statements and experts’ statements.

                              So far as the transcript is concerned, we agree to
                       the direction which is sought; that that is proper evidence
                       of the facts.

q                           As to the amendments, we have no objection to the
                       proposed amendments the Plaintiff seeks, but we ask for
                       consequent leave to amend the defence of the Third
                       Defendants if so advised.

                           May I turn to a part of the case where we are asking
                      the Court’s assistance.  It relates to a request for
                      further and better particulars the Third Defendants have
H                    made and the Plaintiff’s statement of claim.
                                                                                                           I o

                        May I draw your Lordship’s attention to the allegation
                   made against the Third Defendants in the statement of
                   claim.  I only have that in the original form, not the
                   amended form.  It arises in paragraph 10, page 10 of the
                   pleading: the particulars of negligence of the Third
                   Defendants.

           MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                    Yes.
B
           MR. MAXWELL:  Perhaps it would be better if I invited your
               lordship to read them, rather than for me to read them out.

           MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                    I have already looked through them.

           MR. MAXWELL: May I refer your Lordship to the answer which has
               been supplied to a request for further and better
C              particulars.  I do not know if that is on the Court’s file.

           MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                    No, I think I may have this.   I have not
               read it.

           MR. MAXWELL:                It was very recently served: 24th October.

           MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                    Well then, no.
D
           MR. MAXWELL:  I am handing to your Lordship a copy of the
               identical reply received in the Rimmer case.

           MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                    Thank you.   Yes.

           MR. MAXWELL: Your Lordship will see the answer given at the
               very end of this document (This was read)
E
                        If your Lordship would refer to the defence of the
                   Second Defendants.  It is on the last page of the defence.

           MR.       JUSTICE ROSE:              Just a moment.      Yes.

           MR.       MAXWELL: Particulars of negligence of the Third
P                    Defendants set out at A as against the Third Defendants.
                   The Second Defendants will have answered adopting and
                   relying upon the allegations pleaded against the Third
                   Defendants in sub- paragraph 8 inclusive of the statement
                    of claim.   It would seem not to be an open avenue, but a
                    cul-de-sac in the terms as pleaded, so we would like to
                    direct an impasse.   The way is not for the Plaintiff to be
                    required to provide us with particulars, and for things to
q                  be put upon the Plaintiff to seek those particulars those
                    particulars by whatever route is available.

                         My Lord I am sorry to go back and forth, but when
                    I           read to your Lordship the response to the request for
                    particulars which began with the Third Defendants.  They
                    know the allegations are those initially made, and we do
                    not know what is being talked about, except having heard
H                  what has been said and seen the order made the last time.


                                                             28.                            30
D L. S E L L E R S & C O / W. L L O Y D W O O D L A N D




                      We now appreciate that there was some discussion as to the
                      position of the Second Defendants in terms of blaming other
                      parties. What we would like to know, and so we can prepare
                      our witness statements, is the answer to the request for
                      further and better particulars.  We would like to have
                      further and specific information so that we may then
                      approach the relevant witnesses.

B                           That is the position, and we invite the Court to make
                      an order in respect of that request for further and better
                      particulars, if your Lordship thought that was a sensible
                      idea.   It is the consequential effect upon the order made
                      in relation to the witness statements of fact and, my Lord,
                      the disclosure there was to be within I think it is six
                      weeks of the close of pleadings.

C           MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                             Yes, that is right.

            MR. MAXWELL: We think we would be able to make that and shall
                be complying with that; but the request for further and
                better particulars may produce information which requires
                additional evidence from witnesses, and we would like to
                add a further order to add this: that there should be
                liberty - at least for the Third Defendants - liberty for
D               the Third Defendants to serve additional statements of fact
                within 28 days of service of the further and better
                particulars and the statement of claim.

            MR. JUSTICE ROSE: Is it necessary to do that, Mr. Maxwell?
                Could the case not be left to the good sense of the
                parties? Nobody will be critical if --

E           MR. MAXWELL:  I will rest content with your Lordship’s
                observation which I am sure will not be gain sayed by
                anybody here.  I do not think I can assist your Lordship
                further.

            MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                             Thank you.   Yes, Mr. Fenwick?

p           MR. FENWICK: The first and most important matter is the
                question of the date of trial.

                           Clearly, we recognise the importance of getting on
                      with these proceedings as fast as possible, and the last
                      thing we want to do is to delay them unless it is
                      absolutely necessary: but the context of the claim made by
                      the Plaintiffs, and as my learned friend  Mr. Hytner has
G                     indicated effectively at the behest of other defendants, is
                      against a professional firm, and largely against one
                      professional man: Dr. Eastwood.

                           These allegations against a professional man are all
                      the more serious because of the very grave nature of the
                      events that occurred.  For that reason, in our submission,
                      Dr. Eastwood and the Fourth Defendants are entitled to have



                                                                       29.                 31

    .                     a full and proper opportunity before of preparing their
                          case fully and of being properly represented.

                               My Lord, thedifficulty that we face in an early trial
                          date is two fold.   First and foremost, and I accept it
                          straightaway, there is a difficulty for my learned friend
                          Mr. Tilson in attending.  My Lord, he has other commitments
                          throughout the summer until October.
    B
                              On investigation, the one which at present it appears
                         that he may not properly be able to return, is a six week
                         case on 30th April, which should leave him free to start on
                         18th June.   So my Lord, at the moment, having due regard to
                         various commitments, unless released, or unless that case
                         settles, it is unlikely that he would be able to attend to
                         represent the Fourth Defendant if the trial began before
    C                   18th June. My Lord, it is possible that he might even then
(                       be embarrassed either by that or other case.

                              It is not simply a matter of the convenience of
                         counsel. Dr. Eastwood and the Fourth Defendant effectively
                         were involved in the enquiry at a relatively late stage,
                         and others of those represented were present throughout
                         from the outset, tty Lord, Dr. Eastwood received an
    D                   indication by way of letter at a comparatively late stage,
                         and appointed my learned friend Mr. Tilson for their part
                         of the proceedings.   In other words, it was necessary to
                         catch up, and those representing him not done and were not
                        able to hear much of the evidence.    It is on that occasion
                        my learned friend Mr. Tilson alone represented Dr.
                         Eastwood.  He had no junior.

    E                         My Lord for that reason it is a case where in my
                         submission, it is particularly important that due regard .v
                         should be had, if possible, of allowing the Fourth
                        Defendant to be represented by my learned friend Mr.
(                       Tilson, but it goes further than that because of the
                        difficulty of catching up with Fourth Defendant, but anyway
                        because the Fourth Defendant was involved in these
    P                   proceedings at a later stage.   It was only after the las(t
                         summons it was intimated that they were going to be joined.
                        We did not attend, so my Lord, we have to catch up in the
                         proceedings anyway.

                              If the effect of your Lordship's order as to trial
                         date effectively means that the Fourth Defendants cannot
                         rely on the attendance of my learned friend Mr. Tilson at
    G                   trial, during the preparation stage, as your Lordship will
                         imagine on an enquiry, one is very much working very
                         closely with the client day by day, hour by hour.  The time
                         for somebody else to catch up would be all the greater.
                        Your Lordship knows the difficulty and the ways that can be
                         overcome.

                             My Lord, the other matters which in our submission
    H                   make it difficult for the Fourth Defendant to be able to


                                                              30.

                             proceed towards trial with quite the speed of the other
                             defendants, apart from our late joining of them in the
                             enquiry and in the proceedings, is the uncertainty as to
                             the nature of the allegation against us, and what we are
                             going to have to do by way of investigation, and reading
                             the transcript, and reading the witness statements, and
                             those parts of the evidence that we are not as yet familiar
                            with.   I say that for this reason: your Lordship has heard
        B                   that in the case of Chapman currently before your Lordship,
                            we were joined at the end of July, beginning of August
                             after the last direction.

                                  It was intimated to us that at all times until, I
                            think, about the middle of September, that although we were
                            involved in that action, it was not expected by the
                            Plaintiffs that we would be in the second action in
    ( C                     relation to pen 4.    In the event, for reasons which I
                            understand may be similar, all those involved are joined in
                            the Chapman action. We were, in fact, joined in that pen 4
                            action, but it was intimated to us that we were unlikely to
                            be involved in the   third action which has not yet been
                            formulated against those, or relating to those injured
                            outside the ground.

        D                        As we now understand it, not at the behest of the
                            Plaintiff, but as I understand it at the behest of one of
                            the other defendants, it is likely we are going to be
                            involved in that action also. At present we cannot, with
                            great respect, for the life of us see what it is about Dr.
                            Eastwood and his firm which could give rise to a joinder in
                            that action. Clearly it has to be hoped that all the
                            actions can be dealt with at the same time, but until we
        E                   know what is going to be said to us, even in the most
                            general terms, it is very difficult for us to assess the
    (                       time that it will take to prepare for trial.

                                  My Lord, that, in my submission, indicates that our
                            concern should be viewed sympathetically.    It now appears
                             (I hope* I am right in saying this) that all parties are
        P                   effectively agreed that the trial date would be better in
                            June than April or May.    If it was April or May, in my
                            submission we simply would not be confident of telling the
                            court we could get there in time.    In June my Lord, it is
                            going to be difficult, but we do not want to hold the trial
                            up.    If your Lordship feels an October date is too late ---

                   MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                              I do.

                   MR. FENWICK: We would ask your Lordship to consider the
                       estimate of length is five to six weeks.  For our part we
                       say nothing to suggest that is wrong.  To start on 18th
                       June would allow six weks before the end of term.

                   MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                              Only just.

                                                                                            o -j




                                                                               31.

        A           MR. FENWICK:  I accept that.  It is possible for my learned
                        friend Mr. Tilson to absent himself from week one, and
                        attend thereafter; but if one is concerned with the proper
                        presentation, in my submission the fourth Defendant is at
                        least entitled to that indulgence, provided your Lordship
                        is satisfied he is not going to cause substantial hardship
                        to the Plaintiff or other defendants.  In my submission
                        that type of adjournment is unlikely to do so. Of course,
        g               for our part would be content to undertake if any
                        circumstances showed we could get there earlier, we would
                        bring it to the attention of the Plaiantiff without delay.

                                  Unless I can assist your Lordship further, those are
                             my submnissions as to the trial date.

                    MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                             Thank you very much.
    /C
    (               MR. FENWICK:  So far as the report of Lord Justice Taylor is
                        concerned, we welcome the approach that this document
                        should be before the trial judge and should, as far as
                        possible, allow uncontested issues of fact to go before the
                        court without the need to call oral evidence.  Clearly a
                        waste of time and resources that that should happen if not
                        absolutely essential.  It may be that there is no need for
        D              me to address your Lordship at length in view of the lack
                        of agreement from other parties, and lack of jurisdiction.

                                 May I make our position clear. We are sympathetic,
                            and would like to be able to agree to this. We have two
                            concerns, and we regard one as important and the other as
                            sensible and convenient.  They can both be resolved by
                            organisation, and the Plaintiff indicating simply by
        k                  underlining or sidelining passages in the report; those
                            primary findings of fact on which they would seek to rely                              •
                            at trial.

                                  We are asking for that for two reasons, the first
                            which I say is the important one, is that many findings Of
                            fact are quite clearly that; findings of fact. On one
        p                   view, it could be thought a finding of fact, and on another
                            view it could be seen as an inference, or indeed as a
                            conclusion. We think that it     is going to be important that
                            any dispute as to what the findings of fact going before
                             the court are are resolved before the trial, and not at
                             thetrial, so there is no doubt, and the Plaintiff cannot
                             say this is a primary finding   of fact one or other of
                             thedefendants wished to test;   not it is a conclusion. It
        G                   seems to us that it does not take time, or any significant
                             time,on the part of the Plaintiffs, and would lead to the
                             simplification of the issues at trial.

                                  The second point is this: that                         so far as the Fourth
                             Defendant is concerned, I have made                         clear our lack of
                             familiarity.  In order to assist us                         in arrive speedily in
                             our preparation for trial, my Lord,                         it would be helpful to
        H                   us to know which of the matters the                          Plaintiff seeks to rely

I
                                                                             32.                                       34

    A                   on. This can be put against any defendant.   I do not seek
                        to ask him to put which defendant he relies on those facts
                        for; just so we know which areas of the transcript we have
                        to look at closely; which witnesses we have to look at
                        closely; and can put to one side those matters which are
                        not going to be in issue at the trial.  Subject to that,
                        our present view is that we would very much hope to be able
                        to consent in the present terms sought.
    B
                             My Lord, as far as the expert investigations are
                        concerned, we think it may be difficult to meet the date of
                        10th January which presently stands under the order.   I do
                        not make an application at this stage.  I'would very much
                        hope that at least we could say secure the evidence with
                        that exchange of expert report say not less than three
                        months before the trial, which would be a satisfactory
C                       period in my submission. That would either, of course, be
                        about 2nd March or 16th March if your Lordship acceded to
                        my earlier submission.

                             So far as the pleadings and the further       and better
                        particulars (which are an issue raised by my       learned friend
                        for the Third Defendant) and the third party       litigation is
                        concerned, they are intertwined. May I deal        with them
D                      together.

                             As your Lordship has heard on the Plaintiffs in their
                        first statement of claim adopted by anticipation the
                        allegations against the Third and Fourth Defendants which
                        they expected to be made not otherwise by way of third
                        party proceedings by the First or Second Defendants.   That
P                      placed them in some difficulty as to particulars, and
                        clearly both the Third Defendant and the Fourth Defendants
                        are going to have to have these particulars by one means or
                        another.   I anticipate we will be in a similar position to
                        my learned friend for the Third Defendants where further
                        and better particulars we have add nothing. The statement
                        of claim is about to be amended so we did not serve two
                        documents.
F                                    «
                             The point that I sought to make with my learned friend
                        Mr. Hytner and his junior in relation to the pleadings was
                        this: if your Lordship would be kind enough to look at the
                        second Third Party notice which was just put before your
                        Lordship.

               MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                              Yes.
G
               MR. HYTNER: May I save time. This is going to mean a little
                   more work for Mr. King, but we give in.

               MR. FENWICK:  I am grateful for that.  That being the case,
                   once these allegations are properly pleaded in the
                   statement of claim, we can plead to them by way of amended
                   defence and I would seek the consequent order as my learned
H                  friend has, and proceed to the particulars of the


                                                                     33.                    35

                          Plaintiff.  Once that is in place, it becomes unnecessary
     A                   for me to make a submission on the third party directions
                          which I otherwise would have had to'. Clearly they should
                          be properly pleaded, because we are pleading to them as
                          against the Plaintiff.  It seems to us that once they form
                          part of the Plaintiff's case, then there is nothing new or
                          additional in the third party notice, and therefore, no
                          requirement for any pleadings; so once that is in place, I
     g                   support my learned friend Mr. Glasgow*s submission, and
                          there is no need for your Lordship to make any further
                          direction.

                                      Unless I can assist further, that is my submission.

                 MR. JUSTICE ROSE:   Do you want to say anything else about the
(                    wisdom of making an order on the third party proceedings,
''       C           Mr. Woodward?

                 MR. WOODWARD:   I they are going to re-cast third party
                      proceedings, it may be unnecessary.  With respect the third
                      party matter is properly brought despite the persuasive ---

                 MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                             Never mind that: why should I make the
                     order?
     D
                 MR. WOODWARD:  If the pleadings are re-cast in the form
                     contemplated ---

                 MR. JUSTICE ROSE: They are going to be proper particulars given
                     in so far as they are required.

                 MR. WOODWARD: My Lord, if that is the order, then I am not
     E               making any application. I will not pursue it.

                 MR. JUSTICE ROSE: Thank you. Mr. Hytner, what about the time
                     scale so far as those further particulars are concerned?

                 MR. HYTNER:  Fairly equal. Can I deal with the re-casting of
                     the amendments to statement of claim?
     p
                                  To deal with Mr. Fenwick’s point, if he wants it
                           done in that form, it will be. If he finds it easier to
                           plead, we will do it.  I have leave to amend the statement
                           of claim; also the document in accordance with the
                           amendment that has already been sought; plus the additional
                           amendment, and both go on the amended statement of claim.

     (j                         As for the point made by Mr. Maxwell, I have sympathy
                           with his application.  To make this absolutely plain, I
                           have done this on the transcript now I think three times,
                           but I do not want the Plaintiff to be involved in any
                           argument on costs at the termination of this litigation.

                                It is the Plaintiff’s primary case that the First and
                           or Second Defendants are liable to the Plaintiff.  We would
     H                     not have been bringing in the Third or Fourth Defendants


                                                                          34.
D.L. S E L L E R S & CO. / W. L L O Y D W O O D L A N D




                    had we not been told that they were going to be made third
                    and fourth parties.  It was by agreement with all parties
                    that it was accepted that we would re-serve the statement
                    of claim to effect third party proceedings in relation to
                    the Third Defendants. We were slightly bothered to find
                    the form in which they were blamed by the Second Defendants
                    because the words "if necessary" were inserted.

B                        Now, it is perfectly clear, and we wish to make it
                    clear, that we will now seek from Mr. Glasgow the
                    particulars of the allegations sought by the Third
                    Defendants.  My Lord, if the Second Defendants are not
                    serious in their allegations against the Third Defendants,
                    we will drop the claim against them.  It is as simple as
                    that, and Mr. Maxwell will have his particulars by one
                    route or another.  If he does not, the case will disappear
~                   against him.  That can be dealt with between whom there has
                    been total and complete co-operation for the last three or
                    four months; so there is no need for your Lordship to make
                    any further orders on that indication. Can I deal first of
                    all, if necessary, with the application for stay?

           MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                              No.

D          MR. HYTNER:  Can I deal with the question of the form in which
               admitted facts; our notice to ---

          MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                               Yes.

          MR. HYTNER: Without consent, nothing can be done save for the
              procedures, the appropriate procedures to be gone through,
              and we will go through it ---
E
          MR. JUSTICE ROSE:  I am minded                                 to order statement of facts
              within 28 days, and notice                                 of those in dispute by 31st
              January.

           MR. HYTNER:                   I see.             N o w ---

P         MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                               Are you seeking to dissuade ce?

           MR. HYTNER:                   No.

           MR.        JUSTICE ROSE:                       I do not need to hear further comment.

           MR.      HYTNER: Just an indication so my friends know this: that
                   we will not be seeking to have facts admitted which will,
G                  as it were, improve on theliability of the Third and
                   Fourth ---

           MR.       JUSTICE ROSE: You must put                           in your notice of fact, and you
                    must tell Mr. Glasgow. You                            do not need to tell me.

           MR. HYTNER:   Can I deal with one other matter; something which
               may cause a little bit of a problem if it is not dealt with
H              early; and that is the status of Lord Justice Taylor's


                                                                        35.                                 37

                      report.   It clearly can not have, as it were, any
A                     beneficial status once one party objects, but ay Lord,
                      plainly; but is Hr. Woodward saying that there must be a
                      pretence that it does not exist?  Either the judge had read
                      it, or he has not.  If Hr. Woodward feels it is wrong for
                      the judge to have read the report, we have to find a judge
                      who has not. The danger is this: you need only read the
                      newspapers which is often very dangerous.
D
             HR. JUSTICE ROSE:  Pretty unlikely he could remember what he
                 read in newspapers.

             MR. HYTNER:  Some of the headlines stay with some people for
                 ever, but surely Hr. Woodward would agree even ---

             HR. JUSTICE ROSE:                           Mr. Woodward indicated he would not agree.
r
             MR. HYTNER:   My Lord, that I accept; but are we to understand
                  that it could never be referred to during the course of the
                  hearing?

             MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                           That is a matter decided by the trial judge.

                           There will be leave for the Plaintiff to amend the
D                    Statement of Claim which will incorporate such amendments -
                      apart from those presently before me - as are necessary to
                      particularise the Plaintiff's case against the third and
                      fourth Defendants. Leave to serve and make those will be
                      made within 7 days. Leave to amend and serve any
                      consequential amended defence within 7 days thereafter.

                           So far as the application for stay is concerned, I am
E                    not persuaded that the possibility of junior officers
                      making further statements upon which the first Defendants
                      may wish to rely is a sufficient ground for ordering a stay
                      in this case.

                           So far as the conduct of the criminal and disciplinary
                      investigations are concerned, they are investigating
 _                   matters wholly different from those which will have to be
                      determined in this litigation.  There is no present
                      indication as to when those enquiries will be completed,
                      and I am not persuaded that such small theoretical
                      prejudice is important, according to the first Defendants,
                      as a jurisdiction in all the circumstances of this case for
                      ordering these proceedings to be stayed.

G                           The case will be fixed for trial on 11th June 1990 at
                       Liverpool.  I order that a Statement of Facts be served on
                       the Plaintiffs within 28 days; that any party disputing
                       those facts will serve notice of that dispute by 31st
                       January 1990.  I make no variation in relation to the order
                       made by Mr. Justice Steyn as to the disclosure of expert
                       evidence, it being accepted by everyone in these
                       proceedings that some modest delay in the timetable there

                              indicated will not be frowned upon provided it is the
                              result of bona fides.

                                   So far as the transcript of the proceedings before the
                              Enquiry is concerned, I direct that that should be admitted
                              as a true record of what was said at the Enquiry.  So far
                              as the third party proceedings are concerned, I make no
                              order.  So far as any further applications in this matter
        B                     are concerned, I give liberty to apply either to myself, or
                              to Mr. Justice Steyn; whoever is on circuit at the time
                              until such time as the trial judge becomes known.

                                          Is there anything I have forgotten?

                    MR. HYTNER:                    Costs in the cause.

        ;           MR. JUSTICE ROSE: Does anybody resist that? (There was no
                        response from counsel) Costs in the cause.

  Dear P.C. Greenway,
                         Jrefer to our telephone conversation about my complaints
  to the West Midland pofice about the way they handled the evidence in Kevin's
  case, you told me it would be best if I wrote-everything down and sent you aWthe
  evidence that f have.

  in the case of Kevin the evidence at the Mini-inquest was bazarre. On the 2nd
  May 1990 the statement dated 27th April 1989 of P C Bruder, an off duty
  Merseyside Police Officer, was summarised. The summary omitted the evidence
  in relation to vomiting the pulse and an ambulance that Mr Bruder said passed
  him at 3.37.pm. while he was tending to Kevin.
  The evidence of Special Constable Debra Martin of the South Yorkshire Police
  was summarised, including the assertion that at 4. pm. Kevin opened his eyes
  said "Mum" and died.

  On the 3rd May 1990, a statement was signed by P.C.Bruder retracting his first
  statement. On the 3rd May my husband and I were visited by a Det Sawyers of
  the West Midland Police, he came round to tell us that P.C. Bruder has now
  changed his statement a year after he had made his first statement.

 On the 4th May 1990 the coroner held another Mini-inquest on Kevin, the
 retracted statement was summarised, and Dr Slater was recalled to say death
 must have accurred before Miss Martin tended Kevin. Dr Slater was called again
 to say that the twitching spoken of by P.C. Bruder in his new statement was
 possible after death, in spite of the severity of the asphyxia.

 The first statements made by P.C.Bruder and Debra Martin say Kevin was alive
 upto 4. pm. that day, there second statements made a year after the disaster all
 the signs of fife in Kevin had been changed.

 I had a meeting with P.C. Bruder a t__________ Police station were he worked
 one of Mr Bruders superiors was present, I took with me Miss cofernan who did
 the research on Hillsborough, enclosed is a copy of the notes we made of my
 meeting with Mr Bruder. (A).

Mrs A.E Williams



                                                                   Telephone
                                                                        Fax




  I then tracked down Miss Martin she had [eft the Police force, she wanted to
  come to Formby to tell me what had happened to Kevin. Miss Martin told me that
  she had made her first statement up from notes she had made in her pocket book
  on the day of the disaster. Miss Martin also told me that she was visited at her
  home by two West Midland Police officers who put pressure cut herto change her
  first statement, Miss Martin was sticking to her original statement enclosed is a
  copy of the statement that Miss Martin wrote out that day, which was signed in
  the presence of my solicitor. (B)

  I have seen a lot of visual evidence to try and find Kevin, I spotted the ambulance
  that Mr Bruder was so adamant about entering the ground at 3.35. pm. at the
  Peningstone end of the ground and would have passed Kevin and Mr Bruder at
  3.37. pm while he was tending Kevin. Theambulanceis on video compiled by the
  West Midland Police, enclosed is a copy.(C)

  In JUne 1994 when Roger Cook ran a programme about Kevin they tracked down
  Mr Tony Edwards who was the assistant to the driver of the ambulance that
  entered the ground at 3.35. pm.
  Tony Edwards asserts that he was interviewed by West Midland Police in some
  detail but was never called to give evidence. He made it quite dear that a second
  ambulance was involved and appears orrvideo yet West Midland Pofrce never
  presented the court with this information or apprised the court erf the existence of
  Tony Edward's or the relevance of his evidence. This amounts to deliberate
  concealment and suppresion of evidence. Enclosed is a copy of Mr Edward's
  statement. (D)


  John Prescott a Liverpool fan who saw Mr Bruder give first aid to Kevin, has now
  been located and had made a statement. This statement offers still further
  support to the evidence of P.C. Bruder and the ambulance.
  Enclosed is a copy of Mr Prescotts statement (E) and a copy of a still
  photograph taken by a photographer for the Times newspaper, which shows
  Kevin lying on the ground with Mr Bruder giving mouth to mouth, John Prescott
  kneeling to the left of the photo (i n the light jumper) and two unknown people. (F)

                                                                        Fax




  I hope my complaints will be looked into, on the Cook Report Dr Popper admitted
  that there was difficulty with Mr Borders evidence with regard to the timing of the
  ambulance, he said he was worried because if he was in error if you like on the
  ambulance he might have been in error on other things.
  So marrf things have gone wrong in Kevin's case, I now know my son died at
  4. pm. that dreadful day, I feel that through the changing of the witness statements
  and the suppresing of the ambulance the jury at Kevin's inquest drd not know
  what had happened to Kevin after 3,15. pm. I also need to know why this has
  happened.

  I hope to hear from you soon.




                                  Yours Sincerely.
                                             A
       MEETING BETWEEN ANNE WILLIAMS AND P.C. BRUDER - 15TH DECEMBER,      1991.


       P.C. Bruder made his statement approximately ten days after the disaster.

       At that time he asked the West Midlands Police for the name of the          boy he had
       attempted to resuscitate (ie. Kevin Williams).  This was refused.

       At the meeting with P.C. Bruder he stated that he came across Kevin on the pitch and
       that Kevin was either convulsing or twitching.  Kevin had a pulse and there was
       vomit in Kevin's mouth.  As he tried to resuscitate Kevin an ambulance approached
       going towards the Leppings Lane end of the ground.  He shouted for the ambulance
       to stop in order to put Kevin in it, but it went straight past.

       On 3rd May 1990, P.C. Bruder was visited in his home by a West Midlands Police Officer
       who asked him to 'reconsider' his statement.  He was asked if he was mistaken when he
       stated that Kevin was convulsing and had a pulse.  P.C. Bruder stated that he was not
       mistaken.

       N.B. It was only at this time (ie. 3rd May, 1990) that P.C. Bruder          learnt for the
       first time the name of the person he had tried to help.

          At the same time as the West Midlands Officer was interviewing him     in his home, £he D R
5L/}f7--?2.G©i»ener rang P.C. Bruder and tried to persuade him that the facts of his statement
          were incorrect in particular that the ambulance could not have been driving onto
          the pitch but might have been driving off it.    Again,  P.C. Bruder refused   to admit
          that he had been mistaken and was adamant that the ambulance had been driving onto
          the pitch.                                                    ,

       The West Midlands Officer was with P.C. Bruder from approximately 10.00 am - 4.00 pm
       on 3rd May.

       P.C. Bruder told the Officer that he didn't want to see Kevin's parents but if
       they wished to meet with him then he would be prepared to meet them anywhere.
       (N.B. When the West Midlands' Officer visited Mr. and Mrs. Williams the same
       day he informed them that P.C. Bruder would not see them).

       P.C. Bruder stated the reasons behind the West Midlands Officer visiting him when
       he stated "when he came down to see me it was with a brief - to get me to change
       my mind."

       In response to whether or not he would be prepared to make another statement, P.C.
       Bruder replied that he would be prepared to stand up in Court and state that Kevin
       was convulsing, that there was a pulse and that there was vomit in his mouth.

       Asked whether or not Kevin was alive when he got to him, P.C. Bruder^repl-ied •
       "there was a pulse and if that means he was alive then he was alive."

       When P.C. Bruder left Kevin he was certain that he was dead.   He himself vomited
       and then went home.  He— destroyed all the clothes he was wearing on that day.  He
       stated that he has never received any counselling and has dealt with the disaster
       "in his own way."

Dear Chief Superintendent Lowe,

Thank you for your letter of 17th June regarding Kevin Williams
(Deceased), Hillsborough, April 1989.

Given the history of this case, I am bound to say that I am
singularly unsurprised by the contents of your letter.     My lack
of surprise does not in any way indicate that I am anything other
than totally dissatisfied at the unwillingness/refusal to address
the specific questions to which Mrs. Williams seeks answers.     I
also realise the futility of pursuing this correspondence between
us which I now consider to be closed.

Finally, I was interested to see the motto which you have of
Justice with Courage.    It is a pity that this has not been
reflected in your dealings with Mrs. Williams.

Yours sincerely,




                2 6 i \ ; ;'

Dear Chief Superintendent Lowe,

Re; Kevin Williams   (Deceased)   - Hillsborough, April 1989

I have enclosed copies of correspondence relating to the death
of Kevin Williams which are self-explanatory.

I have noted the comments in your letter to Mrs. Williams dated
23rd May, in particular the second and third sentences.

I am sure you are aware of my interest and involvement in this
case and that I not only had an Adjournment Debate on the subject
but also assisted Mrs. Williams in her submissions to the
Attorney General.   Mrs. Williams is concerned - a concern which
I share - that the blanket statement which you make in your
second and third sentences makes no attempt to answer the
specific points which she makes, particularly the point relating
to the presence of the ambulance on the ground.    I am at a loss
to understand how you can say that this is unsubstantiated when
there is clear evidence to the contrary.

Throughout my whole involvement with Mrs. Williams I have been
impressed by one thing above all else, namely her desire to know
the truth. It is quite clear from all the evidence that the cut­
off point of 3.15 p.m. does not apply in the case of
Kevin Williams.   Mrs. Williams will not be satisfied until she
knows the truth and, on her behalf, I ask you once again to
consider providing specific answers to the specific questions
which she poses.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards.

Yours sincerely,
                                          SOUTH YQNK& POLICE I

Dear Mrs Williams

You will be aware that your letter dated 24 April 1996 addressed to ihe West Midlands Police has
been forwarded to South Yorkshire Police for attention.

The matter you mention in your letter has already been subject to a thorough and vigorous
investigation which resulted in the allegation not being substantiated.

There is no new evidence to justify a further re-examination of this complaint and in consequence I
do not propose to take any further action in this matter.

If I can be of any further assistance then please do not hesitate to contact me.

Yours sincerely

    Dear Mrs Williams

   On behalf of the Chief Constable I acknowledge receipt of your letter of 24 April in
   respect of the tragic death of your son Kevin at Hillsborough in April 1989. The Chief
   Constable is concerned that you are complaining about the way in which the death of
   your son was investigated by West Midlands Police officers.

   Enquiries have been made with South Yorkshire Police, who still maintain a dedicated
   office within their Complaints and Discipline Department to investigate issues arising
   from the Hillsborough disaster. They have documentation relating to yourself and,
   consequently, your letter has been forwarded to the Chief Constable of South
   Yorkshire, Mr Richard Wells. He will respond in due course in respect of the issues
   you have raised in your letter to Sir Ronald.


   Yours sincerely

Dear Mr. Hadfield,
                     My name is Anne Williams I lost my 15 year old son Kevin
Daniel Williams at the Hillsborough disaster in April 1989.

The West Midland police did the investigation into Hillsborough, after the inquest
on my son 2nd May 1990 my husband and I were visited by a Det Sawyers who
came round on the 3rd May 1990. to tell us that a witness P.C. Bruder an off duty
police officer from Liverpool had know changed his statement about the condition
Kevin was in when he attended to him that day.

I tracked down P. C. Bruder and asked him why he had changed his statement,
Mr Bruder said he had not changed his statement, that when the West Midland
police officer came round it was with a brief to get him to change his statement.
Mr Bruder is sticking to his original statement made within weeks of the disaster.
Mr Bruder says an ambulance passed at 3.37. p.m. that day he asked a st Johns
ambulance man to flag it down as he wanted to put Kevin in it, it would not stop.
Mr Bruder was told that the only ambulance on the ground at that time was exiting
full thats why it would not stop for Kevin.

I have found the ambulance on video compiled by the West Midland police,
entering the ground at 3.35. P.M. at the Penistone Road end, I have also talked
to the assistant to the driver Mr Tony Edwards who confirms he entered the
ground at that time and would have passed Mr Bruder and Kevin at 3.37.p.m. the
reason he did not stop was because he had orders off the Assistant Chief
Ambulance Officer Mr Hopkins to go straight to the Lepping lane end of the
ground as there were fatalities.
Sometime after the disaster the exact date he can not remember Mr Tony
Edwards was taken to the Ambulance Headquarters on Moorgate Road in
Rotherham, there in a room above the control unit, he met two officers of the
west midland police, they did not take a signed statement from him but one of
them took notes. To help them with their enquiry he was shown a video of his
ambulance progressing up the field, the video had a time injection which related
to the actual time he was on the pitch, they also discussed the differences
between the three ambulances on the field that day, namely that the St. Johns
ambulance witch came on the ground at 3. 15.p.m. had a broad red stripe along
its side, Tony Edwards ambulance had a broad yellow stripe, ( which indicates a
non-emergency vehicle) while the emergency ambulance, manned by
ambulanceman John Flack and                     had a green and whirte chequered
stripe along its side and entrered the ground at 3.20. p.m.

Mr Edwards ambulance was important evidence in Kevin's case, because Mr
Bruder was wrong about the ambulance he must have been wrong about the
condition Kevin was in.

 A few weeks after Mr Edwards had been to Moorgate Road to help the police
with there enquiry he received a letter thanking him for his coperation in helping
the police.

Why was Mr Edwards ambulance suppressed even Lord Justice Taylor in his
report believes that only two ambulances arrived on the ground that day ?

I was also told on the 2nd May 1990 when I attended Kevin's Mini Inquest by Det
Killick that when Kevin was taken to the gym by a S.W.P.C. Debra Martin that
Kevin had spoken the word "Mum" and opened his eyes.
After tracking Miss Martin down I found out that she was again sticking to her first
statement made from notes of her pocket book on the 8th May 1989. Miss Martin
told me that she was put under pressure by two West Midland Police officers to
change her statement, she did not know what she had sighned, she just sighned
a statement to get rid of them.

Please could you have these complaints looked into, so much had gone wrong in
Kevin's case, it had taken me four years to find out how my son died, I have
disscused in intamate detail with Forencic Pathologists Kevin's injuries and they
agree that Kevin could have spoken "Mum'* when Miss Martin had attended to
him. I have know tracked everyone that touched my son that day, the carries that
carried Kevin across the pitch say he was alive, a fan that was with Mr Bruder
says he remembers the ambulance and Mr Bruder saying he had found a pulse
on Kevin.

I have known about the changing of witness statements and the supressing the
evidence of the ambulance for some time, I have been trying to get a new inquest
on my son so that I can finally put him to rest, again I have failed but I need to
know why have police officers put pressure on witnesses to get them to change
there statements, why have the West Midland police supressed the ambulance,
everything seems to have gone wrong in Kevin's case,all I wanted to know was
the truth, I feel I should have been told the truth from the out set not knowing
what happened to Kevin has caused me a lot of heartache.

Please could I have an independet police force to check my complaints out.




                                       Yours Sincerley.

Dear Mrs Williams

You will be aware that your letter dated 24 April 1996 addressed to the West MidlandsPolice       has
been forwarded to South Yorkshire Police for attention.

The matter you mention in your letter has already been subject to a thorough andvigorous
investigation which resulted in the allegation not being substantiated.

There is no new evidence to justify a further re-examination of this complaint and in consequence I
do not propose to take any further action in this matter.

If I can be of any further assistance then please do not hesitate to contact me.

Yours sincerely

    MRS ANNE WILUAMS,

    Mrs Williams is the mother of Kevin Williams, who was killed at Hillsborough in April
    1989. She has written to me complaining about the conduct of the West Midlands
    officers who conducted the investigation into his death.

    My Staff Officer/ Superintendent John Colston, has been in contact with PC Ken
    Greenway in your Complaints and Discipline office which has responsibility for
    enquiries in respect of Hillsborough.

    Mrs Williams is well-known to that office, and this is not the first time she has
    complained. Apparently, this is well-documented, and it would be prudent for a
    response to her current letter to come from South Yorkshire. I have attached hereto
    all the correspondence we have for your information and appropriate action.


    Yours sincerely

Dear Mrs Williams

On behalf of the Chief Constable I acknowledge receipt of your letter of 24 April in
respect of the tragic death of your son Kevin at Hillsborough in April 1989. The Chief
Constable is concerned that you are complaining about the way in which the death of
your son was investigated by West Midlands Police officers.

Enquiries have been made with South Yorkshire Police, who still maintain a dedicated
office within their Complaints and Discipline Department to investigate issues arising
from the Hillsborough disaster. They have documentation relating to yourself and,
consequently, your letter has been forwarded to the Chief Constable of South
Yorkshire, Mr Richard Wells. He will respond in due course in respect of the issues
you have raised in your letter to Sir Ronald.


Yours sincerely

                                                                24th April 1996.




Dear Mr. Hadfield,
                     My name is Anne Williams I lost my 15 year old son Kevin
Daniel Williams at the Hillsborough disaster in April 1989.

The West Midland police did the investigation into Hillsborough, after the inquest
on my son 2nd May 1990 my husband and I were visited by a Det Sawyers who
came round on the 3rd May 1990. to tell us that a witness P.C. Bruder an off duty
police officer from Liverpool had know changed his statement about the condition
Kevin was in when he attended to him that day.

I tracked down P. C. Bruder and asked him why he had changed his statement,
Mr Bruder said he had not changed his statement, that when the West Midland
police officer came round it was with a brief to get him to change his statement.
Mr Bruder is sticking to his original statement made within weeks of the disaster.
Mr Bruder says an ambulance passed at 3.37. p.m. that day he asked a st Johns
ambulance man to flag it down as he wanted to put Kevin in it, it would not stop.
Mr Bruder was told that the only ambulance on the ground at that time was exiting
full thats why it would not stop for Kevin.

I have found the ambulance on video compiled by the West Midland police,
entering the ground at 3.35. P.M. at the Penistone Road end, I have also talked
to the assistant to the driver Mr Tony Edwards who confirms he entered the
ground at that time and would have passed Mr Bruder and Kevin at 3.37.p.m. the
reason he did not stop was because he had orders off the Assistant Chief
Ambulance Officer Mr Hopkins to go straight to the Lepping lane end of the
ground as there were fatalities.
 Sometime after the disaster the exact date he can not remember Mr Tony
 Edwards was taken to the Ambulance Headquarters on Moorgate Road in
 Rotherham, there in a room above the control unit, he met two officers of the
 west midland police, they did not take a signed statement from him but one of
 them took notes. To help them with their enquiry he was shown a video of his
 ambulance progressing up the field, the video had a time injection which related
 to the actual time he was on the pitch, they also discussed the differences
 between the three ambulances on the field that day, namely that the St. Johns
 ambulance witch came on the ground at 3. 15.p.m. had a broad red stripe along
 its side, Tony Edwards ambulance had a broad yellow stripe, ( which indicates a
 non-emergency vehicle) while the emergency ambulance, manned by
 ambulanceman John Flack and                     had a green and whirte chequered
 stripe along its side and entrered the ground at 3.20. p.m.

Mr Edwards ambulance was important evidence in Kevin's case, because Mr
Bruder was wrong about the ambulance he must have been wrong about the
condition Kevin was in.

 A few weeks after Mr Edwards had been to Moorgate Road to help the police
with there enquiry he received a letter thanking him for his coperation in helping
the police.

Why was Mr Edwards ambulance suppressed even Lord Justice Taylor in his
report believes that only two ambulances arrived on the ground that day ?

I was also told on the 2nd May 1990 when I attended Kevin's Mini Inquest by Det
Ktllick that when Kevin was taken to the gym by a S.W.P.C. Debra Martin that
Kevin had spoken the word "Mum " and opened his eyes.
After tracking Miss Martin down I found out that she was again sticking to her first
statement made from notes of her pocket book on the 8th May 1989. Miss Martin
told me that she was put under pressure by two West Midland Police officers to
change her statement, she did not know what she had sighned, she just sighned
a statement to get rid of them.

Please could you have these complaints looked into, so much had gone wrong in
Kevin’s case, it had taken me four years to find but how my son died, I have
disscused in intamate detail with Forencic Pathologists Kevin's injuries and they
agree that Kevin could have spoken "Mum” when Miss Martin had attended to
him. I have know tracked everyone that touched my son that day, the carries that
carried Kevin across the pitch say he was alive, a fan that was with Mr Bruder
says he remembers the ambulance and Mr Bruder saying he had found a pulse
on Kevin.

I have known about the changing of witness statements and the supressing the
evidence of the ambulance for some time, I have been trying to get a new inquest
on my son so that 1can finally put him to rest, again 1have failed but 1need to
know why have police officers put pressure on witnesses to get them to change
there statements, why have the West Midland police supressed the ambulance,
everything seems to have gone wrong in Kevin's case, all I wanted to know was
the truth, I feel I should have been told the truth from the out set not knowing
what happened to Kevin has caused me a lot of heartache.

Please could I have an independet police force to check my complaints out.




                                      Yours Sincerley.

Dear

I refer to your letter of 26 April 1996, and your request for information regarding changes which
have occurred at Hillsborough since 15 April 1989.

As a result of the Lord Justice Taylor inquiry, certain recommendations were made in his report
that not only affected the Hillsborough Stadium but also other football stadiums throughout the
United Kingdom.

Certain structural changes have been made within the stadium insomuch as it is now all seated,
the perimeter fence and gates have been removed in their entirety, and the boundary wall and
turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end of the ground have been removed and relocated, increasing
safety of fans approaching the ground.

Unfortunately, I am unable to assist you further with the information you desire and wish you well
with your assignment.

Yours sincerely

Dear Sir

With reference to your facsimile letter of 3 may 1996, I regret to inform you that it will not be
possible to provide you with any material following the incident at Hillsborough in April 1989.

Since that time there has been a strict policy within South Yorkshire that we will not release
photographic material gathered as a result of that incident, and I can inform you that we have had
numerous requests from a number of sources throughout the country over the past few years.
Indeed, the Police Staff College have also asked for material and have been refused and you will
see, therefore, that in all the circumstances it is not possible to assist.

I am sure you will understand the position we are in and I trust that it will not impair your
presentation.

Yours faithfully

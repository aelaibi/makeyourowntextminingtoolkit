        I and my brother                      then decided to leave the ground,                   as    I knew the

        I fina l l y got home at 2 0 . 10hrs             (2010),      having       stopped at Birch

        S er v ic es    on the M62 to         phone my mother.

        I went     to the       identical      m at c h at Hi 11 sboroua(i last year,             and on       that

        occasion        it was    one of the best         organised/rnatches           that    I have        ever

        been to*, and          I ’ve been going      to footS^/H.        grounds      regularly since           I was

        problem at all.

        I must     say that       I feel      the Police     stopping        the    coach at     the    junction

        of the H1        to    check   tickets,     delayed     u. j f u n n e c e s s a r i l y for about    ten to

        twenty minutes,           and w ould     have    b \ e r X of more    use nearer       to the ground.

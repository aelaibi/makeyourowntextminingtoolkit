                P r ior   to      commencing            duty,   we had been told that a hot meal would be

                pro vi de d for our serial                  after     1.15pm     (1315)      w hich we w ould take at

                s t a g ge r ed    i n t e r v a 1s before       commencement         of the g a m e .      At 2 . 15pm    (1415)

                having       received          no    instructions       to take a meal,            I made    enquiries with

                other officers             on the serial      and d i s c o v e r e d they had a l r e a d y taken a

                meal.       At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2.35pm (1535)               daVe I left my position a n d

                went      to the      rear of the N o rt h Stand,                where        obtained a meal.            On

                leaving        I noticed            that   the Spion Hop,           and the South S tand a pp ea re d

                to be a lmost          full,         whereas     the L ep pings Ln terrace,             West Stand and
                                                                                                           PAGE          3

N or t h Stand,         a p p e a r e d only half full,           w it h    large areas        of the seats

unoccupied.



At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 /SjOpm (1430)          I r eturned to my             position     in front      of

the NortnN Bt an d.              I noticed that           the mood of the            crowd was     now more

aggre ss iv e,         w ith    large    numbers      of spectators              standing,     and standing         on

the seats.             Large     numbers     of the spectators               had o bviously been

d rinking        intoxicants,           w hi ch was    reflected by their a g gr es si ve

b ehaviour a nd          chanting        d ir ected towards N o t t i n g h a m Forest            supporters.



I was      in p o s s e s s l s ^ jof my oVq^ personal              issue M ot orola         radio,     w h i c h was

tuned to         channel       25 for the        purpose of the duty.                 There     had been

t h ro ug ho ut      the day heavy traffic over the                        radio,    but as     the kick off

ap proached,           and from about 2 . '30pm (1430)                 there was        very    little,     and

for a long           period whilst          I was     having my meal,              there was     no traffic         on

the      radio.



The m a tc h was         s tarted on time,            and shortly after              the kick off,         I took

my seat.          At    this     point    I noticed there were                   several   people walking

along      the    perimeter        track.        I spoke       to one youth,           who showed me a

ticket all           he w ould say was           "She told me to               come along      here".      I was

unable      to a s c e r t a i n who      he was      referring        to, and escorted him from the

periraeW'         track        to the entrance at the              rear of the N or th Stand.                 I saw
                Tv
P C 234 8 H A N 9 Q N had also d et ained a y o ut h on the track and was also

esco rt ing       him off the           perimeter      track.



W he n    I returned to my\ p o s i t i o n a few minutes after                         I saw that       there

was      some    problem at t h e \ ^ p p i n g s         Ln t e r r a c e .      People were     climbing

over      the    perimeter        fence,     onto the        pitch,        and    it a pp e a r e d to be an

a ttempt        to invade        the    pitch.      The    centre      pen of the terraces              I could

                                                                                                      S2580

see was        full,    where as there was          room at    the front         of both the N o rt h

a nd Sout h      pens.     I heard some very broken messages                     over    the    radio     but

because of the           crowd noise and the very poor                  reception was          unable     to

make    out anything           that was    being said.        Beca us e of the si tu at io n and

the    possibility of further              crowd    problems       in the N o rt h Stand,         I

remained standing              facing    the North Stand,          as   did other       officers,        on

either side of me.              ETy^this t i W ,     the    crowd,      w h i c h had been      climbing

over    the     perimeter       fence otX^he Le'flpings Ln terrace,                had begun to

swell and was           now e ncroaching      onto the       playing a rea of the              pitch

a d ja ce nt    to the goal.        A number       of Police Officers            began ap pe ar in g

from various           points a ro u n d the ground,         and began making            their way

towards Leppings Ln terrace.                  I saw two officers who m               I cannot

identify        come down the       centre a isle        of the N or th Stand,           d ir ec tl y    in

front    of me.         They    climbed over       the    perimeter wall,         jumped on to the

track and began to              run towards    the L ep pings Ln terraces.                  A Liverpool

spectator        jumped onto       the track,       after    the two officers            had    left and

began shouting           "I want    his    number” .       He said that       one of the officers

had struck        him.     I did not see either of the officers                      strike anyone

whilst     jumping       down onto the track,            I persuaded the man to get                   back

into    the N o rt h Stand,        and grudgingly,          he did so.



I a gain       looked towards       the Leppings Ln terraces,                where      I saw several

hund re d spectators were               now on the       perimeter      track,    and    playing area,

there were        numerouhSsPolice Officers at the front                     of the terraces,             but

the    crowd was        such that^sl      could not see what was             happening.          There

were    still     people       climbing    over the       perimeter      fence,    and    I saw that

now Police Officers w e n                          ng them to       climb over.          People       were

^limbing        from the       rear <              ntral    pen,    into the West Stand,                and

The      crowd       in the N or th stand were becoming                   increasingly more

a gg ressive,           shouting abuse at myself and other                    officers    on the

perimeter           track and shortly after this we were                      reinforced by

a p p r o x i m a t e l y 20 other officers.               This a n t a g o n i s e d the supp or te rs    even

more and they were                 becoming more and more aggressive.



W he n    I a gain       looked towards              the Leppings Ln terrace,,         I saw that        some

of the      crowd were almost                to the half way           line on the     pitch.      The

players and officials                   had by this t i m k left the           playing area,        and

the                e now a p p r o x i m a t e l y    100 - 200 rtflice Officers         on the     playing

area,      the m aj or i t y of Police Officers                   being    o cc upied at the L ep pings

Ln terraces.               By this      time     I saw that       several    people who were

o b v i o us l y    injured were          being a ss i s t e d by s pectators and Police

Officers,           to the      perimeter        track.        It very soon became       obvious      to me

that      something was            ser io us ly wrong,          this   opinion was    reinforced whe n          I

saw people            being     carried across           the    pitch,    on stretchers and broken

billboards.              They were        being       carried towards       the S pion Hop end of the

g ro u nd where          they were        being a tt e n d e d to by St.       J o h n ’s Ambulancemen.



At this         p o i n t I left my         position andN^ent            towards   the L ep pi ng s Ln

terraces.             I was joined by several                  s pectators who were      carrying an

e mpty billboard.                 I went with them to the                perimeter   track   in front of

the L e pp i n g s Ln           terraces,        just    to the    rear of the goal.         The    scene

was a b s o l u t e l y      chaotic.        The      perimeter    fence    of the   central    pen

a d ja c en t      to the     eme rg en cy gate         had the mesh of the fence            pulled out

from the           bottom,      and was      curled upwards and outwards              towards      the    top

of the fence.                There were a large            number      of Police Officers ass is ti ng

people      out of the            central      p^n,     both over the top of the fence and                 from

the      e m er ge ncy gate.           f.\could s\e. what a pp ea r e d       to be a substantial

number of           people      lying at \|ie bottom of the                terrace   steps who were         not

                   moving,         I remember         having       the    i mpression that         they were         just a tangle

                   of .arms and         legs.        We    took the hoarding            boards     just     to the     right     of

                   the goals,         where     lying on the grass on their backs                           I saw

                   ap p ro x imately six or seven people.                Coats were covering the faces of

^lcX£Q             lying face         down,     on %Jie grass            he a pp ea re d to be       in the        recovery

                   position.          I exa mi ned him,            and found that          he was breathing,            his eyes

                   were     open,     but     I was       unable    to get any further             response         from him.

                   T o ge t h e r \ ^ t h   several       other     supporters,         he was     carefully         lifted onto

                   There     he was         carefully       placed on to the grass and                  I placed him          in the

                   recovery        position.          I a g ai n    checked him and found that he was                     still

                   bre at hi ng     but      I was    unable       to get any further             response.          I remained

                   w it h the man for           several       minutes       until      I was a p p r o a c h e d    by a man     in

                   his    early thirties who                stated he was a doctor.                  He made        quick a

                   e x a m i n a ti on of the man and stated he was                       not    in any     immediate     danger

                   a nd that      he w ould take            charge of him.



                   I then returned to the Lepping Ln end of the ground where                                          I saw a

                   P olice Officer who               I do not       know.        He was a tt em p t i n g    to lift a young

                   man,     in his early twenties,                          appeared to have a leg                 injury and was

                   having      d iffi cu lt y t^sJking.                      sted the officers              to the     lift    the

                   man,     and we between u s , >K<arr ied him towards                         the S pi on K op end of the

                   ground,       where we sat him down on the                       perimeter      track.          There were a

                   number of ambulancemen,                   and St John          *s amb ul an ce men,- who at that               time

                   were,     oc cupied with the              injured       persons.        Having a s c e r t a i n e d he was

                   not    in a ny danger          I returned towards                the L ep pings Ln end of the ground.

When     I reached the half way                 line,     I saw that      there were a line            of

Pol ic e Officers           extend et Ka c r oss the entire w i dt h of the                pitch.       I was

told by      Inspeftor W H IT E t o W n                 the    line of officers,        and took       up a
            —— .....             r ~ rN                            , — ..
position        near to the South Stand and                     players   tunnel.       Up until       this

time     I had not seen any senior officers                        either     on the    pitch of at the

L eppings Ln end.



Whilst at this             location,       I saw numerous Liverpool               supporters who were

in an extremely distr es se d state.                          Some were   so drunk they            could only

walk with assistance.                    Most   of the supporters were             shouting abuse at

us,    which under the             circumstances was understandable.



On several           occasions,       we had t o - J n t e r v e n e , when some N o t t i n g h a m Forest

supporters          seated     in the S outh StaY^i, shouted at                 the Liverpool

s upporters         to leave       the    pit&h.        The Liverpool       supporters were

responding          by t hr eatening the N b tt in gh am Forest                supporters and

a tt em p t i n g    to g e t i n t o t h e S o u t h    Stand.        CAT

I remained at this               locations for a considerable                 length of time and
                                          @ A - (t a a j o y

the effect          that the m atch h^ri been cancelled and the ground should be

e va cuated as soon as              possible.



Due    to the        circumstances,         it was some time before               the ground         cleared

and    I was        involved     in clearing        people       from the     pitch,    during this         time

I found two or three members                     of my serial,         whom    I had not seen since

just    before the          incident.



When     the ground had been completely                        cleared of supporters we were

instructed to standby                 in the North Stand            for a de — b r i e f i n g .    Prior to

that     he was      unable      to a l lo w anyone       into the     gymnasium.        I then

returned to the N orth S ta nd where I wa it ed w ith other officers.

Suring this time we were a d d r e s s e d by S u p e r i n t e n d e n t GREENWOOD.                    Also

w hilst at this           1 o cat ion      I saw Chief Supe r int&Hjdent N E S BI TT and Chief

S u p e r i n t e n d e n t MOLE.     It was    particularly         reassuring    to see Mr MOLE,

who    had been my D ivisional                C ommander      for a number      of years,       and had

only t ra ns ferred to B D iv i s i o n a p p r o x i m a t e l y       one week     prior      to the

F A Cu p Semi        final.



At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 5 . 3 0 p m   <1730)   all   officers who were        in the N orth

S ta nd were       instructed to stand down.                   I then took      no further       part     in

the    incident.



I have      been a Police            Officer    for eight a nd a half years.                During      that

time     I have a tt en d e d        the   vast m aj or it y of home         fixtures    of S h e f f i e l d

W ednesday.          During      this      period   I have wo rk ed at various           locations

w it h i n the ground,           and have a good working             knowledge     of the       layout of

the ground,          and the various           duties worked         both    inside and outside           the

ground.



For the       past three and a half years                  I have     been a C o m m u n i t y C onstable

and as such with very few exceptions                          have wo rk ed nearly all          the

football       matches w hich have             been held at the S h e f fi el d W e d n e s d a y

F ootball      Stadium.          My duties      for all       that   period has been on Serial                  1,

together w ith other C o m m u n i t y Constables.                    I wor ke d at various

locations around the                 perimeter      track,     but for the      past three       seasons         I

have     been a l l o ca te d       the same    position on the         perimeter       track     in front

of the N orth Stand,                at a point m id w a y along        the    length of the stand,

excl ud in g         the    present     incident,          there have       been 2 other S e m i - fi na ls

incidents and have                 been well           policed.      On the\ ^ a s t S emi-Final         w hi ch

involved Liverpool                supporters            I noticed that as on this occasion,                   a

large      percentage          of the         crowd,     in the North Stand,            were ob vi ou sl y

under      the       influence of         intoxicants,          w hich was      reflected      in their

a g gr e s s i v e    behaviour       generally,          which became worse when d ec isions                  on

the field of               play went against Liverpool.                    Fo ll ow in g   the Semi- Fi na l        in

1988 w hen the ground had been                          cleared,     there was         considerable      damage

to be seen to the seats                       in the N orth Stand.            In a dd i t i o n there were

numerous          discarded beer              cans and bottles           of spirits        found beneath

seats w hich had been vaca te d by Liverpool                               supporters.



F o l l ow i ng      the    incident,         w hen    I was ass is ti ng     injured fans,        the

at te mp ts       of all who were              present      on the    pitch       were very muc h h am pered

that were            being    passed,         during     the   incident were          v irtually unreadable,

t ransmi ssions.



My    initial   reaction following      the events were of shock and horrer                      that

such an    incident   could occur.       I have always        been of the o p i ni on that

the    policing arrangernents at H i l l s b o r o u g h were of the best of any-

ground w it h i n S outh Yorkshire,     having wo rk ed at all           of the grounds at

some    time.




 n my op in io n having witnessed?        the   behav               Liverpool,         fans on

this and other occasions,         iNbelieve     that    the x o n s u m p t i o n of

intoxicants     by s pectators a ttending       the m atch must         be considered to be

a major    factor w hen     investigating   the   cause of the disaster.

              Fu rther     to my        previous statement d ated the                         12th May     1989     120589    I have

              today been shown h #                Inspector LA YT ON of the West Midla nd s Police                              two

              p ho tographs       r eferenced DM1R 2 / 8 and SM1R1/117.

              1 am shown on both                 p hotographs       kneeling            o v e r a person who          I had f o u n d

              lying      in the     recovery           position at           the Leppings Lane End of the                    pitch.

              He had a sort of blouson type jacket                                 under      his head.

              I am shown         in the      photographs            in the         process      of feeling         for a pulse          in

              his      caratoid a rt er y         in his       neck.

              His eyes were             open and he was b r e a t h i n g , a lt h o u g h very shallowly.                         He

              had a slight          pulse        but    I could get           no response           from him.

              Wi t hi n a m at te r       of a few minutes                  some    supporters        came along witj* a

              hoarding       and together with them 1 placed this man on the hoarding                                             in

              the      recovery     position.
                                     v                                                                  P.AGt
                                     'j                                                                 S2380A

We then took him down to the Spion Kop end of the                                 pitch and       placed him

down on the      grass.

Once    I got to the        other    end    I a g ai n tried to get a response                    from hirn

by talking      to him but again got              no   response,     a lt ho ug h he was           still

breathing.                           »

The    supporters went        back    up the Leppings Lane             end with the              hoarding

and then a man        came along who          identified himself              to me as       being a

doctor.      This man was         in his early thirties,             dressed         casually         in a

jumper and jeans.

The    doctor   had a look at him and said that                   he was          okay.     In view of

the fact     that    he a s s u r e d me that      he would     be alright           I decided that           I

could do more good           by going       back up to the Leppings Lane                    end so at

that    stage   I left      the   person on the grass,            still       in the       recovery

position.I      then a ss i s t e d to      carry another       injured           person from the

L e ppings Lane      end to the S pion Kop             end with another             policeman.           He was

placed    in a line to be looked at                by St Johns ambulance men,                    as     per my

previous     statement.

I have    been shown another              p hotograph by Inspector LA YT ON w h i c h                   is

numbered 63 of a deceased                 person Ri ch rd J4DNES.         F rom the         picture
                                                ■                             *
i de nt i f i cat ion 1 cannot       be    100% sure     but   I do l y n .       feel    that    the    person

I helped to      carry on the hoarding and                left at the S p io n Kop end jjs

that    person R i c h a r d JONES.

I have m arked       on a plan the          two   positions where         I first          found that

person and where         I even tu al ly      left him.        These are ap pr ox im at e and are

m a r k e d A & B.    The    plan    is ma rk ed EJS1.

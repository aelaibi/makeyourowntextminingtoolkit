          STATEMENT OF

           - RE HILLSBOROUGH ON SATURDAY 15 APRIL 1989


          We      ieft   tl                         Iat 9.00 am picking up at
                              and set off for Hillsborough at 9.30 am.

          We travelled along the M56 - through Stockport and over the Wood Head pass
          into Sheffield.   Approximately 3/4 miles outside Sheffield we came to a
          police road block.   The coach was searched, about 1 mile further up the
          road the coach was stopped again but after consultations we were allowed
          through that road block, other coaches were stopped.

           Once in Sheffield we were directed to a parking area outside the
           ,                    I this was at 11.30 and the surrounding area was already
           packed with coaches and supporters.              On leaving the coach we decided that
           town was too busy and to get a bus out of town to somewhere a bit quieter.
           We caught a bus outside the Railway Hotel and asked the driver to take us
           away from the town, he said to get off whenever we wanted and eventually ve
           got Uoff
                  l l outside
                      U U I . O   a pub

                                                  —   j
                                                      |               ~ The--------
                                                                              pub was closed and
            there was a police transit van in the car park,            we stood outside for about
            10 minutes and eventually the landlady popped her head around a side door
            and asked how many of us there were.               We told her that there were oaly
            three of us and she said that if we could just walk around without the
            police seeing us we were quite welcome to go in for a drink. We got into
            the pub about 12.00 pm, there were approximately four other people inside,
            we had a drink and were talking to the landlady and she told us that the
            police had made them shut down, even though they did not want to and that
            was why the police transit van was on the car             park. We stayed in the pub
            until roughly 2.00 pm and we asked the landlady whether she would ring us
            for a taxi for 2.30 pm to the ground.               She rang a taxi which arrived at
           •2.15 pm, the taxi driver saying that the roads were so busy that we would
            be better off leaving early.              We had spent all of the dinner hour in the
            pub, watching the television and mixing with the locals.                The locals came
            in just after us and apart from the locals there were about four other
             football fans. The doors to the pub were still locked.

            We got the taxi down to the ground, the driver was telling us how busy the
            roads were and he said it would probably take us 3/4 hour to get there. As
            it was it only took about 10 minutes, he said he could not believe how the
            roads were because on his way up it had been just one long traffic jam and
            we had been lucky to miss the traffic.

             We arrived at the            ground at about 2.30 pm and entered the ground quite
             easily, we had to           queue but it took us about five minutes to get in. Out
             of the three of us          two were entering into the North Stand and the other lad
             was going into the          Lepping Lane standing area.

             When we entered we bought a programme and went round to find our seats. We
             were sat in the North Stand but at the Spion Kop end of the North Stand.
             On taking our seats we commented on the area behind the goal at the Lepping
             Lane end being full yet the corner of the stand towards the North Stand -was
             almost empty. We waited for the match to kick off which started on time at
             3.00 pm, we were commenting on the area still being packed even though the
             corner was empty and that the Spion Kop was quite full but that the front
             area was still very empty.    After about five minutes we saw people trying
              to climb over the fence and police officers pushing them back down into the
              stand. Eventually some appeared on the touch line behind the goal but the

           police made them sit down and threw some of them back into the same end of
           Iho North Stand corner.   Just after this quite a few people spilled over
           the fence and eventually some fans ran onto the pitch trying to get the
           attention of t T police* or referee.    The police obviously ran onto the
           pitch at which time the players were taken off the pitch.

           We were still in the stands and we saw fans trying to rip up barriers to
           u se as stretchers and they »ere carrying the ■stretchers' uj, to the: corner
           of the North Stand and the Spion Kop.      At first it was           y    ®
           hearted, the fans were sat up and did not seem to badly injured and all the
           Liverpool fans were clapping them and the Forest fans were booing because
           they ‘thought it was a pitch invasion.     Steve who was with me commented
            after a couple more minutes that one of the bodies on the stretchers^ had a
            coat over his head.   At this stage the fans were still trying to rip the
            advertising boardings up but many were struggling against the police to do
            this, the police seemed to be arresting some of them.    A few more people
            came out with coats over their heads at which time it became obvious that
            it was more serious and I told Steve that I was going down on the pitch to
             see if I could do anything.

            We were in the top of the North Stand so I ran down the Stand to the exits
            which went through to the back of the Stand.     At the back of the Stana
            there were four stewards at the exit gates who I asked how it was possible
            to get onto the pitch.   The stewards did not seem to know how to get onto
            the pitch and just said, "It’s one of the tunnels down there, you’ll have
             to go and look."

             Eventually I went through a tunnel, climbed a fence down to the lower
             regions of the North Stand and down to the touch line.        By this time the
             touch line had been surrounded by police stopping fans onto the pitch ana
             when I climbed over the fence the police tried to throw me back into the
             stand, I explained to them that I had St John's Ambulance training ana that
             I was going down to help.     They still would not allow me on the pitch and
             it was only by running through them and towards the Spion Kop that I was
             able to get through.     When I got to the Spion Kop there was half a dozen,
             perhaps a dozen bodies laid out and ordinary fans were trying to give them
              the kiss of life whilst many police officers just stood around.        By this
              time the police seemed to have more of an idea about what was happening and
              some of them were helping the fans to rip down the advertising hoardings.
              I assisted in giving a fan the kiss of life, he was about 20 years old,
             wasn't sure whether I was doing the right thing but the police were just
              milling around, I do n’t think I saw one policeman attempting resuscitation.
              There were a few ambulance men there and they seemed to be trying to
              organise things.    The person I tried to bring round wasn’t responding and
              a n ambulance man cameover, took his pulse and said, “H e ’s dead, move aLong
              to the next one," which we did.      There were several other fans helping me,
              non of whom I knew.        We went to the next person, the ambulance man was
              giving mouth to mouth    and I was pumping his chest.

               Another body was laid out at the side of us at this time, about 30 years
               old and two lads lay above him just crying his eyes out.        He was not
               receiving any medical attention and the two lads were    trying to pull the
               ambulance man     who was working with me, just trying to get him to helpthe
               lad   (who 1 presumed was the brother although I didn’t know that) but the
               ambulance man     said, "He’s already dead, it’s too late."We also failed in
               bringing this fan round and on surveying the area I decided that perhaps I

            could do      more at the other end of the ground in the actual Leppings Lane
            end.   I      picked up a stretcher with another fan and we ran down to the
            Leppings      Lane end, having to force our way through the police who were now
            standing      all across the half way line and up the touch line.

            On arriving at the Leppings Lane end there were stretchers spread all over
            the pitch.    Fans were still being pulled out and surveying the area I
            decided that there was not much I could do there and to go back to where I
            had come from.    I went up to the half way line and again the police would
            not let me through.   I explained to them that I had already been helping at
            the Spion Kop end and I had medical training at which point I was told that
            if I wanted to go up that end I would have to walk round the pitch. Again
            I ignored this and just charged through the police ranks and up to the
            Spion Kop corner.     At this stage there was somebody who said he was a
            doctor, he had blood streaming from his forehead.   I asked him if there was
            anything that I could do.    He told me to go around the back of the North
             Stand and see if it was possible to do anything there.

             On getting    around  there  I found more     bodies, more   people giving
             resuscitation and I found a young lad who was lying in the corner having
             difficulty breathing.   Again there were police officers wandering around,
             by this time ambulances had started to arrive and firemen had appeared on
             the scene.   I tried to calm the young lad down and lay him out.   Although
             not giving him mouth to mouth pumped his chest trying to get air into his
             lungs.     He appeared to recover and regain consciousness.         He was
             complaining of a sore leg which he was unable to move and a sore arm which
             was obviously badly bruised if not broken.   At this stage an ambulance man
             came over to examine him and asked me to stay with him and check his pulse.
             The lad did not seem to sure where he was or what was happening to him and
             kept drifting in and out of consciousness.    At one time he was struggling
             to breathe and a fireman said sit him up and cradle him from behind which
             would help him to breathe. The fireman also gave him oxygen.

              At this stage I saw two police officers standing giving an interview to the
              press.   People were still being resuscitated but the police officers seemed
              totally oblivious to the fact.    I shouted at them, at which I was told the
              press have a job to do and to shut up.     Several people traded insults with
              them, I attempted to chase the press away but was stopped by a fireman who
              although agreed with me told me that I was better off assisting the
              injured.

              An ambulance man came over and checked the lad I was with, examined his arm
              and leg and asked me and a police officer if we could carry him into an
              hospital.   It was a temporary hospital inside the sports hall but when we
              entered it was obvious it was also a mortuary as there were three or four
              lines of bodies there with their faces covered by coats. A police officer
              told me that there were about 50 bodies.     The lad seemed to go into shock
              when he saw this, neither of us were expecting it and once in he again had
              to be given oxygen. A doctor came over and I helped him to put a drip into
              the lad’s arm and one of the St John’s Ambulance and myself put a split
              onto his arm to keep it straight. By this time the lad was very distressed
              so I managed to get his name and address and give it to a police officer.
              Eventually a stretcher came, the police officer and I lifted the lad onto
              the stretcher and wheeled him out to an ambulance.     There were already two
               people on stretchers in the ambulance and the lad w h o ’s name was        ~
              had to be laid in the middle.      The officer said that I should go to the
               hospital with him but by the time it came to go the ambulance was too full
               and the driver asked me not to go.

           Once the ambulance had gone I went back to see if I could help but by this
           time the injured appeared to be in the hospital and there was no signs of
           anybody lying outside who needed assistance so I made my way back to the
           coach.

           I arrived back at the coach at about 4.45 pm.    I remember the results were
           just starting to come     through on the radio and the radio reported that
           possibly 7 people had     died at Hillsborough.   I was one of the first to
           arrive back at the coach. The rest of the fans appeared in dribs and drabs
           between 4.45 pm and 5.30 pm. When we eventually found that we had a full
           coach we left the parking area and set off back for home. The news on the
           radio was still that     possibly7 fans had died and as many people were
           distressed we decidedto keep it quiet that I    had seen the mortuary and had
           been told by a police officer that there were possibly 50 people dead. We
           decided that the best thing we could do was to find a telephone and
           eventually stopped in Stalybridge, Thameside just outside Manchester and
            'phoned home. At this stage we were told that there were at least 90 dead
           but let it be known that we were all alright.

           We left Stalybridge at something like 7.45 pm and arrived back in
           about an hour later - 8.45 pm.

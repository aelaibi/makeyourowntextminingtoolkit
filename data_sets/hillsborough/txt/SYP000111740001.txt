            Dur in g     duty on R a w s on Spring Road,                 it was     evident that a large                  number

                  Notts.     Forest       fans     had been       consuming alcohol                eh route to

            Sheffield.           Many     fans were        d isposing       consumed         cans of alcohol             and of

            the    ones     I -spoke to          it was    evident       that .they were            under   t he    i n f l ue nce

            of alcohol.           Owing      to    the distance          from the        ground,, the number              of

            fans    involved,           and the dep le ti on           in m an po we r      that w ou ld have .resulted

A rr i v e d   into ground at           *Spio-n K o p * end.          There was obvious           disruption,

at the Liverpool- s upport ers                  end —      'West S t a n d ’ .      On nearitig" the

stands-I        noti ce d an officer a p p a r e n t l y            s truggling w ith a middle aged '

gent. - B e l i e vi n g      that     the officer was a tt em p ti n g             to effect an

arrest,          1 went      to assist        him.       I took     hold of the man's           right arm

and the        other    officer        (not known to me)             told me that        "It was alright,

he'd just had a rough time                     coming out         of there"        (refering      to the

m id d l e - a g e d man and the West Stand).                     I asked     if    the officer         was

alright and           I then     rejoined PC 660 Dexter.                    Still    thinking         that    it

was a ’ pitch           invasion',        We a p pr o a c h e d the West Stand.                 1 saw

officers         climbing       onto    the    fence,       but   I could not make          out what          they

were     doing..        1 was    i r n ^ r u c t e d ^ b y a S er geant     (not known to me)            t^orm

                         s the       pitch.     I saw a L iverpool            supporter         run    the tuII

length of the            pitch and stand             in the goal       m outh at the        'Spion Kop*

end,     making       SV*    sign     gesture    to the Notts.            Forest     supporters.

Myself and PC Dexter and other                           officers    formed a passive            cordon

across         the   pitch.      At tfa^^yLsjrie I had not s e e n a n y bodies,                      or other

persons         other    than    'walking wounded'.

It was only w hen s tretch ers                  passed me,          carrying       corpses,      that    I

O n r e a lising        this,    and after       having       suf fe rr ed    considerable            verbal

abuse      from d i st r e s s e d and i n t o xi c at e d Liverpool               supporters,         I deci de d

thjat I was          serving     no useful       purpose          in my position at, that time.

B y the time we              reached the           perimeter          fence,       people were, f il tering out

of the gates.                Oar       concern was         to the N or th          side of« the     West Stand.

I did not see any                  corpses       carried from that                 side of the      stand.                 ,
                                                                                                                           v

I a t t e m p te d to        clear       the ground         in order         to    give afxeSs      to the

A m b u l a n c e Service,             who    had not a r ri v e d until            that time.

Man y fans were              eager       to help but were              not    sure what to do.             Man y were

w a n de r i n g     aimlessly,          and others were              looking for          lost    relatives        and

fri e n d s .

A   large       number       of the w o od en a d v e r t i s i n g          boards     had been      collected by

the    fans and they were                     strewed a r o u nd the -goal mouth area.

I d i r e c t e d a number              of    the fans      to    clear      them out of the way,              to

place      them near          the       goals,     and then to             stand to one side          to await a

call     for a s s is t an c e          from us,       should we need             it,   at the      same    time,

t hanking          them for        their       help,    a l re ad y    given.

A m b u l a n c es    star te d        to arrive.

I can remember a fight                        starting      in the        corner of the. S ou th / We s t

Stands,         apparently             between memb er s          of the Liverpool             supporters.             I

ran towards            this,       but       before    I a r ri v ed the          situation       had been

c ontr o l le d       by other          officers       present.

At no time,/           did    I have          contact w ith        corpses.

E ve n at the          time       of being asked            by Chief S up er in t en d en t          Nesbit       to

form- a cordon,              I had no          idea of the extent                 of the    injuries/

fatalities,            or the          reasons     behind        them.       I had seen about            six   corpses

being      carried,          I had not          seen man y        badly      injured       persons,      the   ones        I

had seen a p p e a r e d           to'-fae d is tr es se d        rather      than phys ic al ly         injured.

1 felt       ill-informed,               unable       to get      involved         because    of the mass           of

               potential         for a full         scale     riot was      clearly       evident*.

A statement has been taken from                   rho attended the semi
finals at Hillsborough in both 1988 and 1989 as a supporter of Liverpool.

           is employed by                        within the
                     ^nd his duties include responsibility for licensing both
                                   stadiums under the Safety at Sports
Grounds at 1975.

The statement provides a description of events as would be expected from a
normal spectator seated in the North Stand from pages 1 to 5. The remaining
7 pages of his statement give his professional perception of the events as
they developed on the Lepping’s Lane terraces and conclude with a number of
recommendations/criteria for safety at Sports Grounds with obvious reference
to Hillsborough.

Not included in the statement but a fact which should be brought to the
attention of Counsel for The Inquiry is that in
           ]supplied copies of the Safety Certificates in respect of both
        ind                to Sheffield City Council.

Grounds over a number of years and in 1988 spoke at a World Health
Organisation Seminar.  It is understood that on at least one occasion the
Chairman of the meeting was the Head of Department within Sheffield City
Council with responsibility for licensing Sports Grounds.

Following the HEYSEL STADIUM football disaster              fas commissioned by
________________________ to prepare a report. It is understood that at this
stage no formal submission has been made to Lord Justice Taylor*s Inquiry by
                         however it is known that              statement has
been made with the full approval of t h e L e a d e r .

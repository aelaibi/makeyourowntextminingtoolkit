GORDON SYKES



Police Inspector

Ecclesfield Police Station



I am a Police Inspector stationed at Ecclesfield Police Station.

On   Saturday    15    April     1989,    I was engaged   on   duties    at Hillsborough

Football   Ground       in connection      with   the Liverpool       v Nottingham Forest

F.A. Cup Semi-Final.

On this day,      I paraded for duty at Ecclesfield Police Station at 9am.

Together   with       other    officers   I was   then    transported     to Hillsborough

Football Ground for a briefing at 10am.                This briefing was conducted by

Chief   Superintendent           Duckenfield who         outlined     the overall   Police

strategy   for    the    day     and   particularly    said    that   the event would      be

policed in a firm but            fair way and         thatsafety to the public would be

paramount.

Superintendent Murray then outlined the emergency evacuation procedures

and that he would be overall ground commander.

My specific duties on this day was Commander of Sub Sector 8, 9 was also

assisted by Inspector Purdy.              These duties included overall supervision

of serials 16, 17, 18 and 19.

Serial 16 - supervised by PS 1288 Payne were responsible for Leppings

Lane Turnstiles A - G.

Serial 17 - supervised by PS 468 Whitlam were responsible for Leppings

Lane Turnstiles 1 to 8.
                                     -   2    -




Serial      18 - supervised by PS 758 Morgan were responsible for Leppings

Lane Turnstiles 9 to 16.

Serial      19    ~   supervised         by       PS 323   Proctor were       to be     used       as   coach

reception and supervise the fans entering the ground.

After    the      main    briefing       I instructed all            these    serials       that I would

personally brief them at 11am behind the West Stand.

This    I   did,      and    went    through the           match    order    as   to    their      specific

duties.          I instructed serials 16, 17 and 18 that they would be at the

turnstiles        to prevent unlawful access to the ground and ensure queues

would be formed.

I told serial 19 they had a virtual roving commission as per the match

order and to generally assist wherever they were needed.                                     I also told

all the serials           to expect a high incidence of people to be drunk, and

although       our    policy is not to allow this,                    on this particular            day we

would have to relax the rules a little and only arrest people who were

extremely         drunk     and   couldn't          look   after     themselves        or   were    causing

trouble.

I gave this instruction as I know from past experience that on F.A. Cup

Semi-Final day, large numbers of fans come to the ground who have been

drinking to excess and to start arresting them all would only drain any

manpower.

I also told the serials that if the crush at the turnstiles got so bad I

would use horses to relieve the pressure.

On this day my serials and myself were under the supervision of Section

Commander         Chief     Inspector         Creaser      and     under    the   overall      command     of
                                -    3   -




Superintendent Greenwood the inside Ground Commander.

After I had briefed the men they all then went to their relevant posts.

I had been issued with a personal radio as had all the serial sergeants.

After my briefing    to the serials          I immediately went    outside   Leppings

Lane Turnstiles into the enclosure there.            This would be shortly after

11am and even at that time fans were hanging about outside.                  Some had

tickets and some were asking me if I knew where they could purchase one.

Fans were also approaching the ground carrying cans of beer, bottles of

beer and bottles of spirit.         Any fans who approached the ground carrying

such items of alcohol had it taken from them and put in the large bins

provided for that purpose.

From this time on the crowd started to swell.           Not all wanted to go into

the ground or had tickets to get in and were hanging about outside and

on   roads   and    pavements       leading     to   Leppings     Lane   Turnstiles.

Periodically I sent officers to urge these people into the ground or to

move on those who hadn't a ticket.             Mounted Officers also assisted in

this task.

At one stage I received a radio message that ticket touts were operating

in Leppings Lane.    In consequence of this I asked nearby CID officers to

investigate a large crowd who are congregating about two hundred yards

along Leppings Lane towards Penistone Road.             Shortly after I was told

that ticket touts were operating there and were pointed out to me.

I caused PC 2902 Roberts to arrest the two touts concerned for causing

an obstruction to the footpath.

The build up of the crowd continued and fans still arrived who had no
                                                  _   4   _




ticket       and     some     who    had     obviously              been    drinking.      Whilst     I saw no

fighting        I    can     best     describe            these      fans    as   being   stupid      drunk     and

wouldn't listen to advice and instructions.                                   By 2pm the build up of the

fans was such that there was pushing and shoving at the turnstiles and a

build up occurred of fans trying to get into the ground.

It was about this time that I saw some fans climbing over the wall above

Gate     'B'    to     gain    access        to       the      ground.       I tried      to    contact      ground

control        by    radio     but    was     getting           no response.            Other    officers      were

telling me that the radios were down.

In view of this I gained access to the ground through Gate 'C' to inform

the    officers        inside       the    ground           that people were           climbing over.          The

officers inside were already aware and were ejecting the fans through

Gate 'C '.

Whilst inside I heard shouts from the turnstile operator nearest to Gate

'C'    that         fans    were     getting           in      by    not     paying.       Those      fans    were

immediately held by Police Officers and ejected through Gate 'C'.                                             I saw

some    of     those        fans     climb    over            the   turnstile     barrier       and   some    were

crawling underneath, through the legs of people who had tickets.

I then went back outside through Gate                                 'C' , as I did so I was asked by

the gatemen on this                 gate for advice.                   They informed me that stewards

from Liverpool Football                   Club were             seeking admission         to the      ground by

showing their stewards passes.                            Whilst the Sheffield Wednesday stewards

had allowed some access                   to the ground they believed the stewards were

then collecting the passes and taking them outside for other people to

use.     I told the stewards that if this was the case then no more persons
should be allowed access to the ground by showing a stewards pass.

At this time there was about 30 people outside Gate 'C 1 with                              stewards

passes.        Some of these had children with them and were trying to gain

admission.       They were all refused on my advice.

I then made      my way back towards the roadway at Leppings Lane.                         As I did

so fans were streaming through an open perimeter gateway towards Gate

'C' and the      turnstiles there.             This in effect caused the orderly queues

to disperse      as people started to push and shove who hadn't queued.

I caused this gate to be closed to prevent this happening.                           I also asked

the    mounted    section    to    put     a    cordon     of   horses   across      the   rows   of

spectators to prevent any further people approaching the turnstiles in

order to prevent crushing.

This had the effect of slowing down the crush at the turnstiles.                             I then

went   further towards Leppings Lane roadway and I could see that fans

were   converging      on   the   ground       in vast      numbers.     Many   of    these    were

carrying alcohol and many were drunk, I was shouting to them not to push

but they were taking no notice.                     They appeared to have one purpose and

that was to get into the ground.

Many fans were milling            about outside with no tickets and                 were shouting

if anyone had any spare           tickets.

I could see that the fans converging on the ground were of such a number

that    they    were   spilling     over       on    to   the   road   and   into    the   path   of

vehicles.       I tried to get through on the radio to ask for Leppings Lane

to be closed to vehicular traffic.                    I was receiving no response.            I was

then joined by Superintendent Marshall and I asked him to get the road
                                    -    6   -                                                   <lol)

closed.    He agreed with me that it should and got through on his radio.

Vehicles eventually stopped coming along Leppings Lane.

I have worked in Leppings Lane at football matches for the last eight

years and the rush of spectators at this time was so bad that this was

the first time I have known the road closed to traffic before a match.

This would have been at about 2.30pm.

People were still        coming     to me asking for directions into the ground

with children and only the adult had a ticket.

Shortly after this I saw Inspector Bennett on the wall above Gate                              'B'

helping    people    over    the wall.           I was    still    trying to prevent people

pushing    into    the   crowd    from       the   back   but     they   were   not   taking   any

notice.

I have no actual timing of the next event but would estimate it to be

2.50pm and then I saw Gate 'A' open wide.                   People were streaming through

it and it was obvious         tickets were not being checked.                    People gaining

access through this gate would gain entrance to the North Stand.

I pushed through the crowd to Gate                  'A' and saw PS Higgins and some of

his men.    He told me he had opened the gate as people were in danger of

being killed by the crush.

We then managed to partly close the gates and were checking tickets as

people    came    through.       This    caused the crowd outside               to thin to safe

numbers and we then shut the gate completely.                      It was at this stage that

the call went up for all officers to go inside the ground.

I cannot remember if I heard it on the radio or someone told me.

I made my way through Gate              'C' and went towards the Police Control Box.
I climbed the steps to see what was going on.                            I could see that a large

number of people were on the field and that Police Officers were helping

other    people    over    the       perimeter     fence.            I could also see          that people

were pushing from behind as they couldn't                         see what was happening.

I decided       to go to       the    tunnel   under      the West Stand            that   leads to the

Leppings Lane Terraces.               As I did so I told other officers in that area

to assist in moving people from the back of the terraces and out                                    of the

ground.        This was to enable officers to reach the                        people trapped at the

front and allow people to be rescued.

Some of these fans not knowing what had happened were at first reluctant

to believe but we eventually managed to clear a way through.

I then saw some officers struggling to carry a young girl (teenager) who

was unconscious and had stopped breathing.                           I grabbed hold of her and we

carried    her     back    up    the     terraces        and    through       the     tunnel    into      the

enclosure behind the West Stand.

Whilst    we    were    carrying       her    up   the    terracing      her    tee-shirt       had    been

pulled    up     over    her    head     in    the    crush       exposing      her    breasts      and     I

distinctively heard someone shout "throw her up here I'll fuck her".                                        I

have no    idea who       shouted this and I didn't see the person who shouted

it.

When we    got    into    the    enclosure         I gave      the    young    girl    mouth     to mouth

resuscitation and got her breathing                      again.       I was assisted by a young

policewoman, I do not know her or where she is stationed.

When I had brought the young woman round I then saw that the enclosure

was   filling     with    bodies       and    injured     people.        I knew        that    we   had    to
evacuate      them   from     the    enclosure      in    order     that       they    could     receive

treatment.

I organised the officers who were present to clear the crowd and form a

way through to Gate 'C' in order that we could use the sterile area down

the side       of the ground.

This we did and         all other bodies          and casualties brought out of that side

of the ground were brought to this area.

Ambulances were         then brought       from Leppings Lane            into the sterile area,

collected      casualties      and   carried       on    down     the    sterile       area    past    the

players entrance etc.

At first I decided which casualties should go into the ambulance but I

was    then    joined    by   a   Doctor    of Asian       appearance          who    after     treating

people decided in his professional opinion who should go to hospital.

I also arranged for one of the Police transits to take people who were

not seriously injured.

I cannot      say with any authority how many                   people     received treatment at

this end of the ground but it was quite substantial.

Eventually when all the injured were taken away I was left with ten dead

people in the sterile area.              I arranged for the officers who had brought

out    the     bodies to      stay with     the    body    and    detailed       other officers        to

assist.         I was later joined by Inspector Webster who                           was part of     the

body       identification         team   who      then    took      over       the     role     of    body

indentifications        and    removal     of     the    bodies    to    the    ground        gymnasium.

When they were all removed I went back to the Police Control at the back

of the North Stand and liaised with other senior officers.

At    no   time when I went through the tunnel at the back of Lepping Lane

did I see any bodies in ttte tunnel, all the bodies were brought from the

front of the pens and back up the terracing.

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY

Lord Justice Taylor has asked me to thank you for your letter of
26 September.

In paragraph 3 of your letter, you say that you are primarily
concerned to follow up the questions Lord Justice Taylor will be
dealing with in his report on the contribution which crowd
disorder made to the disaster. Lord Justice Taylor has now
reported on the events at Hillsborough on 15 April. He would not
think it helpful to seek to discuss further the contribution
which crowd disorder made on that day.  If, however, you had any
general points to make about crowd disorder at sporting events,
which would be helpful to him in relation to Part II of his
inquiry, he would be happy to receive them in writing.

So far as any discussions are concerned, Lord Justice Taylor is
not planning to have discussions with individual Members of
Parliament. He does intend, however, to invite the All Party
Football Committee to meet him in due course.

I hope this clarifies the position. We look forward to receiving
anything you would like to let us have in writing.  If you would
find it helpful to discuss this letter, please telephone me at
the number above.

Secretary to the Hillsborough
  Stadium Disaster Inquiry
Home Office
50 Queen Anne's Gate
LONDON SWlH 9AT



Dear Mr. Whalley

Thank you for your letter of 5th September following
my request for a short meeting with Lord Justice Taylor.

With the passage of time, I think it would be more
useful if it might be possible for me to meet him for
half an hour in London prior to the preparation of the
final Report.

I am primarily concerned to follow up the questions
you will be dealing with in the Report on the contribution
which crowd disorder made to the disaster.    It would be
completely off the record and only as the Member of
Parliament covering the Hillsborough Stadium.

Could you let me know whether you feel this might
be possible and if so, an idea of dates which would
suit Lord Justice Taylor and I will fit in.

Yours sincerely




DAVID BLUNKETT
MP FOR SHEFFIELD BRIGHTSIDE

Dear Lord Justice Taylor

INTERIM REPORT ON THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

I realise how extremely busy you must be but I wondered
whether there might be a possibility of our having a
short meeting to briefly discuss your findings.

I shall be in London on Monday, 11th Ge^ L e m b e r , and
again on Wednesday, 27th September, and if you were
able to see me on either of those dates, I should be
grateful.

Failing that, the House resumes on 17th October when
I will be in London for most of the week.

I should be grateful if you would get in touch with
my secretary, either in Sheffield or in London, to
make the necessary arrangements.

Yours sincerely




DAVID BLUNKETT
MP FOR SHEFFIELD BRIGHTSIDE

Dear Peter

Hillsborough private prosecution

I am sorry that some weeks have passed since the very satisfactory conclusion of the trial,
but you can probably imagine I needed to have a short break and it has taken some time to
get down to the housekeeping matters.

Nonetheless, I very much wanted to write to you to record our thanks for all the support
provided by the PSA over the last few years but most specifically during the currency of the
trial.

From the legal perspective the funding minefield has been a very difficult additional burden
to carry, and your willingness to contribute to the limit of your resources was a tremendous
boost to David and very much appreciated.

In terms of the hearing itself, the personal support provided by members of the PSA, was
also heartfelt from everybody's perspective. You will know that HFSG had large numerical
support throughout.the case, and if the case were decided on pure numbers then we would
be in some difficulty. I know both Defendants felt rather exposed and it was difficult for
them and their families because of this. The attendance of a number of your members to
provide moral support cannot be valued.

Further, from a personal point of view can I thank                  your press liaison officer,
for all that she contributed, particularly in the last week as we awaited the verdict On the
day when the Judge decided that David would not face a retrial, I faced more professional
pressure than I have in my career and the tasks taken on by                    nd her advice
specifically in dealing with the press conference were priceless in terms of getting me
through the day.

Continued

I am also very pleased that the outcome hopefully gives a boost to police officers
everywhere, but also to those organisations who have taken the trouble to stand up and fight
for the interests of their members such as yours. You can imagine that running a Defence
like this is a team effort, and the input from organisations such as yourself should not be
underestimated in putting us in a position where we could do the best possible job, and as
luck would have it, achieve the right result. For all of that may I say “thank you” both on
David’s behalf and on behalf of all the legal team.

I should mention however that there is one postscript from a legal point of view that we are
attending to. You may recall that we made an application before the trial Judge in January
this year to have the trial stayed because of abuse of process, specifically relating to a
breach of the European Convention of Human Rights in that the trial had not been brought
within k‘a reasonable time”. The Judge side-stepped this issue and declined to decide the
point. Leading Counsel has advised that this matter ought to be taken to the European
Court of Human. Rights, and David has instructed us to do this. This is largely a paper
exercise, argued by the lawyers and David will not be required to attend. The legal costs of
this exercise are somewhere between £10,000 and £20,000, and as first port of call I have
written to the South Yorkshire Police Authority to ask them to consider indemnifying David
tor any costs incurred. We do feel very strongly about the merits of this application and it
certainly has widespread potential implications for criminal prosecutions in this country.

It may well be that the Police Authority do not feel that this is an application they can
support, for a variety of reasons, and I mention it now just in case it is something that the
PSA may be able to support, given your kind offers in the past and the fact that we were
able to deal with previous applications without having to make use of those offers. To
assist in your consideration I enclose herewith a copy of my letter to the SYPA and will
naturally keep you advised of developments.

Once again many thanks for all your help along the way, and I hope in some professional or
other context our paths will cross in the near future so that I can reiterate those thanks face
to face.

With best wishes

Yours sincerely




SIMON EASTWOOD

Dear Bill

Hillsborough private prosecution

Following the very satisfactory outcome to the Hillsborough trial, we have liaised with Mr
William Clegg QC, Senior Counsel for David Duckenfield, in regard to one particular
aspect of the criminal proceedings which the Authority will be aware has caused
considerable concern.

This relates to the application made in January 2000 before the trial Judge Mr Justice
Hooper, that the trial be stayed on the basis of a breach of the European Convention of
•Human Rights, to the extent that the .prosecution had not been brought “within a reasonable
 time". You may recall that the trfal Judge declined to deal with this issue, leaving it to
 resolution at any appeal that might take place, as the Human Rights Act has yet to come into
 force.

Subsequent to the full trial, Counsel has advised that it would be appropriate for David
Duckenfield to make an application to the European Court of Human Rights on this point,
and he has provided a written advice dated 31 July 2000 to this effect, a copy o f which I
enclose for the attention of yourself and the Authority.

 We are confirming instructions from David Duckenfield to make the necessary application,
 and as there are time limits, the documentation is presently being attended to and any
 application to be made will be filed at the earliest opportunity.

 1 raise this matter with you to ask that the Authority formally consider indemnifying Mr
 Duckenfield against the (relatively) modest cost that would be incurred in making this
 application. I refer you to the comments made in Counsel’s advice, and would wish to
 highlight the importance of this aspect of criminal law and that success before the European
 Court further reinforces the appropriateness of the Authority’s s u p p o rt^ 4regard to the

Continued

Interlocutory Application made earlier this year, notwithstanding the fact that the Judge
refused to stay the proceedings.

In regard to costs, it is anticipated that including all expenses these will be in the region
£10,000-£20,000 and that once the initial documentation is lodged, there will be a time
delay of approximately 1 year before the case will be argued in Strasbourg. It will not be
necessary for David Duckenfield to be personally involved in giving evidence, as the matter
is largely dealt with on the papers by way of legal argument.

I look forward to hearing from you as to the Authority’s consideration of this matter, and
naturally in the event that you require any further information or assistance in this regard
please do not hesitate to contact me.

Yours sincerely




 IMON EASTWOOD

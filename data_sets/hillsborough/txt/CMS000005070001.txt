                          The first point that I feel I should make is a general one.
                         The Taylor recommendations are made on grounds of safety.
                         They will undoubtedly cause difficulties in sc-ne cases and
                         those difficulties are likely to be as great for particular
                         clubs         south          of the border as                  in Scotland.             If we       are to
                         depart from the Taylor recommendations it will, in my view,
                         need to be a very considered decision either applied to all
                         of Great B r i t a i n , if we are proposing a general move away
                         from the timetable, or applied on a consistent basis to all
                         clubs         if what we are considering                                a. departure from the
                         recommendations                       in special c a s e s .            do not think that we
                         can       argue         that          safety       considerations            vary       significantly
                         from one part of the country to a n o t h e r .


                         If     you        were       to       agree      to    a     revised    general         timetable        in
                         Scotland,              1 do           not    see      that    we     could     argue, that          safety
                        considerations justified maintaining the original timetable
                         in England and Wales,                            X would prefer to come back to this
                        when          we       have            had    our      discussions            with       the    Football
                        Association                 and        the    Football         League.         In the meantime                I
                        think that                    there are one or two points which                                  can be made
                        which will                  perhaps point the way ahead.


                        Can I explain first how we are thinking of proceeding south
                        of the border.                      You know that we intend to use the Football
                        Licensing Authority to bring about all-seated accommodation
                        through the proposed Football r                                         l"g scheme at grounds
                        at     which          matches               are   held      whi,..            designated         matches

                        intention                is         to       designate          matches         which          are    UEFA
                       competitions or any match Involving a team representing a
                       club         which              is       a    member         of the    Football League                or   an
                       overseas             club held                (in each case)           at a ground designated
                       under         the       Safety of              Sports Grounds            Act     1975     or     a ground

                       not propose at present to require licences for matches held
                       at designated grounds where neither team is a member of
                       Football League or a foreign club,                                     nor to impose the ^

                         slight departure from Taylor Recommendation 4,


                         Can I now comment on the Taylor recommendations themselves.
                         Taylor's Recommendation 2 is based on paragraph 82 of the
                         final report which refers to the FIFA resolution passed in
                         July 1989 that from 1993 all high risk matches,                                     as defined
                         by UEFA,              should be held only                 in all-seater          stadia.         The
                         football             authorities           in England and Wales               appear to have
                         accepted this position.                           We propose to require all-seated
                         accommodation at grounds which seek a licence to hold                                       l-   ••

                         be required by the football authorities themselves,                                     Tiiouqh
                         this is one of the issues for discussion with                                       e footb^V
                         authorities,                     their         interpretation       of        the   FIFA/UEFA
                  **     requirements                    will      presumably        apply        to      Scotland         as
                         elsewhere.


                         For matches                 involving          first and second division clubs                    in
                         England and Wales,                       we see at present no reason to depart
                         from the             recommendations              in Taylor's Recommendation                3 of
                        all-seated accommodation to be achieved by August 1994,                                           it
                        may        be      that        we      shall     receive    representations           from     the
                        Football             League            or the Football Association when we have
                        our proposed meeting but we have had none yet.                                        X do not
                        think           that        we         should    concede     any   departure         from      the
                        proposed timetable                       in the meantime and X would hope that
                        you would               feel       able to hold your hand               in respect      of the
                        premier division of the Football League in Scotland.


                        You mention the first and second divisions of the Scottish
                        League.             As I read Recommendations                   3 and 4 of the Taylor
                        report, no specific mention is made of these two divisions
                        and our own thoughts were that these should be regarded in
                       the same category as the third and fourth divisions of the
                       Football League in England and Wales.                               If this is the case,
                       Recommendation 4 applies which means that these clubs would
                       not be required to achieve all-seated accommodation before
                       August 1999.                    There might even be a case for arguing                                          .


                                                                                                                           3

               Scottish       second           division         clubs       should,             like     English          and

               standing accommodation should be progressively removed.                                                     In
               other    words           it    will        never    be       necessary             for     a       club     to
               provide       more        seats       than       the        number         of     people           that     it
               expects       to    attend        its       matches.              I    imagine          that       many     ot
               these    clubs          are    already          in the position where                         the     irn- ’
               numbers       of         spectators              which       they            attract          coi'.ld       r-:<

               accommodated in the seats which are currently available.


               I    think    however           that        if     our      decisions              are    not        to     be
               challenged on grounds of reasonableness, that we shall need
               to    have     some           flexibility           on      both           the     1994        and      1993
               timetables          by    which        individual            clubs           move       towards         all­
               seated      accommodation.                  Clearly         some will              have       an    easier
              task than others.                 Some will have features which make them
               fairly safe grounds by any standards,* others will not.                                                    One
              advantage that we shall have in England and Wales is that
              we     shall        be     able        to    rely       on        the       Football           Licensing
              A uthority to make recommendations in respect of the use of
              section 11 of the Football                          Spectators Act which provides
              the    power        to    direct        that       conditions               relating        to       seated
              accommodation              should           be    Included             in     the        licences           for
              particular           football           grounds.               Although              we    are        sc. ill
              considering precisely what range of matters the licensing
              authority will                 be able       to take          into       account          in deciding
              w hether a licence should foe granted to permit the holding
              of the particular classes of designated football match and
              on    what     terms       and     conditions,               we        hope       that    it    will         be
              possible to permit the Authority to exercise a fairly wide
              judgement on these matters.                          Thus if a ground were in all
              other     respects             safe,    with       adequate             arrangements             for        the
              control of spectators and for the prevention of offences,
              the    Authority           might        feel       able       to       recommend          that        there
              should be some relaxation of the Taylor timetable for one
              year or perhaps two if there were firm plans in the longer

                      term    to    meet     the     overall        objectives.            The    licensing
                      authority will of course also have power under section 13
                      of the Football Licensing Act to review the w ay in which
                      individual local authorities carry cut their responsibili­
                  ties       under the Safety            of Sports      Grounds Act            1975.       Some
                  local authorities have undoubtedly been better at this than
                  others.


                  What all this means is that if we permit individual clubs
                  to depart from the proposed timetable,                           it will only be in
                  circumstances where we can be assured that the grounds are
                  reasonably safe.                Since Lord Justice T a y l o r ’s recommenda­
                  tions are made on grounds of safety,                        j think it would be
                  leas than prudent to grant a relaxation from the timetable
                  without such an assurance.


                  You raise also the question of Murrayfield.                             Officials here
                  will be inviting the Rugby Union authorities to meet us to
                  discuss          the    Taylor    recommendations          very        soon.     We      have
                  already made it clear that we have no statutory authority
                  at     the       moment    to     require     the    provision          of     all-seated
                  accommodation at rugby matches.                       It is also the case that
                  rugby matches have been mercifully free of crowd accidents
                  and crowd disorder.                I think it sensible that the national
                  rugby stadia should move towards all-seated accommodation
                  but my first thoughts are that we do not need to forc-~                                      t'

                  same pace a© in the case of association football,
                  we     should      be     looking      to   the    rugby    authorities          to      come
                  forward with definite proposals for movement towards a ll ­
                  seated       accommodation             at   Twickenham       and        at     the     Welsh
                  National Stadium but it may not be practicable to insert on
                  all-seated accommodation at other locations where rugby is
                  played.          Rugby Union is an amateur game which does not JMve
                  available          to     it     the    monies      which        are     available            to
                  association football and we shall, I am sure, need to adopt
                  a pragmatic approach.


              r   I    will    write        to    you    on   these    matters       again        when     our
                  thoughts         are    a little       clearer.      In the meantime             I would,

                         counsel           against           any   across     the    board       relaxations         of     the
                        Taylor timetable primarily for two reasons,                                       The first is
                        that the Taylor recommendations are essentially a package
                        which the Government has accepted as an alternative to the
                        football membership scheme to secure improved public order
                        and safety at football matches,                                I do not believe that «
                        case        can      be made           either    on   cultural,          economic      or    safety
                        grounds for taking a less rigorous line in Scotland than in
                        England and Wales.


                        The second point, which follows,                             is that any relaxation ef
                        the       Taylor          timetable         in   Scotland        will      be     taken       as    an
                        indication               that        the   Government        considers          that   a     lesser
                        standard of safety than that which Taylor is recommendinq
                        Is ac c e p t a b l e »              Where that leaves the Government if iher-

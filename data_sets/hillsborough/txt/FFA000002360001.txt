REF:                                      DATE:   2nd May, 1989




         Attached herewith is a copy of a letter we have received
from the Queen's Office at Buckingham Palace.

         You will see that the correspondent refers to the
security fence produced in Prance.   This has been referred to on
a few occasions.   Is it possible to ascertain exactly where it
is in use at the present time and for how long it has been there
and how it actually works and whether the French F.A. believe it
is effective.

           I believe the Solicitors would find this information
helpful.

Dear

    I am commanded by The Queen to thank
you for your letter of 18th April about
the recent disaster at Hillsborough
Football Ground. Her Majesty appreciated
your thoughtfulness in writing as you did
about the security fence which is
produced in France and has directed me to
forward your letter to the Football
Association so that they may know of your
approach to her.

              Yours sincerely,
                                            frantC

There have been a small number of occasions .pver the years v/hen
people have collapsed or been injured fairly near t<? where I was
seated and I have of cpurse .gone to .help these people...........
       I do not have any written Contract with the Club but the dutie
that I describe above are those which haye been carried out by the
"Club Doctor" for very many years and the way that I haye dealt
with the matter is in no way different frpm my predecessors....
       I do not have a direct relationship with the St. J o hn 's....
Ambulance Brigade.                         They .have their own Medical Officers, cpne pf
whom I believe is Dr. Shortland.                                                             The . C l u b p r o v i d e s a F i r s t .Aid
Room for the use of the S t . J o h n 's Ambulance Brigade.                                                                   I dp not
have a key to this area and have only been in on one occasion that
I can remember.                 I have no control whatsoever over the operations
of the St. John's Ambulance Brigade personnel................ ...
       At the Club there is a Treatment Room which is primarily_the
 area where the Club Physiotherapist A 1 j • Smith treats injured__
 players.          This contained two couches,                                                     three physiotherapy machine
 and stocks of bandages, dressings and some d r u g s . T h i s                                                                 room is
 often referred to as the "Medical Room" but really it should be
 called the Physiotherapist Room although I do use it occasionally.
 A Player injured on the field would be taken to this room and
 then if necessary to hospital.                                                     There is a stretcher kept in the
 corridor just outside this room...................................
        About four or five years ago a former                                                                                   .......
                                 , collapsed with a cardiac arrest near to me in a
 Reception Lounge at half-time.                                                      I was eventually successful in
  resuscitating                                              |.            I was assisted by a Doctor from the
 Norwich Football Club who had an Ambu-bag and airway with him.
 The Ambu-bag is a substitute for applying mouth to mouth resusci­
  tation .         The purpose of the airway is to pass a pipe ?yer the
  tongue and down the mouth to create a clear passage..............
         The next morning I was asked to speak to the Club Chairman
  Mr. McGee.            By chance there was an article in the current British
  Medical Journal about portable defibrillators and ^ tore this out
  to take with

 the night before and I rtold him that I felt the Club needed a
 defibrillator and showed him the article.                                     However Mr. McGee
 told me to obtain an Ambu-bag and airway as the Norwich Doctor
 had used.            This I did soon afterwards.                           Ever since I have always
 carried an airway in my pocket at every match and keep the Ambu-ba
 in my case.             My normal practise is to leave my case in the
 Physiotherapy Room.
          A defibrillator can only be used in certain circumstances.
 For example an area must be cleared arpund the casualty before the
 charge is delivered to ensure that anyon e.standing nearby does not
 receive an electric shock.                          It would not be possible for a
 St. John's Ambulanceman or indeed a qualified Nurse to use such
 a piece of equipment as in general only qualified Doctors may do
  so.        Since my discussion with Mr. McGee there has not been any
 occasion when a defibrillator would have been required.
          On the 15th April,              1989 my wife and I had been invited by tl>*-
 Club to the F.A. cup Semi-Final at Hillsborough.                                           My wife was
  given a seat in the Stand but I had been asked previously by
  Graham Mackrell,               the Club Secretary,               to take a seat behind the dug
  out at the side of the pitch.                           This was because of an incident at
  a Football match elsewhere in which a player nearly choked                                          by
  swallowing his tongue when knocked out.                                   The Football Association
  had made a direction that a Doctor should be near the pitch.                                             Where
  I was to be seated was a much more convenient place for getting
  onto the pitch quickly than being seated in the Stand.
          My wife and I attended a luncheon in the Executive Suite befor<
  the match and I actually got to the area where I was to be seated
  at about 2.40p.m.                  I did not notice anything about the crowd at
  that stage.             Indeed I cannot say that I noticed anything unusual
  prior to the match being stopped.                              I had not particularly looked
  at the Leppings Lane end of the Ground.
          When the match was stopped I simply thought that the Police

     into the Stand above the Leppings Lane enclosure but still
     thought that it was a crowd disturbance due to the number of
     spectators and Police milling around in front of the crowd
     barriers at that time.
               Within about three or four minutes of the game being stopped
     I saw a Policeman lifting somebody out of the crowd over the
     fence and realised immediately that this was peculiar and that
     the situation required further investigation.                                                                                       I hurried to that
     end of the Ground and found a number of people lying or sitting
     on the edge of the pitch.                                                    I went around these looking for anyon
     seriously injured but without exception these people were all
     conscious and had suffered only minor injuries.                                                                                         This would have
     taken me about two minutes.                                                        I then came upon a casualty who
     was obviously asphyxiated and who was being resuscitated by two
     people I now know to be Dr. Glynn Phillips from Kilbride and
                                                 from Liverpool.                                   I stopped to assist these two
      and we were joined by a fourth person who I cannot identify.
     This was a male aged between fcprty,and fifty who .was .obviously
      a First Aider 'but I cannot recall, whether .he .was .in .a. St..John 's
      Ambulance Brigade .uniform or not.................................
                 I spoke to a Policeman                                       .w h o       was near to. us and. told him .to..
      bring any asphyxiated people that .he could find t<? the. area
      where we w e r e .                             I could npt identify this Policeman again but
      within a short space of time .there were a number of people who
      were asphyxiated laid <?n the ground near to us.                                                                                       The four of us
       split into two teams, I was working with j                                                                                             from Liverpool
      who I later ascertained was a Nurse Manager wprking on the Cardiac
       Unit at Broad Green H ospi tal ....................................
                  It must be understood that we were working in the middle of
       a large crowd.                                We        were slightly to the left of the Goal Posts
       as you look at them                                     on the pitch, about two or                                               three yards onto
        the Pitch.                         There were hundreds of people in that immediate
        area and it certainly wasn't possible to see through the crowd
        to the fencing.                                  I therefore had no idea what                                                   the scale of the
        casualties would be but the evidence before me                                                                                  at that^JLj-me

 suggested that people were either going to be asphyxiated or only
comparatively lightly .injured.                                                         It was obviously appropriate to
 turn my attention to .the asphyxiated first of. all...... This .was a
question of working on one person until such time, as it seemed
 that there was no real prospect of them breathing unaided again
 and then moving on to another victim to .try .and assist.                                                                   In...

 and I worked in such a fashion or how many people we worked upon
 but it was quite a long time.                                                         I have to say that in general .
 the people that we treated were cyanosed to such an extent, and
 their pupils were so dilated,                                                   that it seemed               to me   that they had
 probably not been breathing for some minutes before                                                                  we were     able
 to try and help them................................................
            I had two Brookes airways in my pocket which were used but
 proved useless as they became choked                                                                with vomit ver;/ quickly.
            I remember that during this period I spoke to a Policewoman
 and told her that there was a stretcher in the players tunnel
 which she should go and fetch.                                                         I_ never _actually^ saw her with
  the stretcher but to my knowledge the stretcher has gone and                                                                      has
  not been returned to the Club . ....................................
            When there seemed to be no more that we could do on the pitch,
                            and I ascertained that there were casualties in the
  Gymnasium.                        We made our way off the playing area and round the
  back of the North Stand where we came upon a number of casualties
   laid on hoardings, most of whom were obviously dead but there was
   one lad aged about twelve years in a red shirt                                                               (possibly a
   Liverpool Football Club Team strip) who did not appear cyanosed.
   He was not breathing and there was no pulse so Mr. Evans and I
   started work upon him.                                           We maintained that task until an
   ambulance crew took over and moved him from u s .                                                                  I would add that
    there was a lorry parked between where this lad was laying and
    the First Aid Room so that the people in the First Aid Room'
     (which was dealing with a number of minor casualties at the time)
   would not have been able to see him lying there.

of bodies and in the .other area there were, .probably, half a. dozen

         It appeared that there was nothing further we ccpuld do and

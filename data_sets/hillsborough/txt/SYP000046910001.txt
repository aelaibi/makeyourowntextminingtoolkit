   Dear Sir

   I acknowledge receipt of your faxed letter dated 23 May 1990 concerning removal
   of the remaining barriers and safety fence to the Leppings Lane terrace at
   Hillsborough before the start of the 1990 season.

  Before replying I will consult with Dr Popper, H M Coroner for Sheffield, Mr
  Kennedy, The Crown Prosecution Service, Captain Taylor, Police Complaints
  Authority and Dr Nicholson, Health and Safety Executive, concerning any
  objections they may wish to raise.

   I note that the position does need to be reviewed by the end of July 1990.

1985   I opened            ray p u r n s t i l e         for      supporters             at       12    noon.           Shortly          after

       that,         turnstile            No             was      opened       by    a       young          operator.              I do       not    know

       his     name.

       When     we     ar e        inside          our    turnstile            the       two       of       us    face    each          other.           We

       supporters                 came     through           my    turnstile.                 This          grew    to a s t e a d y           flo w .         Eh

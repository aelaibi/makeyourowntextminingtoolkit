these       shops       were        facing          a    large          park       and       bowling          green          area.

Whilst          patrolling           back          and       forth          among       these       shop          fronts          which          was       an

apparent,         route        for       Liverpool                supporters,                it    became           obvious            that

then       communcati.ons                were       at       a    minimum          since          the    only          radio          held       by     th e

serial          was    with     POL          PS    LOMAS,             who    I believe             was       positioned                along          the

same       road       towards        the          Leppings             Ln    end       of    the    ground.

During          the    time     we       were       deployed                which       commenced             at       about          1 i .15am

(1113)          until     match          kick       off,          several          small          groups          of     Liverpool

supporters             passed        at       isolated                intervals,             some       of    these          being          family

groups,          others        small          groups             of    males.          Most,       if    not        all      who       passed

appeared          to    be     in a          joyful          and       boisterous                mood,       taut      none       appeared              to

be    drunk.          Some     supporters                were          carrying             cans    of       beer        but      seemed           in

control          of    their        behaviour,                   the    age       range          of/'most         being          30yrs       or       older

At    about       3.05pm        (1505)             myself             and    POL       P C JCRAN        were        still         on _Middlewood

were       passed       on     the       opposite                side       of    the       road    by       PO                        Y    and       other

Doncaster             Officers           who      were           presumably             attached             to     his      se r

We    were       beckoned           on       to    follow             these       Officers          and       after          crossing              the

road       followed           the    group          some          distance             behind,          towards             Leppings             Ln     a nd,

As    we       reached          the       ent r a ne e         to    the     ground          I    could         see      a       continuous

strearn         of       supporters              leaving            the     ground          by    the        Leppinqs             Ln    entrance

together with groups of other Police personnel who were stood in the

vicinity             of    the       entrance.             Myself          and       PQL     PC       CRAN      were         completely

detached             from       our       supervisor                and    serial           colleagues,               and         whilst          hearing

abusive             remarks          directed             at    the       Police           were        totally        unaware            of       what

had       or    what       was       t a k i ng      place.

We    then          crossed          the       road       to    try       and      locate         our        serial memb e r s                from

whom       we       were       totally          detached             and     it      was     then        that        I saw         people          being

carried             or    assisted             from       the       rear     of      the     W    Stand         into         a    small       access

roadway             running          round          the    ground,           which          was       rounded         by         metal       railings.

ambulances                who       were       then       arriving            in     the     area.

Several             of    those          carried          out       were      covered             by    blankets and                   were

sustained                within          the    ground.             I then        remained              in    this       area          forming          part

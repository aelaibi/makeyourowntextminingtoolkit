           Subject:    Hi 1Isborough

                        FA Cup Semi-final



           Si r ,



                                                             ice action was totally

           unjustified



       /   They worked like trojans     in tryijwg to rescue the injured and dead and

           in many cases gave mouth to^^outh resuscitation.           The police did the

           only thing possible at JUhe time,         pulling the injured and hurt over the

           fencing trying to relieve the pressure as best they could, as events

           later came to light this was the only way because of the back entrance
                                                                            PAGE
                                                                            S3448

     was blocked with injured people who had fallen on their way into the
     *
     ground.



     / h e Doctor stated that no one seemed to take cfc^rge of the situation.

     * ^ e 1 ieve this to be untrue   (at the rear 9^ the stadium major incident

IJ   plans had been put into operation)            first all seemed to be utter

        os and confusion out of which orifer was restored by small degrees

     at a time.   This may not have been apparent to the untrained eye.



     He further complains of no *D e - f i b * being available   in the ground.

     Questions    If one had been available,    where would they keep it, and

     who would be able to use it?



     I suggest he was talking without forethought and in the heat of the

     moment.



     He was not in his hospital environment asking for equipment which

     would normally be put into this hand by near-by trained staff.


                                        Aori
     At the casualty clearing point            was an over abundance of Senior

     Ambulance Staff equipped with Vital       radios yet a serious lack of

     liaison with ambulance    cr& 1 $s seemed evident,   the crews seemed to be

     left to their own deviires as to priority cases.



     Mistakes were made by all    including the F.A*      but for the emergency

     services to have to deal with the amo          of casualties they did in so




     The Trent Region can Jrfe proud.

               Sir,



               Further to my report dated 15 April                   1989 <150489),      I would like to

               append the following.
                                                                   PAGE
                                                                   S3448A



Having attended Hillsborough recently I would like to put forward a

proposal to be incorporated in the above        plan.



If the major emergency services had colour coded reflective jackets

for the Incident Officer only and the scheme adopted nationwide any

emergency services from outside the area would be able to identify at

a glance his/her Incident Officer, and failing other radio

instructions know who to approach for deployment.



May I suggest s-



             Reflective   White   Police    )

             Reflective   Blue    Ambulance > - Incident Officer

             Reflective   Red     Fire      )



It goes without saying that only one at anytime should wear their

particular    colour from each service.



I hope you will find the above suggestion of interest.

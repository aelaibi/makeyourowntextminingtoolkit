             At a p p r o x i m a t e l y    10.50am        (1050)    I commenced             (together with the                 rest of

             searching          of the Liverpool                supporters            coaches.     When the        parking         spaces

                 were   filled we were direc                                   o c a t i on outside a public house

             called the Gate                Inn.

             At this       location we w e / / preventing Liverpool                               supporters       from going

At 3 . 0 0 d m   (15QQ)       most   of the supporters           had made their way         past     us en

route     to the ground and we were                  directed to     return to C l a y w h e e 1s Ln

for meal.

We had just set off to go to C laywheeIs                         Ln when we were d ir ected to

the Lej?pings Ln end of the ground by radio,                         with a message         to the

effect     of    crowd problems at that end of the ground.

We made our way           i mm ed iately to the L ep pings Ln end.                We went       into the

s t a d i u m a nd on reaching          the    large    concrete area to the           rear of the

stand     I saw a state of a bs olute                chaos.      Liverpool    supporters       were all

over     the area and          I saw several         people    laid out on the floor            receiving

first aid treatment.                 The    tunnel     leading    to the terracing was           packed

and bodies w ere being               passed through the tunnel            and on to the

forecourt area,               Liverpool       supporters were       shouting and screaming

a bout    people       being    trapped on the terracing.               At this    point myself

a nd several          other    officers       from my serial       forced our way thro ug h the

tunnel    and out onto           the terracing.

On getting        to the terracin g            I made my way down onto           the   pitch;       Pe op le

were     lying all       over    the    place and       people were still        trapped down at

the front        of the terracing.              I then a ss is t ed three Liverpool

supporters who           had an a d ve rt is in g       board w hi ch they were using as a

stretcher        to    convey    injured       people    to an amb ul an ce    point at the other

end of the        crowd.        We made several          trips    in this way as well          as

assisting        one or two others whose                injuries were     not so bad.          This

carried on for some time                    until   things    started to get sorted out.

At about 5.00pm           (1700)       an    Inspector who       I d o n ’t know told us to go

w i t h him out on to L ep pings Ln to direct Liverpool                        supporters        back to

their     coaches »

This     we did and at about 5.30pm                  (1730)   we began a check on all               coaches

to find out how many were missing                       off of each     coach.     We then

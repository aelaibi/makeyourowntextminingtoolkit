                           NOTE OF MEETING WITH D/SEL ON 15.8.89

                     on                                       (IR/L/ME/MM/89/1).

    No t e s

    1.         Dr Jones handed me two copies of the RLSD report (PGJ & AFE).
               I also noted reference of the Inquiry Interim Report by Lord
               Justice Taylor (CM 765 HMSO £10.65) - a copy should be avail­
               able via Library.

    2.         HSE involvement in the Inquiry

               Mr Nattrass AD offered assistance to Local Authority and
               assembled an HSE team to visit the ground on 16.4.89 (FAID/TD
               /RLSD).    It was apparent that investigation was out of the
               LA depth, and Mr Hammer wrote to Home Office formally offer­
               ing RLSD (& HSE) assistance i.e in a similar vein to that for
               Kings Cross Inquiry.     This was accepted and RLSD team under
               C Nicholson was asked to report to Prof. Maunder,          the
               technical assessor to the Inquiry.        Thereafter there was
               virtually daily contact between Maunder and Nicholson with
               respect to the Inquiry needs, with RLSD summoning assistance
               from TD and others as appropriate.      RLSD's initial remit
               from Maunder was to look at turnstiles,       gates, barriers,
               signs and walls.     This was subsequently expanded to include
               crowd density, noise, and crowd flow.
    3.      TD input fvia

           RLSD acknowledged the range of TD input on

               (a)   wall stability
               (b)   barrier 124A strength
               (c)   condition and position of barriers
               (d)   outer gates
               (e)   turnstile functioning
               (f)   crowd density

    4.     Inquiry needs

           As noted above, Dr Jones said that RLSD work was governed by
           the Inquiry needs.    in simple terms the Inquiry were to
           address two aspects

            (i)            what happened and why?  (Interim Report)
            (ii)           recommendations on stadia safety  (Full Report)



                                                   1
5.   RLSD report:

     Dr Jones said the content of Dr Nicholson's report was
     dictated by the Inquiry team, 'they called the shots'. Thus
     it was the Inquiry team who said the work on wall stability
     was not germane at least to the interim report, and because
     of this view the          observations were not included at
     this stage.

     I said I considered this to be the wrong approach in that
     Dr Nicholson's report should have contained the essential
     elements of everything we (HSE) had done.     If the Inquiry
     team then chose to ignore certain findings of our report so
     be it, but this would have clearly then been their decision.
     As it was now, HSE have colluded with the opinions of the
     Inquiry team which may or may not be correct.

     After some discussion on this point Dr Jones accepted my
     view, and said the final HSE compilation report would contain
     references to everything done.  (*)

     I also complained that the RLSD (HSE) report      was issued
     without prior consultation with FAID and TD.        Dr Jones
     apologised for that, but claimed pressure of time for the
     omission.    He agreed the final RLSD (HSE) report would be
     cleared with FAID and TD before being published.  (*)

6.   Relevance of TD views on crowd density

     We discussed at some length the 'recommended'       figure for
     crowd numbers in Pen 3 of the ground.     RLSD had done some
     good work on assessing the 'estimated actual' figure at 157 6.
     However, they had then related this to a recommended value of
     1015 in their report,     a figure arrived at      by   simple
     application of the Green Guide.

     I put the case, based on               views, that the guide
     should be applied with more rigour to take account of
     access/egress points, gangways, sub-standard barriers & etc.
     This could lead to 'recommended'   figures as low as 390.
     Thus the perception of overcrowding could be significantly
     influenced by the figures used:-

     (a) Nicholson figures 1576 versus 1015 = overcrowding by 50%
     (b)       figures     1576 versus 390 =       "        " 300%

     Whilst the realistic 'recommended' figure was probably some­
     where between 390 and 1015, the impact of Inquiry comments on
     this aspect would be stronger the higher the overcrowding
     factor.    This in turn might influence commentary on the
     current Green Guide.

     Dr Jones after some debate accepted my argument,   and agreed
     that HSE must resolve this issue internally before we
     publicly comment on the matter again.    Also the point would
     need to be resolved prior to the final RLSD (HSE) report and
     Dr Jones agreed to investigate the matter further.   (*)
                                2
      Future research

      I enquired what future research RLSD had in thearea of
      crowds and crowd control.    Dr Jones said they had    nothing
      specific at this stage, but had suggested to the Inquiry one
      or two ideas which had been proposed by Mr          ]TD3B (see
      Annex 1).   He said RLSD would expect to respond to a request
      from the Home Office for research in this area.

      I suggested that HSE had a legitimate interest in crowds by
      virtue of its responsibilities for the leisure industry,
      railways and the like and could therefore sponsor its own
      research.   Dr Jones said RLSD would be happy to respond to
      any such requests from TD or FAID.  (*)

8.    Green Guide (Mark II)

      RLSD had already offered to assist in developing an updated
      Green Guide (see Annex 1).    I suggested to Dr Jones that if
      Home Office (via Prof. Maunder) respond to this offer,     it
      would be sensible to form an HSE working group on the subject
      so that the views of RLSD/TD/FAID and Policy Division could
      be included in any contribution we might make.      Dr Jones
      agreed with the suggestion.  (*)

9.    Further guidance bv HSE

      I suggested that in view of HSE1s legitimate interests in
      crowds and crowd control issues, it may be appropriate to
      develop our own guidance on the subject  (internal,  external
      or both).    I said I would check this idea with FAID, and if
      they agreed that something was needed, the. HSE working group
      (see para 8 above) could be set up now.  (*)

10    Relationship FAID/TD/RLSD regarding incidents

      We reviewed the procedures for handling major incident work
      within HSE, and agreed the requirements of HSAM 38 GAP were
      appropriate.   We recognised that the point of enquiry should
      be FAID (either directly or from LA via the ELO). Thereafter
      if technical assistance was required, needs would be focussed
      via the FCG who could then call on TD/HQ or RLSD as appropri­
      ate.   Dr Jones agreed this arrangement was sensible.

11.   Cross references RLSD report and Inquiry interim report

      I asked what use had been made of data in the RLSD report
      for the Inquiry Interim report produced by Lord Justice
      Taylor.     Dr Jones said there were a number of references,
      and these had been complimentary to HSE's input (see Annex
      2).     Dr Jones said the RLSD (HSE) report had been unani­
      mously accepted by the Inquiry and the nine QCs representing
      interested parties.    In view of this no HSE staff had been
      called to give evidence, although Dr Nicholson had sat with
      and advised Counsel to the Inquiry, during examination of key
      witnesses.

                                 3
  12.   Policy interest

        I asked Dr Jones if there had been any interest from our
        Policy Divisions on Hillsborough or crowd problems.   He said
        that SPD'B' had been looking into this from an HSE perspec­
        tive,  and there had been exchanges of correspondence    (see
        Annex 3 and 4).      I noted that TD had not been included in
        these exchanges.

  13.   Next steps

        Dr    Jones   said the next steps had been indicated in
        Dr Nicholson's letter to Prof. Maunder (see Annex 1).     The
        Inquiry team would now be reviewing the whole issue of safety
        at sports grounds with a view to producing a Final Report for
        early 1990.    RLSD had promised to produce a compilation of
        their   (HSE) work and make this available to the Inquiry if
        required.

        I stressed on Dr Jones that the RLSD compilation should

         (a)   include the main elements of everything we had   done   in
               response to the incident

         (b)   be cleared by    consultation RLSD/TD/FAID   before being
               released. (*)

  14.   Items for 'Express'

               ~1 RLSD had drafted a piece for Express on the work HSE
        had done in support of the Hillsborough incident.    I had a
        look at this and made one or two suggestions for rewording.

  15.   Broken crowd barriers

        I took the opportunity to have a look at the damaged crowd
        barriers recovered from the Hillsborough ground.

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER


     At HFCG, I agreed to pull together TD inputs on the
     Hillsborough Disaster as a prelude to possible action by
     you.

     The papers below indicate 3 main areas of concern within TD:

     (i)   Dr Nicholson's report of 16 June 1989 (flag L) did not
           include material form           on the condition of the
           walls near and over the gate and turnstiles providing
           access to the disaster area itself?

    ii)    Dr Nicholson's report ignores the view o   f  o  n
           permissible crowd density in the disaster area; the
           effect of this is to minimise the extent to which actual
           crowd numbers exceed the permissible capacity. To put
           this into context, Dr Nicholson's report implies that
           the estimated number of people in Pen 3 was 155% of the
           allowable maximum, whereas        calculations suggests
           405%;

and iii)   Dr Nicholson's report was not circulated for comment
           before finalisation - it was a "fait accompli".

3    I understand that Lord Justice Taylor did not want material
on (i) in the report (obviously I have not pursued this with
RLSD), but I am uncertain as to why, or what - if anything - is
our policy in such circumstances.

4     The point at (ii) above is central to TD's position as
technical adviser to HSE.            feels that TD3 provides the
technical expertise on sports ground safety, not RLSD, and that
his views should have been taken into account.   Put bluntly, we
have had the rug pulled from under our feet; RLSD is now in effect
in charge of the provision of technical advice to the inquiry (and
is ignoring our views); moreover, it remains in charge of
developments post-inquiry, eg. in terms of research needs, on
which           also feels strongly.

5.   I suggest this point should be the focus of any action you
decide to take up with RLSD.  It could be allied to the fact
that HSAM 38 GAP, together with the agreement reached between RLSD
and TD on detailed procedures for action surrounding major
incidents, makes it clear that the FCG SSI is the focal point for
commissioning and coordinating all technical and scientific advice
in support of investigations. Dr Jones should not have "jumped
the gun" in offering RLSD as the coordinator and Mr Hammer should
have remembered the procedures.  Both are aware of both sets of
procedures.

6    We can, of course, discuss if you wish. But it is very clear
to me that TD has, for the time being, lost an area of
responsibility which is central to its function and which is high
profile. The lessons are obvious.

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER


1     At HFCG I agreed to pull together some information on TD's
input to the HSE submission on the Hillsborough Disaster, because
of the concern expressed about omission of work.

2.      I attach papers from               covering the NEFCG
inputs.    These cover:

     i)   flag A -   the condition of the perimeter wall adjacent
                     to Gate C and parapet walls over the Leppings
                     Lane turnstiles. The former was found to be
                     distorted and lacking in lateral stability and
                     could be made to sway when pushed by hand;
                     the latter were dilapidated. None of this
                     material is included in Dr Nicholson's report
                     of 16 June 1989 - copy attached at flag L;

    ii)   flag B -   failure of crowd control barrier 124A; this
                     report post-dates Dr Nicholson's report, but
                     material on this topic (presumably from
                     elsewhere or verbally provided) is included
                     and is central to Dr Nicholson's report (see
                     Section 3 of same and para 9.2);

   iii)   flag C -   examination of condition of and disposition of
                      crush barriers in the Leppings Lane End
                      central pen. The main conclusion is that a
                      number of barriers did not meet the
                      specifications of the Guide to Safety at
                      Sports Grounds 1986; this is included in
                      Dr Nicholson's report (paras 2.1 - 2.5 and
                      9.1) ;

    iv)   flag D -   examination of outer and folding Gates at
                     West Side of ground. The main conclusions
                     were that there was minor damage of unknown
                      origin to the outer gates (see flag E for
                      location)  and wear on folding gates
                      commensurate with their age; such material is
                     not included in Dr Nicholson's report;
       v)      flag F -   examination of turnstiles A-G (which fed the
                          disaster area). Here the main conclusion was
                          that although old, worn and in need of
                          maintenance, all were working satisfactorily
                          in terms of foot pedal and cam motions; the
                          report notes that further work on load/release
                          pressure data, throughput and counting tests
                          was under way. Dr Nicholson's report includes
                          some of the FCG findings (eg at para 4.2 and
                          4.7) but focuses mainly on the error in
                          counting revealed for turnstile G by testing
                          (para 4.6 and 9.3);

      vi)      flag G -   an addendum to flag C, covering effective gate
                          widths and step configurations of Pens 3 and
                          4. This is included in Dr Nicholson's report
                          at para 2.6 and 9.1.

3.          I also attach inputs from TD3

        i)     flag H - proposed research work needed on allowable
                         crowd densities and pressures, the
                         relationship between pressure and injury and
                        test procedures. None of this -
                        understandably - is in Dr Nicholson's factual
                         report on HSE's work;

      ii)      flag J - a record of conversation with Dr Eastwood of
                        Eastwood and Partners, the Safety Consultants
                        to the Club. There is no reference -
                        understandably - to Eastwood's testing in
                        Dr Nicholson's report of the HSE work; and

     iii)      flag K -           I' report of 6 June on the capacity of
                          the terraces. None of this is included in
                          Dr Nicholson's report and this is particularly
                          important b e c a u s e f e e l s that the
                          allowable crowd density in the areas of the
                          disaster is much lower than a simple
                          application of the Code would permit, but that
                          this is not reflected in Dr Nicholson's
                          report. To summarise: Dr Nicholson
                          calculates the maximum crowd density on the
                          basis of 54 persons/10m2 (the Code figure),
                          and drawings of pens 3 and 4 by Ralph Brady
                          and Associates, making no explicit allowance
                          for non-conformity with the Code; this gives
                          him eg a maximum capacity of 2051 for Pens 3
                          and 4, the site of the disaster.
                          notes that the club's Safety Consultant
                          (Dr Eastwood) had in 1979 proposed a 10%
                          reduction for the Leppings Lane terraces
                          because of the lack of gangways here (para 2
                          of flag K ) .            goes on to calculate the
                          capacity of pens 3 and 4 based on a strict
                          application of the Code       taking into effect
                          eg. the re-siting of one barrier, the need for
                          entrance areas to be kept clear and the non­
                          conformity of the barriers, and arrives at a
                    figure (para 11 of flag K) of 929 ie. only 45%
                    of Nicholson/s figure. It is worth noting two
                    things : first that this is how the Code would
                    have been applied in Lancashire; second even
                    with a marshalling failure, a figure of 929
                    would not have resulted in a disaster.
                             remains of the opinion that TD's
                    position (and thus HSE'S) should be that the
                    permissible crowd numbers for pens 3 and 4
                    should have been for fewer than the numbers
                    in Dr Nicholson's report. But he has been
                    ignored.

     Following suggestions that the condition of the perimeter wall, adjacent to Gate 'C1,
     may be relevant to the Hillsborough enquiry, a detailed examination of the wall and
     parapet walls over the Leppings Lane turnstiles was made. The survey was
     subsequently extended to cover the remainder of the perimeter walls. The wall in
     question was found to be distorted and lacking in lateral stability and could be
     made to sway when pushed by hand. The parapet walls over the turnstiles were found
     to be dilapidated with a loose pier, loose copings and loose/broken infill railings.
     Other than these parts of the perimeter the remainder was in a generally adequate
     condition, subject to minor repairs and pointing. Recommendations are made
     regarding the remedial works considered necessary to ensure the integrity, safety
     and srfectiveness of the wall and parapets over the turnstiles at the Leppings Lane
     entrance to the ground.

        14/C/5/39

        1.   WALL BETWEEN GATE 'C' AND SOUTH STAND AT SOUTH WEST CORNER   OF   GROUND

             1.1   The wall is approximately 71 m (233 ft) long, stretching from Gate 'O'
             to the brick building housing turnstile 19 adjacent to Gate 'D 1. The wail is
             not perfectly straight but has a slight curve on plan, being concave when
             viewed from outside the ground, and having an oblique corner at a distance of
             46.3 m from Gate 'C '.

             1.2   It is constructed from 230 mm (9 inches' brickwork, laid ir. black mortar,
             to a type of Flemish garden wall bond with alternate header/stretchers in
             every sixth course. The rear, or inner, face of the wall is reinforced with
             700 mm x 115 mm (27^ inches x ik inches) buttresses at approximately 7 m (23 ft)
             centres. The wall is capped with a precast concrete coping approximately 75 mm
             (3 inches) high and the height to the underside of the coping varies from
             2.36 m (7 ft 9 inches) to 2.98 m (9 ft 9 inches). It is constructed on siccing
             ground and the height varies in steps along its length.

             1.3   Mild steel angle brackets, curved outwards and carrying three strands of
             barbed wire, are bolted to the top external face of the wall. Some of these
             were loose and all were rusty and dilapidated.

             1.4. The wall is distorted and bowed along its length and is also cut of
             plumb, leaning inwards over parts of its length and outwards over other parts
              ;see Table 1, Photographs 1-4).   The maximum deflection out of plumb is
             100 mm (4 inches) leaning outwards. No damp-proof course appears to have been
             provided when the wall was constructed and the mortar near the base has eroded
             and weathered due to damp and frost action. Both faces have been repointed in
             cement mortar m the past but the original black mortar can be seen where the
             pointing has deteriorated.    It is not known upon what type of foundation the
             wall is constructed. However, the base of the stretch between the corner and
             Gate 1D ' shews stepped brickwork at the-base and it is possible that this is
             the top of a stepped brick foundation.

             1.5   There was seme diagonal cracking in the wall at a distance of 40 m from
             Gate ’C 1 and again at 50 m, the latter extending for the full height of the
             wall. In addition there were areas of loose brickwork at the top of the wall,
             and in places the concrete coping was weathered and cracked, particularly
             where the top of the wall was stepped (see Photographs 5—3).

             1.6   It was found that the wall could be made to sway and oscillate when
             pushed. For example, when pushed near the comer, some 40 m from Gate 'C,
             the wall swayed and a wave travelled to the end such that the lamp pillar
             bolted to the wall near Gate 'C could be seen to sway and shake. Similarly,
             if Gate 1C ' was pushed the adjacent wall was found to shake due to the bolted
             connections between the gatepost and the end of the wall.

             1.7   Advice was given that the wall was significantly distorted, had failed
             as a structure and was unsafe. It was considered to be liable to topple during
             high winds, or if set oscillating by crowd pressure. Consequently it was
             considered that it should be either taken down and reconstructed or stabilized
             by buttressing or other equally effective means.




                                                1
2.   BRICK PARAPET WALLS AND INFILL RAILINGS OVER TURNSTILE BUILDINGS AT
     LEPPINGS LANE ENTRANCE

     2.1    The perimeter of the ground detween gates A-C at the Leppir.cs Lane er.d
     is enclosed by single-storey buildings housing turnstiles 1-15 and A-G. The
     outer face of the buildings has a 230 mm (9 inches) brick parapet wall
     surmounted by brick piers with an infill of ornamental cast iron railings
      (see Photographs 17-20). As the railings do not present a barrier to climcing,
     but rather the reverse as they provide hand-holds, the effective height of the
     wall is 3.43 m (II ft 3 inches) ie to the bottom of the railings.

     2.2    The parapet walls, piers and railings are generally dilapidated with
     loose and spa 1 ling brickwork in places, loose and broken sections of railing
     and loose coping stones on top of the brick piers (see Photographs 10-15).
     The 230 mm x 345 mm (9 inches x 13^ inches) brick pier adjacent to Gate 'C '
     has become detached from the wall and is displaced (Photographs 9 and 10).
     The end of the infill railing is fixed to the pier but the opposite end of the
     railing is only loosely held by the next pier (Photograph II). As a result the
     pier and attached railing are loose and can easily be rocked by hand. They are
     held in position by the wooden post of a large notice board which is positioned
     diagonally across the corner of the turnstile building (see Photograph 9).
     However, the effect of a number of people using the railing as a hand-hold to
     climb over the wall could be sufficient to pull the railings and pier over
     onto the crowd below. The coping belonging to the brick pier above turnstile
     15, .adjacent to Gate 1B ' was lying on the ground adjacent to the exit frcrr. the
     turnstiles (Photograph 20) .

     2.3    As can be seen from the Photographs, the front of the turnstile building
     does not provide an effective barrier against determined assault. The fixed
     ■guide barrier adjacent to Turnstile 'G' provides a convenient foothold and the
     parapet railings a hand-hold (Photographs 17 and 19). Similarly, the panelled
     gate adjacent to Turnstile 15, together with its stay and wall brackets,
     provided convenient means of scaling the wall (Photographs I" and 13). The cas'
     iron railings are, in fact, broken in two at this point (Photograph 13).

     2.4   In view of the general condition of the parapet wall, brick piers and
     railings, and their failure to provide an effective barrier, it is recommended
     that consideration be given to dismantling and reconstruction of the parapet
     as a solid barrier of sufficient height to deter climbers.

3.   NORTHERN PERIMETER WALL

     3.1   The northern perimeter comprises a 230 mm (9 inches) thick brick wall,
     approximately 2 m high, surmounted by a mesh fence to a total height of 4.3 m.
     The perimeter forms the rear boundary of the houses fronting Vere Road and thus
     has no access by the general public. It is generally in satisfactory condition
     and is not considered likely to give rise to any hazards.

4.   REMAINDER OF PERIMETER WALLING

     4.1   The remainder of the perimeter walling is generally provided by the cuter
     walls of buildings, such as turnstiles, the south stand etc and there are no
     other substantial lengths of freestanding wall.




                                        2
      4.2   There were some relatively minor defects noted that required remedial
      action and these are listed below.

            (i)   The brickwork above turnstiles 25/26 and the return wall
           behind the turnstile building required inspection and repcinting.

           (li)   The screen wall to the toilets behind turnstile 42 requires
           repairs to the brickwork at the top of the wall.

            (iii)   The parapet wall above turnstiles 32-33 requires repcinting.

5.   CONCLUSIONS

     ~.I   The North .South and East perimeter walls of the ground appear to be
     adequate apart from the relatively minor defects noted above.

     o.2   The freestanding wall at the South West corner, between Gate 'C' and
     turnstiles 19-22 is distorted, has inadequate lateral stability for its
     height and is unsafe and liable to topple if subjected to wind or crowd
     pressure. As recommended earlier it should be taken down, and reconstructed
     suitably buttressed or stabilized by other eoually effective measures.
     Whatever course is adopted the wall should be upgraded to meet modern desig
     loading criteria for sportsgrounds.

     5.3   The parapet walls and infill railings surmounting the turnstile build
     1-16 and A—3, between Gates A-C at the Leppir.es Lane end of the ground are
     generally dilapidated and in peer condition. In addition, the adjacent bar
     ard gate and the infill railings provide hard and foot-hcIds facilitating
     climbing and unauthorised entry to the ground. I consider that this parape
     walling should be taken down to sound brickwork ard reconstructed as a sell
                                                  event unauthorised access.

       Summ ary

        The report considers the loading on Barrier 124A, likely toca^-s* collapse and
        assesses the relative strengths, under horizontal crowd loading, of the horizontal
        rail and upright frames. It concludes that the weak link in the structure was
        the horizontal central rail and collapse was initiated by failure of the central
        span rail, followed by span 124A/1, due to combined horizontal and lateral load
        once connection to the laterally braced bay 124A/3 was lost.

1.     GENERAL
       1.1    The failed barrier, numbered 124A on the Club's Drawings, comprised ^
       -i u^riqnt angle frames supporting 3 spans of Horizontal tubular        --- *as
       subsequently learned that the tubular rail was constructed rrcm wrougnt iron
       and the angle frames from mild steel.

       1.2   The horizontal rail was secured to the rep of the rru_d s- - angle
       frame by a bolted steel strap, formed to the profile of ^ e pipe and f am
       tcc. Test data provided by RLSD gives values or 2j.2 ana *4 uur.^sq^nc.i
       the ultimate tensile strength of the wrought iron face witn        °r     ,
       proportionality of 9.1 and 10.3 tons/sq i n c h respective y.
       of the mild steel angle gave a UTS value of 2^.2 ana 2..^ ^       -
       vield points of 17.27 and 19.92 tons/sq inch respectively.

       WROUGHT IRON HORIZONTAL RAILS

        2.1   To assess the failure load of the horizontal ™ g h t iron rails,
        calculations are based on the assumption that_it acted a._. Sxu,p;y s u p p o r t
        beam. Any degree of fixity d e restriction or rotation) ^-tau^
        offered by the securing straps is ignored. On tnis DaSi^ ;                  7 *-
        ^at- the maximum failure load on the tube would ce approximate.^ .oO Id ,
                 As S t i f l e d   test load is 400 ifcs/f, m o .   « s , loacs would nave
        ever-stressed the rails. No allowance nas ceen mace i.or „orros_^n wh^c*.
        would reduce the theoretical zailure load.

        MILD STEEL UPRIGHT FRAMES

        3.1   When assessing the strength of the mild steel uprights, the case or
        the more highlv loaded intermediate support has ceen c o n s iaer=c. What
        actually occurred at failure is not known. However,_it_is assumed tn
        failure would occur at the yield point. On tnis ^asis i_ is               , ,7
        failure would occur at a horizontal rail lcac or cetween 480 ancDoO(average
        515) lbs/ft ran assuming that the top rail remained intact.                ^
        estimate takes no account of deterioration, corrosion et.       A^so, the m°oe o
        failure appears to be by tearing through the leg or an ang.e u
        High stress concentrations at the rivet hole, up uO 3 times^_n            1
                                                                                  g ,
        would tend to lower the failure load. Thus, the figure or Dib ,cs/.t is
        probably on the high side.

         COMMENTS

         a.l   The uprights apcear to be stronger than the rails and I consider that
         -ailure was initiated by failure of the central span of horizontal ra^i.
         This would be followed by additional deflection of the
         bv side swav due to lack of lateral bracing once the connection to the brae-
         bay was lost. The direction of collapse of bay 124A/1 is consisten         ^
         angle of attack of a surge down the gap between the barriers o r . the t^rrac-

         4.2   The maximum crowd pressure available in the surge is nou known. It is
         possible that the barrier might not have failed if the top rai
         stronger. However, in view of the assessed strength of aie uprights compared
         to^         design loading, I consider that the. barriers were:
         though they appear to comply with the requirements of die         Gr~en ^oae .

Detailed examination of both halves of the central pen, the entrance/exit tunnel and
the crush barriers was made.

Site measurements were obtained and photographs were taken.

Barrier tests by Mr Eastwood and his team were witnessed which revealed that the
barriers tested met the load requirements for type 'A' installations as shown in the
relevant Code of Practice.

Barrier heights and spacings did not fully agree with the recommendations in the
     Code of Practice 1Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds1.

                TESTED BY:        EASTWOOD & PARTNERS, KINGFIELD ROAD,SHEFFIELD      (LAST TEST JULY 1988)

                INTRODUCTION

                I visited the Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground on the 16th, 17th and 18th of
                April 1989 at the request of Mr S Nattrass, Area Director, H & SE, South Yorkshire
                & Humberside Area following the tragedy which occurred on the 15th of April 1989.

                The initial purpose of my visit was to assist in investigating the incident with
                particular reference to the crush barriers.

                Other members of H & SE staff present during the first 3 days of the site
                investigation are shown on the attached list.

                During the visits I spoke to Mr D Perchon. (Director - Health & Consumer Services,
                Sheffield MBC),              (SEHO, Sheffield MBC) and            (EHO, Sheffield
                MBC) .

                Mr W Eastwood and Mr R Eastwood of Messrs Eastwood & Partners, Kingfield Road,
                Sheffield were also present on site on the 17th of April 1989 and conducted a number
                of tests on the crush barriers which were witnessed.

                CRUSH BARRIERS

                Two types of barrier were seen in the central area, the older type having half 'A'
                frames embedded in the concrete steps were reported to have been installed in 1966.

                New types of barrier utilizing steel box section support pillars had been installed
                at several locations and again the pillars were embedded in the concrete steps.
                Both types of barriers carried horizontal tubular type handrails of between 60 and
                75 mm diameter. In general the spacing across each handrail between vertical
            £   supports was of the order of 1.23 m (7 ft 6 inches). Barrier heights varied
       ''       between 0.87 and 1.17 m and the corresponding details for each barrier in the
O' '            central pen are given in Table 1 and on Ralph Brade & Associates drawing No.1340/02.

                Barrier height recommended by the Code of Practice 'Guide to safety at Sports Grounds
                should be a minimum of 1 . 0 2 metres with a preferred height of 1 . 1 metres.
                                                           1
•
    A sits plan and end elevation is shown in Fig. 1 which also indicates spacings
    between barriers etc and confirms the position of the two sections which collapsed
    at barrier no. 124A. Similar details are also included in Ralph Brade & Associates
    Drawing No. 1340/02.
    A sectional view of the entry/exit tunnel is shown in Fig. 2 -and in Ralph Brade &
    Associates Drawing No. 1340/03.
    A general view of the collapsed section of barrier 124A is shown in Fig. 3 where
    it can be seen that both of the horizontal tubes had been severely bent prior to
    the bending over and collapse of the leg supports. The bottom ends of the latter
    had remained in position in the ground although the right hand front column at the
    end of the barrier had broken away a small section of the concrete step.

    The failure at the top of the central leg of this section of barrier designated
    124A/1 is shown in Figs 4 and 4A where it can be seen that the strap has remained
    in position although distorted and the rear leg has t o m from a point adjacent to
    the lower bolt hole. The horizontal tubes which were badly corroded in the areas
    underneath each strap at the top of the respective pillars appear to have fractured
    after the support pillars have been bent over and although the tube section is
    considerably thinned it appears to have been capable of carrying sufficient shear
    force at the strap positions to enable the vertical pillars to be bent over under
    the pressure generated by the crowd.

    An inner view of the top end of the right hand pillar at connection 124A/4 (see
    Fig. 5) indicates the extent of corrosion underneath the strap and underneath the
    pillar head behind the gusset plate and again confirms the tearing mode of failure
    from the inner edge of the rear pillar at the section through the lower bolt hole.
    The metal angles forming the legs were nominally 50 mm x 50 mm x 6 mm thickness
    (2 inch x 2 inch x 0.25 inches).

    The fracture of the tube section from connection 124A/4 is shown in Fig. 6 where
    it can be seen that the end of the tube has been bent and approximately half its
    section has broken away at the time it separated from the pillar connecting strap.

    The tube which was originally in position between connections 124A/2 and 124A/3 is
    shown lying on the terrace steps in Fig. 7 and the fractures at the corresponding
    ends of this tube are shown in Figs 8 and 9 respectively. The grass at the left
    hand side of the fracture in Fig. 8 confirms that the tube was recovered from the
    pitch after the incident.

    The top of pillar 124A/2 is shown in Fig. 10 where extensive corrosion can again be
    seen, particularly at the gusset plate which has corroded through. This connector
    had been repaired at some time during its life and it can be seen that a section of
    steel tubing had been inserted inside the original tubing. The insert was found
    to be 50 mm OD x 35 mm ID and was approximately 127 mm long (2.0 inches OD x
    1.375 inches ID x 5 inches long).

    BARRIER TESTS

    During my visit to the football ground on the 16th of April 1989 I was shown a test
    rig used for load testing of the crush barriers under the supervision of
    Mr W Eastwood of Eastwood & Partners, Kingfield Road, Sheffield who were the
    Engineering Consultants to the Club and carried out routine tests annually on
    barriers at the terraces. A general view of the front section of the test rig is
    shown in Fig. 11. The front pusher arms of the rig are designed with various
    fulcrum points to enable a single load from each of the main pusher arms to be
    distributed to 4 points equally spaced along each section of barrier rail. The



                                          2
•
    main pusher arms were driven forward by a pair of hydraulic rams which were
    pressurized from a small hand operated pump unit with calibrated load gauge.
    A copy of a calibration certificate for the test rig is shown at Appendix I.

    During testing, the forward load on the barrier was gradually increased to a figure
    of 1.4 tons in each of the main pusher arms and simulated a load of 400 lbs/ft run
    across the barrier as recommended for class A barriers in the Code of Practice
    'Guide to Safety atSports Grounds' at Annex C paragraph 1. The forward deflection
    of the barrier railwas measured as shown in Fig. 12 and the tests were conducted
    in accordance with the Code of Practice.

    The left hand end of barrier 136 in the south west pen adjacent to the central pen
    was found to deflect by approximately 16 mm in the forward direction on application
    of the test load. The barrier recovered fully at the end of the test.

    Similar tests were performed on barrier 137 in the central pen area and this was
    found to deflect by 13 mm on application of the test load (400 lbs/ft run).
    Barrier 137 recovered fully at the end of the test.

    A further load was applied to this barrier to initiate its failure and at
    500 lbs/ft run the deflection was 20 mm which gradually increased to 29 mm. The
    barrier recovered to 11 nm and had undoubtedly failed under this load. The
    condition of the barrier after this overload test is shown in Fig. 13. Initiation
    of fracture/tearing had been produced at the central leg immediately below the
    gusset plate and adjacent to the lower of the 2 rivets in the rear section of the
    leg as shown in Fig. 14. The commencement of twisting of the leg is shown in
    Fig. 15.

    Further tests were also carried out on barrier no. 128 which was seen to have
    already been damaged. One of its tubes was bent outwards by approximately 55 mm
    and was also bent downwards by approximately 25 mm close to its centre. These
    tests were again carried out in accordance with the guidance given in the Code of
    Practice and at a load of 1.4 tons (400 lbs/ft run) the rail deflected by a further
    16 mm and returned to approximately 4 mm. These figures indicate a 75% recovery
    as required by the Code of Practice.

    The load was then increased to 1.75 tons and later to 2.1 tons where a deflection
    of 40 nm was recorded together with a recovery back to   13 mm. This severe over­
    load was equivalent to approximately 600 lbs/ft run on the barrier but its recovery
    was outside the recommended levels.

    CONCLUSIONS/BARRIER TESTING

    The barriers tested were seen to meet the load testing requirements of the Code of
    Practice 'Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds' Appendix C Para 1 for class 'A' type.
    The results of tests carried out in July 1988 on the barriers in the central pen
    also confirm that the units in this area met the load test requirements of the
    Code of Practice at the time of their last test although barrier 124A did not
    recover fully until the third of the 3 tests recommended by the Code of Practice.
    (See Appendix II).

    SITE DATA

    As indicated earlier in the report a site plan to scale is shown in Fig. 1 and a
    sectional plan of the entry/exit tunnel is shown in Fig. 2. These details are also
    shown in Ralph Brade & Associates Drawings Nos. 1340/02 & 1340/03 respectively.


                                          3
The site plan indicates that many of the barrier spacings were outside those
recommended by the Code of Practice where it is suggested that gaps between
barriers should not exceed 1.4 m width.

The slope of the terrace was found to be approximately 14 degrees and Table 1 on
page 37 of the Code of Practice recommends a horizontal distance between barriers
in peak viewing areas for the type 'A' barrier of 3.8 m at a terrace gradient of
15 degrees. Examination of the site plan confirms that in general the barriers
were arranged within this figure and consecutive gaps between rows of barriers
were in accordance with Fig. 3 on page 36 of the Code except at the areas immediately
in front of the entry/exit tunnel area.

Steps on the terraces were found to be approximately 75 mm depth with 380mm treads.
These were within the limits laid down in the Code of Practice.

CONCLUSIONS/TERRACE LAYOUT

The spacing of the barriers and gaps between barriers did not fully comply with the
recommendations laid down in the Code of Practice 'Guide to Safety at Sports
Grounds1. The areas giving rise for concern were those directly in front of the
entry/exit tunnel which was seen to have a down gradient of approximately 1 0 degrees
for a distance of some 8 - 1 0 m leading to the terrace doorway openings.

PEN CAPACITY

The area of the central pen was approximately 3      square metres and allowing 54
persons per 1 0 square metres gives a maximum capacity of 2 0 5 * persons. The rated
capacity for the pen was stated at 2 2 0 0 persons on the drawing of the site provided
by the Club.

RECOMMENDATIONS

If the area is to be re-used as terracing it is recommended that a full site survey
of the whole of this terrace and the other terrace at the opposite end of the
football stadium should be made by a competent authority.

Where necessary, it is recommended that barrier heights should be increased slightly
in order to comply with the guidance set out in the Code of Practice 'Guide to
Safety at Sports Grounds' and any barriers which are found to be suspect should be
either strengthened or replaced with barriers of the new design. The latter should
preferably be fitted with flat or box section top rails which should be of the order
of 100 mm vertical depth. Barriers heights should be a minimum of 1.02 metres with
a preferred height of 1 . 1 metres.
Where necessary the spacing of barriers should be adjusted to suit the
recommendations given in the Code of Practice and additional barriers should be
provided across the entry/exit tunnel opening area.

The arrangements for the control of spectators in the area between the turnstiles
and the tunnel to ensure that the capacity of the central pen does not exceed the
rated capacity should be reviewed and amended accordingly. In my opinion the
capacity of this section should be reduced and at least be rounded off to the
nearest hundred below the calculated capacity.

    FUTURE ACTION

    You may wish to arrange confirmation of the above recommendations with the Football
    Club via the H & SE Area Staff and the Local Authority as soon as the official
    enquiry is completed and if the terrace is to remain, most certainly before it is
    re-used.

    It is anticipated that metallurgical work and an engineering assessment of the
    design and strength of the failed barrier will be undertaken by H & SE RLSD staff
    in due course. This work will be the subject of a separate report.

 S u m m ar y
 Examination of the outer gates associated with the entrance to the terrace^
 turnstiles revealed some minor damage to bolts and catches of unknown origin.

 Examination of 3 folding type 'Bolton1 gates (A, B & C) revealed general wear
 in accordance with their age. All gates were functioning correctly with the
 exception of the engagement of centre bolts in floor locating recesses. Some
 routine maintenance was required which included the provision of colt locating
 plates at ground level at the centre of Gate 'B ' and frame/wall securing bolts
 at the left-hand side of Gate 'C'.

         SUEJECT:   EXAMINATION OF GATES AT WEST SIDE OF GROUND

         USER:      SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FC, HILLSBOROUGH, SHEFFIELD


         INTRODUCTION



         I visited the Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground curing tne week commencing

         the 24 April 1989 to continue investigations at your request and m        accordance

         with the wishes of the judicial enquiry team headed cv Justice Taylor.



          I was present on site between the 24 and 28 April witn the exception of Thursday

          the 27 and on each occasion I was accompanied by                , Principal

          Specialist Inspector, Construction Engineering, North East FCG.     During the week

          I examined the gates at the west side of the football ground and in particular

          those associated with entrance to the terrace/ standing area.



          I also examined turnstiles 17 - 23 (A - G) on which I have prepared a separate

          report.    I also assisted           in the examination of the west wall and the

          brickwork above the aforementioned turnstiles, the results of these examinations

          will be reported separately by


                                                   1
OUTER GATES



The layout    of the gates and turnstiles at the west side (Leppmgs Lane) end of

the ground    is shown in Figure 1 which was based on Drawing 6708/8A by

Messrs Eastwood & Partners, dated 3 June 1985.     Furtner layout data is given m
Ralph 3rade & Associates Drawing No. 1340/0$-.


A general view of outer gates 1 - 6    taken from the south stand roadway inside

the ground    is shown in Figure 2.   Gates 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 were all found to be

approximately   1.55 m (5') wide whilst Gate No. 4 was approximately 2.74m    (9')

wide.



All the gates were approximately 2.1 m (7') high and were supported cr. a series

of cast iron pillars set in the ground.     Several of these pillars were leaning

slightly inwards and the pillars at Gates 4 and 5 were leaning to the lert by

approximately 7.5 cm (3") in their total height.     Other measurements confirmed

that the pillars associated with Gates 1 and 2 were leaning inwards by approxi­

mately 2.5 cm (1").   The pillar associated with Gate No. 4 was leaning inwards

by approximately 5 cm (2") and the pillar associated with Gate No. 5 was

leaning inwards by approximately 1 cm (0.4") .    The pillar at Gate No. o apceare

to be vertical in both directions.



Examination of the securing arrangements for each pair of gates indicated that

at Gates 1 and 2, the misalignment had been in existence for sortie time and the

central clasp/padlock feature would not engage.     Consequently, at these gates

an alternative clasp/padlock arrangement had been provided on the outer face

immediately below the original clasp.     (See Figure 3).
The floor bolting arrangements for Gates 1 and 2 are shown in Figure 4 where it

can be seen that the recess in the floor plate was full of debris and required

cleaning out.   Some damage was noted in the central vertical rail of Gate No. 1

in that it had been bent towards Gate No. 2 at some time in the past, presumably

by the gates being forced inwards whilst locked.



The central securing arrangements for Gates 3/4 were similar to those at Gate 1/2

and had been modified some time ago.    (See Figure 5).



The floor bolting arrangements fcr Gates 3/4 are shewn in Figure o where it can

be seen that the 22 mm diameter x 312 mm long (0.875" diameter x 32" long) steel

bar had been bent at a point approximately 20 cm (3") from its lower end.

It was also noted that the upper clasp/hinge point for the bolt had been opened

up by approximately 12 mm (0.5").    The central locating plate fcr this bolt was

almost fully covered by tarmacadam and it would appear that the bolt had not been

engaged in the plate for some considerable time.    Again the central hole was full

of debris and a deep groove in the tarmac, some 0.3 - 0.45 m long (12 - 18 inches
long) produced by the bolt suggested that the gate had been forced open recentiv.
This event had probably caused the damage to the bolt.
Although the original clasp arrangement at Gates 5/6 would still engage, a

separate chain and padlock had been provided as shewn in Figure 7.    The central

floor bolting arrangements for Gates 5/6 are shown in Figure 8 which again

reveals that the bolt had been bent at its lower end and would not locate in

the floor plate recess.



The sheeted fence and gate dividing the main turnstile access areas was approxi­

mately 2.18 m (7' 2") high at its mid point.    This fence exhibited considerable

damage in the form of denting along its whole length and numerous vertical

score marks were seen.    The latter suggested that persons had climbed over the
fence recently.    The locking arrangements for the gate were m   good oraer and

are illustrated in Figure 9.



A brief examination was made of outer gates 7 - 1 2 and these were found to be

in better condition than Gates 1 - 5 in that all original securing arrangements

were in good order and all central bolts would locate in their respective floor

plates.   Some debris was present in the floor plate recesses which required

routine maintenance.



An examination was made of the 3 folding 'Bolton' gates designated A, B and C

in the area.     Gate A was in relatively good condition although worn.   All its

features were in order and were working.



Gate 3 was also in reasonable condition and although its locking reatures were

considerably worn, all were functioning with the exception of the lower centra.

bolts which would not fully engage in the recesses owing to decns.        The maximum

ocening width of the door was found to be 4.17 m (13.7') and the heigr.t to the

underside of the door frame was 3.34 m (11').     The overall height to tne tcc or

the fencing above the gate was 4.19 m (14') and it was noted that tne concrete

slab capping had been removed and was on the floor outside the rear or turnstile

No. 16.



Although the vertical right-hand steel joist forming the door frame appeared to

be adequately secured to the building associated with turnstile No. 16, the

left-hand vertical joist forming the door frame was not properly secured at the

upper of its 3 securing bolts approximately 3.35 m (11') above ground level in

that only a 1 2 mm bolt and nut were used and this was seen to be at least 6 mm

(0.25") loose.
Examination of Gate C revealed similar wear conditions on locking features etc

to those encountered on Gates A and B.     A general view of Gate C frcm inside

the yard behind turnstiles A - G is shewn in Figure 10.      The upper, lower and

central locking arrangements for Gate C are shown in Figures 11, 12 and 13

rescectively.     Although proper floor recesses were provided for the central

bolts, they were full cf debris and in need of routine maintenance.



Again, the right-hand vertical steel joist forming the door frame as viewed

frcm the inside appeared to be adequately secured tc the building behind turnstile

G, hcwever the left-hand vertical steel joist forming the dccr frame was not

secured at its lower position (see Figure 14) and at      its mid point cruv a 9 mm

(0.275") diameter bolt was used which was seen to be      loose.   See Figure 15.



The upper securing point of the gate framework was not used as the wall in this

area was not high enough.     A general view of Gate C from outside is shewn m

Figure 16.



During my examination of the area around Gate C I noted that the top 9 courses

of brickwork forming a pillar at the left-hand side of the gate as viewed from

the outside were loose and were only held in position by a single 9 mm (0.375")

diameter bolt which held the adjacent fence section in position.       The coping stone

on top of this pillar was also loose as were all the      other 5 copings on similar

pillars above turnstiles A - G.     Figure 17 shows the   loose brickwork at the top

left of Gate C.



The brickwork and copings at the right-hand side of Gate C as viewed rrcm the

outside were also in a poor condition and can be seen in Figure 18.        The condition

of this brickwork and the wall in the direction of the south stand are the subject

of a separate report.
     Whilst carrying out my investigations of the gates at the west end of tne ground

      I was asked to demonstrate the condition of the walls in the area or Gate C and

      was able to show that the 9 courses of brickwork forming the pillar at the upper

      left-hand side of the gate, together with the coping stone could easily be moved and
my opinion could easily be
   / pushed to the ground. I demonstrated that by pushing tne wall at_ _.e j_j_ght—hand

      side of the gate it was possible to induce considerable movement m   tne wall &■_

      a point some 30 m towards the south stand thus demonstrating its instability.

      As mentioned above this matter will be discussed in more detail in a separate

      report.



      CONCLUSIONS



      Examination of the cuter gates associated with the entrance to tne terrace

      turnstiles at the west side of the ground revealed some minor damage to colts

      and catches of unknown origin.



      Examination of the 3 folding type 'Holton' gates (A, B and C) revealed genera^

      wear in accordance with their age.    All the gates were runctioning correctly

      with the exception of the engagement of some of the centre bolts m    tneir

      respective floor locating recesses.



      Some routine maintenance was required which included the provision of bolt

      locating plates at ground level at the centre of Gate B and frame/wail securing

      bolts at the left-hand side of Gate C.



      RECOMMENDATIONS



      It is recommended that all damaged floor bolts on the gates should be repaired

      and all locating holes should be regularly cleaned out.    Bolt locating plates

      should be provided in the floor at the centre of Gate B.
All dcor frames should be examined for adequate securing to respective walls

and bolts of adequate size should be installed.



Repairs to walls etc are the subject of a separate report.

SUBJECT:        EXAMINATION OF TURNSTILES A-G
USER:           SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB, HILLSBCRCUGH, SHEFFIELD

INTRODUCTION



I visited the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club ground during the week commencing

the 24th of April 1989 to continue investigations at your request and m accordance

with the wishes of the judicial enquiry team headed cy Justice Taylor.



I was present on site between the 24th and 28th of April with the exception of

Thursday the 27th of April and on each occasion I was accompanied by                         ,

Principal Specialist Inspector, Construction Engineering, North East FCG.           During

the week I examined turnstiles 17-23 (A-G) and this report contains the results or

this examination.



TURNSTILES



The general layout of the 7 turnstiles A-G which feed the west terrace at the football

ground is shown in Fig. 1 of my earlier report NE/FCG 14/M/18/89 and details are

confirmed in Messrs Ralph Braid & Associates drawing no. 1340/Q^.




                                            1
A general view of the turnstiles from the approach side is shown m    tig. 2 and rrom

the egress side in Fig. 3.



All the turnstiles were of considerable age and were noted to have been manufactured

by Messrs W D Ellison & Co Ltd, Irlam, Manchester.    Details of the turnstiles and

their method of operation are shown in the makers trade literature at Appendix 1.



All the turnstiles were of the low pattern type and turnstiles A, C, D, E, F and G

were fitted with convex arms.    Turnstile B was fitted with straight arms.



                                                                                    *' i   *
I took detailed dimensions in all the turnstile enclosures and assisted with

functicnal tests of each ’
                         unit.



All the turnstile ratchets were working satisfactorily and although worn, all the

foot pedals and footstep motion cams were working correctly.     Some of the lower

mechanisms were in need of lubrication, however, this did not prevent the mechanisms

from operating satisfactorily and allowing at least 20 persons per minute to pass

through each turnstile.



I noted the patent numbers on the turnstile^ which were shown as 653191 and 653226

and were marked on several of the mechanical counter cover plates.     The serial

numbers were also marked in this area but were only present on turnstile C (serial

no. 14038) , turnstile D (serial no. 13263) and tumstile G (serial no. 14039) .



1 noted that all the doors at the front of the turnstile enclosure were approximately

0.63 m (25 inches) wide and the opening widths were between 465 mm and 555 mm

(18.3 inches and 21.8 inches).    The heights of the openings were approximately

2 m (79 inches).


                                         2
 The passageways through each turnstile were approximately 2 m   (6 ft; 9 inches) long

 and 0.5 m (20 inches) wide.   The ceiling height in each passageway was

 approximately 2.25 m (7 ft 5 inches).



 The height of the turnstile tables was approximately 1.04 m (3 ft 5 inches).     The

heights of the turnstile arms and their lower skirt plates etc ar.d the gaps between

 the ends of the arms and adjacent walls in individual passageways are shown in

Table 1.



Vertical blocks of weed were secured to the walls at the entry side of the

turnstiles in all except passageway C where a box had been constructed on the wail

opposite the centre of the turnstile spindle.    All blocks of wood in turnstiles

except C were approximately 14 cm x 14 cm x 61 cm long (5.5 inches x 5.5 inches x

2 ft long) which were positioned with their lower ends approximately 38 cm (15 inches

above flcor level and their central axis approximately 30 cm (one foot) forward cf

the turnstile axis.



The box mounted on the wall opposite the rotating arms of turnstile C was 46 cm

(18 inches) long on its front face and 61 cm (2 ft) long on its rear face.      The

box was 24 cm (9.5 inches) deep and projected from the wall by approximately 10 cm

(4 inches).   The top face of this box was approximately level with the top face of

the turnstile arm.    (See Fig. 6).



Additional wooden blocks were also fitted on the walls opposite the turnstile arms

in passageways A and B only.   These blocks were mounted on the turnstile side of

the aforementioned vertical wooden blocks and had curved form varying from

7.5 cm (3 inches) thickness at the ingress end to 9.5 cm (3.75 inches) thickness at

a point opposite the turnstile axis centre.   These blocks were approximately 49 cm

(19.25 inches) long and 14 cm (5.5 inches) deep and reduced the gap at the end of




                                         3
*




     the turnstile arm to approximately 2.5 cm (one inch).



     Photographs of turnstiles A to G taken from the egress side show the aforementioned

     features together with the respective footstep cams and pedal counterweights etc.

     (See Figures 4-10).



     I removed several of the foot pedals from the tarnstiles and two of these from

    ’
    units 3 and C are shown in Figs. 11 and 12 respectively.



    Pedal return action was achieved by a counterweight mounted on the respective arm,

    these weights can be seen in Figs. 11 and 12.



    OTHER OBSERVATIONS



    During my examination of the turnstiles I noted that an electronic counting system

    had been installed and that duplicate switching arrangements were present on the

    majority of the units.



    Small roller type limit switches were noted in positions immediately above the

    central boss carrying the turnstile arm adjacent to the main rotating shaft.   These

    switches were arranged such that they would be actuated at each quarter turn of

    the turnstile.   The central switches at units C, D and E were the only ones

    connected.



    Additional rat-tail switches were seen to have been positioned on the wooden frames

    at the egress side of the turnstile block and were actuated at each indexing motion

    by the respective turnstile arm.   However, these switches were disconnected and

    had broken tails at turnstiles C, D and E, they appeared to be connected and



                                           4
 functioning correctly at the other turnstiles A, B, F and G.



Load,'pedal resistance testing and throughput rate testing of the turnstiles together

with checks on the mechanical and computer counting systems are the subject of a

separate RLSD report.



It was also noted that photoelectric emitters ar.d sensors had been arranged in pairs

across each turnstile passageway at positions above the turnstile arms as well as at

table level at the egress side.   Examination of these devices indicated that many

had been either removed or disconnected and in some cases the wiring had been cut.

The latter was noted on the over,/turnstile sensors at units C and F.



CONCLUSIONS



Examinations of turnstiles A-G confirmed that although old, somewhat worn and in many

cases in need of lubrication/routine maintenance etc.    all were working

satisfactorily and would each allow at least 20 persons per minute throughput.



Data and load/pedal release pressure tests, throughput      and computer count tests

are the subject of a separate RLSD report.



RECOMMENDATIONS



It is recommended that the gaps between turnstile arms and adjacent walls should be

reduced to the minimum practicable safe dimension in order to prevent persons

gaining access without actuating the turnstile mechanism.



In my opinion the over/turnstile photoelectric devices should be reinstated to detect

persons climbing over without actuating the mechanism, alternatively, full height




                                        5
turnstiles (floor to ceiling) should be installed.



Where necessary, individual turnstiles should be repaired at their broken table

supporting pillars in order to improve rigidity and several of the ’
                                                                   units required

re-levelling.



End float in all the turnstile spindles should be checked and adjusted accordingly

as many exhibited approximately 4 mm lift.



All ratchets, pedal mechanisms and cams should be suitably lubricated at appropriate

inter/a Is.

and one Barrier. This Turnstile has been specially
designed to prevent more than one person passing
through for each payment. It proves its efficiency                r*ispss

  I also examined gates 3 and 4 leading from the central terrace area onto the

  pitcn.   These gates were of similar construction and opened outwards to the

  left as viewed from the terrace.



  The effaczive width of the gate openings were found to be 0.81 - 0.82 m

  (^2 inches approx) for gate 3 and 0.77 - 0.79 m (30.75 inches aporox) for gate 4.

 The gaps in the low wall at the gate positions were found to be 1.0 m wide

  (39.4 inches) and the walls were approximately 1.07 m high (42 inches) from the

 lowest terrace step.




 The errective opening heights at the two gates were found to be 2.11 - 2.16 m

  (83 - 85 inches).




 It was noted that the step configurations at the two gates were slightly

 different.   Both level concreted approach areas (plinths) commenced at the

 third terrace step level but at gate 3, two risers of 0.165 m (6.5 inches)

 and 0.22 m (8.6 inches) with an intermediate tread of 0.480 m (19 inches)
                                 c t Q.
 were seen.  (See FIGS 16, Negs &904»-;kd67‘-3-8-) . The approach plinth at gate 3 was

 j-ound to be 1.185 m (46.75 inches) wide and the step-up from the lowest terrace step

 at each side was 0.340 m (13.5 inches high).

                                              1
    At gate 4 the level concreted approach area (plinth) again commenced from

    step 3 of the terrace and extended forwards to the wall by a distance of

    0.86 m (34 inches) to a single step up through the gateway which was 0.340 m

    (13.5 inches) high.   The concreted plinth area to gate 4 was 1.125 m (44.25 inches)

    wide and the step-up from the lowest terrace step at each side was approximately

    0.190 m (7.5 inches).       See FIGS 17 - 19 which confirm the step arrangements at

    gate 3 and 4.

    PEN CAPACITY



    The area of the central pen was approximately 376 square metres and allowing

    54 persons per 10 square metres gives a maximum capacity of 2030 persons.          The

    rated capacity for the pen was stated a~ 2200 persons on the drawing of the

    site provided by the club.



    In view of the variations in barrier openings in the central pen, further
                                                                                                 c / L
    calculations have been made of the pen capacity based on the recommendations             ^   ^ ”

    dC Para 286 of the Code of Practice.



    The total length of barriers in the left-hand side of the pen behind gate 3

    including the 14.3 metres of the front fence was      approximately 45.5 metres,

    giving 45.5 x 3.8 x 5.4 =934 persons.



    The total length of barriers in the right-hand side of the pen behind gate 4

    including the 14.4 metres of the front fence was      approximately 48.3 metres

giving 48.3 x 3.8 x 5.4 = 991 persons.


                                                 2

The revised calculated capacity for the central pen was therefore S34 + 991 = 1925

persons.

       there a similar argument that applies t
At the moment Dr Dickie of Manchester University is doing some
work on this subject for the Home Office, although he is looking
at the forces which a limited number of person could induce on a
barrier should they deliberately try to wreck it. I imagine the
measuring techniques he is using would be relevant to the above
problem. This project could also help decide the maximum length of
straight corridors, tunnels, gangways etc, to limit the pressures
which could build up when these become overcrowded.

3.   Degree ftf iniurv which persons could sustain  It is
important we should know what sort of injuries persons could
receive from various levels of pressure. This information would
help decide the shape, height and spacing of barriers. I
understand Medical Division is looking at this, but I have seen no
response so far.

4.   Testing of barriers The present test required in
"Appendix C" does not appear to be a sensible practical one. The
theoretical concept of first loading the barriers to take up any
slack in the frame and then testing within the elastic limit seems
proper and correct. However the repeated loads required in the
Appendix (that is the 3 loading cycles) to simulate the surge load
and then looking for a set percentage recovery over all the 3
cycles does not bear critical engineering scrutiny.

A more practical approach would be (a) to first make a visual
examination of the barrier rejecting those which appeared
unsatisfactory (b) apply the load and sustain it for a limited
period until all movement had ceased, (c) Remove the load and
measure any permanent deflection, (d) The cause of this permanent
deflection should be considered with those barriers which had
deflections which could not be satisfactorily accounted for being
rejected, (e) Finally^the load should be reapplied and the barrier
checked to ensure if^behaved within the elastic limit. Those that
did not being rejected. The supervisor of the test should also be
satisfied that this elastic deformation was also within acceptable
limits. All the deflection measurements should be taken on the
frames, not the handrail, although the loading should be on the
handrails so closely simulating a U.D Load.

It is important that the percentage overload used in the test
should be high enough to compensate for the dynamic effects of a
surge. However as at present, there is not suitable information
relating to the dynamic surge pressures to the value of the
percentage overload, this too should be the subject of a research
proj ect.

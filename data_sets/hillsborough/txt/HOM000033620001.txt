           BACKGROUND
           U nder the present law, the general position- is that a plaintiff who suffers a
           recognisable psychiatric illness3 as a result of another person’s death, injury or
           impenlm cnt cannot recover damages for negligence; (even where the defendant ought
           to have foreseen that his or her conduct mighr cause the psychiatric illness) unless
           the plaintiff can satisfy three main requirements:
           • that he or she had a close tie of love and affection with, the person killed, injured
             or imperilled;
           • that he or she was close to the “accident1' in time and: space;
           • that he or she directly perceived the “accident" rather than, for example, hearing
             about it from a diird person.

           In addition, the present law imposes two further restrictions,.which apply generally
           ro claims for negligently inflicted psychiatric illness:
           • the psychiatric illness must have been induced by a ‘‘shock”;
           • the psychiatric illness does not result from the defendant’s own death, injury or
             imperilmenL

WHY IS R E F O R M N E E D E D ?
A very large majority o f those who responded to our consultation paper4 considered
that reform of this area is needed and that die above restrictions on recovery produce
arbitrary and unjust results. Examples of this are:
• A mother was told about a car accident which, happened close tc- he?; home til
   which one of her children was killed and others seriously injured. She rushed to
   the hospital to which her family had been taken and saw them within two hours of
   the accident.5 She was able to recover for the psychiatric illness which she
   suffered as a result, because she saw the immediate aftermath, of the accident- But
   the relatives of those who died at the Hillsborough foorbai! stadium disaster in.
   1989, some of whom saw the tragedy unfold on live television and later went to
   the stadium to identify the deceased, were -not- able to .recover for their
   consequential psychiatric illness. They were nor. close to, and did not perceive
   with their unaided senses»the accident or its immediate aftermath.9
• A father who suffered psychiatric illness on the death of bis son. rhree daw after
   the boy was injured in a road accident was unable to re-cover damages tram the
   negligent driver. ■ He had gone, directly to the hospital ro which his son had. been
   taken and had sat at his bedside in intensive cars for i c three days before die
   child’s life support system was switched off.? But he was unable to recover
   damages because he did not see the immediate aftermath o f the accident and his
   illness was not “shock-induced". Had his son died within a few hours ot arrival at
   the hospital, and the father had then seen his body, he would probably have been
   able to recover.
• If a wife were to witness % car accident caused pnm aniy through the negligent
   driving of her husband bur partly through the negligence o f a. second driver, she
   would be able to recover full damages from the second driver for psychiatric
   illness suffered as a result: of .her husband’s injury. But under the present law. the
   second driver .could not claim any contribution in respect of those, damages’from
   the husband, even though the husband was primarily responsible for the. accident,
   because the husband would nor. owe a duty o f care tn respect of psychiatric illness
   suffered as a result o f his own injury.

0 At one extreme, all liability for psychiatric illness suffered as a result of another
  person’s death, injury or imperilmerit could be abolished On our consultation
  exercise only a very small minority of consultees supported this approach. It was
  thought to be our of keeping with contemporary me.di.cai .understanding ot
  psychiatric illness and it would exclude many deserving cases.
0 At the other extreme, all the special restrictions could be removed, so that liability
  for psychiatric illness was brought into line with liability for physical injury, and
  the plaintiff would only have to prove chat his or her illness was reasonably
  foreseeable. This approach, received more' support from consultees. However, our
  review''of the medical research into psychiatric illness has led us to believe that
  some special restrictions on-liability are still ncccssary, un order to avoid the risk ot
  opening the “floodgates ot litigation".

                        0 We therefore- fa v o u r a m id-position.. In our view - and rhis was widely
                          supported on consultation - the most rational and fair way to Siinir liability is by
                          reference to the- relationship between the plain off m d the' person killed., injured or
                          imperilled.

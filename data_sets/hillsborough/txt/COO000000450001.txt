     The Prime Minister has seen your Secretary
of State's letter of 10 July to the Lord Preside
She was content with his proposal that the
national licensing authority should take the
form of a quango rather than to be operated
as an extension of a Government Department.
She stressed, however, the need to ensure
that the quango does not turn itself into
a pressure group for additional expenditure
or engage in empire building.

     I am copying this letter to the Private
Secretaries to members of H Committee, Murdo
Maclean (Chief Whip's Office) and to Sir Robin
Butler and First Parliamentary Counsel.




                     (ANDREW TURNBULL)

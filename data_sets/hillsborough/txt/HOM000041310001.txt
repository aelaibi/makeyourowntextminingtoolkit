  moderately light,            with    the m a j o r i t y of vehicles         being      private    cars.

 Almost all       the    cars were displaying              colours associa ti ng            them with

 Liverpool      Foo tball       Club.      As    time went      on,     traffic    became very heavy

 and there were          periods where           traffic was       in fact at a standstill,

 backing up from the             traffic        island at the new Stock sb ri dg e by-pass.

 Between 11.20 am and 2 . 3 0 pm (1430)                   we    checked 53 vehicles,            being a

 mixture of coaches an d mini                   buses.    O n the       coaches    checked there wer

 no drinks found a n d only 7 persons were                        found to have no tickets.

 Due to our      location,        and the fact that             those 7 persons were amongst

 organised groups,             it seemed        impractical       to    prevent them continuing

 their journey,         but     they were       suitably advised.              They all hoped to

 purchase tickets          from       touts.      In the mini          buses   checked,     so far as wc

 could as c e rt ai n    it a pp e a r e d that      persons were          in possession of the

 correct a pp r o p r i a t e    tickets.        On some       of the mini        buses    cans of

 drinks were        located.       These were few           in number,         and after     the

 occupants     had been str on gl y advised,                the   drinks were surrendered.

 The   contents were          poured away,        and the      em pt y cans      collected and

 deposited in the w as te             container at C l a y w h e e l s Lane Garage.                None of

the persons «on the             coaches,       or in the mini          buses were      under the

influence of drink and                there were no pro blems whatso eve r with their                          j

behaviour.       The     oc cu pa nt s were       obviously       in high spirits,           but what     I    j
would consider          normal     for persons a t t e n d i n g        this type of function.

During the whole          of    the    time we were        checkin g vehicles,            we had no

                  such that       it was   impossible       to get air         time to clarify from ground

                  deploying       elsewhere.       Also,    the m e s s a g e s     being              passed on the air did '

                  not seem to       indicate a s i tu at ion        such as         was found tohave occurred,                       i



                  A l t h o u g h the time was     now past 3 . 1 5      pm    (1515)            there were       still a numt

                  upset at not being al lo w e d acces s             on the       production of their tickets.'

                    realised that someone must have been                         injured.           On looking down the

                    small    road w h i c h         runs a l o ng sid e the     football       ground I saw that there

                   from my pos it io n              could not tell what          it was.        I left my serial          in

                  \^n entering           the       large access     gate,     I saw a large number of injured

                   of a male who was                ob vi ous ly dead.        I returne d to my serial and

                   what help they              could.       I made my way        further       into the area,        still

                   trying     to as s e s s what          had occurred.         Duri ng       this time 3 ambulances

                   had ar ri v ed be hi n d me,             near to the       large    gate,    and some      injured

                   persons were           being m o v e d towards           them by either          police   officers or

                   the   injured         persons friends.

                   It was during           this      time   that    I met S u pe ri n t e n d e n t Marshall.        He

                  to gain acc ess           to the ground area,              this     being due to the        large metal

                  bars wh ic h st r e t c h e d across             the top of the         large access gate,          and

                  wh ich    carry the          running      gear   for the      sliding       gates.     I considered this

           message    regarding        the        b reathing a pp ara tu s,                    and saw a member of the

           found all     to be too           low to allow access ,                        for       the same       reason as

           initially stated.              I again             returned to S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Marshall and

           passed on this           information.                   He then         i n s t r u c t e d me to begin moving

           injured persons          out      of the area and                     t o war ds        the ambulances.          I

           therefore went a r o u n d the area and a r r a n g e d                                 for Police Officers and

           other    persons who were a dm ini st eri ng                           first aid,           to begin to move the

           injured persons           towards           the access              gate.          As    I wal ke d around,          I saw

           other dead        persons      lying          in the area,               c o ve re d by coats etc.               Even at

           this    point,     I was    still           not fully a wa re                of what        had occurred,            but

           realised the        persons were suffeirng                            crush        injuries.          At one    point,

           whilst near       the access             gate,          I saw that           fans were              preventing an

           ambulance    en t% ri ng       the top of the a c c e s s                      road,       and made my way to the

           area.     W i t h others we manag ed to get                            the a m b ul an ce through the

           supporters.        Also whi ls t              in the area,               bo t h whi ls t moving around

       assessing        the situation,                   and whilst              tr y i n g    to arrange          casualty

       evacuation,           I was a b u s e d on a number                        of occa si ons           by Liverpool         fans.

           I was   pulled a n d       pushed about and on m a n y                             occasions         it was    pointed

       out to me quite              f o rc ib l y that               I was      a murd er er .          The language being

       uses was        some of the most foul                            I have      heard.           It seemed to me taht

       the abusers were               s u f fe ri ng shock,                   a n d we re      relieving their

       frustrations           on me.           I could see little                       point       in taking their actions

       further,        and after          trying to calm do w n the various                                    fans,   left them to

       make their way out of the ground.                                       Others         were simply trying to

                      patiently around,                      and               I was thankful            that    they h a d n ’t decided to

                      cause other           problems.                            On re-entering              the tunnel,       I was met by two

                      off duty nurses who were                                         seeking help.           Whil st   speaking with these

                      nurses,        we w£re            d ir e c t e d to a youth sitti ng                            nearby who was

                      complaining of                   pains                  in his      ribs.        The    nurses took       charge of this

                      person and b eg an to evacua te him to the ambulances.

                      I returned to                  the ar e a near the acces s                              gate,    where    I met   Inspector

                      portable fencin g and                                   I saw that there were               several      bodies    covered up

                      in this enclosure.                             On querying                 the    number,       I was    informed that there

                      were ten persons.                          The Liverpool                    fans       then began leaving the ground

                      At this        point,           we were                    joined by Insp ec to r Webster.                 He stated that

                      he was trying                 to a s c e r t a i n the number                          of dead     persons at our end of

            the only fatalities                  to have         occurred,             and that the         injured persons we

            had removed were                  the bulk of those                  injured.        We were      informed that

            there were over 70 other                         persons           dead    in the gymnasium,         and this was

            the first time          that         I realised the scale                       of the       incident.

            We were then joined by Dr. Leigh,                                   Po l ic e Surgeon.          Superintendent

            Marshall       requested that                   he a t te nd at the gymnasium.                    As there was no

            one else       in the a r e a who                knew the wh e r e a b o u t s        of the gym,        or the

            route,     I took him to that                     location.               I left him at the entrance to

            the gym wi t h other officers an d began maki ng my way back towards the

            Leppings Lane end of the ground.                                    I saw that       by this time,        the

            terraced area was almo st                        clear and decid ed to sue that as the easiest

            retur n route.          On         crossing the football                       pitch I saw that there were

            very few persons,                  other than Pol ic e Officers,                      still      on the pitch.

            On arriving          back at         the L e p p i n g s Lane end of the ground,                         I located my

            serial,     still a s s i s t i n g wi t h ground                        clearance of unin ju re d fans.            I

            notice d that the time was                        now 4.4 5          pm    (1645).       During    the whole of th:

            time,    the    radio      had been receiving,                           but   there was no free air time to

            pass messaged.

            By 5 pm (1700)          the me ss ag es were                       talking about         traffic    problems,

            obviously being            caused by the fans                        leaving     the ground,        made worse by

            returning em e r ge n cy             vehicles.                At    the Le ppings Lane ar e a the fans were

            now   clear,        and as        our         original        brief had been traffic               patrol   in the

            Ta n k e r s l e y area,      I decid ed to                   resume      to my serial        to assist with

            traffic,       as    possible.

            I noted that as we began to move                                   off    in our vehicle         the time was     in

            fact 5 pm (1700).                  We         pa trolled as best we              could along        the A61 betweeT

            H i l l s b o r o u g h and Grenoside,               but saw that              points were being worked.

            One of the          problems         causing traffic                     hold-ups was the         coaches still

            parked along P e n i s t o n e R o a d / H a l i f a x Road,                    and o b v io us ly waiting to

                                                                                                            R4Q8

          pick up their       passengers.         These     ve hicles      caused problems throughout
     r
         We     continued to patrol,         and a t t e n d e d an      incident      reported as Police

         Officers     in trouble      near the s u p er ma rk et s         in Halifa x Road,         but

         nothing was found.           Due    to the amount             of traffic on the       radio it was

         still    not possible       to   pass me ss ag es       to     control.

         By 6.30 pm (1830)         the A61      towards T a n k e r s l e y was almost         clear.        as we

         travelled down towards Hillsbo ro ug h,                   I notic ed a gap         in air traffic

         and for the first         time m a n a g e d to      contact      control.        I explained the

         road conditions a nd as ke d for              instructions.           We were      instructed to

         continue    patrol    for    the time        being.       Due to the fact that we had                not

         had anything to eat          or drink        since     10.30 am I instructed my driver to

         atte nd at C la yw he el s Lane Garage wi t h the hope of obtaining

         refreshments for my serial.

         Again,    they were     i ns tr uc te d to      remain to gether          until    instructions

         were    confirmed.     At 7. 1 5      pm (1915)        I was     instructed to stand down my

         serial,    but to rema in avai la bl e mys el f               until   instructed otherwise.

         At Claywheels Lane,          I could find no one who ap pe a r e d to be collecting

         debriefing forms,        radios      or other        paperwork,       but   realised this was

         due to the op e r a t i o n still        in a c ti on at the ground.              At 7.30     pm I ws

         joined by Inspector Sykes who                 informed me        that we had now all              been

         stood down.     I went       off duty at 7. 4 5           pm that     date.

         One of my officers          had been d e l eg at ed to go with one of the

         deceased.     Prior    to    leaving,        I made      certain that his whereabouts               were

         noted,    and made    pr o v i s i on a r r a n g e me nt s   for his transport       back to        ’A'

         Di vision on his      return.

At     1100 am,      we      picked      up our vehicle           a nd went           to Tanker sl ey

intersections where                 we    re nd ezvoused w i t h          several        Road Traffic

Officers.           On sp ea ki ng        with those        of f i c er s,       we were       informed that

they had not           been b ri e f e d to work w i t h                our    serial, and        in fact     their

order     sp ec i f i c a l l y     in fo rm ed them that              be cau se      of traffic       problems      in

,1988,    such       checks        for    1989 had been d i s p e n s e d with.                This     therefore

 left me wi th          11 off ic er s        including m y s e l f .            At    11.20 am I set         up my

 reception          point     in the       lay by w h ic h        is    si t u a t e d on the Sh ef fi el d
              0
 side of the motor way,                    on the A61         approach          road.

 I pre-briefed my serial                    to randomly           check        coaches and mini-buses,               as

 per the order,              not    to    enter     vehicles       unl es s      there were 4 or 5 of thei

 together,          in the event           of trouble         on a ny       vehicle.        I instructed them

 to    check     persons         for     drink,     dr un ke n    c o n d i t i o n , and the     possession of

 the    correct        ent ry      ticket,     and any        p r o b l e ms    to be referred to either

 the Ser gea nt         or myself.

 It quicky became a p p a r e n t              that     the      per sonal       radios were of no use

 whatsoever,           due    to our       location an d          distance         from the ground.            The

 van contained a F or ce                  radio,     but our       radio        call sign as       issued was

 India 18 on           personal          radio.

 At    the outset,           tr af fi c    travelling         t o w a r d s She ff iel d was only

 m od e ra te l y    light,        with    the m a j o r i t y    of    vehicles         being   private      cars.

                                                                                                                       R408

A l m o s t all      the    cars were           displaying           colours a s s o c i a t i n g        them wit h

Liverpool           Football Club.               As     time went on,             traffic       became         very heavy,

and     there were          periods w he re             traffic was             in fact at a standstill,

backing        up from the t r af fi c                 island at          the    new S t o c k s b r i d g e    by-pass.

Between        11.SO am an d S . 3 0             pm     (1430)       we    checked 53 vehicles,                  being a

mixture        of    coaches and mini                  buses.        On the       coaches       c h ec ke d there were

no    drinks        found and only 7               persons       were       found to have            no tickets.

Due     to our       location,          and     the     fact    that       those 7 persons were amongst

organised           groups,       it s e e m e d       impractical          to    prevent       them      continuing

their       Journey,        but     they were           s ui ta bl y advised.              They all        hoped to

pur ch as e     tickets       from touts.                   In the mini          buses     checked,        so far as we

could a s c e r t a i n      it a p p e a r e d        that    persons          were    in p o s s e s s i o n of the

correct        a p p r op ri at e      tickets.             On some of the mini                buses      cans of

dr in k s    were     located.           These         were    few    in number,           and af ter          the

occupants           had been s t r o n g l y advised,                 the       drinks were         surrendered.

The     contents were             poured away,               and the empty             cans    c o l l e c t e d and

deposited           in the «waste            co ntainer        at C l a y w h e e l s Lane Garage.                   None of

the     persons       on the        coaches,           or    in the mini          buses we re unde r the

in f lu en ce of drink an d                  there were         no    problems w h a t s o e v e r         with their

behaviour.            The o c c u p a n t s      were o b v i o u s l y         in high spirits,               but what       I

would       consider        normal       for     persons a t t e n d i n g          this type        of    function.

During       the whole        of       the    time we were            checking          vehicles,         we had no

problems,         and so far           as     I was         co ncerned all          vehicles       leaving           our

l o c a t i o n were       in order.

We    had occasions           to .stop several                 coaches w h i c h were d i s p l a y i n g              signs

to    the    front w h i c h s h o w e d         ' N o t ti ng ha m Forest',             but    these      turned out to

be    d e s t i n a t i o n sheets       is s u e d by the operator                    to simp ly      indicate to

fans,       where     the    coach es         we r e   going,        as many        coaches      had      left the same

area     in Li verpool            to    bo th    the m a t c h       in S h e f f i e l d a n d the other              semi

signs were         r em ov e d    to prevent w ro ng             identification             of the     vi si t i n g

fans when nearer                the ground.        It mi gh t als o             be perti nen t        to note       that

ma n y    of the    coaches         had been s e a r c h e d       by the Po l i c e          in Li v e r p o o l

prior      to departure.

At 2 . 1 5   pm (1415)           traffic was a l mo st            non existent,             and   except      for S

coaches w h i c h a r r i v e d together at about                        2.30       pm we    check ed no other

coaches      or mini        buses      for quite        some      time.         The    reason     given by the

drive rs     for    these        last 2     coaches       for     being        so    late was     that they had

d e c i d e d to travel          towards S h e f f i e l d       via     the M56       inte ndi ng mi ssi ng as

mu ch     traffic as        possible       on the M62,            but     had       instead    run    into heavy

tr aff ic at       roadw ork s        in the M a n c h e s t e r        a r e a of the M56.

After      these    two     coaches       left,    we     ch eck ed       no other          vehicles.

During       the time we were             op er ati ng at T a n k e r s l e y nothing wh ats oev er

was      received     by    personal        radio.        On the         vans VHF       radio,       it sounde d as

C i t y area.       This        fact was     co nf irm ed        by vis iti ng Tr aff ic Officers,                     who

felt we had be en lucky to have been s e l e c t e d to cover the point we
                0
had, instead of at the N o t t i n g h a m F o re st side of the ground.

My    serial      had be en detailed during P h a s e                     2 to meal          at Cla yw he el s

Lane,      then    ret ur n      to the T a n k e r s l e y area.              In view of the          fact     that

t ra ffi c was      non-existent,            at 2 . 5 5     pm    (1455)        I stood my serial             down and

we    began to make             our way to C l a y w h e e l s          Lane.

As we tr av ell ed          down H al if ax Road,            for        the    first    time,     we heard

messages         on the     personal        radio.        Th ese        tende d to      indicate       that     things

a r o u n d the g r o u n d we re busy,           but     no t h i n g    mo r e .     As we turned         round

still      see    lots     of    fans making       their         w ay    to the ground,           even thou gh          it

was      now past 3 pm           (1500)    the kick        off      time.

PURDY,       I    informed                him        of       my    intention             to    meal,          and     then        attended          at

the    Garage          forecourt.                    On       arrival          at       Claywheels             Lane,        my     serial       was

briefed          to    meal          as     a            group, ready               for       future          d e p l o y m e n t . In    the        main

I expected             this          to     be            a f t e r the        match          had    ended.

Whilst       at       the       Police              Garage,          I used             the    toilets,              and    then       went     to    t he

mobile       canteen             to       collect              my    hot       meal.          After       being        served          with     the

meal,       I began             walking              back          towards          the       entrance           into       Claywheels              Lane

garage,          and       at    this           point,             was    met       by    my       serial        leaving           the    garage.

They    indicated                to       me        that       we    were          to    attend       at        the    Leppings           Lane       end

of    the    ground             as     there             was       some       kind       of    a    problem.           After          depositing

my    meal       on    a       table,           I    rejoined             my       serial.           We       attended           near     the

Leppings          Lane          entrance                 to    Hillsborough.                   The    time           would       now     be    about

3.15    pm       (1515 )•

On    initially                attending                 this       point,          I    saw       that       Officers           were      forming         a

cordon       across             t he       access             area       to    the       ground.          The        only       Senior

Officers          in       the       areaappeared                    to       be    other          Inspectors.                    I asked       them

what    was       wrong,             none             s e e m e d to          know,       but       that       we     were       to p r e v e n t
                                       0
further          access          to        the       ground          by       supporters.                 I     therefore             left     one    of

my    officers             with        our          vehicle          to       protect          it,    or       move        it    as    necessary,

and    deployed                the     remainder                   of my       serial,             with       the     other        officers

already          forming             the        cordon.             The       traffic          on    the        personal           radio       was

such    that          it       was     impossible                   to    get       air       time    to        clarify          from     ground

control          either          what           the       problem             was,       or    if    they        wished          my    serial

deploying             elsewhere.

Although          the          time        was       now       past       3>15pm          (1515)          there        were        still       a number

of    supporters                making              their          way    to       the    ground,             and     obviously           they       were

I then went         to the a m b u l a n c e         nearest       the       gate and    passed on the

me ss ag e   regarding           the    brea th in g a pp ara tu s,            and saw a member            of the

vehicles       crew enter           the      ground wi t h suc h equipm ent .                  I also saw that

by this time          s e ve ra l      fire     tenders were            in atte nda nce ,         and fire

brigade officers             were       also       entering       the    ground        carrying     breathing

apparatus.           I th en       ch ec ke d the         large    gates        in the    immediate area and

found all to be too                 low to allow access,                     for    the same      reason as

 initially stated.                 I again          returned to S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Marshall             and

 passed on this            i n f or m at io n .       He then       i n s t r u c t e d me to begin m oving

 injured persons             out       of    the area and to w a r d s              the ambulances.          I

 therefore went a r o u n d                 the area and a r r a n g e d            for Police Office rs and

 other       persons who          were ad m i ni s t e r i n g      first        aid,    to begin to move the

  injured persons            t ow ar ds        the access         gate.        As    I wa l k e d around,        I

  other      dead    persons        lying          in the area,         co v e r e d by coats       etc.     Eve n at

  this    point,      I was       still        not fully aw ar e             of what had occurred,               but

  realised the            persons we r e            suffeirng       crush       injuries.         At one    point,

  whil st near        the     acce ss         gate,     I saw that           fans were      preventing an

  ambulance         entering           the    top of the a c c e s s           road,    and made my way to the

  area.       With others           we m a n a g e d to get          the      ambul anc e    through the

  supporters.             Also w h i l s t         in the area,          bo t h whilst moving around

  asses si ng       the    situation,              and whilst       tr yi n g       to arrange     casualty

   evacuation,         I was        a b u s e d on a number             of    occas ion s    by Liverpool            fans.

   I was     pulled and           pus he d about and on m a n y                  occasions        it was    pointed

   out    to me quite            forcibly          that    I was    a m u r de re r.        The    language          being

   uses was         some    of    the m o s t       foul    I have       heard.         It seemed to me taht

   the abusers were               suffering           shock,      an d w e r e      relieving their

   frust ra ti on s        on me.            I could see       litt le        point     in taking their ac tio ns

   further,         and a f t er       tr yi n g     to calm dow n           the    various fans,      left          them to

   make      their way        out      of     the ground.          Others          were simply trying to

    obtain     information,                 none    of-jihich I was           able to give.

E v e n t u a l l y things      a p p e a r e d to be se tt lin g           down an d most           of the

injured        persons       had been m o ve d from the area.                          At   this   time,    I went

al ong    the tunnel           which     leads        from the       rear      of the       stand,      onto the

sta nding area of L e p p i n g s Lane terraces,                          at     the    centre.         On arriving

at the terracing,                I saw that there were                   still     a number        of    persons

 wa nd er in g ar ou n d       on the        ter ra ce d area.           I also        saw that      there wre

 people       on the      pitch,        some       still    being    gi ven first aid,             and also,

 there was a line               of Po li c e Of fi cer s           st an din g    on the       centre      line

 across        the w i d t h    of the        pitch.        On    looking      e l se wh ere    a r o u n d the

 g ro u n d    I r e al is ed    that        the N o t t i n g h a m F o re st    fans were          just standing

 patiently around,               and          I was       thankful      that they h a d n ’t decided to

  cause other           problems.              On    re-enter ing        the tunnel, I was met by                 two

  off    duty nurses           who were         seeking       help.       Whilst        sp eaking with these

  nurses,        we w e r e 4 di r e c t e d    to a yo ut h        sitting       near by who was

  complai nin g         of    pains     in his        ribs.       The   nurses         took    charge of this

  pe rs on and b eg an to eva cu at e                     him to the ambulances.

  I returned to the are a near                        the access         gate,     where       I met     Inspector

  Sykes,        and a serial            of Officers.             They had made an en closure out of

  portable          fencin g     and     I saw that there were                   several       bodies     covered up

  in this           enclosure.          On    q ue ryi ng     the number,         I was       informed that there

  were        ten persons.           Th e     Liver   pool, fans        then began          leaving      the ground

  and     I w o rk ed tog et he r            wi t h other        off icers     in di recting            them from the

   ground.
   At    this       point,     we were         joi ne d    by Inspector Webster.                   He    stated that

   he was trying             to a s c e r t a i n the        number     of dead persons at our end of

   the    ground.            I was    under        the     imp re ss io n that the            10 dead     persons were

the     only fatalities               to have    occurred,           and    that     the    injured       persons we

had     removed were            the    bulk    of those        injured.         We were          inf ormed that

there were          over 70 other             persons     dead       in the     gymnasium,             and this was

the     first time that               I realised the           scale       of the     incident.

We were          then joined          by Dr.    Leigh,      P o li ce      Sur geo n.       S u p e ri nt en de nt

Ma r s h a l l    requested that he a t te nd at                  the      gymnas ium .          As there was           no

one     else      in the area who knew the w h e r e a b o u t s                   of the gym,           or the

route,       I took him to that                location.          I left       him at the ent rance                to

the     gym wi th other           officers and beg an m a k i n g                  my way back towards               the

L ep p i n g s     Lane   end of the ground.                   I saw    that       by this time,          the

te r r a c e d area was almo st               clear and d e c i d e d         to sue that as the                easiest

r et u r n    route.        On   crossing        the foo tball             pitch     I saw that         there'were

very      few persons,           other      than Po li c e O f f ic er s,            still    on the       pitch.

 n o t i c e d that       the    time was       now 4 . 4 5     pm    (1645).         During      the whole of this

 time,       the    radio       had been       receiving,         but      there was        no free air          time       to
                            O
 pas s m e s s a g e s .

 By 5 pm (1700)             the mes sa ge s       were      ta lki ng       abo ut    traffic          problems,

 obviously          being       caused by the           fans    leaving       the ground,              made worse         by

 retu rni ng        em er gen cy vehicles.               At the L e p p i n g s       Lane ar e a the fans were

 now     clear,         and as our         original      brief       had been traffic              patrol    in the

 T a n k e r s l e y area,       I de ci de d to        resume       to my serial           to ass is t with

 traffic,          as    possible.

 I no te d that as we b eg an to move                       off      in our vehicle              the    time was        in

 fact 5 pm          (-1700).          We   pa tr oll ed as best we             could along             the A61    between

 H i l l s b o r o u g h and Gre no si de ,        but    saw that          points were being worked.

 O ne    of the         problems       causing     traffic        ho l d - u p s was       the    coaches still

 p a r k e d along P e n i s t o n e R o a d / H a l i f a x Road,           and o b v i o u s l y waitin g          to

 pick      up their        pas sengers.         ..These v e hi cl es         caused        problems       throughout.

                                                                                                                      R ^oa

      We    continued       to    patrol,        and at t e n d e d an         in ci den t    re po r t ed as Police

      Officers        in t r o u b l e    near    the s u p e r m a r k e t s     in H a l i f a x    Road,    but

       nothing was        found.          Due    to the am o u n t        of    tr af fi c    on the      radio      it was

       still    not    pos si bl e       to    pass mes sag es       to    control.

      By 6.3 0    pm <1830)          the A61          towards T a n k e r s l e y was almos t            clear.        as we

      trav ell ed down t ow a r d s H i l ls bor oug h,                I n o t i c e d a gap          in air      traffic

      and for the         first      time m a n a g e d to       co nta ct       control.            I ex pl ain ed the

       road conditi on s          a n d a s k e d for      in st r u c t i o n s.      We were        instruc ted to

       continue       patrol        for the time being.                Due      to the       fact that we had           not

      had any thing         to      eat or drink since              1 0.30 am I i n s t r u c t e d my driver               to

      att en d at C l a y w h e e l s Lane Garage w i t h                 the    hope       of ob ta ini ng

       refreshments         for m y serial.

      Again,     they we re         instructed          to remain t o g e t h e r           until     instructions

      were     confirmed.          At 7 . 1 5     pm    (1915)     I was        in st ru ct ed       to stand down my

      serial,     but     to     r e ma in a v a i l a bl e my se l f      until       i ns tru ct ed otherwise.

      At Cl ay wh e e l s      Lane,      I could find         no one who a p p e a r e d             to be    collecting

      de bri efi ng     forms,0 radios            or other       paper wo rk,          but    rea lised this was

      due to the o p e r a t i o n            still    in a c t i o n at       the    ground.        At 7 . 3 0   pm I ws

      joined by In s p e c t o r          Sykes who        in fo rm ed me        that we had now all                 been

      stood down.           I we nt       off    duty at 7 . 4 5       pm that         date.               * •

      One of my o f f i c e r s          had been d e l e g a t e d       to    go w i t h one of the

      deceased.         Prior         to leaving, I made            certain          that his w h e r e a b o u t s     were

      noted,    and m a d e       provision arrangements                   for       his   tr ansport     back to       'A'

      D i v i s i o n on his     return.

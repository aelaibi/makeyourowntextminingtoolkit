          Dear Sirs,
                                              /


          Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.


          If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
          of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent,
          on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m.  Details of venue will be notified in
          due course.

          I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
          evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
          coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
          inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

         Subject to the Corone rs ’ Act 1988 and the Corone rs ’ Rules, the Inquest is
         under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
         witnesses who wish to give evidence.    I am at present engaged in considering
         this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

         Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
         to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
         appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me to
         consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

         May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
         attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

         I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
         names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision as
         to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

         I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
         heard from you by                      I will assume you have no names to
         submit.

         Yours f a i t h f u l l y ,

    Dear Dr Popper,

    RE;   Peter McDonnell

    I have been through Pet er ’s Summary with his parents and they have no
    questions to raise on either it or the Post Mortem Report.

    Mr .^nd Mrs McDonnell will be .in-■-Cour-t-to-hear tfee-ir soek 's ^ Summary-
    presented, they will probably have two other members of Peter's family
    with them.

    I trust this information is of assistance.

Dear Dr Popper

RE: PETER McDONNELL (deceased)

I have recently been consulted by the parents of Peter McDonnell late
of 18 Hill View, Aigburth, Liverpool 17... They want me to take over
conduct of matters relating to Peters death from their former solicitors
E Rex Makin & Co.

I have written to Mr Makin for the papers but I understand from my clients
that they have not been offered sight of the Post Mortem report and
it occurs to me that you may not have been asked to supplya copy.

Will you please let me have a copy as soon as possible, subject of course
to the usual conditions.

             Sirs,

He:        P0TBR McDOlOTELL (deceased) lTo-40.
As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
on the 15th of January 1990.

I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not- to resume the
Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
he may wish to undertake.

I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
on this matter further.

I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

Yours faithfully,



S.L.Popper,
H.M. Coroner.

        Sear Sirs,

        i£i—
        Thank you for your letter of the 8th of August.

        I enclose a letter Reference SLP/JT/H/TM/OOl which deals
        with the question of the release of the post mortem
        reports to you. On that basis, I enclose the post
        mortem report. If you cannot accept it on these terms,
        please return it unused.

         I am not clear whether you represent your clients in
         connection with the Inquest proceedings.

         As I am anxious to sort out the legal representation
         in order that I may know who to communicate with, I
         would be grateful if you could please let me know as
         soon as possible whether or not you are instructed
         in connection with the Inquest.

         If you are so instructed, I would be grateful if you
         could please let me know who precisely you represent.

         Finally, I would be grateful if you could please let
         me know whether you intend to associate yourself with
         the Hillsborough Steering Committee group of solicitors.
         This is of course a matter entirely for you, The purpose
         of my inquiry is to try and sort out which firms are
         within the groups and which will need separate communications.

         I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.

         Please quote our reference.

         Yours faithfully,



         S.L.Popper,

E. Rex Makin & Co.,
Solicitors,
Whitechapel (Entrance Leigh Street),




Bear Sirs,

You will be aware that I do not normally release post mortem
reports until the resumption of the Inquest, when they are
in fact put in as evidence.

However, in view of the numerous requests which I have received,
and the obvious distress which delay is causing to your clients,
I have decided that subject to certain conditions set out below,
I am prepared to release to you upon request, the post mortem
report of your client(s).

The release of these post mortem reports are on the basis that:-

        a.      They have to be treated as provisional, and therefore
                subject to amendment or alteration until such time as
                they are given or produced in evidence at the Inquest.

        b.      They are to be used only for the purpose of bereavement
                conselling of the deceased's relatives or for proper
                legitimate purposes in connection with any legal proceedings
                in which solicitors may be engaged.

        c.      Subject to tha'c3-fe3¥8, they are to be kept confidential until
                they come into the public domain at the resumed Inquests.

I have your request for the post mortem report to hand in respect
of each of the persons listed on the attached sheet, and on the
assumption that you will confirm that the report in respect of
each of your respective clients is accepted on the terms set out
above, and in order to save further delay and upset to your client,
I enclose a copy of the relevant post mortem report. If for any
reason you cannot agree to the contents of this letter, please return
the post mortem report to me, without of course making any use of it.

The cost for the copy post mortem report(s) is 55p    per sheet (total £ 2 .7 5
Please make your cheques payable to the City of Sheffield.

Yours faithfully,
                                      V

    I refer to your recent conversation with Superintendent
    Sleath concerning the release of the deceased persons from
    the Hillsborough incident to their respective next of kin,
    following the adjournment of the inquest.

    After consultation with Professor Usher, I have no objection
    to this course of action.

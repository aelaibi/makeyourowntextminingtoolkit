                                             15 A PR IL 1989

                                          I N T E R IM R E P O R T O F IN Q U IR Y


                                                      IN T R O D U C T IO N

   1. O n 15 April 1989 a football m atch to decide a semi-final round o f the FA Cup com petition was to be
played between the Liverpool a n d N ottin gh am Forest Clubs. T he neutral venue chosen was Hillsborough
Football Stadium , Sheffield W ednesday’s ground. Only six m inutes into the game, play was stopped when it
was realised that spectators on the terraces b e hind th e Liverpool goal had been severely crushed. In the result,
95 died an d over 400 received hospital treatm ent.

   2. O n 17 April 19891 was a p p ointed by you to carry out an Inquiry with the following term s o f reference:

       To inquire into the events at Sheffield Wednesday football ground on 15 April 1989 and to m ake
       recom m endations about th e needs of crowd control and safety at sports events.

   3. Two Assessors were a p p oin ted to assist me: M r Brian Johnson Q PM , C h ief C onstable o f Lancashire,
and Professor L eonard M a u n d e r OBE, BSc, P h D , ScD, FEng, FI Mech E, Professor o f Mechanical
Engineering at the University o f Newcastle u po n Tyne. T heir help has been invaluable a n d I am very grateful
for th eir expert advice a n d wise counsels. While the sole responsibility for this rep ort is m ine, I am comforted
in the knowledge that both Assessors agree with it.

  4. M r R obert Whalley was appoin ted Secretary to the Inquiry. He and his assistants have worked
prodigiously and skilfully to give m e all the advice and support I could have wished. I also wish to acknowledge
the help I have received, as always, from my clerk, M r Ernest Pott.

  5. T h e policing arrangem ents for 15 April were in the hands o f the South Yorkshire Constabulary. The
efficacy o f those arrangem ents a n d their im plem entation was from an early stage called into question. It was
therefore decided that the investigation o f the disaster and the gathering o f evidence for this Inquiry should be
conducted by an independent police force. M r Geoffrey D ear Q PM , Chief C on stable o f West M idlands
Constabulary, undertook this task. He was m a d e responsible directly to me; he ap p o in te d Assistant Chief
Constable M ervyn Jones to take full-time charge o f the investigation. I am deeply in d e b te d to both of them.

  6. O n 18 April I visited Hillsborough Stadium . I inspected the scene of the disaster on the terraces and all
relevant parts o f the stad ium a n d its approaches. My Assessors and I have m a d e fu rther visits during the
Inquiry. I also visited Liverpool o n 21 a n d 29 April.

    7. T he Lord M ayor and the Sheffield City Council kindly offered to make the a c c o m m o d a tio n and facilities
o f Sheffield Town Hall available for the hearing o f oral evidence. This offer was gratefully accepted and I would
like to record my thanks for those facilities and for the co-operation afforded to th e In q u iry by the authorities
in Sheffield.

   8. O n 28 April 1989,1 held a prelim inary hearing to announce the date when the oral evidence would begin,
to give some directions as to the procedure I intend ed to follow and to hear applications from those wishing to
be represented at the hearing. I accorded representation to the following:
       (i)     Those bereaved or injured as a result o f the disaster.
       (ii)    T he Football S upporters’ Association.
       (iii)   T he Football Association.
       (iv)    Sheffield City Council.
       (v)     Sheffield W ednesday Football Club together with the Football League, the C lub’s casual staff and
               their insurers, the Sun Alliance.
       (vi)    South Yorkshire Constabulary.
       (vii) South Yorkshire Fire an d Civil Defence Authority.


                                                                 1
Subsequently, during the hearing, I furth er accorded representation to:
      (viii) Trent Regional Health Authority, for the South Yorkshire M etrop olitan A m bulance Service
             (SYMAS).
and   (ix)   D r W Eastwood, consultant engineer to Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

   9 Since the circum stances o f the disaster raise d urgent questions of safety, especially at football grounds,
you indicated at the outset th a t you would welcome any recom m endations, even o f an interim nature, which I
m ight be able to give in advance o f the new football season due to com m ence in m id-A ugust 1 9 8 9 .1 therefore
annou n ced at the preliminary- hearing on 28 April that I would conduct an oral hearing with all possible
expedition as the first phase o f the Inquiry to discover the facts a n d causes o f the disaster an d enable me to
m ake any im m ediate interim recom m endations necessary in the short term.

   10. T he West M idlands Police investigation began on 24 April. A “F reephone” n u m b e r was advertised to
enable m em bers of the public, especially those who had attended the m atch, to offer their evidence to the
Inquiry. Initially this n u m b e r was available for three days on 28 different lines. T he response from the public
was such th a t the lines were continued for a further three days by the en d o f which 2,666 calls h a d been
received. There were also m any written offers o f help. Some 440 West M idlands officers were deployed on the
Inquiry. To service this operation, special police offices were established in B irm ingham , Liverpool and
Sheffield an d c o m p u te r technology was used to the full. In all som e 3776 statem ents were taken. T here were
also some 1550 letters to Ministers, to the Inquiry a n d to me personally all o f w hich I read. The police,
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club an d the BBC h a d video cameras filming at the g ro un d on 15 April. In
aggregate, they recorded some 71 hours o f film covering the period before, during a n d after the disaster. Thus
the m aterial gathered and potentially available for presentation at the oral hearing was enorm ous. F rom this
mass it was essential to select only sufficient good an d reliable evidence necessary to establish the facts and
causes o f the disaster.

   11. W here it seemed likely that any allegation or criticism m ight be m ade o f the c o nd u ct o f any person or
party, the Treasury Solicitor, after consultation w ith Counsel for the Inquiry, wrote to the party concerned
setting o ut the likelygrounds for complaint. This followed the practice established by the Royal Comm ission
on Tribunals o f Inquiry (the Salmon Commission).

  12. T h e hearing began on 15 May. It continued, sitting long hours, for 31 days concluding on 29 June. In
that period, 174 witnesses gave oral evidence. Counsel’s submissions were delivered in writing on 7 July and
on 14 July I h eard th e ir b rie f oral submissions supplem enting the written argum ent.

   13. Witnesses were not sworn. Since this is a d epartm ental inquiry, there was no power to adm inister the
o ath bu t there was no instance of any witness giving evidence which I considered m ight have been different
had he o r she been sworn.

   14. T he witnesses called were only a small fraction o f those from w hom statem ents were or could have been
taken. Nevertheless, I am satisfied that they were sufficient in n u m b e r an d reliability to enable m e to reach the
necessary conclusions. To have called m ore would have prevented me from presenting an interim report in the
required tim e an d would not have ad d ed significantly to the relevant evidence. I have, however, been able to
take into account m any written statem ents in ad d itio n to oral testimony.

   15. A p art from the evidence called by Counsel for the Inquiry which was drawn fro m statem ents taken by
the West M idlands Police and others volunteered by individuals, each o f the represented parties was given full
opportun ity to put forward any witnesses they considered should be called. A final subm ission was m ade by
Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police th a t since the investigation by West M idland s Police is still continuing,
all the evidence has n ot been assembled and it would be unsafe for m e to m ake findings o f fact. I should
therefore m ake clear th a t the investigation continues principally to furnish as m u ch detail as possible to HM
C oroner for the City o f Sheffield as to th e cause o f death, the precise position at d e a th an d the care and
m ovem ent o f each o f the 95 victims individually. I am assured by C hief Constable D e a r and Assistant Chief
Constable M ervyn Jones th at it is m ost unlikely any further evidence gathered will significantly alter o r add to
the history o f events which emerged at the hearing.

   16. I should like to th a n k all those who m ade it possible for the oral hearing to take place so soon after the
event an d for evidence to be efficiently presented an d tested so as to give a full a n d fair account o f what
h appened in all its aspects without irrelevancy or duplication. I pay tribute particularly to the West M idlands
Police for th eir speed and dedication in gathering the evidence and to all those responsible for processing it.



                                                           2
The m ost eloquent tribute to the fairness and thoroughness o f the police investigation came from the Secretary
o f the Football Supporters’ Association. He said there had been initial anxiety in Liverpool as to whether that
investigation would be fair a n d objective. His Association therefore collected 200 witness statements
themselves. Having heard the opening statem ent by Counsel to the Inquiry based upon the evidence gathered
by the police, he found th a t it accorded entirely with his Association’s evidence and the initial anxiety was
wholly dispelled.

   17. Before and during the Inquiry I derived great assistance .on a wide range o f technical issues from the
Health and Safety Executive w ho providentially have a laboratory in Sheffield (the Research and Laboratory
Services Division) where tests were conducted an d reports prepared swiftly an d efficiently. This was done
in close consultation with Professor Maunder. I am most grateful to the Director, D r A Jones, and to the
D eputy Director, D r C E N icholson, for their invaluable help.

  18. I wish to c o m m en d C ounsel to the inquiry, Mr Andrew Collins QC, M r Alan Goldsack and M r
Bernard Phillips for their industry, care and fairness in selecting and presenting the necessary evidence; also,
Counsel for all those represented who tested th a t evidence fully bu t expeditiously. T his Interim Report could
not possibly have been prep ared in so short a tim e had I not had the whole-hearted co-operation o f all those
m en tion ed and many others.

   19. The second phase o f the Inqu iry will be directed to making final an d long term recom m endations about
crowd control and safety at sports grounds. I need to consider in depth inform ation, opin io ns and arguments
from a wide range o f sources a n d contributors b o th here and abroad. It was clear from the outset that this
second phase could not be carried to completion before the next football season. However, at an early stage of
the oral hearing I invited evidence from all who wished to contribute to it and specifically from many sporting,
local authority, emergency service and police bodies as well as technical consultants. I asked that submissions
should be in writing an d should be m ade prom ptly so th a t the second phase o f the Inquiry could
follow imm ediately after the first. I shall now proceed to consider the large body o f w ritten evidence which has
been submitted. I shall w ant in some instances to have further oral evidence or discussion in conjunction with
my Assessors. We will also need tojmake a n u m b e r o f visits and inspections.

  20. I now present my Interim Report and Recom mendations. I shall prepare my Final Report and
R ecom m en datio ns as soon as reasonably possible.

Fixing T he Venue
  21. O n 20 M arch 1989, the Football Association (the FA) requested th a t their Cup semi-final between
Liverpool and N o ttin g h a m Forest be held on 15 April at Hillsborough Football Stadium. The corresponding
semi-final between the same two team s had been held there in April 1988. T he arrangements h a d been
successful in the view b o th o f the police and o f the host club. Sheffield W ednesday (the Club) were therefore
willing to accom m o d ate the 1989 m atch. South Yorkshire C onstabulary were prepared to police it b u t only if
the ticketing arrangem ents were the same as those for 1988. Otherwise, the FA would have to look elsewhere.
Those arrangem ents did n ot please Liverpool or its supporters either in 1988 or 1989. They thought the ticket
allocation was unfair for reasons to be explained later. Reluctantly, however, the police requirem ent was
accepted and the m atch was fixed for 15 April at Hillsborough.

T he Ground
  22. The H illsborough Stadium is som e 2'k miles to the north-west o f central Sheffield in the district o f
Owlerton. The ground was opened in 1899 on what was then a greenfield site by the river Don. The pitch lies
roughly east to west. A plan o f the g round and its im m ediate en virons is at A ppendix 1.

  23. The west end, w ith which this Inquiry is principally concerned, is known as the Leppings Lane end. The
east end abuts on Penistone Road, the A 61. To the south is the river D on a n d to the north a residential street,
Vere Road, which runs between Leppings Lane an d Penistone Road North.

   24. Alongside the river is a private roadway giving access to the south stand, to the Directors’ a n d players’
entrances, and to the ad m inistrative block under the stand. T he roadway gives both vehicular and pedestrian
access between Penistone R oad a n d Leppings Lane, but there are gates which can shut it off at each end. There
is some car parking along this roadway principally for Directors, players a n d employees o f the Club. T h e south
stand dates from 1914 a n d is the oldest at the ground. It is all seating with places for 8,800. 5,500 o f those are
roofed over a n d 3,300 are uncovered.

  25. T he north stand is also all seating and accom m odates ab ou t 9,700. B ehind it is a gymnasium o r sports
hall. There are also a first aid room a n d police room close by.

  26. T he east en d is all terracing and is known as the Spion Kop. It was enlarged and roofed over in 1986 and
now accom m odates som e 21,000 standing spectators. T here are crush b arriers in the Kop running parallel to
the goal line b u t no dividing fences to prevent free m ovem ent from side to side.

   27. At the west or Leppings Lane end o f the ground there is terracing close to the pitch. Behind it is the west
stand which provides covered seating a n d was built in 1965 for W orld C up m atches, some o f which were held
at Hillsborough in 1966. The covered stan d accom m odates 4,456 seated spectators. T he terracing in front o f it
extends higher in the corners between the stands an d its total capacity was stated to be 10,100. At both the Kop
end and the west end access to the pitch is barred by p erim eter fencing. T h e fencing is about eight feet high
m o un ted upon the low wall at the foot o f the terracing. At the top o f the fencing the wire returns back at a sharp
angle for some 15 inches to m ake it difficult for anyone to climb over tow ards the pitch. There are gates at
intervals along the perim eter fencing to afford access between terrace a n d pitch. These gates are less than a
metre wide a n d were designed to be opened only from the pitch side for police purposes or in an emergency.
They are m arked a n d nu m bered on the plan A ppendix 1.

  28. U nlike the Kop end, the west terracing has not only crush barriers parallel with the goal line b u t radial
fences at right angles to it, dividing the area into pens. This division was begun after an FA Cup semi-final in
1981 when crushing occurred d u e to overcrowding and gates had to be open ed . It proceeded in stages, the final
arrangem ent being shown on the plan A ppendix 1. T h e first section o f th e west terracing moving south to north
contains gates 1 a n d 2 an d is known as pens 1 an d 2 although in fact con stitu tin g only one pen. N ext is pen 3
with one gate; next pen 4 with one gate; pen 5, which is extremely narrow, was intended as a sterile area to
divide pen 4 from pen 6. T his was to isolate hom e and away fans on occasions when both might be
accommodated on the west terracing in separate pens. Finally there is pen 7 at the north-west corner. Pens 5,6
and 7 each have a p e rim e te r gate. At the back o f the pens, u n d e r th e front o f the west stand, there is a gate in


                                                             4
each radial fence. W hen those gates are open, the back row o f the terracing is intended to perm it access from
pen to pen along the whole west side. In practice, when substantial num bers are present, those gateways are not
readily visible or accessible. T h e present layout o f the pens, fences, crush barriers and gates has resulted from a
series o f piecemeal changes. T he nature and effect o f those changes m ust be considered later.
                                                                                   I                               I


The Turnstiles                                                                    |
   29. Because o f the housing in Vere Road there is no access from the north side o f the ground. Along
Penistone Road N orth there are some 46 turnstiles which usually give access both to the Kop and to the east
end o f the north stand. They are m arked 43 to 88 inclusive on the plan. T he 12 num bered 77 to 88 are designed
to feed the n o rth stand b u t were n ot used for th a t purpose on 15 April in order to segregate supporters o f the
two team s as appears later. Two o f them, 77 an d 78, were however used for access to the Kop.

   30. At the south side o f the ground there were 24 turnstiles (num bered 19 to 42 on the plan). Those
n um bered 37 to 42 led to th e Kop and the rest to the south stand.

  31. In summ ary, the south a n d east sides o f the ground accom m odated some 29,800 whose access on the
day was through 60 turnstiles.

  32. T he oth er two sides o f the ground, north and west, with a capacity o f 24,256 were fed solely from the
Leppings Lane entrance where there were only 23 turnstiles.

Travel to the Ground
  33. Most supporters were expected to come by road although rail transport was available. N ottingham
supporters travelling by train w ould arrive at the m ain line Sheffield M idland Station whence they would be
directed and escorted n o rthw ards by the police. They would arrive at the ground along Penistone Road.
N ottingham supporters travelling by coach, mini-bus or car would approach Sheffield from the south m ainly
on the M 1. Again their arrival at the ground would predom inantly be via Penistone Road or Herries Road.

   34. Liverpool supporters travelling by normal rail service would arrive at Sheffield M idland Station ju st
like their N otting ham coun terparts. T he police aim ed to segregate the rival fans and p ut them into separate
coaches. Liverpool fans could alternatively travel by special train to Wadsley Bridge, a British Rail station
catering solely for football sup porters and situated to the north o f th e ground. A police escort was available to
conduct them on foot to the Leppings Lane entrance. Those com ing from Liverpool by road would approach
Sheffield either via the M 62 an d down the M 1 from the north or across the Pennines from th e north west. All
such routes would bring them to th e ground via one or other limb o f Leppings Lane as shown on Appendix 1.
Broadly, therefore, arrivals from Liverpool would be from the north and west; arrivals from Nottingham
would be from the south a n d east.

Allocation of Places and Tickets
   35. Experience in recent years has produced a policy o f segregation to prevent trouble between supporters
o f rival teams. T he need for this policy to be m aintained was endorsed and em phasised by the Popplewell
Report following the B radford C ity disaster in 1985. Accordingly, before the 1988 semi-final the police decided
that sections o f the Hillsborough Stadium should be allocated so as to achieve efficient segregation o f
Liverpool a n d N otting h am Forest fans. The section to be granted to each was determ in ed by the direction
whence each pred om in an tly approached. Thus, Liverpool were allotted the north and west sides o f the ground
for which access was from Leppings Lane. N ottingham Forest were allotted the south a n d east sides with access
from Penistone Road.

   36. T he effect o f the decision was that for this all-ticket C up Tie, Liverpool were allotted only 24,256 places
as against 29,800 for N o ttin g h a m Forest. This, although average attendance o f supporters at home matches
was substantially higher at Liverpool than at Nottingham. Moreover, with standing tickets at £6 and seats at
£12, N ottin gh am Forest had 21,000 standing places com pared with Liverpool’s 10,100. So, Liverpool’s
allocation was m ore expensive as well as smaller. Understandably, Liverpool were aggrieved by the allocation
o f places and tickets. They sought with some support from the host club an d the FA to have it changed in
1988, b u t the police were a d a m a n t. To switch ends would, in their opinion, have involved rival supporters
crossing each o th e r’s paths w hen approaching the ground thereby frustrating attem pts at segregation an d
creating a risk o f disorder. In 1989, when the same plan was proposed, Liverpool again challenged it. T h e
police, however, m ain tained th e ir view, adding that those who had attended in 1988 w ould be familiar with the
arrangem ents and that any change would lead to confusion.

Access from Leppings Lane
   37. As the plan A ppendix 1 shows, the approach to the west turnstiles is across a narrow neck or forecourt at
a bend in Leppings Lane where, com ing from the north, it turns to the south-west and crosses a bridge over the
river D on. Parking areas for the Liverpool supporters had been arranged north a n d west o f the ground. They
were therefore expected to arrive on foot along both limbs o f Leppings Lane and would cjonverge on the
forecourt at the bend. In an arc across th a t forecourt is a line o f railings with six sets o f double gates. Inside
those p erim eter gates is the short approach to the turnstiles. As shown in the photographs ^.ppendix 2, the
latter are in two sections divided by a fence. The northern section consists o f turnstiles 1 to 16. N um bers 1 to
 10 gave access to the n o rth stand. T hus there were 10 turnstiles for the 9,700 w ith north stand seats. Their
tickets were m arked “ Entrance A ” and were colour-coded brown. Turnstiles 1 to 10 correspondingly had the
letter A above them an d brown boards on the wall.

   38. T urnstiles 11 to 16 were for those with seats in the west stand. T h us 4,456 were served by six turnstiles.
T hey were the next block to the right o f those marked A. However, instead o f these turnstiles and the west stand
tickets being m arked B as m ight alphabetically have been expected, they were m ark ed C. Their colour-code on
tickets and boards was red.

   39. O n the o th e r side o f the dividing fence in the approach area, there were only seven turnstiles to serve
10,100 w ith tickets for the west terracing. Those seven turnstiles were labelled A to G. This was because there
had originally been 18 turnstiles at Leppings Lane and the sequential n u m b e rin g continued from 19 upwards
on the south side o f the ground. W hen the num ber at Leppings Lane was brought up to 23 the present
arrangem ents o f 1 to 1-6, A to G and then 19 upwards was adopted to avoid re-num b erin g all round th eground.
However, above the lettering A to G was a large letter B. “ Entrance B” also a pp eared on tickets for the west
terrace. Thus, the three blocks o f turnstiles encountered by a ticket holder at the Leppings Lane end read from
left to right A, C, B. T h e colour-code for west terrace tickets and the bo ard s beside turnstiles A to G was mauve.
To the right o f tu rnstile G is a tubular steel barrier to divide the queue for that turnstile from the roadway to the
south stand.

Inside the Leppings Lane Turnstiles
  40. Turnstiles f t o 10 gave access to a passageway leading to the north stand. T h ere is an exit gate (marked A
on A ppend ix 1) betw een turnstile 1 and the adjacent housing.

  41. I nside turnstiles 1 to 16 is a concourse leading to pens 6 and 7 and the steps to the west stand. There is a
wall dividing this area from that inside turnstiles A to G. It had been built to segregate hom e and away fans at a
tim e w hen the Club intended they should share the west terrace. T h a t idea was not pursued but the wall
rem ain ed . T here was, however, a gateway in the wall which did perm it access between the two areas. An exit
gate (m ark ed B on A ppendix 1) was provided from the area inside turnstiles 11 to 16.

   42. Finally, anyone using turnstiles A to G entered a concourse b o u n d e d on the left by the wall just
m e n tio n e d and on th e right by the wall o f the private roadway coming from the south stand to Leppings Lane.
T h ere was an exit gate in the latter wall (m arked C o n Appendix 1) ju s t inside turnstile G.

  43. All three exit gates, A, B and C, were o f concertina design. They could b e opened only from the inside
and were n ot inte n d e d for entry o f spectators into the ground.

  44. Those entering through turnstiles A to G had three options once inside the ground. They could by
m oving to the right go ro u n d the south en d o f the west stand and.gain entry- into pens 1 and 2. They could go
through the gap in th e dividing wall towards the concourse behind turnstiles 11 to 16 and then round the north
end o f the west sta n d into pens 6 or 7. However, there were no conspicuous signs inviting them to take either o f
tho se courses. T h e obvious way in was straight ahead o f the turnstiles w here a tunnel under the m iddle o f the
west stand gave access to pens 3 and 4. Above its entrance in large letters was th e word “Standing” and a large
letter “ B” . T h u s B ticket holders were drawn towards the tunnel.

   45. T h e length o f the tunnel is some 23 metres. It rises slightly at first then levels off but finally descends
towards the terraces at a gradient o f 1 in 6. As it emerges onto the terrace, the way ahead is bisected by the radial
fence between pen 3 on the right and pen 4 on the left. A short s p u r o fb r ic k wall projects forward from each side
o f th e tunnel at its m ou th. Those emerging are thus guided straight forw ard ra th e r than to either side. The
photog rap h at A ppendix 3 shows the west stand and terraces.

   46. As with the layout on the terraces, the configuration o f the Leppings Lane turnstiles and the areas inside
th em was effected by a series o f piecemeal changes. Again, it will be necessary to analyse their resultant effect.

Policing Arrangements
   47. A t the 1988 semi-final, policing had been und er the control o f Chief Superintendent Mole, then
C o m m a n d e r o f F D ivision w ithin whose area Hillsborough lies. He was still in post on 20 M arch 1989 when
the FA broached the 1989 semi-final, but he was due to hand over c o m m a n d o f F D ivision on 27 M arch to
S u perintendent D uckenfield on the latter’s prom otion to Chief Superintendent. Both were present at an initial
meeting on 22 March, but on 27 M arch M r Mole bowed out and M r Duckenfield took over. U n der him were
Sector C om m an ders, all Superinten dents with m uch experience o f policing football m atches at Hillsborough
and elsewhere. In particular, Superintendent Marshall was in charge o f the area outside th e Leppings Lane
entrance an d the app roaches to it. Superintendent Greenwood was in co m m a n d inside the ground, but this
included the area between the turnstiles and the perim eter fence. They thereby sw apped roles from the
previous year. U n d e r M r D uckenfield’s overall c o m m and were som e 801 officers an d m en on duty at the
ground plus traffic officers and others from D D ivision to deal with the influx o f supporters into the city centre.
In all, therefore, some 1,122 police were deployed for this m atch a m o u n tin g to about 38 per cent o f the total
South Yorkshire force. Included in the m ounted section of 34 were officers from Liverpool an d N ottingham to
assist respectively in m arshalling their home supporters. The total at the ground was divided into serials
consisting usually o f eight to ten Constables plus a Sergeant and an Inspector. The serials were posted to duties
at various stations in an d a ro u n d the ground in three phases: before, du ring and after the match. All o f this
was provided for in an O peration al O rder which followed closely the O rd e r drawn up for the 1988 semi-final
and took into account the force’s “ Standing Instructions for the Policing o f Football G ro u n d s ”. T he O rder
described the duties o f each serial at each phase. It was supplem ented by oral briefings before and on the day o f
the m atch.

Sheffield Wednesday’s Arrangements
  48. T he Club provided 376 stewards, gatemen and turnstile op erators for duty on 15 April. The stewards
were briefed as to their d uties on the morning o f the m atch by police Inspectors an d were allocated round the
ground. They wore yellow tabards. The Club’s control room, situated below the south stand, could
com m u nicate by V H F radio with the stewards. Closed circuit television was installed by the Club with
screens in th e ir control roo m showing all the turnstiles round the ground. A com puterised counting system was
incorporated in the turnstiles. T his flashed onto a screen in the Club control room the running total o f
spectators passing through the tu rn stile s section by section. Thus, at the Leppings Lane end, there would be
separate running totals for turnstiles 1 to 10 (north stand), turnstiles 11 to 16 (west stand), and turnstiles A to G
(west terraces). W hen th e total for any section was within 15 p e rc e n t o f its perm itted capacity a warning pulse
showed on the screen. For th e west terracing that warning would occur when the n um bers were within 15 per
cent o f the total terrace capacity o f 10,100. W hat the system could not do was m on itor the distribution o f fans
on the terracing, pen by pen. It could give no warning therefore if on e pen was full beyond its safe capacity.

Police Communications
   49. T he nerve centre for police control is the control room or box situated at the south-west corner o f the
ground between the south stan d and pen 1 of the west terracing. T he box is elevated an d reached by a num ber
o f steps. It has windows c o m m a n d in g views.across the pitch and straight along the line o f the west perimeter
fence. T he box is very small an d has seats for only three officers. Superintendent M urray was in control o f it
and was advisor to M r D uckenfield as he had been to M r Mole the year before. Next to him sat Sergeant
G o d d a rd who operated the radios. T he third seat was for Police C onstable Ryan who operated the telephone
and public address systems. At the back o f the box stood Police C onstable Bichard who was in control o f the
police closed circuit television system operated by a row o f consoles on a bench in front o f h im and behind the
three seated officers.

   50. T here were five television screens showing views o f five roving cameras fixed at high points on the
stands and directed both inside an d outside the ground. There was also a m aster screen which flicked in
rotation from one cam era view to another and which m ade a video recording. T he cam eras have a zoom
facility to close in on any po in t o f interest. Specifically, there were good cam era views o f the west terracing, of
the Leppings Lane turnstiles and beyond them o f Leppings Lane itself.

  51. T he Tannoy public address system was relayed through speakers fixed at vantage points inside the
ground an d outside the turnstiles. It was used by a disc jockey, housed u n d e r the police control box, to relay
music before the m atch, but it could be overridden by the police. Messages could be relayed through all
speakers or if approp riate to on e area only.
   53. R adio contact at Hillsborough from control to serials operating both inside and outside the ground was
U H F on channel 25. T here was a W1 F U portable base station in the control box and if it failed there was a
stand-by station u n d e r the o p e rator’s bench. H an d sets were issued to all ranks o f Sergeant and above.
C om m u n ity C onstables on duty would already have their own. O th e r Constables had no radio.
C om m un icatio n was on “talk throu gh ” i.e. any message from any source would be heard by everyone tu n ed in
and if more th a n one source spoke messages could become garbled. Ear pieces were issued to som e officers in
an attem pt to overcom e the loud crowd noise which m ade receipt o f signals very difficult. There were other
radio channels open to Sergeant G o d d a rd : V H F to police H eadquarters at Snig Hill, channel 35 to FI
Sub-divisional H ead qu arters at H a m m e rto n R oad and channel 19 used by CID . There was also a set tu ned to
Sheffield W ednesday’s radio system between its control room and the stewards.

                                     15th APRIL: T H E BUILD-UP TO 2.30pm

Early Arrivals
  54. 15 April 1989 was a warm sunny spring Sat jrday. The m atch \ i'as a sell-out, so 54,000 ticket holders
were expected. Others would com e without tickets hoping to acquire hem or even to gain access otherwise.
The following account concentrates, as did the evidence, on the western approaches and the Liverpool
supporters since the disaster occurred at their end. They began to arrive in the Hillsborough area quite early in
small num bers. Some brought cans o f beer with them and were seen drinking as they walked; others took
advantage o f the w eather and sat about on walls and open spaces. W hen the public houses opened, many
resorted there, drinking inside or spilling out into the sunshine. Leppings Lane and its environs com prise a
mixed shopping and residential area. Local residents saw groups o f Liverpool supporters keen to find a public
house or off-licence. M any were asking for tickets or “spares”. There were a few touts selling them at inflated
prices. From an early stage, some o f the fans were using private gardens and yards to urinate. As the m orning
wore on, nu m bers increased. Requests for tickets and trespass to urinate also increased. Still the prevailing
mood was one o f carnival, good h u m o u r and expectation.

Public Houses
  55. T here were some 74 shops with off-licences in and around Sheffield. In general, they opened at 8 am.
Liverpool supporters d id visit them but the evidence did not suggest a great am ount o f alcoholic drink was
bought there.

  56. O p ening time at public houses was in general 11 am. Some rem ained closed all day. O f the others, some
72, mostly in the city, were frequented by local patrons only. Some 23 public houses, however, served over a
hundred Liverpool supporters each. A nother 51 served more than 20 each. Little trouble was reported, but
many supporters drank enough to affect their m ood. At first excitement: later frustration.

The Gathering Crowd              '    C
   57. Towards the end o f the morning, fans gathered on and around the bridge n e a r the Leppings Lane
entrance. They seemed reluctant to enter the ground early. All turnstiles were open at 12 n o on and one or two
as early as 11.30 am. Som e 53 police had been deployed to operate outside the turnstiles an d in the Leppings
Lane area. They enquired at ra n d o m whether fans had tickets. Those who had not were advised to go away;
nevertheless, many returned m ore than once. Those who had tickets were guided in th e right direction. The
police tried to persuade th em to enter the ground early. Officers, male and female, h a d been posted outside
each turnstile with the duty o f searching entrants for weapons, drink or drugs. Once thro ug h the turnstile, an
entrant was liable to be searched again by one o f a serial o f officers positioned just inside.

   58. At about 12 noon C h ie f Inspector Creaser asked Superintendent M urray w h ether the pens on the west
terrace were to be filled one by one successively, but was told that they should all be available from the start and
the fans should find their own level.

  59. By 2 p m it was app arent to those inside the ground and those m onitoring events in the police and Club
control rooms that the n u m b e r o f N ottingham fans in their places greatly o utnum bered those from Liverpool.
The Kop an d the south stand were filling up steadily, but the north and west stands were h a lf empty. It was
noted about that tim e th a t the turnstile figures showed only 12,000 had entered as against 20,000 at the same
time the previous year. O n the west terraces, although pens 3 and 4 were filling, the wing pens 1 ,2 ,6 and 7 were
nearly empty. At 2.15 p m a Tannoy message asked fans in pens 3 and 4 to move forward an d make room for
others.

  60. T here had been three special trains from Liverpool in 1988. This time, there was only one. It arrived
early, ju st before 2 pm, at Wadsley Bridge station. The 350 passengers were met by b o th m ounted and foot
police officers who escorted them in a crocodile down Leppings Lane. They were orderly an d passed through
the turnstiles into the ground by about 2.20 pm without incident.

  61. By this time the police Traffic Division reported that the Liverpool routes were clear, so the majority of
Liverpool fans were in the Sheffield area. T he num bers converging on the Leppings Lane entrance were
increasing rapidly. Between the perim eter gates and the turnstiles the crowd became congested. There was no
longer a separate queue at each turnstile but a single phalanx filling the whole approach area. The foot officers
outside the turnstiles were no longer able to search everyone and had difficulty in searching even selectively.

M o un ted officers in an d outside the turnstile area were having difficulty m an o eu vrin g in such a dense crow d.1
T he police were beset by fans bem used by the ticket and turnstile labelling asking for directions. Many h a d |
been d rinking but up to an d ju st after 2.30 pm the m ood rem ained good.                                           I

   62.
                                                                                                                     I
           S u p e rin tend en t M arshall was on foot amongst the crowd. H e becam e anxious about the n u m b e rs !
coming down Leppings Lane and spilling out onto the roadway where buses and cars were moving. At 2.17 #
pm he radioed to control to have m o to r traffic in Leppings Lane stopped. T his was eventually done at a b o u t!
2.30 pm. U p to this tim e, despite the large mass outside the turnstiles an d the num bers still approaching, th e re !
was still no panic in the crowd; no perception o f crisis by the police. In the control room M r Murray, who could f
see Leppings L ane on the video, advised M r Duckenfield that they would get everyone in by 3 pm. M r f
D uckenfield reaffirm ed to him the policy about a delayed kick-off. It would be ordered only if there was so m e !
m ajor external factor such as fog on the Pennines or delay on the motorw ay: not if spectators merely turned u p !
late even in large num bers.                                                                            f

                                     TH E CRISIS AT THE TURNSTILES

   63. In the 20 minutes from 2.30 pm to 2.50 pm there were crucial developm ents b oth inside and outside
the ground. In pens 3jand 4 there was a steady increase in pressure as m ore fans cam e through the tunnel to the
favoured area behind the goal. B> 2.50 pm these pens were already full to a degree which caused serious
discomfort to many well used to enduring pressure on terraces. The num bers at that tim e were clearly in excess
o f the m a x im u m density stated by the Home Office G uide to Safety at Sports G ro u n d s (1986 Edn) (the G reen
Guide) i.e. 54 persons per 10 square metres. (Although the G reen G u ide has no statutory o r legal force, it is the
only official advice available about safety at sports grounds.) In the wing pens 1, 2, 6 a n d 7, there was still
ample room and bare patches o f concrete were visible.

   64. Meanwhile, the crowd grew at the Leppings Lane entrance. As m ore arrived at the back the crush at the
front grew worse. Entry to the turnstiles becam e m ore difficult. T h eir efficiency was im paired and their rate
reduced. Arrivals at the back exceeded deliveries through the turnstiles, so the build-up increased. The foot
officers outside were unable to function and in danger themselves so they went through the turnstiles and out
again through gate C where they did what they could to relieve pressure by the tu bu lar barrier. The m ounted
officers were surrounded by the dense mass o f people and became ineffective. S u p e rintend en t Marshall was in
the m idst o f the turmoil. H e extricated him self an d stood on a parapet o f the bridge to get a clear view. A
d runken fan tried to push him off: a beer can was thrown at a m ou nted officer. But these were isolated acts by
individuals; the m enace cam e from the massive num bers single-mindedly determ ined to be in for the kick-off
with tim e running out. At the back o f the crowd fans were frustrated by the lack o f progress as 3 o ’clock
approached. Some, mostly young m en who had been drinking, tried to push and force th e ir way forward. At
the front, people were ja m m e d together and against the turnstile walls. Some panicked as the pressure
intensified. Some youngsters and women were fainting and in distress. They were helped out through the
tubular b arrier by turnstile G or were passed over the turnstiles elsewhere. Fans clim bed up and over the
turnstile building or on to the dividing fence. This was to escape the crush rather th a n to gain free entry since
most o f them had tickets.     ^

   65. At 2.44 pm M r Marshall radioed for reinforcements, for the Tannoy to request the crowd to stop
pushing and for a vehicle with loudspeaker eq u ipm ent to come and request the same. Unhappily, at about 2.40
pm, radio com m unication on channel 25 becam e defective. For a period o f two or three m inutes the control
room lost contact. A com m u nication s officer came prom ptly and switched to the standby station. With the use
o f a handset at control, contact was restored. D espite this hiatus, two o f M r M arshall’s requests were received.
T he Tannoy was used but with little effect. Reinforcements, including m ounted officers from Penistone Road,
were sent. T he third request, for a Landrover, was received direct by its driver PC Buxton who arrived at 2.46
pm and urged the crowd by loudspeaker not to push. This was no more effective th a n the Tannoy. The
m ounted officers besieged near the turnstiles cam e outside the perim eter gates. An a tte m p t was made to shut
them against the crowd outside, to enable..the throng inside to be dispersed or at least th in n e d through the
turnstiles. T h e pressure from w ithout, however, opened the gates again. M ounted officers, now reinforced to
greater num bers, formed a co rdon across the elbow o f Leppings Lane from the sweet shop to the bridge, again
with the object o f reducing pressure inside the gates. They were successful in this for som e minutes despite
desperate individuals forcing their way und er or between the horses. However, this exercise was overtaken by a
more d ram atic relief o f the pressure.

“Open the Gates”
   66. Between 2.40 pm an d 2.45 pm the crowd inside and outside the turnstile a p p roach had swelled to
over 5,000. At the head o f the phalanx conditions had become intolerable. Those who got through were short
o f breath an d sweating profusely. M any com plained to police officers on the concourse inside the turnstiles
and asked them in forceful term s to do something. Exit gates A and B were being shaken. It was clear the crowd
could not pass through the turnstiles by 3 pm. Police Constable Buxton radioed from the Landrover to control
asking that kick-off be postponed. T he suggestion was acknowledged but rejected.

  67. Superintendent Marshall realised the crowd had become unm anageable. Although loth to do so, since it
was contrary to basic police strategy, he decided to request the exit gates be opened to relieve the pressure.
Otherwise, he feared fatalities would occur. O th e r senior officers outside the ground agreed. At 2.47 p m he
radioed control to perm it the gates to be opened. At 2.48 pm, whilst M r D uckenfield was considering the
request, gate C opened to eject a youth who had climbed in with no ticket. Immediately, fans outside took
advantage and about 150 m anaged to get in before a m ounted officer enabled the gate to be closed again. Mr
Marshall repeated his request. Still no response from control. He repeated it a third tim e, adding that if the
gates were not open ed som eone was going to be killed. In the control room , M r D uckenfield had not made a
decision. M r M urray asked him “Are you going to open the gates?” . M r D uckenfield gave the order and Sgt
G o d d a rd radioed to M r M arshall “O pen the gates” . N either the Club control room n o r any police officers
inside the turnstiles were told of this order before o r after it was given or o f any action it would require.

  68. At 2.52 pm , gate C was opened wide. Fans behind turnstiles A to G and from the concourse beyond
came round tb flow through it in large numbers.

   69. About two m inu tes later the pressure outside gate A led Sgt Higgins to radio, despite the gateman’s
objection, for it to be opened. If it was not, he said, “ It’ll go an d someone will get killed” . P erm ission was given,
but this tim e reserve serials were alerted to m onitor the inrush towards the n o rth stand. G ate B was also briefly
opened against the g a te m a n ’s wishes and about 200 o f those pressed at turnstiles A to G gained entry to their
left.

   70. T he largest entry, however, was through gate C. In the five m inutes it was open about 2,000 fans passed
through it steadily at a fast walk. Some may have had tickets for the stands. N o d o u b t som e had no tickets at all.
T he m ajority had tickets for the terraces. O f these, some found their way either right to pens 1 and 2 or left
through the div id ing wall to 6 and 7. But a large proportion headed straight for the tunnel in front o f them.

                                                T H E DISASTER

   71. T he initial influx through gate C, augm ented by entrants via the turnstiles, cam e through the tunnel
with great m o m entum . Fans spoke o f being swept through, feet off the ground. T he 1 in 6 gradient accelerated
their progress. Upj3n reaching the crowded pens, some wished to go back but were unable to do so. The new
arrivals found thehiselves pushed forward and th e pressure becam e intense. At 2.54 pm , shortly after this
influx began, the team s cam e onto the pitch. As usual, this was greeted by a surge forward. M any were now
acutely uncom fortable and some were in distress. T he mass seethed about but voluntary m ovem ent by any
individual was difficult; hands down could not be raised and some fans found it hard to breathe. Still the flow
continued through the tunnel causing further surges forward. There were shouts for help and for the gates to be
opened to the pitch. Police officers on the perim eter track did not im m ediately react. In the deafening noise
from chanting and shouting they did not at first recognise the problem. Realisation cam e at different m om ents
to different officers in different places.

   72. G ate 3 sprang open un d e r the intense pressure from within. An officer quickly closed it. Shortly
afterwards, it sprang again; officers tried to shut it. Those seeking to escape were urged and pushed back. G ate
4 was opened by a policem an who noticed the crushing. People began to spill out through it a n d were directed
to the wing pens where there was still ample room. Meanwhile, gate 4 was closed again and then re-opened. At
gate 3, a Constable, now alive to th e crisis, followed strictly his written orders and radioed for permission to
open th a t gate. Receiving no reply, he took it upon him self to open it.

  73. Just before 3 pm , the m atch kicked off. At the same time, gate C, which had been closed at 2.57 pm ,
was reopened and a steady trickle continued to e n ter through the tunnel.

   74. To escape the crush, fans began climbing the radial fences out o f pens 3 an d 4 into pens 2 and 5. Others
tried to get over the front p erim eter fence bu t were at first tu rned back by police who feared a pitch invasion.
N ear the front, fans, mostly youngsters, were weakened to the point o f collapse an d in som e instances death b ut
they were held upright by pressure-all round. F u rth e r back, m ost were so preoccupied with the pain of being
pressed against barriers and with breathing problem s that they saw nothing o f the game. But at the rear there
were m any who, although cram ped, were watching the football unaware o f the distress at the front.

  75. At 3.04 pm , Beardsley for Liverpool struck the crossbar at the Kop end. T h ere was a roar from the
Liverpool fans and at the sam e tim e a powerful surge forwards in pen 3. T he several surges w hich occurred after
the influx from gate C carried the pressure down the pens towards the pitch. T h e force becam e such as to twist
and break two spans o f a crush b arrier towards the front o f pen 3. The evidence does not establish with
certainty when this happened. Probably it was triggered by the surge at 3.04 pm . But I a m sure it occurred after
the influx from gate C so greatly increased the pressure in the pen. W hen the barrier broke those whom it had
supported were projected towards the perim eter fence. M any fell and the involuntary rush o f those behind
pressed them down. The crushing force was tra nsm itted and dispersed so that all along the front o f pen 3 fans
were pressed hard up against the low wall and the wire mesh o f the fence above it.

  76. In pen 4 no barrier broke. Nevertheless those at the front were crushed against wall an d fence. Further
back, two barriers were bowed and some individuals succumbed to the pressure aro u n d them .

   77. Surges on terraces are com m on. Usually, they go forward, then recede. H ere, with the weight o f
num bers, there was no receding. T h e pressure stayed and for those crushed breathless by it, standing or prone,
life was ebbing away. If no relief came in four m inutes there would be irreversible b ra in damage; if longer,
death.

  78. In the control room no-one noticed the overcrowding or anything amiss in pens 3 a n d 4 until the first
fans spilt out onto the perim eter track just before kick-off. Then, the officers in c o m m a n d assum ed that there
was an attem pted pitch invasion. They called up reserve serials waiting in the gym nasium an d all available
officers elsewhere to go to the pitch. A request was m ade to H Q for dog handlers.

   79. Superintendent G reenw ood, the G round C om m ander, was by the players’ tu n n e l at the kick-off. He
noticed fans on the track and went to the west end behind the goal. As he approached, he did not think the pens
overcrowded until he was very close and saw those pressed against the fence. Even then, he thought the
situation “retrievable” if those higher up the pen relieved the pressure. He clim bed on the wall below the fence
and signalled with both hands to those behind to move back. O ther officers join ed him . It was impossible.
Those fans who would have w ished to comply were powerless to do so. Behind them , there were still many
unaware o f the crisis, w atching the game. T he football continued to joyous shouting and singing round the rest
o f the ground while those crushed an d trapp ed slowly expired.

  80.    W hen M r G re e n w o o d ’s signals to move back proved fruitless, he tried to radio for the m atch to be
stopped. At first, his message was not received by control, so he signalled with his arms towards the control
box. M r Duckenfield sent M r M urray down from the box to have the m atch stopped via the linesman, the
Agreed emergency drill. Before he could do so, M r G reenw ood ran over the pitch to the referee who stopped the
game. It was 5 'k m inutes past 3.

                                               TH E AFTERMATH

Rescue Attempts
   81. From 3 o’clock, gates 3 an d 4 had been open and rem ained so. At first, fans had walked or staggered out
winded and faint. But the final surge at 3.04 pm, and the struggle to reach the open gates, caused a horrendous !
blockage o f bodies. The dead, the dying and the desperate bccamc interwoven in the sum p at the front o f the
pens, especially by the gates. Those with strength left clambered o verothers submerged in the hu m an heap and
tried to climb out over the fence. They were now helped by police and other fans who hauled them up and over. !
N um bers o f fans were clim bing over the radial fcnces into adjacent pens. At the back, m any were hauled up !
into the west stand to relieve the pressure.

   82. T he steps from the sum p at gateways 3 an d 4 were so congested with bodies live and dead that each had
to be prised from the pile by the police. Initially, no officer took effective charge. A n u m b e r o f individual
officers and fans worked frantically to free those trapped but the gateways were so narrow th a t only two or three 1
could get at the entw ined bodies Willing hands got in one another's way. More officers arrived from the
gym nasium an d elsewhere in the ground. Many used their own initiative to help those laid o ut on the pitch, to
assist in getting others over the fencing and to comfort the distressed. But some stood in groups near the
perim eter fence not knowing w hat to do. They had been sum m oned in response to what was thought to be a
threat to public order. W hat they found was a horrific scene o f carnage and some young officers were shocked
into im potence by w hat they saw.

  83. It was truly gruesome. T h e victims were blue, cyanotic, incontinent; their m ouths open, vomiting; their
eyes staring. A pile o f dead bodies lay and grew outside gate 3. Extending further and furth er on to the pitch, the
injured were laid down a n d a ttem pts made to revive them. More and more walking survivors flooded ou t on to
the pitch as the players left. T h e scene was emotive and chaotic as well as gruesome. As the enormity o f the
disaster was realised, m any o f the fans milling ab ou t were bitter and hostile to the police, blaming them for
what had happened. Officers were confronted, abused, spat upon and even assaulted. A small nu m b e r o f
hysterical fans had to be sub d ued-

   84. A dding to the chaos, a n u m b e r o f press photographers dodged about among rescue workers apparently
avid to secure ph o tographs at point blank range o f those dying through the wire mesh an d those laid on the
pitch. Angry fans sought to assault them. Police had to intervene.

   85. At about 3.12 p m , C h ief Superintendent Nesbit, C o m m and er of the Traffic Division, arrived on the
pitch. He took charge at gate 3 and organised a chain of officers to simplify and expedite the extraction of
casualties from the pen. In the absence of any mechanical means, police and fans together pulled and worked
at the wire mesh with their bare hands and their feet to breach the fencing. They succeeded in both pens,
enabling officers to get in a n d fans to be got out.

   86. By now, som e officers o f their own .initiative went round from the pitch to the tunnel where they m et
other office rs fro m the turnstiles and the west stand. Together, they tried to persuade fans at the rear of the pens
to go back through the tunnel. Some complied, b u t many resisted, wishing to stand their ground. Casualties
were brought out through the tunnel, and as the pressure in the pens was relieved, officers were able to get
further in an d bring o u t m ore casualties, dead and alive. They were laid on the ground in the concourse outside
the tunnel an d a tte m p ts were m ade to revive them.

First Aid
  87. The St John A m bulance Brigade had some 30 personnel posted round the ground for the match - 25
adults and 5 ju n io r cadets, They were quickly on the scene when the first casualties em erged and sought to
revive them . T heir D ivisional Superintendent, M r Wells, tried unsuccessfully to help those pressed against the
fencing by feeding oxygen to th em through the m esh until they could be got out.

  88. D r Purcell, Sheffield W ednesday’s doctor, came from his seat in the south stand and attem pted
resuscitation. Assisted by a male nurse from the crowd, he moved from patient to patient doing what he could,
but in m ost cases it was too late.

   89. At 3.13 p m a St Jo h n ’s ambulance came onto the pitch at the north-east corner and drove to the
p erim eter fence close to gate 3. There was no call for doctors and nurses on the public address system until
nearly 3.30 pm. Nevertheless, as the minutes ticked past, some o f them came onto the pitch to help o f their
own accord when they saw the casualties and the am bulance an d realised the gravity o f the situation. Many
fans also worked prodigiously in a tte m p ts to revive the dead an d the dying, in some cases their own relatives
and friends. Artificial respiration, m o u th to m outh respiration an d cardiac massage were applied by th e skilled
and the unskilled b u t usually in vain. T hose capable of survival mostly cam e round o f their own accord. The
rest wei;e mostly d o o m e d before they could be brought out and treated.

    90. "there was an urgent need to get casualties off the pitch a n d to hospital. T here were six stretchers in the
first aid room a n d three in the St J o h n ’s am bulance. They were quickly brought into use. T hen the fans
im provised by tearing down the hoardings around the edge o f the pitch and against the stands so that lengths o f
bo ard could be used as stretchers. Im provising in this way, parties o f fans a n d police ran repeatedly th e length
o f the pitch bearing casualties to the north-east corner. A n u m ber were dead on arrival there.

In the Control Room
  91. M r D uckenfield stayed in the control room. Chief Inspector M cRobbie was there in civilian clothes as
an observer. M r D uckenfield sent him down to the track to tell a policewoman a t gate 1 to a d m it those
displaced from the centre pens. M r Duckenfield did not realise there were injuries until he saw som eone laid
on the pitch. Even then, he did not realise the nature o f the problem or its scale.

   92. M r M urray re tu rn e d from his a tte m p t to stop the m atch and M r Duckenfield sent him down again to
clear the pitch a n d assess the situation. A message was broadcast requesting fans to clear the pitch. T his was
because M r D uckenfield could not from the control room see clearly w hat was happening for the milling and
increasing num bers.

   93. T he A ssistant C h ie f Constable (Operations), M r Jackson, had attend ed the m atch in civilian clothes as
a guest o f the Club. H e cam e from his seat in the south stand to ask what had happened. M r D uckenfield was
unable to say; he did not tell M r Jackson that the exit gates had been opened on his authority. M r Jackson went
down to th e pitch to discover the situation.

   94. A t 3.06 p m M r D uckenfield, still primarily concerned ab ou t public order, caused a message to be sent
to H e a d q u a rte rs asking for O peration Support. T h at was a call for all available additional police resources to
com e to the ground to strengthen the police presence.

   95. M r Jackson was told by M r G reenw ood that there were casualties and returned im m ediately to control
to m ake sure emergency services were alerted. Meanwhile, M r M urray had seen the plight o f those behind the
fence. H e radioed to control that a fleet o f am bulances was required. He also asked for a Tannoy b roadcast to
those in the pens to move back b ut there is no clear evidence that it was m ade.

  96. O nly w hen M r Duckenfield received the request for a fleet o f am bulances did he realise the n a tu re and
gravity o f th e situation. Then, supp orted by M r Jackson, he caused messages to be sent converting O peration
Support in to calls for the M ajor D isaster Plan.

No Information
   97. A p a rt from the message to clear the pitch and the belated call for medical assistance ab ou t 3.30 prn, no
in fo rm a tio n o r advice was broadcast on the public address system. M r D uckenfield feared th at th e crowd
might tu rn hostile o r m ight all a tte m p t to leave together thereby h am pering the emergency services i f they were
given in fo rm a tio n a b o u t what had happened. T he result was that apart from those close enough at the west end
to see th e terrible tru th for themselves, the majority o f the crowd were left in ignorance. Many, especially
N ottin g h a m su pporters in the Kop, still thought there had been a pitch invasion or other m isb eh av io ur by
Liverpool fans. T hey continu ed singing and chanting incongruously. This infuriated som e Liverpool fans who
were already distraught. A few began to run towards the Kop end. T he police feared violence m ight result on
top o f th e existing disaster. Accordingly, they deployed a large n u m b e r o f officers to form a line across the
width o f the pitch at the Kop end a n d advance up to the halfway line sweeping any Liverpool fans back as they
moved. T h e re th e line stood as an insurance against disorder but doing nothing. O th e r officers were posted to
the p e rim e te r track facing the north stand for the same purpose. To those distressed a n d d istraught who
wanted urgent action, this large contingent o f passive officers was seen as an affront. Feelings against th e police
intensified.

Misinformation
  98. At a b o u t 3.15 pm , M r G ra h a m Kelly, C hief Executive o f the FA, M r K irton also o f the FA and Mr
G ra h a m Mackrell, Secretary o f Sheffield Wednesday, went to the control room for inform atio n. Mr
D uckenfield told th e m he thought there were fatalities and the game was likely to be a b an do n ed . H e also said a


                                                            16
gate had been forced and there had been an inrush o f Liverpool supporters. He pointed to one o f the television
screens focussed on gate C by the Leppings Lane turnstiles and said “T h a t’s the gate th a t’s been forced: there’s
been an in ru sh ”. Inevitably M r Kelly was interviewed a little later live on television. He spoke o f the two stories
concerning the gate - the fans’ account that the police had opened it, the police assertion that the fans had
forced th eir way in.

  99. A bout 3.30 pm there was a further meeting in the Club’s boardroom . M r Duckenfield went thefre and
met M r Kelly, the referee an d representatives o f the three clubs. ACC Jackson was also there. M r
Duckenfield indicated the m atch was likely to be abandoned although no firm ruling was given. He added that
he d id not want people to know it was to be aban do ned lest the dispersing crowd h a m p e r the emergency
operations.

Public Announcements
   100. Later the m anagers o f the two teams were asked to go to the control room. They were invited there to
m ake a public a n n o un cem en t to calm the crowd. M r Kenny Dalglish agreed to do so. He told the crowd that
there were problem s and asked th e m to assist the police and those rendering first aid. He asked for calm and his
message was well received. It was then 3.56 pm. At 4.10 pm it was announced that the m atch was abandoned
for th a t day. Again that message was received calmly by the crowd most o f whom behaved responsibly as they
dispersed.

Fire Brigade
   101. M eanwhile the emergency services had been in action. At about 3.10 pm a request came from the
perim eter fence to control for bolt croppers to cut the wire mesh. Sergeant G o d d a rd contacted the police garage
close by w ithout success. At 3.13 pm, PC Bichard requested H eadquarters to call the fire service to bring
hydraulic cutting e q u ipm en t to th e Leppings Lane entrance.

   102. T h ere was no arran gem en t for a fire officer to be present during the m atch. However, the M ajor
D isaster Plan required all enxergency services to be alerted. After ’phone messages which m ust be described
later, fire appliances arrived at.bo th Leppings Lane and Penistone Road at 3.22 pm. At both entrances their
arrival surprised police who were uninform ed as to why they had been called o r where they should go.

   103. At Leppings Lane a police Inspector told Station Officer Swain “ I d o n ’t really th in k we need you” .
A n o ther police officer then asked for more resuscitators as people were dying so M r Swain radioed for ten fire
appliances. Each carries oxygen an d resuscitation equipment.

   104. At the Kop end, Leading Firem an Housley arrived with an emergency te n d e r and Station Officer
Fletcher in another appliance, each with a crew. T he emergency ten der came along the roadway by the south
stand b ut owing to its height was unable to proceed further. It therefore backed out an d went to the Leppings
Lane en trance losing som e eight minutes. From there, M r Housley and his crew went onto the pitch with
resuscitation equipm ent. They rendered help there and later at the gym nasium. M r F letcher and his men ran
along b ehind the south stand carrying cutting-equipm ent and oxygen cylinders. W h en they arrived at the
fence, the cutting equ ip m e n t was not required as by then the last o f the dead and injured were being removed
from the pens. M r Fletcher set up a casualty clearing area under the police box and firemen assisted in carrying
victim s as well as rendering first aid on the pitch.

South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service (SYMAS)
   105. Before 1986 there had been no SYMAS representative routinely present at H illsborough matches. The
Club was content, as indeed are m any other clubs, to rely upon the St Jo h n ’s A m bulance Brigade and a 999 call
if necessary. From 1986 onwards, after representations, the Club provided two seats in the south stand for
SYMAS staff at League m atches. At one stage it was suggested they would be best placed in the north stand
close to the gym nasium which had been designated as the casualty centre in the event o f a m ajor incident. The
south stand seats were allotted as they placed the SYMAS staff closer to the players’ tunn el should a player be
injured. T hese seats were, however, not available at Cup semi-finals. SYMAS representatives nevertheless
attended at the semi-finals by arrangem ent with the police in 1988 and again in 1989. T h e SYMAS officers
stood on the ram p leading to th e pitch at the north-east corner. They had one am bulance outside the ground
and one on standby.

   106. O n 15 April 1989, Officers Higgins and Eason were at the ground with an a m b u la n re and crew. They
noticed fans on the track and went to the Leppings Lane end whilst the game was still in progress. They began
to atten d to casualties. Meanwhile, at 2.59 pm , there had been a call from Police C onstable Waugh at police


                                                            17
H e ad q uarters to the Hillsborough police control asking if am bulances were required. This was on the
instruction o f C hief Inspector E dm undson who had heard over the radio, as had Police Constable Waugh
himself, crowd noise an d snatches o f speech from Hillsborough suggesting distress and possible injuries. The
reply from the control box was: no reports o f injuries but keep standing by. At 3.07 pm after hearing from the
ground th a t there m ight be injuries, police H eadquarters notified SYMAS th a t am bulances mighi be required.
Then, seconds later, M r M urray’s request for a fleet o f am bulan ces was relayed to SYMAS. Tlley reacted at
once. A m bulances began to arrive at the Leppings Lane entrance at 3.13 pm and at the Penistone Road
entrance at 3.17 pm. In all, some 42 am bulances attended, 31 o f them from SYMAS and 11 from
neighbouring authorities. By 4.30 pm, they had conveyed some 172 casualties to the N orthern General
H ospital and the Royal Hallamshire Hospital.

Gymnasium
   107. T he gym nasium had been in use for serving meals to the police. W hen the M ajor Disaster Plan was                    <
ordered, it was cleared and divided into two. One end becam e a tem porary m ortuary; the other was used as a
casualty clearing area for the injured. As the stretchers, designed an d improvised, brought in more and more
casualties, the scene was initially and inevitably chaotic a n d harrowing. T h ere was intense distress amongst
the injured an d bereaved; relatives were reluctant to be parted from the dead and sought to revive them. There
were people looking for missing friends and relations; there were recrim inations, there were scuffles. Some of
those involved were the worse for drink. Doctors and nurses had followed the casualties in from the pitch and
sought to attend the injured as best they could in the adverse circumstances. Those in m ost urgent need of
hospital tre a tm e n t were taken to am bulances as they arrived, triage being employed to determ ine priorities.             ,
D octors were requested by the police to exam ine each person thought to be deceased to confirm and certify
death. A police Constable was detailed to attend and guard each o f the dead and a photograph o f each was
taken by a police photographer so that relatives coming to identify bodies could be spared the ordeal of
searching am ongst all who had died.

The Dead and the Injured
   108. O f the 95 who died, the evidence suggests that at least 16 and probably 21 cam e through gate C after it
opened at 2.52 pm. T h a t is established by the statem ents o f relatives and friends who cam e through with them
bu t survived.
                                                                                                                           |
   109. By com m end ab le hard work, a team o f pathologists headed by Professor U sher completed                         I
po st-m ortem exam inations on all the deceased within 48 hours. They found th a t 88 o f the victim s were male
and seven female. Thirty-eight were u n d e r 20 years o f age, 39 were between 20 and 29 years an d only three were
over 50. In virtually every case the cause o f death was crush asphyxia due to compression o f the chest wall                  ’
against oth e r bodies or fixed structures so as to prevent inhalation. In all bu t n ine cases that was the sole cause.       i
In one, pressure on the chest had been so great as to rupture th e aorta; in six cases there were also injuries to the         j
head, neck o r chest; in the remaining two cases, natural disease was a contributory factor. In 18 cases bones                 j
were fractured. T hirteen o f those were rib fractures. However, one was a fractured femur, one a fractured                    j
radius an d the rem aining three involved fractures o f bones or cartilages round the voice box. These injuries
suggest the victim s m ay have been trod den while on the ground.

  110. Blood samples were taken from the dead. N o alcohol was found in any o f the females. O f the males, 51
had no m o re than 10 milligrams per cent in their blood which is negligible; 15 had over 80 milligrams per cent
and six over 120 milligrams per cent.

  111. A lthough the great majority o f those who died were in pen 3, at least five were in pen 4. M ost deaths
occurred at the front o f the pens but there were a few fatalities further back.

  112. In all, some 730 people com plained o f being injured inside the ground and 36 outside it. O f the 730,
about 30% are thought to have entered through gate C after 2.52 pm. T he largest category o f injury was
bruising, especially to the ribs and chest.
                                                  CHAPTER 6

                                            SPECIFIC INCIDENTS

  113. I have given my findings as to the basic factual background and the m ain sequence o f events in
narrative form. There was very little conflict as to the principal events save as to some tim ings and numbers.
1 ndeed, the consistency o f the evidence lnas been a remarkable feature o f this Inquiry. T h e experiences o f most
witnesses were unforgettable and no daubt the early hearing helped to preserve accurate memory. Also, the
existence o f tim ed videos and photographs and o f logged and taped messages provided reliable checks by
which to p ro m p t and test witness recollection. Accordingly, I have not for the most part burd en ed the narrative
with citations from the evidence o f individual witnesses.

   114. However, there were several instances o f detailed evidence a n d assertions being highlighted by the
m edia in d ram atic and em otive terms during the hearing. Since some o f those m uch-publicised incidents gave
rise to u nfair criticism, they ought to be the subject o f specific findings. I have therefore dealt with them
individually at A ppendix 6.

    115. This disaster was the worst in the history o f British football. It h ap pened because pens 3 and 4 became
grossly overcrowded. They were uncom fortably overcrowded by 2.50 pm at least to a degree which required
th a t they should be closed to fu rth er arrivals. Even the n um bers com ing through the turnstiles in the last 10 4
m in utes would have increased the pressure beyond danger poin t and there would have been injuries if not             J
fatalities. As it was, the influx through gate C after 2.52 pm so increased the pressure in the two pens as to
cause fatal crushing.

    116. T h e overcrowding up to 2.52 pm was due to a n u m b e r o f factors which can be considered broadly
u n d e r three heads.
   (i) T he layout at the Leppings Lane end.
  (ii) Lack o f fixed capacities for the pens.
 (iii) Lack o f effective m onitoring o f the terraces.

  117. T he crushing and fatalities after 2.52 pm m ust be considered un d e r a n u m b e r o f headings.
 (iv) T he build-up at the turnstiles.
  (v) T he blu nd er on opening the gates.
 (vi) T he barriers in pen 3.
 (vii) T h e crushing not recognised.
(viii) T h e response o f the police.
 (ix)   T he perim eter gates were too small.

                               T H E LAYOUT AT T H E LEPPINGS LANE END

  118. I have already observed that the layout o f the turnstile area, o f the terraces and o f the concourse
between them was the result o f piecemeal changes. A brief history o f these changes is now necessary.

The History
   119. Before 1965, the Leppings Lane end consisted entirely o f terracing like the Kop. In that year, the west
stand was built and the terraces rem aining in front o f it were truncated to their present d epth, front to back. As
to width, they consisted o f a single standing area with no dividing fences. D uring the early 197 0 ’s, hooliganism
and pitch invasions m ade it necessary to prevent access to the playing area and the p e rim e te r fences were
therefore erected in 1977.


   120. Section 1 o f the Safety o f Sports G ro u n d s Act 1975 empowered the Secretary o f State to designate a
sports sta d iu m having, in his opinion, accom m odation for m ore than 10,000 as a stadium requiring a
certificate from the local authority. Hillsborough was so designated with effect from 1 Janu ary 1979 by SI
 1978/1091. In anticipation o f th a t date, Sheffield Wednesday instructed Eastwood an d Partners, a firm o f
consulting engineers, to act on their beh alf especially in their dealings with the local authority. Dr Eastwood,
the principal o f the firm, is a highly experienced civil and structural engineer and has advised several m ajor
football clubs. He recom m ended that a n u m b e r o f additional crush barriers should be ad ded since those
already in place were insufficient to comply with the Green Guide (1976 edition). T h a t work was approved
and carried o u t during 1979.


  121. T h e relevant local a u th o rity at the tim e was the South Yorkshire County Council. It s e tu p an Officer
Working Party consisting o f representatives o f the police, the fire service, its own building surveyor’s division
and its own legal and administra.jjon-department. T he Working Party m ade inspections an d consulted with the
Club and D r Eastwood. A Safety Certificate was issued on 21 D ecem ber 1979 for an indefinite period. It has
remained in force ever since and has not been am ended.


   122. Schedule 3 o f the certificate sets out the m ax im um crowd capacity for various areas in the ground. T h e
figure for the west terrace is '7,200 and for the north-west terrace 2,900. T hese figures were intended to be in
accordance w ith the G reen G u id e (1976). Paragraph 15.4 provided for a m axim um “ packing density” o f
between 54 a n d 27 persons p er 10 square m etres depending on the condition o f the terrace. D r Eastwood had
calculated 8,000 for the west terrace on the basis o f 54 per 10 square metres. He thought this a justified starting
figure in view o f his im proved system o f barriers. However, he reduced it to 7,200 because there were no
gangways on the terrace and he did not think it feasible to provide any. So, the total figure for the Leppings Lane
terraces was a n d is 10,100.


The 1981 Semi-Final
   123. As already m entioned, there was crushing at the Cup semi-final in 1981. T h e m atch was between
T ottenham H o tsp u r and W o lverham pton W anderers. T he police debriefing m inutes after the incident
prophetically refer,


  “to the late arrival o f a large n u m b e r o f spectators who were still waiting to enter th e Leppings Lane
  enclosure when the m atch started. The flash po int occurred when T ottenham scored” (at th e Kop end) “after
  only three minutes. T h e spectators ju st entering pushed forward to see what was h ap penin g and caused a
  crush, w hich resulted in the injuries”.


   124. T hose being crushed called for the perim eter gates to be opened onto the track. There was no
im m ediate reaction, according to M r Vaux w ho was there, but fortunately a police Inspector gave instructions
and the gates were then opened. A bout 250 cam e o ut onto the track. T here were broken a rm s, legs and ribs and
38 were treated either in hospital o r by the St Jo h n A m bulance Brigade. It is clear from th e docum ents (a) that
the turnstile readings showed the capacity figure o f 10,100 had been exceeded by over 400 (b) that the police
shut off fu rth e r access to th e terraces because o f crushing, and (c) the police view after the event was that the
capacity figure o f 10,100 in the Safety Certificate was too high. This latter view was com m un icated to the Club
by the C h ie f Superintend en t then in com m a n d o f F Division but it was not pursued.


                                                          21
Three Pens                                                                                |
    125. After this incident in April 1981 the police requested that the terrace should be divided into sections.                 |
T h e object was to im prove crowd control by reducing sideways movement. D ivision would enable m ore even                       J
distrib ution to be effected when there was a capacity crowd. It would also enable the west end to be used for                    J
b o th hom e a n d away supporters who could be segregated in separate pens, if necessary with an em pty pen                       I
between them .

   126. T h is proposal was agreed by the Club and the Officer W orking Party a n d was approved by the local               |
authority. Two radial fences were accordingly fitted in N ovem ber 1981. They are the fence now separating pens             |
2 and 3 an d th a t now separating 5 a n d 6, T h e result was to divide the whole terrace into three pens. Access from , jj
the concourse to the m iddle pen was through the tunnel and to the wing pens ro un d the sides o f the west stand.
D r Eastwood suggested and illustrated an altered layout which would have provided separate access through                 ;j
separate banks o f turnstiles to the north stand, to each end o f the west stand, a n d to each of the three pens.           j
W hilst the m a in object o f this was segregation, such a layout would have enabled each of those areas to be
m o n ito red num erically via the turnstiles so as to ensure its m a xim um capacity was not exceeded. T he plan was    »j
n ot adopted. T h e m ax im u m capacity for the new centre pen was calculated at 2.200, but no alteration was
m a d e to the Safety Certificate so to limit it nor was there any means mechanically o f counting the num bers jgj
going into th a t pen.                                                                             |

The 1985 Changes                                                                                                            %
    127. By 1985, Sheffield Wednesday had been p rom oted to the First D ivision an d was draw ing larger                   | ::
crowds. T h e im p ro v e m e n t o f the Leppings Lane end was raised again by the Club and D r Eastwood prepared a        H
n u m b e r o f drawings. T hese illustrated various schemes for achieving segregation by providing m ore turnstiles
in separate banks an d divisions o f the concourse. T h e police wanted furth er divisions of the terrace itself,
again to im prove control and segregation. T here was m uch discussion o f these schemes which included                          ‘j
suggestions o f 29 a n d even 34 turnstiles in total. In the result, the following alterations were carried out in
1985.                                                                                |

New Radial Fences
   128. O n th e terraces, two m ore radial fences were fitted. O ne divided the existing central pen into the
present pens 3 an d 4. G ates were fitted at the m ou th o f the tunnel to enable each o f those pens to be closed off.
T h e second fence was placed in the new pen 4 so as to create the narrow pen 5 intended to be a sterile area. Until        *
those two fences were a d d e d there existed only perim eter gates 1 ,2 ,4 ,5 and 6. T h e creation o f pen 3 required a
new gate 3 to be fitted which was done.

Barriers
    129. T h e lines o f the new radial fences ran across existing crush barriers so th at w ithout m odification those
barriers would have run through the fencing. T h e police considered the barriers would be used by fans as
convenient m o u n tin g points to scale the new fences, thereby defeating their object. They therefore wished i
spans to be rem oved from ttie barriers. H ad their wishes been met in full th e result would have been an i
u n im p e d e d run in pen 3 from the m o uth of the tunnel down the south side o f the new fence to the perimeter. D r 1
Eastw ood dug his heels in against that proposal which he rightly regarded as dangerous. He d id however agree I
to som e m odificatio n to the m iddle row o f barriers in th e newly created pen 3, chiefly to facilitate access.
Likewise in the new pen 5. The 1985 m odifications to the pens are shown on the plan A ppendix 4.

The Turnstiles and Concourse
   130. At th e entrance, m odification b u t no increase in n u m b e r was m ade at the turnstiles. T he bank 1 to 16 ;
was divided from A to G by the metal fence now in place and th a t division was projected across the concourse .
inside the turnstiles in the form o f a brick wall. A personnel gate was provided for access through that wall but
was enlarged to its present size at the request o f the police. T hose alterations were m ade in the interests o f ’
segregation. T h e m ore elaborate divisions which D r Eastwood had suggested, giving separate access to each . t
sub-division o f the accom m od atio n, were not pursued for financial reasons. In May 1985 the Bradford <
disaster occurred. T he south stand at Hillsborough had wooden decking and the Club realised it would have to f
u ndertake expensive remedial works there. T h e cantilever ro o f o f the sam e stand was also discovered to !
require expensive repairs.

   131. In fact, shortly after the new dividing fence and wall had been built at the Leppings Lane entrance and             J'
concourse, the Club, by agreement with C hiefSuperintendent Mole, ceased to a ccom m od ate hom e supporters                ,
at the Leppings Lane end. T here was therefore no longer any need for segregation at th a t end, but the wall
rem ained.


                                                           22
   132. Also in 1985, electronic counting equipm ent was installed at all turnstiles. This conveyed the running
count for each bank o f turnstiles, for example A to G, to a television screen in the Club control room where the
figures were displayed. In 1986, an electronic eye was installed in each turnstile boo th to catch and record
anyone who clim bed over the turnstile.

Barrier 144
   133. In J u n e 1986, the police requested that the crush barrier nearest to the tunnel at the entrance to pens 3
and 4 should be removed to assist the flow of fans into the pens. They found it caused o bstruction because it
was in a good viewing position and spectators liked to stand against it in num bers thereby blocking access by
others fu rth e r into the pens. T h e police also suggested it might ham per effective evacuation through the tunnel
especially in an emergency. D r Eastwood considered the pros and cons o f this proposal a n d accepted the police
view. T he Officer Working Party approved the proposal at a meeting on 7 August 1986 on site. Authority was
given then a n d there by M r Bownes on behalf o f the Sheffield City Council which had taken over responsibility
for the Safety Certificate from South Yorkshire County Council on 1 April 1986. Two spans o f the barrier were
therefore rem oved, leaving only one span in pen 4 as shown on A ppendix 4.

Effects of the Layout
   134. T h e result o f these changes was to divide the terrace into a n u m b e r o f small areas w ithout providing
any co m p uterised or m echanical m eans o f limiting entry numerically into any one area if all areas were open
for choice. Before the fences a n d pens had divided the terrace, the overall figure of 10,100 could be monitored
via the turnstiles an d in theory the crowd could even itself out laterally. Even then, it was not possible strictly to
ensure com pliance with Schedule 3 Part 1 o f the Safety Certificate which prescribed a m a x im u m of 2,900 for
the north-west terrace and 7,200 for the west terrace. Paragraph 3 o f Schedule 2 o f the Safety Certificate
provides:

  “The n u m b e r o f spectators ad m itte d to the Stadium and to the several areas o f spectator accom m odation
  within the S ta d iu m shall n ot exceed the figures specified in Part 1 o f Schedule 3”.

  The Club had to rely upon visual monitoring.

   135. T he situ atio n becam e worse however with the division o f the west terrace into pens. Not only were
there m ore a n d smaller discrete areas bu t some were likely to attract m ore th a n their a p prop riate share of the
 10,100 total. It is well recognised th a t the area behind the goal is very popular. Moreover, th e position of the
tunnel vis-a-vis th e turnstiles A to G, its labelling and the absence o f signposts advertising the wing pens would
draw to it those with terrace tickets. It was therefore highly likely that pens 3 and 4 would fill to capacity and
indeed exceed it unless preventive steps were taken. H a d D r Eastwood’s plan for separate turnstile access to
separate sections with separate toilet a n d refreshment facilities been im plem ented, total com puterised control
could have been kept.

                                 LACK OF FIXED CAPACITIES FOR THE PEN S

  136. In 1981, w hen the terrace was divided into three areas, D r Eastwood gave the Club the figur^ of 2,200
capacity for the centre pen. He based this on the G reen G uide, m aking such allowances as he thought right. No
dou bt the num b ers could have been counted in via th e turnstiles if only that pen was in use or if such pens as
were in use were filled sequentially, b ut not otherwise.

   137. After th e 1985 changes, D r Eastwood did not h im self give any figures for the new pens 3 and 4.
Som eone on his staff however split the figure 2,200 into 1,200 for pen 3 an d 1,000 for pen 4. Those figures did
not even take a c co un t o f the fact that pen 5 had been carved o u t o f pen 4 which was boun d to have a reducing
effect on capacity. Nevertheless, the figures o f 1,200 an d 1,000 were put on a drawing em anating from
Eastwood and P a rtn e rs and the figures have been notionally regarded since as applicable by the Clu:b and the
police. T hey are in fact too high.

  138. D r N icholson, at the Research and L aboratory Services Division o f the Health and Safety Executive,
has calculated th a t the figures for pens 3 and 4 respectively would be 1,015 an d 1,036 if the strength and
spacing o f the crush barriers had com plied with the Green G uide. But they did not.

Departures from the Green Guide
   139. In pen 3, fou r out o f five gaps in the lines o f crush barriers do not conform with paragraph 115 of the
G reen G u ide (198 6). In pen 4, nine ou t o f ten do n ot conform . In particular, the spans taken out of the barriers
in pen 3 in 1985 left gaps well in excess o f the m ax im u m o f 1.4 metres prescribed. One gap was 57% wider than
the Green G u id e m a x im u m . Moreover, that gap was in direct diagonal line from the m outh o f the tunnel to the
barrier which collapsed. D r Eastwood justified these larger gaps by the absence o f gangways. Fans had to be
able to get in a n d o ut an d standard gaps tended to get blocked up. T he effect o f his reasoning was that the
absence o f gangways, recognised as having a safety function, led to the sacrifice of a second safety feature,
namely gaps o f strictly limited width.

   140. Again, the removal o f barrier 144 was b ou nd , as D r Eastwood conceded, to affect capacity. In fact it
did more, as I shall indicate later.

   141. Capacity should also have taken account o f two fu rth er departures from the Green G uide. If, as was
the case, the p e rim e te r gates were n ot regarded as exits, som e 40% o f those in pens 3 and 4 were m ore than 12
metres from an exit (an d there was no gangway) contrary to the aim o f paragraph 96. Four out o f five of the
crush barriers in pen 3 an d six out o f nine in pen 4 were below the height prescribed in paragraph 110. These
were the old b arriers which had been repaired an d plated where their bases had corroded an d fresh concrete
had been applied, raising the level o f th e steps. T h e point is not academ ic since, in the event, m any fans were
bent painfully over barriers under great pressure.

   142. D r N icholson calculated th a t when all relevant factors regarding the configuration an d th e Green
G uide are taken into account, the m a x im u m capacity for pen 3 should have been 822 and for pen 4, 871.

Safety Certificate
   143. W hatever sh ou ld have been the m ax im u m capacities for pens 3 a n d 4, the fact is that no figures at all in
respect o f th e m were put into the Safety Certificate. D espite all th e changes in layout o f the fences an d barriers,
the two figures, 2,900 for the north-west terrace a n d 7,200 for the west terrace, have rem ained as the only
m axim a with w hich th e Club has to comply.

   144. Section 2(1) o f the Safety o f Sports G rounds Act 1975 provides (so far as is relevant):

   “A Safety Certificate shall contain such term s an d cond itio ns as the local authority consider necessary or
   expedient to secure reasonable safety at the stadium when it is in u s e . . . ”

   Section 2(2) provid ed (so far as is relevant):

   “W ithout p rejudice to sub-section (1) above, a Safety C ertificate-
   (a) shall specify th e m axim u m n u m b e r o f spectators to be a d m itted to the stadium ;
   (b) may specify the m ax im um n u m b e r to be a d m itted to different parts o f it;
   (c) shall include term s and c o n d itio n s-
   ... (iii) as to the number, strength and situation of any crush barriers.”


                                                              24

£      I
f   Section 2(2) was repealed by the Fire Safety and Safety o f Places o f Sport Act 1987, section 19, which
|   gave power to the Secretary o f State to lay down, by order, terms and conditions. No o rd e r has yet been
1   made and guidance from the H o m e Office has recommended local authorities to approach their
|   function u n d e r section 2(1) in accordance with the criteria in the repealed section 2(2). (See Home
|   Office C ircular 71/19i87 dated 25 Novem ber 1987, Annex A, paragraph 6.)    ,

        145. It is clear tlvat when the certificate was first issued the South Yojkshire C ounty Council went
     further th an s im p ly 'to fix the m axim um num bers for the whole Stadium, They prescribed figures for
'   each part o f the ground not merely by the four points o f the compass but by specified sections.

       146. Section 8(1) of the 1975 Act requires the holder o f the certificate before carrying out any
     proposals to alter or extend the stadium or any o f its installations while a Safety Certificate is in
     operation to give notice o f those proposals to the local authority. That obligation is specifically
     repeated in Sheffield W ednesday’s certificate at Schedule 2 Paragraph 5(2). T he Club complied with
i   the requirem ent. Having received notice of the alterations to the pens and the barriers, the local
1   authority ought, in my view, to have am ended the Safety Certificate accordingly. They did not do so.

    Why was the Safety Certificate not Amended?
        147. Although D r Eastwood acknowledged that the various changes to the layout would have had
     an effect on capacity, he did not take active steps to see that appropriate am e n d m e n ts were made. He
     says he m entioned from tim e to tim e that the alterations would have an effect on capacity and that he
!   did not realise the Safety Certificate was not regularly updated. However, I find two m em oranda in
     early 1987 highly significant. D r Eastwood’s assistant M r Strange was concerned with queries from
I   the FA as to Hillsborough’s capacity for a semi-final. M r Strange recorded these questions in a
I   m em orandum :-

       “Has any account been taken for alterations done on Leppings Lane over the last few seasons? Is the 10.200
       or so figure still correct? I said th a t i n my opinion it needs to be adjusted, better do it now than later.”

       148. M r Strange’s next m em o (a few days later) records as follows:-

       “D r Eastwood says leave the capacity at Leppings Lane end as it is, providing police have gates under West
       stand open so that people can distribute throughout the terrace evenly.”

     Although he says the last nine words do not report him accurately, D r Eastwood accepts the rest of that
     message.

        149. In my view the provisions as to capacity in the Safety Certificate ought to have been reviewed and
     altered. T h e u n happy situation is th a t the police believed even the overall figure o f 10,100 to be too high as far
     back as 1981. T h at was reported to the Club but apparently not to D r Eastwood. M eanwhile, th a t global figure
     had been rendered academic by the sub-division o f the terrace which was not reflected in the Safety Certificate
     at all. If proper m axim um figures h a d been inserted in the certificate for each o f the pens, the Club and the
     police might well have been p ro m p ted to find some m eans o f limiting the num bers entering those pens other
     than by visual monitoring. T his could have been done by implem enting one o f D r Eastwood’s plans for totally
     separate sections, turnstile to viewing area. It could have been done by insisting on sequential fillingof pens at
     all matches; alternatively, by counting fans into each viewing area.

     T he City Council
        150. T h a t the Safety Certificate was not am ended and individual capacities not reviewed cannot be laid
     solely at D r Eastwood’s door. H e was, after all, consultant engineer to the Club and responsibility for the
     certificate was that o f the local authority. When the South Yorkshire County Council h a n d e d over to the
     Sheffield City Council, the latter delegated all its powers and duties un d e r the 1975 Act to its General Purposes
     Panel. Apparently, therefore, the decision-making body on behalf o f the Council was th a t Panel, although two
     specific functions were delegated to the Head o f A dm inistration and Legal D epartm ent - the power to issue a
     prohibition u n d e r section 10 o f the 1975 Act and the power o f entry and search und e r section 11 of the Act.

        151. In practice, M r Bownes, the Council’s C h ie f Licensing Officer in the A dm inistration and Legal
     D ep artm en t, bore the brunt o f the Council’s duties un d e r the Act.



                                                                25
   152. T he Officer W orking Party was superseded by a Safety o f Sports G ro u n d s Advisory G roup, but
apart from the change o f the n am e the system continued as before. M r Bownes attended the inspections
and meetings o f the Advisory G ro u p together with the representatives o f the police, the fire service, the
dep artm ent o f health and consum er services, and the building engineer’s division o f the Council. The
latter was an engineer and ought therefore to have been alive to the same issues as D r Eastwood.

  153. T he A dvisory G roup seems to have worked in a very informal m anner. A short passage from Mr
Bownes’ evidence gives the flavour o f it:—

    “Q     W ho was taking the lead in the working party as you understood it?

      A    T h a t is a good question, sir. Leads were coming from several different directions really.

      Q    W ho chaired it, if anyone?

      A    N ob o d y as such, sir. It was an inspection rather than a m eeting as I u n d e rsta n d it.

      Q    W ho decided what should be inspected?

      A    Effectively the group itself, sir, it seem ed to me. T here was also some input from the Club
           representative as to, if you like, an element o f direction as to what should be looked at.

      Q    A p a rt from the inspections the working party met, presumably, o r did they only meet on
           inspections?

      A    No, sir, I have referred to three previous meetings.

      Q    W ho took the chair when it met?

      A    I suppose it could be said that I did, to some extent.

      Q    T here is no point in having inspections unless you form conclusions as a result o f that inspection, is
           there?

      A    T h a t is correct.

      Q     T here m u st presumably have been some m eeting following the inspection at which you all sat down
            together a n d decided what, if anything, should be done.

      A    T here was not, to my recollection, no.

      Q    How did you decide what should be done, if anything needed to be done?

      A    T here were discussions on the site, particularly in relation to barrie r 144, which took place at the
           time.

      Q    N o th in g m o re than that and no record anywhere o f any decisions th a t were made?

      A    No, sir.”

T h e decision to rem ove barrier 144 was assented to on behalf o f the City Council by M r Bownes. It was not
referred to the G eneral Purposes Panel. W hether M r Bownes strictly had any power to assent to it is to say the
least very doubtful. But he himself adm its that he was ill-equipped to do so. H e knew very little about football
grounds. H e h a d read the file passed on from South Yorkshire C ounty Council a n d assum ed all had been run
satisfactorily by them .

  154. It was recorded, however, in a report which M r Bownes drafted th a t “the conditions (in th e Safety
Certificate) givd som e cause for concern as they appear to be in a dequate or in a p p ro p ria te in som e areas”. The
report to the G eneral Purposes Panel suggested that new Safety Certificate conditio n s should be drafted.

   155. T he task o f revising the Safety Certificate was begun in Ju n e 1986. In July 1987, a draft was sent to the
fire service to which they replied in August. In Septem ber 1987, the Panel was in fo rm e d that the redrafting was


                                                            26
“progressing steadily” and should be submitted to the Panel in October. The final draft was not circulated until
30 March 1989, 16 days before this disaster.

   156. Meanwhile, the Safety Certificate has rem ained unam epded since 1979. The enlargem ent o f the Kop
in 1986 increased its capacity to 21,000. lAlthough this was known and agreed by the Council it had not been
the subject o f any change in the certificate which still showed the capacity o f the Kop as 16,850. Mr Mackrell,
Sheffield W ednesday’s Secretary, raised the question o f am endm ents to the Safety Certificate and in particular
with regard to the Kop in April 1987 with Eastwood and Partners but nothing resulted.

  157. Sheffield U nited Football Club was designated under the 1975 A c to n 3 July i 984. A Safety Certificate
was about to be issued by South Yorkshire County Council at the tim e it handed over to the Sheffield City
Council on 1 April 1986. N o certificate has yet been issued to Sheffield United.

   158. T h e explanation given for these delays was pressure o f work. M r Bownes as C h ie f Licensing Officer
was responsible for 32 other licensing systems when this one was added to his burden. H e had a staff o f only
five. I fully accept that the addition o f further statutory responsibilities to the already heavy workload o f a local
authority with curbs on its expenditure creates problems. But it is clear that the a ttention given to this
im portant licensing function was woefully inadequate.

Summary
   159. T h e Safety Certificate contained no m a x im u m figures for individual pens. T here was therefore no
sanction or provision focussing attention as to the need to limit entry to the pens by num bers. The layout at
Leppings Lane as it evolved m ade electronic or mechanical control over numbers entering individual pens
im practicable if all pens were to be available. Given an important match and a capacity attendance, fans were
likely to crowd into popular sections like pens 3 and 4. Those pens were likely to becom e overfull well before
warning cam e from the turnstiles that numbers were approaching the terrace m a x im u m o f 10,100. Control
over n um bers and the avoidance o f overcrowding therefore depended entirely on visual m onitoring o f the
crowd.

                        LACK O F E F F E C T IV E M O N IT O R IN G O F T H E T E R R A C E S

    160. M onitoring the spectators on the terraces so as to avoid overcrowding involves observing the numbers
an d their distribution in each area, milking decisions as to when an area is “full” , taking steps to close it off
a n d m oving spectators from one area tcj another, if necessary. It is a function beset by three problems. 1) Who
should carry it out? 2) W hen is an area “full”? 3) Fear o f hooliganism.

Who should Monitor the Terraces?
   161. Should it be the host club via its stewards? Should it be the police? Should it be both? O r should it be by
arrangem ent, depending upon the ground or section o f the ground in question?

   162. In principle, a football club w hich invites the public to a m atch on its prem ises for reward is
responsible for securing safety at that event. The Green Guide (1986) provides:

        “ 23. T he safety o f the public inside the ground is the responsibility o f those who stage the event and
              adm inister the ground in which it is held, ie the “m an a g e m e n t”. T his responsibility applies in
              b oth norm al and emergency situations...

         195. ...there are five basic duties which stewards are called upon to carry out. These are:

               (a)   controlling or directing members o f the public who are entering or leaving the ground, to
                     help achieve an even flow o f people to the viewing areas a n d safe dispersal o f spectators on
                     the terraces or viewing slopes;

               (b)   patrolling the ground to deal with any emergencies, eg raising alarm s or extinguishing
                     fires;

               (c)   m a n n in g entrances, exits and other strategic points, especially exit doors a n d gates which
                     are continuously open whilst the ground is in use;

               (d)   assisting police as appropriate or as requested with crowd control; a n d

               (e)   undertaking specific duties in an emergency.”

The Interim Popplewell Report
   163. T here was considerable controversy in the course o f the public inquiry held by M r Justice Popplewell
in 1985 as to the responsibility o f the club and the police. In paragraph 3.6 o f his interim report, M r Justice
Popplewell q u o ted from a report pro d u c e d for the M inister o f H ousing and Local G o v e rn m e n t in 1969 as
follows:-

  “T he responsibility for controlling crowd behaviour is divided between the police a n d th e club operating the
  ground. T he broad line o f division being that police are responsible for m ov e m e n t o f spectators in public
  thoroughfares and from public thoroughfares into the ground, while the club is responsible for the control o f
  spectators once they are on the club’s premises . . . ”

M r Justice Popplewell said he did not quarrel with that view and went on to observe th a t in practice the police
have to take charge and be responsible for controlling crowd behaviour. H e then said (paragraph 3.8):

  “It follows, therefore, th at as a m a tte r o f practice, while the physical safety o f the building an d the
  m a in te n a n c e and good housekeeping o f the ground must always be the responsibility o f the club, the police
  have to take the de fa c to responsibility o f organising the crowd, with all th a t entails, du rin g the game . . . ”

M r Justice Popplewell went on to instance evacuation o f the ground as a procedure in which only the police
could bear the responsibility o f supervising the organisation o f the crowd.

The Final Popplewell Report
  164. H e harked back to this subject in c h apter 4 o f his Final Report. There, he cam e down m ore firmly in
favour o f holding the club responsible for crowd safety. At paragraph 4.13 he said “Because, as a m a tte r o f


                                                           28
  practice, police officers have regularly attended in large numbers at football grounds, it has somehow been
  assum ed by th e clubs th at the responsibility for control o f what goes on inside the ground has passed from
  them to the police. A police presence is there to assist in the enforcement o f law and order. Those responsible
  for organising a private function, however, have the primary and continuing obligation a n d responsibility to
  ensure reasonable safety for those who are invited on to their premises.” M r Justice Popplewell ended that
  section as follows: “ It ca nnot be too strongly em phasised that it is upon the club, or the occupier o f the grbund
, who is pu ttin g on the function, th at the primary and continuing obligation rests.”                            |

I     165. T here remains, however, the question w hether there are some grounds or parts o f grounds where the
| club may need to rely upon the police (w hom they pay to attend) to control filling o f pens a n d m o nitoringthem
  for overcrowding. In other words, whilst the duty in law to ensure safety rests upon the club, they may need,
  an d by agreement be entitled, to employ the police to act as their agents in certain circumstances. This very
  difficult an d grey area as to club and police responsibility will need to be reviewed in greater depth at stage two
  o f this Inquiry.

. Arrangements at Hillsborough
      166. W h at is clear, however, is th at de fa cto the police at Hillsborough had accepted responsibility for
    control o f the pens at the Leppings Lane end. T he evidence o f the senior officers who had been concerned with
    policing at Hillsborough over the years was all one way on this point. Only M r Duckenfield, who had not
    policed a t Hillsborough for som e 10 years prior to 15 April, took a different view.

       167. M r Lock is now security officer at Sheffield Wednesday and was formerly a police Superintendent at
    Hillsborough m atches occupying M r M urray’s role. H e claimed there had been a formal although unwritten
    agreement between the Club a n d the police in a b o u t 1982, whereby the police agreed to steward the Leppings
    Lane end o f the ground. Such a formal agreement is denied by other senior officers and I do n o t accept that any
    formal agreem ent was reached. Nevertheless, a practice or arrangem ent d id develop w hich was known and
    accepted by both Club and police. Its effect was th a t throughout the ground the stewards were responsible for
    m an n in g exits and entrances, for controlling entry into the stands, for'assisting spectators to their seats in the
    stands an d for helping to c o n tro f th e exits after the match. They were also responsible at the Kop end on the
    terraces for keeping gangways clear and helping to control the crowd which usually consisted o f home
    supporters. At the Leppings L ane end, however, there were no gangways on the terraces and the crowd
    consisted usually (and always since 1987) o f away supporters. M r Mole and other senior officers accepted that
    it would have been unreal a n d unreasonable to expect stewards to go onto those Leppings L ane terraces. They
    would not have been effective there; moreover, they could well have been in some danger from hostile away
    supporters. T h e police accepted, therefore, th a t the proper filling o f the pens and m onitoring them for
    overcrowding could and would not be carried o u t by stewards. M any stewards have te n d e d to be either
    extremely young or som ew hat elderly. They are p aid only a modest sum (£9 at Hillsborough) and they are not
    suitable either by physique or by training to cope on a crowded terrace with no gangways.

    Case for the South Yorkshire Police
      168. N o tw ithstanding the overwhelming evidence from senior police as already m e n tio n e d and from the
    Club, Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police c o ntinued throughout the hearing to contend th a t the Club and
    not the police were responsible for filling and m onitoring the pens a n d th a t this was well known to both parties.
    He m a in ta in e d th a t the police were there essentially to secure and preserve law and order. Q u ite apart from the
    police evidence to the contrary at this Inquiry, the official stance o f the South Yorkshire Police has not always
    been to that effect.

    Harris -v- Sheffield United Football Club Limited
       169. In M arch 1986, the South Yorkshire Police Authority obtained a judgem ent against Sheffield United
    Football Club for money due for police services provided at Sheffield U n ite d ’s matches. T h e defence had been,
    inter alia, that the police were not providing “special police services” . They were doing no more than
    perform ing their norm al police duties o f securing and preserving law and order amongst a crowd. The police
    argum ent was that they had additio n al duties. In his judgement, Boreham J sum m arised the instructions for
    policing as providing for:-

     “(a) the m ain tenance o f enforcem ent o f law and order;

      (b) the enforcement o f the C lub’s ground regulations, many o f which are concerned with law and order;

      (c) the safety and comfort o f the spectators, officials and players.”


                                                               29
He referred to the argument o f Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police as follows:-

  “Thirdly, here the police were not discharging their own duty to the public; they were in fact discharging the
  Club’s duties to the spectators w hom the Club invited to the ground. T he Club chose to invite large numbers
  to their private premises; it was the C lu b ’s duty to provide for their safety, health and comfort. They could
  have employed a security firm as banks and others have to do to protect their interests; they chose to request
  the police to perform those duties knowing that the police expe'cte|i payment. Fourthly, the police within the
  ground provided services which it was not within the scope off tlieir public duty to perform. For instance,
  they assisted in crowd managem ent a n d in the enforcement o f such ground regulations as refused entry to
  those who tried to enter without paying or prohibited spectators encroaching on parts o f the ground which
  their entry fee did not entitle them to enter. It may be, s u b m its M r Bentley, that the m aintenance o f law and
  order was the predom inant aim but there were other services performed.”

T h e learned Judge found:-

  “In addition to what m ay be called th e ir law and order role the police were expected and did take part in
  crowd m anagement, ensuring the safety o f spectators, the enforcement o f the C lub’s regulations and to be on
  hand to assist in the event o f some emergencies such as fire or accidental injury.”

Police Practice at the Leppings Lane End
   170. At League m atches at Hillsborough, the police practice was to decide in advance how many an d which
pens would be used. If a m odest crowd was anticipated only one or two pens might be needed. It was better to
confine the fans to limited spaces (a) to prevent them running about and (b) to reduce the num b er o f police
required. The practice was then to fill the pens one by one. This involved making a judgem ent as to when a pen
was full. There would then be a police decision to close that pen and fill another. It was regarded as impractical
and unsafe for police officers Gust like stewards) to go onto the Leppings Lane terraces with away supporters.
This m eant that m onitoring the nu m bers in any pen had to be done from vantage points outside it. H ere, the
police were much better placed than the stewards. There was a good view from the control box an d the
television screens there. There were officers on the perimeter track. No stewards were placed there because
having both police and stewards interfered with the viewing. There were also police in the west stand who
could look down on4he pens. Intelligence from all these sources could give the police a good appreciation o f
the state o f the terraces. W hen it was necessary to shut off access to the pens officers on the concourse could be
informed by radio and could take the necessary steps.

“Find Their Own Level”
   171. At Cup semi-finals, a different approach was adopted. All the pens were opened from the start an d the
policy was “ to let the fans find their own level” . This phrase was repeated again and again by police officers at
the Inquiry. W hat it m eant was that no specific direction was given to fans entering through the turnstiles.
They were free to go wherever they wished on the terraces. I f they became uncomfortable or wished for any
other reason to move their position, then theoretically they could move elsewhere. In this way it was hoped that
the fans on the terraces would level themselves out and that distribution would be achieved w ithout police
intervention. O n these occasions, the gates at the top o f the radial fences were locked in the open position. It
was sought to argue, therefore, that there was freedom o f m ovement from one pen to another enabling fans to
“find their level”.

   172. This argument was bad both in theory and in practice. In theory, the whole object o f the radial fences
had been to achieve even distribution by directing fans into desired positions. To say then that they could move
freely from one pen to another would defeat the object and enable fans to go from a less popular to a more
popular area without inhibition. In practice this did not happen because the position and size o f the gates was
such that once a substantial num ber o f spectators were in, the gates were unnoticeable and inaccessible
especially to those towards the front who might have most need o f them.

  173. T he same argum ent was deployed to suggest that individual m axim um capacities for individual pens
need not be assessed since the presence o f the open radial gates still m eant that the terrace was one area. In
practice this simply was not so. T he photograph at Appendix 5 taken from the north stand at 2.59 pm shows
very clearly the congestion in pens 3 and 4 contrasted with the sparseness in pen 6. This gives the lie to the
suggestion that the fans could, if uncom fortable, “find their own level”.

  174. T he effect o f this policy was that whereas at League matches the police had to make a positive decision
when to close one pen and open another, at semi-finals, where overcrowding was much m ore likely, the police


                                                         30
left it to the fans themselves to “ find their own level” . Effectively, they were left to m onitor their own comfort
and safety so as to avoid overcrowding. The police would only intervene when there was some overt sign that an
area was “full” .

When is an Area “Full”?
   175. Over the years, spectators on terraces have come to accept conditions which are often very
uncom fortable and not infrequently downright dangerous. They are subjected to buffeting and squeezing to
get in and out o f the terraces. They are packed tightly and exposed to surging and swaying during the match.
They put up with these conditions because they are devoted to the game and because there is little they can do
about them . They believe the discom fort will pass and nothing very untoward will happen. Usually that is the
case and they are reassured by it. M ost clubs have not, until very recently, consulted their supporters as to their
grievances or suggestions. The practice has been to pack them in on the assum ption that if they are prepared to
put up with it the conditions must be tolerable. Although crowd figures at football grounds have been reduced
in recent years, this has been due principally to the increased p ro p o rtio n o f seating as against standing
accom m odation. Terraces have still been packed.

   176. It is said that m any fans enjoy these features of terrace viewing. Clearly close proximity, shared
discomfort, weathering sways a n d surges together and chantingthe sam e songs and slogans en m asse do evoke
good h u m o u r and have produced a spirit or cult o f the terraces which m any enjoy. Equally there are many who
simply endure these things for the football, for a cheap ticket or indeed for the chance o f getting in at all. And
before Hillsborough m ost fans on the terraces, even if they enjoy the hurly-burly, had not realised the narrow
margin o f safety between an uncom fortable crush and a fatal one.

   177. T h e Green G u id e sought to improve safety and comfort by laying down criteria for m axim um
capacity, ie defining what is “full” . The standard set was 54 persons per 10 square metres in favourable
conditions but fewer, down to 27, in less favourable conditions. The tendency may have been to aim off too
little from the higher figure for shortcomings in the layout. Certainly the figures considered appropriate in
pens 3 an d 4 at Hillsborough were too high, as already indicated.

   178. Even taking the highe's\ figure suggested in the Green G uide, the problem rem ained that those
supposed to be m onitoring pens visually had and have little idea o f what 54 persons per 10 square metres look
like. M r D uckenfield’s opinion was that when a pen was full to capacity, the spectators would be “shoulder to
shoulder an d chest to back” . T h a t view may derive from seeing the sort o f density crowds regularly endure
w ithout injury resulting. But it is m uch more dense than the Green G u id e m axim um .

    179. T h e South Yorkshire Fire Brigade provided the Inquiry with photographs o f people standing in an area
o f 10 square metres at various densities o f packing. Together with my Assessors and others, I took part in a
similar experim ent at the Health a n d Safety Executive’s Sheffield laboratory. We stood in a room o f measured
area at densities o f 54, 80 and 100 per 10 square metres. It was clear from the photographs and from our
experim ent th a t the m a x im u m density set out in the Green G uide left considerably m ore room than those
m onitoring the terraces would have left before declaring an area “full” .

   180. T he tendency has been to allow the pens to fill until the fans com plain or show signs o f discomfort. If
the density at the front appeared less than at the back, the Tannoy would invite the fans to move forward to
make room for more. T h e evidence before the Inquiry and many anecdotal letters I have received clearly show
there have been frequent occasions when the packing on terraces, not only at Hillsborough, has caused
discom fort and som etim es, for b rie f periods, fear. Usually the surge recedes, the sway returns, the pressure
eases and the incident passes unrecorded.

  181. After the crushing at the 1981 semi-final, Hillsborough was not chosen again by the FA until 1987.
There was evidence th at the central pens were uncomfortably overcrowded on that occasion and again at the
1988 C up semi-final, although entry to the tunnel was blocked off by police shortly before kick-off in 1988
because th e pens were deem ed to be “ full”.

Fear of Hooliganism
   182. Over the last few years, hooliganism at and associated with football matches has strongly influenced
the strategy o f the police. In their plans and m anagem ent they have concentrated on averting or containing
threats to public order. This is understandable and indeed com m endable. But it has led to an imbalance
between the need to quell a m inority o f troublem akers and the need to secure the safety a n d comfort o f the
majority. In the police O perational Order, the em phasis was upon prevention o f disorder and in particular
prevention o f access to the field o f play. There was no express requirem ent that officers on the perim eter track


                                                         31
or in the west stand should keep watch for any possible overcrowding on the terraces. Indeed, the view was
expressed in evidence that packing fans close together on the terraces assisted in controlling the unruly since
the less room they h a d the less scope there was for misbehaviour.

Sum m ary
   183. Although the police had accepted de facto responsibility for m onitoring the pens, their policy on the
day was to leave fans to “find their own level” and to concentrate their own attention on possible disorder.
W hilst in theory, the police would intervene if a pen becam e “ full”, in practice they perm itted the test of
fullness to be w hat the fans would tolerate.

  184. By 2.52 pm when gate C was opened, pens 3 and 4 were over-full even by this test. Many were
uncom fortable. To allow any more into those pens was likely to cause injuries; to allow in a large stream was
courting disaster.

                                   T H E BUILD-UP AT TH E TURNSTILES

   185. T he decision to open gate C, and subsequently gates A and B too, was forced on to the police by the
crowd c o nditions which developed outside the turnstiles. The crush was so severe that injuries were being
suffered an d dqaths were feared unjless the pressure could be swiftly relieved. Why the crowd pressure had built
to such intensity was one o f the principal issues during the hearing. The suggested causes must be considered in
turn.                                '

The Physical Layout
   186. I have already described and illustrated the approach to the turnstiles (Appendices 1 and 2). At
Penistone R oad and at m any other grounds, turnstiles are in a straight line, adequately spaced and with a
sufficient waiting area for queues to form. Not so at Leppings Lane. The building line, the bridge over the Don
and th e b end in the road, left a wedge-shaped approach to perimeter gates set in an arc, and across a short
forecourt, to turnstiles also set in an arc. The pairs o f turnstiles were close together and the forecourt, especially
as divided by the metal fence, provided little space for a waiting crowd.

The Number of Turnstiles
   187. T he decision to fill the whole o f the north stand from the Leppings Lane end required the 23 turnstiles
there to a d m it 24,256 spectators. O f those, the seven turnstiles (A to G) serving the terraces had to adm it
 10,100, ie an average o f just und e r 1,450 through each turnstile. At the Penistone Road end, 29,800 were
served by 60 turnstiles, or ju s t und e r 500 per turnstile.

   188. T h e Green G uide recognises (paragraph 47) that the rate at which spectators can pass through
turnstiles dep en ds on a variety o f local circumstances but states “in general based on observation and
experience, it is unlikely th a t the m axim um notional rate per turnstile would exceed 750 per hour”. Since the
semi-final was an all ticket m atch requiring no cash transactions, the Club considered th a t a higher rate of
about 1,000 per hour per turnstile Could be expected. Even at this higher rate, which assum es the turnstiles
working at m a x im u m efficiency non-stop, it would have taken nearly 1'h hours to ad m it all those with terrace
tickets. At 750 per hour, it would have taken nearly two hours.

  189. T he G reen G uide provides (paragraph 44):-

  “Turnstiles should be o f such num bers as to a d m it spectators at a rate whereby no unduly large crowds are
  kept waiting for admission ..

   190. T h e Officer Working Party had discussed in 1985 the need, and D r Eastwood’s various schemes, for
im provem ent o f the turnstile arrangements. T he m athem atics are elementary. Both the police and the Club
should have realised that the Leppings Lane turnstiles and the waiting area outside th e m would be under strain
to adm it all the Liverpool supporters in time. Success depended on the spectators arriving at a steady rate from
an early h o u r and upon the m axim um turnstile rate being maintained. In fact neither o f these requirements,
which are inter-linked, was fulfilled. T h at they m ight not be so was in my view foreseeable.

The “Late” arrival of Liverpool Fans
  191. Between 2.30 pm and 2.40 p m the crowd waiting for the turnstiles swelled to over 5,000 and became
unm anageable. The case m ade for the police was th a t large num bers o f Liverpool supporters arrived late; a
high p ro p o rtio n o f them were d runk and unco-operative; a high proportion had no tickets; all o f them were
hell-bent on getting in on time. They say this was unforeseeable a n d explains why they lost control.

    192. W h e th e r those who arrived between 2.30 pm and 2.40 p m were “late” was m uch debated. The ticket
simply requested its holder “to take up [his] position 15 m inutes before kick-off’. T h a t may have been
in tended to persuade those with stand tickets to take their seats, but it would not be unreasonable for a
standing spectator to arrive at the turnstiles between 2.30 pm and 2.40 pm. W hether they were “late” or not,
however, th ere was certainly a large concentration o f Liverpool fans arriving at about 2.30 p m and after.

Traffic Delays
  193. It is unlikely that traffic conditions had any significant effect on this. True, there were delays on the
Liverpool traffic routes. There were roadworks on the M62 which was the recom m ended route. At various
points the carriageway was reduced from four lanes or three lanes to two, but no serious delays were reported.


                                                          33
O n the M63 there were longer delays due to a contraflow and at its ju n c tio n with the A560 there was heavy
congestion due to volum e o f traffic. However, the Liverpool routes were clear by 2.20 pm and those witnesses
who complained o f delays en route had nevertheless managed to be in range o f the ground in ample time.

Fine Weather and D rinking
   194. T he likeliest explanations for the sparse Liverpool atte n d a n c e in the ground before 2.30 pm were four­
fold - the warm weather, drinking, disinclination to enter the ground early and prolong the standing, and a
tendency o f Liverpool supporters to cut it fine.

   195. The police em phasised that at the 1988 semi-final there was no com parable build-up o f “late” arrivals.
T hey claim, therefore, th at they had no reason to foresee it in 1989. However, in 1988, although the weather
was fine, it was 11 °F cooler than in 1989. 15 April was the sort o f fine spring day which tem pted fans to sit or
stand about in the sun w ith a drink. If you had a ticket it would seem m ore pleasant a n d sensible to relax in that
way than to enter the ground early and stand on the terrace for an extra hour. Pre-match entertainm ent in the
ground had been advertised but did not take place. Even if it had, it may not have been an encouragem ent to
m any fans to enter so early.

Was Drunkenness a M a jo r Factor in the Crisis at the Turnstiles?
    196. O f those who arrived at 2.30 pm or after, very m any had been drinking at public houses or had
brought drink from h o m e or an off-licence. I am satisfied on the evidence, however, that the great majority
were not drunk nor even the worse for drink. The police witnesses varied on this. Some described a high
p roportion as drunk, as “ lager-louts” or even as “anim als”. O thers described a generally normal crowd with an
unco-operative m inority who had d runk too much. In my view som e officers, seeking to rationalise their loss
o f control, overestimated the drunken elem ent in the crowd. T here certainly was such an element. There were
youngsters influenced by drink and bravado pushing im patiently at the rear o f the crowd thereby exacerbating
the crush. But the m ore convincing police witnesses, including especially Detective Superintendent McKay
an d Chief Inspector C reaser as well as a n u m b e r of responsible civilian witnesses, were in my view right in
describing this elem ent as a minority. Those witnesses attributed th e crush to the sheer num bers of fans all
anxious to gain entry. T here was no criticism o f the crowd by any o f the witnesses in the period up to 2.30 pm
or even 2.35 pm. W hat happened then was not a sudden deterio ra tio n in the m ood or sobriety of those
assembled there. N o d o u b t those coming behind would have had m o re to drin k and would have included the
unruly minority. But the crisis developed because this very large crowd becam e packed into a confined
turnstile area and its very density ham pered its passage through the turnstiles.

   197. Superintendent M arshall and other officers criticised the crowd as unco-operative because police
exhortations to stop pushing a n d to ease back were not heeded. How could they be? In that crush most people
h ad no control over th eir m ovem ents at all. Two incidents involving police horses illustrate the point. One
horse was found afterw ards to have cigarette burns on its rum p. Clearly th a t was the despicable work o f a
hooligan w hether in d rink or not. However, there were also eyewitness accounts o f a horse being physically
lifted off its feet by the crowd. T h a t occurred, as the police accepted, w ithout malice or intent but as an
involuntary consequence o f crowd pressure which those by the horse’s flanks could not resist any m ore than the
horse itself.

Reduced Efficiency of the Turnstiles
   198. T he labelling o f the turnstiles in the order A, C, B was confusing. A fan w ith a B-ticket who went by
m istake to the w rong side o f the metal fence would have had the greatest difficulty in getting back and round to
the correct side. T he colour coding was inefficient because the coloured wooden panels were affixed to the
turnstile walls so low th at they were not easily visible through a crowd. T he inform ation on the ticket printed by
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club was misleading and its layout unhelpful, as M r Mackrell frankly conceded.

   199. T he result was th a t in the early stages, police officers were pestered by fans for help as to where they
should go. Later, as the crowd becam e m ore dense, fans were presenting their tickets at the wrong turnstiles.
T here were also Liverpool supporters who had acquired tickets for the Kop end but sought entry at Leppings
Lane. They caused delays in the turnstile operation when entry was refused and after a while the police
instructed the operators to let them through. T here was further delay because the crush m ade it difficult for
fans to get into the turnstile entrances. Once there, the pressure from behind was such as, on occasions, to jam
them in the doorway or against the paddle o f the turnstile. Finally, there were fans w ithout tickets who sought
to enter by offering paym ent, by seeking to go over or under the paddle or by sliding through with a ticket
holder. All o f these activities slowed down the turnstile rate which at the worst period was only about 600 per
h o u r per turnstile. T he waiting crowd therefore expanded and as the m inutes passed frustration grew. Visitors


                                                          34
who had paid for tickets and travelled from afar realised they were making little forward progress. Frustration
increased pressure and induced panic at the front. D eterm ination to get into the match was intensified by
d e term in atio n to get out o f the crush.

Were Fans W ithout Tickets a M ajo r Factdr in the Build-Up?
  200. It has become a fact o f football li 'e that fans do turn up at all-ticket matches w ithout tickets. It is not
possible to give an accurate figure or even a reliable estimate of the n u m b e r w ithout tickets on 15 April. Police
estimates varied from about 200 to about'2,000. T here were certainly frequent requests for tickets or “spares”
during the hours before the build-up. Many of those warned off by the police were seen to return to the area.
Some were hanging about on the bridge. Again, however, the police witnesses who most im pressed me did not
consider the n u m b e r o f ticketless fans to be inordinately large. T his accords with two oth e r sources o f
evidence.

   201. First, there was a wide range o f witnesses who observed inside the ground that the Liverpool end was at
a late stage well below capacity save for pens 3 and 4. The north stand still had m any em pty seats and the wing
pens were sparse. The match being a sell-out, there were clearly m any ticket holders to com e and they could
account for the large crowd still outside the turnstiles. Had the Liverpool a c c om m odation been full by 2.40
pm, one could have inferred that m ost or much o f the large crowd outside lacked tickets.

   202. Secondly, such figures as are available from the Club’s electronic m onitoring system and from analyses
by the HSE suggest that no great n u m b e r entered w ithout tickets. They show that the n u m b e r who passed
through turnstiles A to G plus those who entered through gate C roughly equalled the terrace capacity figure o f
 10,100 for which tickets had been sold. The C lub’s record showed 7,038 passed through turnstiles A to G.
However, the counting m echanism on turnstile G was defective, so the HSE did a study using the video film
and projecting figures from the oth e r turnstiles. This gave an assessment o f 7,494, with a m axim um o f 7.644
passing through A to G. Again, using the video, the HSE assessed the n u m b e r who entered the ground whilst
gate C was open at 2,240 with a m axim um o f 2,480. Accordingly, the H SE ’s best estim ate o f the total entering
through gate C and turnstiles A to G was 9,734 with a m axim um o f 10 S1 2 4 .1 recognise th a t these can only be
rough checks because, for example, some with terrace tickets were allowed through turnstiles 1 to 16 and there
would be oth er sim ilar factors which have not form ed part o f the assessment. Nevertheless, the figures do
suggest th a t there was not a very significant body o f ticketless fans in the crowd which built up.

The “Conspiracy” Theory
  203. On b eh alf o f South Yorkshire police, the theory was advanced that the “late” arrival o f so many
Liverpool supporters was planned to buck the system. The suggestion was that fans w ithout tickets conspired
to arrive late an d create such trouble as would force the police to a d m it them to the match. The slender
evidence upon which this theory rested came from two sources: overheard conversations in public houses and
the antecedent history o f Liverpool supporters at away matches.

  204. O ne witness said he heard three Liverpool supporters saying, in effect, th a t they would manage to get
in w ithout tickets by causing trouble so that police would open a gate, and th a t they had done this before.
A nother witness heard two o f a group o f Liverpool supporters say they had no tickets, th a t they would go to the
ground ju s t before kick-off, that no-one would stop them getting in and that they had not been stopped yet.
Statem ents were put in relating to two other small groups talking in sim ilar terms.

Liverpool Supporters at Away Matches
   205. T h e South Yorkshire police prepared a dossier o f reports on the behaviour o f Liverpool fans at away
matches with th e object o f showing a pattern o f troublesome behaviour by large num bers either without tickets
or with forged tickets. W ithout setting out the whole history, it can be sum m arised as follows.

  206. O n three occasions Liverpool fans without tickets were allowed into all-ticket m atches upon payment.
(At W atford on 13 February 1988, 1,500 were adm itted; at Southam pton on 24 S eptem ber 1988, 150 were
adm itted; at S o u th am p to n again on 12 December 1988, 750 were adm itted.) At Norwich on 1 April 1989,
Liverpool supporters arrived w ithout tickets but 1,272 tickets had been returned and fans from both Liverpool
and Norwich were allowed to buy them for cash. A sim ilar situation occurred at W im bledon on 13 May 1989.
There were six other occasions from 1986 to date, including the Cup finals o f 1986 and 1989, w hen numbers of
Liverpool supporters turned up w ithout tickets or otherwise behaved badly.

  207. Four points must be noted, however. On none o f the occasions when ticketless fans were admitted for
paym ent was the m atch a sell-out. T here was therefore room in the ground on each occasion. At a sell-out fans


                                                          35
might not expect to be allowed in, even for payment. Secondly, no trouble o f the kind alleged was encountered
at the 1988 semi-final w hen Liverpool visited Hillsborough. Thirdly, Liverpool visited Hillsborough again in
J a n u ary 1989 w ithout any trouble. Finally, no forged tickets were in use on 15 April apart from three crude
photocopies.

No Conspiracy
   208. I have already found that there was not an abnormally large num ber o f fans w ithout tickets on this
occasion. With one or two exceptions, the police witnesses themselves did not subscribe to the “conspiracy"
theory. I am satisfied th a t the large concentration at Leppings Lane from 2.30 pm to 2.50 pm did not arrive
as a result o f any concerted plan. There were, I accept, small groups w ithout tickets w ho were willing to exploit
any adventitious chance o f getting into the ground. They, together with the minority who had d runk too much,
certainly aggravated the problem faced by the police. But th a t m ain problem was sim ply one o f large numbers
packed into the small area outside the turnstiles.

The Police Operation at Leppings Lane
  209. T he Operational O rder for 15 April followed closely th a t laid down for the 1988 semi-final. The
em phasis was on m aintaining law and order. Side roads were to be blocked off to prevent damage in residential
areas. Pairs o f officers were to patrol streets to prevent “ clash o f rival supporters” . Officers were to watch public
houses, shops and superm arkets “where looting could take place”. O utside the turnstiles, officers were to ensure
supporters entering did not have banners, weapons, missiles or alcohol.

   210. Unfortunately, hooligan behaviour has m ade all these steps necessary. But the only written provision
aim ed at effecting controlled entry to the turnstiles was one enjoining officers “to ensure orderly queues are
fo rm e d ”. There was no provision for controlling the entry o f the crowd into the turnstile area.

  211. As long ago as 1924, the D epartm ental Com m ittee on Crowds stated:-

  “T h e control o f crowds should begin at a point some considerable distance from the entrance to the ground.
  T h e advantages o f an arrangem ent o f this kind a r e ... in preventing congestion at the entrances to grounds.”

This was particularly im p o rtan t at Leppings Lane where the turnstile area was so small and awkwardly laid
out. I f a large crowd was perm itted uncontrolled entry through the perimetergates, the forming o f queues at the
turnstiles and control by officers, w hether on foot or mounted, would become impracticable. Those waiting at
the turnstiles would becom e a single growing mass. Once that happened, it would be difficult to retrieve the
situation.

  212. W hether steps were taken and w hat steps to avoid this happening was left to oral briefing and ad hoc
instructions on the day.

Previous Experience
  213. T he senior police officers said it had never happened before so there was no reason to foresee it. In fact,
the only two previous occasions when the Leppings Lane terraces had been used to fill the whole o f the north
and west sides o f the ground were at the two semi-finals, in 1987and 1988.In 1987, the m atch was on a Sunday,
scheduled for 12 noon, and kick-off was postponed for a quarter o f an hour because o f late arrivals.

Policing in 1988
  214. As to 1988, there was a very large and consistent body o f evidence that, on the day, the police in
Leppings Lane conducted an efficient filtering exercise designed to keep away those w ithout tickets and
control the flow o f fans towards the ground. I do not believe that so m any witnesses w ithout either opportunity
or reason to put their heads together could be mistaken about what they experienced on that occasion. Yet, the
police m aintain th a t no filtering exercise other than on a random basis was conducted in 1988 and that their
policy and practice then were no different from those o f 1989.

  215. T he answer to this conflict m ust, I think, be that whilst the policy may have been no different, in
practice the policing in 1988 was m ore efficient and was not put to the same test and strain as a year later. There
was not so large a swell in num bers approaching the ground from 2.30 pm to 2.50 pm as in 1989.
Nevertheless, there had been warning signs in 1988. Detective Superintendent M cKay gave the following
evidence:



                                                           36
 “Q Were you aware o f a build-up o f numbers last year towards the latter stages at the turnstiles?

 A    Yes. . . There was a huge build-up around 10 minutes to 3 when many, many Liverpool supporters
      came at that time. They had been drinking, the ones that I saw and there was quite a sizeable crush
      built-up - sizeable queue.
                      |
  Q   Q ueue or crusli?

  A    C om pacted queue, built-up in the area by the turnstiles which I believe are marked A to G. T hat crowd
       reached back almost to the gates. It never got any bigger than th a t and the turnstiles operated relatively
       freely an d they dealt with th a t crowd. Fans were still arriving at about 10 past 3 bu t by then t h e . . .

  Q   This crowd that you have described o f the late arrivals at about 10 to - was it an orderly crowd?

  A   Oh no. No. T he orderly crowd had gone in, and when I say they were not an orderly crowd, obviously
      mixed amongst those people w e r e . . .

  Q   O f course, but taking it generally?

  A    But by and large they had taken a lot o f drink on board and they were in such num bers that excluding
       th em from the ground was completely out o f the question.

  Q    Were they standing in an orderly queue or was there some pushing and shoving?

  A    There was a lot o f pushing and shoving. There was an urgency to get into the ground.

  Q    But fortunately it does not appear to have been in nearly such num bers as this year.

  A   It wasn’t.”

Police Intelligence in Advance
  216. Apart from that experience in 1988, the tendency          o f Liverpool supporters to arrive late was not
unknown. Witnesses said that they get through the turnstiles     at their hom e ground, Anfield, quite quickly and
tend therefore not to arrive early. Indeed, a general recent     tendency to postpone arrival was noted by the
Sheffield City Council Advisory G roup, with police present,     on 23 M arch 1988. The m in u te reads:-

  “As far as the turnstile question was concerned, a pattern has developed o f people arriving some 15 minutes
  before the start o f the gam e hoping to gain admission. This trend m ay be due to the ban n in g o f alcohol at
  sports grounds which could lead to people going elsewhere for refreshment prior to the football match. As
  the available turnstiles operated quite effectively for the majority o f the time, and that the late arrival
  problem could perhaps only be dealt with by^education o f the spectators” (sic).

  217. In so far as Liverpool supporters’ behaviour at away matches may have been indicative o f what police
problems m ight arise on 15 April, most o f the facts should have been available at the planning stage. As in other
forces, South Yorkshire Police h ad a liaison officer whose job was to seek, receive and collate relevant
information as to the visiting supporters. The Association o f C hief Police Officers’ G uide to Policing Football
highlights the im portance o f such liaison:-

  “It is im p o rtan t that the officer responsible for policing the m atch determ ines the pre-m atch planning in the
  light o f the intelligence at hand. W hilst that intelligence can be obtained from a variety o f sources, the prime
  source for football intelligence is the Police N ational Intelligence System which is based on the network o f
  police liaison officers. S um m arie s completed by police officers o f the hom e club force are forwarded to the
  visiting club’s liaison officer making available intelligence about fans’ behaviour at b o th hom e and away
  fixtures. This inform ation will be collated and m ade available for future matches involving that club” .

  218. T h e FA had also laid down in a m em orandum issued in the 198 5/6 season measures to be adopted by
the away club which included the following:-

  “ It is the responsibility o f the away club to advise the hom e club o f the recent behaviour o f their supporters
  at away matches, irrespective o f w hether the behaviour has resulted in disciplinary action by the Football
  Association or not” .

  219. It does not seem that information o f this kind was passed to the Sheffield W ednesday Club or played


                                                         37
any part in the South Yorkshire Police plans. H ad the latter been informed o f the history contained in the
dossier and sum m arised above it may well have influenced police strategy in Leppings Lane.

  220. There is presently a proposal that a national computer-based police football intelligence system should
be set up to make the necessary information readily available.

Police Intelligence on the Day                                               I
   221. The unfilled space in the Liverpool areas inside the ground, the figures for entry available from the
C lu b ’s com puter and observations on the video screen should have enabled those in the control room to
m o n ito r the numbers arriving and still to arrive at Leppings Lane. Radio contact with mobile (Tango) patrols
detailed to m onitor licensed premises in the district could have indicated the num bers still to come. But at 2.30
pm when Mr M urray told M r Duckenfield they would “get them all in by 3 o ’clock” he seems not to have
appreciated that in addition to those visible at the turnstiles there were m any m ore still to come. Certainly, Mr
Marshall outside the turnstiles was not told and could not otherwise have known that there were still m any
Liverpool ticket holders to arrive.                                        :

M r M arshall and M r Greenwood
  222. The division of co m m a n d between these two officers did not help. Mr Marshall was in charge o f the
serials outside the perim eter gates in the Leppings Lane area and in the roads beyond. In practice lie operated
inside and just outside the turnstile area. M r Greenw ood’s area as G ro u n d C o m m a n d e r extended from the
pitch to the perim eter gates. He in fact stationed himself near the players’ tunnel. He was wholly unaware o f the
growing problems at the turnstiles and was in no position to exercise control over his officers who were under
pressure there. No-one in the control room thought to tell him.

Control Lost
   223. In the result, the large concentration o f arrivals from 2.30 pm to 2.40 pm pressed unrestrain ed into
the turnstile area through the perim eter gates which were fully open. W hen that area was full, later arrivals
swelled the crowd out to the forecourt and even into the road. As already recounted, the foot officers at the
turnstiles became trapped and endangered and retired through the turnstiles. The m ounted officers could not
operate amidst such a dense crowd in a confined space. They came out o f the turnstile area. There were then
the belated attem pts to close the perimeter gates and prevent more fans joining the mass until it had a chance to
d im inish through the turnstiles; still later the attem pt to put a cordon o f horses across the entrance.

   224. Despite knowledge o f the difficult layout, the very large num b e r o f fans to be got through so few
turnstiles and the tendency o f fans to arrive in the last h alf hour, no contingency plans were m ade to avoid a
crush such as occurred. Even on the day, the need to close Leppings Lane to traffic before 2.30 pm and the
o th e r available intelligence already sum m arised, should have p rom pted those in c o m m a n d to take precautions
against such a crush. If som e o f the perim eter gates had been closed and cordons o f m ounted and foot officers
had been placed a little distance from those gates, the flow o f fans into the turnstile area could have been
controlled before that area becam e engulfed. It was the crush itself which produced the frustration and the
panic and brought out the worst in those who had drunk too much. Earlier control o f entry would have
prevented the crush and m a intained the good m ood which had prevailed until 2.30 pm.

  225. It should moreover have been obvious by 2.40 pm. if not earlier, that a large part o f the crowd could
not be adm itted until well after 3 pm. Had a decision to postpone kick-off been m ade and a n nounced m uch o f
the frustration and with it the impetus crushing the crowd would have been reduced. A com binatio n o f
controlled filtering and a postponed kick-off would probably have obviated the need to open the gates.

Postponement of Kick-off
    226. At various stages in his evidence, M r Duckenfield gave three accounts o f why he thought it too late to
postpone kick-off. Once it was that one o f the teams had already come onto the pitch. Then it was that a group
o f photographers at the tunnel had wrongly led him to think that the teams were com ing out. Finally, he did not
know why he thought the team s were coming out. They did not in fact come onto the pitch until 2.54 pm, two
m inutes after gate C was opened. Police Constable Buxton had asked for a p ostponem ent o f kick-off before
gate C was opened. It should not, however, have needed a police Constable in the thick o f the crowd (and there
were others o f like mind) to th in k o f postponing the kick-off. T he need should have been clear in the control
room.

  227. The truth was that M r Duckenfield applied inflexibly the policy he had discussed with Mr Murray.
Kick-off would not be postponed unless there were some m ajor cause for delayed arrivals eg a ja m on the


                                                          38
motorway or fog. I accept that the thinking behind this policy was not callous or punitive. If kick-off is
postponed whenever a proportion o f fans choose to leave the public houses late, the practice may grow and
kick-off tim es would become meaningless. But, a c om m ander must deal with the problem o f the day. Faced
with a situation which was becoming dangerous, crowd safety should have been his p a ra m o u n t consideration.
Kick-off should have been delayed.
                                           ]


S u m m a ry                               j
   228.     T he layout o f the turnstiles a n d th e num ber they were required to serve left no margin o f safety against
an uneven flow o f fans. Because police strategy in advance and on the day did not cater for it, the arrival o f a
large n u m b e r o f supporters between 2.30 pm and 2.40 pm created an unmanageable crush. The presence o f
a substantial m inority o f fans who had drunk too m uch aggravated that problem. H aving lost control and
rejected the o p tion o f postponing kick-off. the police were faced with a serious danger o f deaths or injuries.
They were left therefore with no alternative but to open the gates. Superintendent M arshall was right at that
stage to ask for it and M r Duckenfield was right to agree. But the possible effects of so dram atic a step required
other action.

                                 T H E BLUNDER ON O PEN IN G T H E GATES

  229. T he decision to o rd er the opening o f the gates was not accom panied or followed by any other o rd e r to
deal with the consequences. W hen gate C was opened, a steady stream o f about 2,000 fans poured through it
over som e five m inutes. Clearly they were going to go into the ground som ew here and unless they were diverted
their likeliest route was through the tunnel for reasons already given. N o warning was issued from the control
room that the gate was to be opened. Serials on the concourse were not alerted. N e ith e r the Club control room
nor the C hief Steward at the Leppings Lane end was warned. N o t even M r G reenw ood, the G ro u n d
C om m ander, was inform ed. From 2.47 pm when M r Marshall m ade his first request until 2.52 pm w hen M r
Duckenfield acceded to it, there were five minutes in which orders could have been given as to how the influx
was to be absorbed. It was not done. In evidence, M r Duckenfield began by saying th a t no officer m ad e any
wrong decision but he later conceded he had erred in this regard. He said he did not consider where the people
would go when the gate opened. Even after it opened, when he could see the influx on th e television screen, no
order was given to steer the fans to the wing pens. M r Duckenfield said it did not cross his m ind to detail
officers on the concourse to shut o ff the tunnel. Those officers could not have known from their position how
full pens 3 and 4 were. T h a t was a matter for the control room to m o n ito r from its own observations an d using
intelligence from aro u n d the ground.

  230. Since pens 3 a n d 4 were full by 2.50 pm, the tunnel should have been closed o ff w hether gate C was to
be opened or not. T h e exercise was a simple one a n d had been carried out in 1988. All th a t was necessary was
for a few officers to act as a cordon at the entrance to the tunnel and divert fans elsewhere. Unfortunately, the
1988 closure seems to have been unknown to the senior officers on d uty at the tim e. It did not figure in the
debriefing notes. It therefore had no influence on the planning for 1989.

  231. Planning apart, however, it should have been clear in the control room where there was a view o f the
pens and o f the crowd at the turnstiles that the tunnel had to be closed. If orders had be e n given to th at effect
when gate C was opened, the fans could have been directed to the e m pty areas o f the wings and this disaster
could still have been avoided. Failure to give that order was a blun d e r o f the first m agnitude.

  232. Significantly, w hen perm ission was given to open gate A, M r D uckenfield did o r d e r serials to go to that
part o f the concourse to m o n ito r the influx towards the north stand. H e did this because he feared th a t if fans
went to the n o rth stand w ith o u t tickets, they would not get seats and, there being no p e rim e te r fences at the
north side, they m ight inv ad e the pitch. This illustrates again the preoccupation with avoiding pitch invasion
as against safety a n d the risks o f overcrowding. Because those entering through gate C could not get onto the
pitch, it was not thought necessary to alert officers to m o n ito r them . T h e possibility o f overcrowding simply
was not considered.

                                            T H E BARRIERS IN PEN 3

Barrier 144                             i
   233. T he removal o f barrier 144 jn 1986 should have reduced the notional capacity o f pen 3 as already
mentioned. But it did more. Jn the absence o f barrier 144, the influx o f fans after 2.52 p m met no retarding
structure as it cam e into pen 3. T he pressure created was free to push fans straight down by the radial fence to
the lowest line o f barriers. The pressure diagonally from the tunnel m o u th down to barrier n u m b e r 124a which
collapsed was unbroken by any intervening barrier. 124a was also vulnerable to pressure straight down the pen
through the gap in the barrier above it created in 1985.

  234. Inspector Bullas, positioned in the west stand, described what he saw looking down on the pens
around 3 pm.

  "... 1 saw from the direction o f the tunnel a kind o f m ovement down the te rra c in g ... the type o f thing that you
  see on the nature programmes, the molten lead flowing down the side o f the m ountainside, the molten lava...
  a “river o f people” ... going directly towards the pitch but there again spreading ...■out.”

   235. D r Eastwood conceded in evidence that the removal o fb a rr ie r 144 was likely to have contributed to
the collapse o f 124a. Later, he sought to resile from that answer, but I th in k his earlier adm ission was correct. It
was argued th a t if barrier 144 had remained, the influx from gate C would have built up fu rth e r back and the
tragedy might have occurred in the tunnel or might have broken barrier 144 itself. This is speculative and I
think unlikely. W h a t rem ained o fb a r r ie r 144 in pen 4 did not cause a build-up; nor did it collapse. But its
remaining in position may well have accounted for no barrier further down pen 4 collapsing and for the lesser
carnage in th a t pen.

When did Barrier 124a Fail?
  236. Counsel for the S outh Yorkshire Police sought to argue th a t this barrier collapsed or may have
collapsed at a b o u t 2.47 pm. His purpose was to suggest that the opening o f gate C was not causally linked with
the crushing and fatalities resulting from th a t collapse. I have already found that whilst the evidence does not
permit the tim e o f collapse to be fixed with certainty, it was after 2.52 pm. I now give my reasons:

  (a) I have several times watched the BBC video tape on which Counsel relied. I do not find the incident he
      identifies at 2.47 pm suggestive o f a collapse at th a t time;

  (b) the evidence o f fans w ho were near or at the barrier was overwhelmingly to the effect th a t the collapse
      occurred at or after 3 pm;

  (c) the biggest group o f witnesses was that which related the collapse to the surge following Beardsley’s
      “near-m iss” at the Kop end at 3.04 pm;

  (d) the appearance on video and photographs o f fans in the area o fb a rrie r 124a after the incident at 2.47 pm
      an d before the final crush is not consistent with it having collapsed so early;

  (e) it is highly unlikely th a t if so catastrophic an event had occurred as early as 2.47 p m , the police on the
      track and elsewhere would have taken until nearly 3 o ’clock to realise something was seriously wrong.
      Indeed, if Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police were correct in his tim ing o f the collapse, the failure o f
      the police to respond for so long would expose them to even graver criticism than th a t made in this
      Report.

Dr Eastwood’s Testing of the Barriers
  237. Two sections o f b a r rie r 124a in pen 3 collapsed as a result o f the overcrowding. T h a t collapse caused a
num ber o f deaths. D r Eastw ood and his staff had undertaken the periodical testing o f crush barriers required
by the G reen G u id e and by the Safety Certificate. Barrier 124a had been tested in July 1988 a n d passed.

  238. T h e test had been carried out in accordance with D r Eastwood’s interpretation o f Annex C to the
Green G uide. T h a t requires an evenly distributed force o f 6.0kN /m etre width to be applied for 3 five m inute



                                                           41
periods, the interval between applications to be as short as possible. A record has to be kept of the am o u n t of
d eform ation during each loading and of the percentage o f recovery. If the recovery is less than 50% after the
third application of force, the barrier has failed the test. If recovery is between 50% a n d 75%, there m ust be a
re-test. T h e question is'. 50% or 75% of what? Is the recovery to be in relation to the position o f the barrier
before the first application o f force or before the third? If the former, a span o f 124a recorded 53% at the 1988
test an d should have been re-tested. If the latter, it recorded 100% and passed. U nfortunately the Green Guide
is unclear as to the correct interpretation. D r Eastwood took the latter view and so passed the barrier. He
justified his interpretation in evidence.! He said failure to recover to the original position could be due to a
“shake-down” effect related to some giving in the ashes under the concrete or to some oth e r extraneous factor
rather th a n to any defect in the m aterial;o f the barrier itself.

   239. I think, after consulting Professor M aunder, that safety ought to have dictated recovery should be by
reference to the position o f the barrier before the first application o f force. 1 accept, however, that the Green
G uide is am biguous and D r Eastw ood’s interpretation is tenable. It has some sup p o rt from the British
S tandards tests on steel structures. Cleady, however, for the future, the G reen G u id e should be clarified on this
point.

Corrosion
  240. Inspection o f barrier 124a, and indeed other barriers at Hillsborough, by the HSE showed
considerable corrosion o f the metal at vulnerable points where water could accum ulate. D r Eastwood agreed
that if a significant degree o f corrosion was observed on visual inspection, a barrier should be condemned.

  241. T h e G reen G u id e does not specifically refer to corrosion. Paragraph 39 provides, inter alia:

  “C rush barriers and balustrades should be exam ined for deform ation or any other overt signs o f weakness” .

Paragraph 6 o f A nnex C provides:

  “If during any test, even though the barrier ... satisfies the above loading requirem ents, doubt should arise
  for any reason (including such matters as cracking o f the terracing or distortion o f connections) as to the
  safety o f the barrier ... a detailed investigation should be carried out. Unless the results o f this investigation
  remove the d o u b t as to safety o f the b a r r ie r ... (it) should be deemed to have failed the test”.

  242. Since corrosion is a likely cause o f deterioration, a revision o f the G reen G u id e should make specific
reference to it.

Causation
  243. Tests done by the HSE suggest that although barrier 124a passed the loading test in 1988 and probably
would have been able to sustain a force which did not exceed the test load, it was unable to resist the load
im posed upon it by reason o f the numbers in pen 3, the excessive gap in the barrier higher up the pen an d the
absence o f b a r r i e r 144. C orrosion probably played a part, but the effective cause o f the collapse was the
excessive and unanticipated pressure to which the barrier was exposed.

                                   TH E CRUSHING N OT RECOGNISED

Observation from Control Rpom               !
   244. As the stream from gate C flowed through the tunnel, the officers in the control room could be expected
to keep a close watch on pens 3 and 4. They had a direct view of them from an elevated position through their
window. Although they hadino field-glasses, there was the zoom facility on the TV camera. The radio was by
then working again and although reception was difficult due to crowd noise and possibly excessive air traffic
on channel 25, attempts could have been made to alert officers on the perim eter track to watch for
overcrowding and report their observations. In the event, pens 3 and 4 became more and m ore crowded, surges
took place, fans were showing and signalling distress. N one of this was seen or recognised in the control room.

Officers on the Track
  245. T he 20 officers detailed to the perimeter track were distributed round the pitch so th a t some five
officers were at the west end. T heir written instructions made no reference to the avoidance or detection of
overcrowding. T he same applied to the officers in the west stand. M r Greenwood adm itted that his oral
briefings also contained no m ention o f monitoring the pens for overcrowding.

   246. T he Operational O rd er for 1988 had instructed officers to forbid anyone “access to the track from the
terraces w ithout the consent o f a senior officer (except to receive medical attention)”. At the end of the 1988
semi-final, there was a m in o r pitch invasion. Accordingly, that prohibition was em phasised in the 1989
Operational O rd er by being p u t into capital letters. T he com bination o f no instructions as to overcrowding and
a strong prohibition on opening the gates was likely to make police recognition o f crushing slow and their
response reluctant. Small w onder that the growing pressure and congestion between 2.50 pm and 2.59 pm
went unheeded or certainly unrem edied. Even when officers recognised there was a problem, the rule required
consent o f a senior officer before a gate could be opened.

  247. “Senior officer” m eant a’n'offi'cer of Inspector rank or higher. T he Inspector in charge o f the 20 officers
on the track was Mr Darling. He stationed him self by the players’ tunnel, the most central position for
supervising his men. In evidence he said:

  “I would only take action if I thought crowding had got to such a stage th a t the fans were in danger. I’d then
  inform ground control and I would expect someone deployed to the back o f the stand.”

  T h at underlines the inhibition against opening perim eter gates. So did the evidence o f one Constable who
said it had been so dru m m ed into officers not to open the gates that w hen he saw distress in pen 4, he “debated”
with him self before opening the gate, thinking: “ If I’m wrong, I’m going to get a right bollocking for this.”
Naturally, one would hope th at co m m on sense and hum anity would m ake some officers cut through the rules
and open a gate if fans were clearly in distress'.'

  248. This is what happened, b u t not until officers recognised the distress and even then not immediately.
Hence, gates 3 and 4, having been opened, were shut again before they were finally opened and at first those
seeking to climb out over the fence were pushed back. This reaction o f the police did not go on for as long as
some witnesses believed. They probably misinterpreted the hand m ovem ents from M r G reenw ood and others
aim ed at persuading fans to move back and relieve the pressure as attem pts to stop those climbing out at the
front.

  249. Nevertheless, there was a period during which the failure to recognise the problem and the inhibition
against tackling it caused vital tim e to be lost.

The Officers in Command
  250. Even when realisation o f the problem came to officers on the track, it was som e m inutes before it
reached the control room. Whejn spectators first appeared on the track, the im m e d ia te assum ption in the
control room was that a pitch invasion was threatejned. This was unlikely at the beginning o f a match. It
became still less likely w hen tliose on the track m ade no move towards the pitch. M r M otson, the BBC
comm entator, recognised and said, well before the match was stopped, that the trouble seem ed to be
overcrowding and not misbehaviour. Still, the assumption to the contrary persisted in the control room. U ntil
Mr M urray radioed for a fleet o f ambulances, about 3.06 pm, M r D uckenfield c o ntinued to treat the incident
as a threat to the pitch and to public order. The message calling up all available officers m entioned a pitch
invasion. Operation S upport was initiated and dog handlers were requested.
   251. Until C hief S uperintendent Nesbit arrived, there was no effective leadership either from control or on
the pitch to harness and organise rescue efforts. No orders were given for officers to enter th e tunnel and relieve
pressure. Some officers did this on their own initiative. Apart from the Tannoy request to clear th e pitch, no
attem pt was m ade to clear and m ark off a casualty area where first-aid could be given w ith o u t h in d ra n c e by
fans and photographers milling about between the bodies. There was no co-ordination o f the early provision o f
first-aid or of stretcher parties or o f the rescue effort through gates 3 a n d 4. N o request for help was broadcast to
doctors an d nurses in the crowd until about 3.29 pm when it was too late. Probably, there was little that could
have been achieved in most cases however soon doctors had been su m m o n e d , but there were marginal cases
where earlier attention might have m ade a difference.
  252. T he plight o f those behind the fencing and the existence o f injuries were known to officers at the scene
from 3 pm. But the M ajor D isaster Plan was not started until 3.06 pm at earliest when the am bulance service
was called. No request for cutting gear or for the fire brigade was made until 3.13 p.m. Again, it is unlikely that
these services could have saved lives if they had been called promptly, b u t it is possible.
Police on the Pitch
   253. Despite the initial lack of leadership, many officers did all they h u m a n ly could to rescue a n d revive the
victims. M any supporters w ho gave evidence paid tribute to these efforts. It is also fair to say that the n u m b e r
o f officers who could at first be usefully involved at the two open gates was necessarily limited.
   254. C h ief Superintendent N esbit’s action in deploying a line o f officers across the m iddle o f the pitch has
already been mentioned. I can well understand the resentment it caused. However, the police assertion th a t a
rush by some fans towards the Kop end raised fears o f conflict are well borne out by the video tape. In my
judgem ent, C hief Superintendent Nesbit was well justified in using som e o f the m any officers called up
pursuant to O peration Support to prevent possible violence. To have h a d open fighting in a ground where
some 90 spectators already lay dead would have been an unthinkable a n d obscene development.
Fans on the Pitch
   255. M any fans who escaped onto the pitch alive were in a state o f collapse or close to it. M ost o f those who
retained their strength strove magnificently to assist the victims. They helped pull them clear; they helped with
first-aid; they helped carry the improvised stretchers.
  256. There were fans, however, who were distraught, angry, drunk, or all three. T h e ir conduct in abusing,
assaulting and spitting at the police was disgraceful, the more so since earlier police failures had little to do
with those officers now doing their best for the injured. In addition, there were abuse and assaults on
am bulance m en and firemen in the course o f their rescue work. This was probably because th e ir sim ilar
uniforms caused them to be mistaken for police. However, although the abuse was w idespread, the n u m b e r o f
assaults an d spittings was on the evidence comparatively small. In deploring them , one m u st recognise the
uniquely horrifying experience which those responsible had ju st suffered a n d were still suffering.
False Reports
   257. Before this Inquiry began, there were stories reported in the press, a n d said to have e m anated from
police officers present at the match, o f “mass drunkenness”. It was said th a t d runken fans urinated o n the
police while they were pulling the dead and injured out, that others had even urinated on th e bodies o f the dead
and stolen their belongings. N ot a single witness was called before the Inquiry to su p p o rt any o f those
allegations although every opportunity was afforded for any o f the represented parties to have any witness
called whom they wished. As soon as the allegations I have m entioned were m ade in the press, M r Peter
Wright, C h ief Constable o f South Yorkshire, m ade a dignified statem ent dissociating h im se lf from such grave
and emotive calumnies. Those who m ade them, and those who dissem inated them , would have done bette r to
hold their peace.

                               T H E P E R I M E T E R GATES W E R E T O O SM A L L

  258. T he perim eter gates in the pens were not designed as exits. They were intended to afford access by the
police to cope with any local disorder or with an emergency. The kind of emergency contem plated was not
massive crushing but, for example, the collapse or illness of an individual. Emergency evacuation of the pens
had been considered by the Officer Working Party. Although fire risk was minim al since the terraces, west
stand and tu n n el were of concrete construction, the fire brigade were the principal arbiters of evacuation
procedure. They aimed to be able to em pty the pens in six minutes. T he plan was to evacuate spectators via the
tunnel. If for any reason that option becam e impracticable, eg due to a bom b threat, then the alternative route
would be along the back o f the terraces, through the gates in the radial fences and round the sides of the west
stand. T he fire brigade were satisfied that each o f these routes would enable the pens to be evacuated in less
than six m inutes, without relying on the gates to the pitch. Those gates would also be available, but their use
was excluded from the calculation o f evacuation time.

  259. T h e need to provide for speedy and large scale evacuation from the front of the pens to the pitch was
not anticipated. The Green G uide (1986) provides as follows:

  “209. Access to the pitch m ust be m ade as difficult as possible in norm al circumstances while at the same
  time ensuring that the police have effective access to the terraces for the purpose o f crowd control and
  enabling th e pitch to be used (where appropriate) in the event o f serious emergency . . .

  214. . . . at some m ajor soccer stadia, where restriction on crowd m ovement forms a necessary part of the
  safety measures, it may be necessary to have a fence which prevents access to the pitch in normal
  circum stances . . . but allows for access in emergency.

  215. For m ost major stadia, whether used for association football or other sports, the pitch perimeter fence
  will be req u ired either to prevent access to the pitch as m entioned above, or at least to discourage attempts
  by spectators to enter the playing area. Gates or other access points (m inim um w idth 1.1 metres) should
  nonetheless be provided for use in an emergency . . . Provision o f such gates or access points is particularly
  im p o rtan t to allow full access to the playing area (or track) where it is likely to be used as a place o f safety in
  an emergency.           Such gates or access points should be properly stewarded and                             clearly
  m arked so th a t im m ediate access to the playing area or perimeter track can be e n sured” .

  260. G a te 3' was .82 metres in width; gate 4 was .79 metres in width. There were therefore clear departures
from th e G re e n Guide standard.

  261. T h e Safety Certificate provided (by Schedule 2 Paragraph 24) as follows:

  T he (club) shall arrange for the Stadium to be inspected by a suitably qualified C hartered Engineer . . . at
  least once each period o f 12 m onths . . . and . ... shall as soon as possible after each inspection supply to
  the . . . C ouncil a Certificate by the said C hartered Engineer as to the current com pliance or non-compliance
  with . . . th e appropriate provisions and recom m endations o f the (Green) G uide o f all structural parts o f the
  S tadium . . .

  262. It was argued that there was no breach o f the Safety Certificate since the G reen G u id e specifically
provides for flexibility. However, in my view the Safety Certificate cannot and certainly should not be
interpreted so liberally as in effect to leave such basic requirem ents as the size o f exit gates to the total
discretion o f th e club and its advisers. O ne o f the m atters for consideration at stage two o f this inquiry will be
whether, a n d in what respects, the Green G u id e needs to be clarified and toughened.

   263. D r Eastwood explained the small w idth o f the gates by reference to the dilem m a facing the police. They
wanted a gate sufficient for its intended purpose ie police access and small scale emergencies. On the other
hand, they d id not want a flood gate o f such size as to endanger the prim e principle o f preventing pitch
invasions. In th e light o f Hillsborough, this is perhaps the most poignant example o f the difficulty of achieving
a balance between stopping hooliganism and ensuring crowd safety.

   264. Even if the w idth o f gates 3 and 4 had complied with the present Green G uide standard, they would
have been wholly inadequate to relieve pressure and release spectators swiftly on 15 April. Moreover, the
 Green G u id e says nothing about the num b e r o f gates required for a pen o f given size. Whilst the Club,


                                                            45
D r Eastwood, the Officer Working Party and the local authority can be criticised for failing strictly to conform
to the Guide, the real failure was c o m m on to all those who have been responsible for considering safety on the
terraces. T h e anxiety to protect the sanctity o f the pitch has caused insufficient attention to be paid to the risk
o f a crush du e to overcrowding. Certain it was, th a t once the crush occurred on 15 April gates 3 and 4 were
wholly inad eq uate for rescue purposes.

  265. T h e im m ediate cause o f the gross overcrowding and hence the disaster was the failure, when gate (J was
opened, to cut off access to the central pens which were already overfull.

  266. They were already overfull because no safe maxim um capacities had been laid down, no attempt was
m ade to control entry to individual pens numerically and there was no effective visual monitoring o f crowd
density.

   267. W hen the influx from gate C entered pen 3, the layout o f the barriers there afforded less protection
than it should and a barrier collapsed. Again, the lack o f vigilant m onitoring caused a sluggish reaction and
response when the crush occurred. T he small size and number o f gates to the track retarded rescue efforts. So,
in the initial stages, did lack o f leadership.

  268. T he need to open gate C was due to dangerous congestion at the turnstiles. T hat occurred because, as
both Club an d police should have realised, the turnstile area could not easily cope with the large numbers
dem an d ed o f it unless they arrived steadily over a lengthy period. The Operational O rder and police tactics on
the day failed to provide for controlling a concentrated arrival o f large num bers should that occur in a short
period. T h a t it might so occur was foreseeable and it did. The presence o f an unruly minority who had drunk
too much aggravated the problem. So did the C lub’s confused and inadequate signs and ticketing.

                                       TH E FA’s CHOICE OF GROUND

    269. T he FA were strongly criticised by the Football j Supporters’ Association and others for having
imposed the Hillsborough venue on Liverpool for a second year running. The Liverpool supporters had to
travel m uch further to Sheffield th a n their N ottingham rivals. T he police required that if the match was to be at
Hillsborough at all, Liverpool would have to have the west and north side accommodation. T he disadvantages
o f that and the disparate num bers o f hom e supporters o f the two clubs have already been set out. Liverpool had
had to knuckle under to the arrangem ent in 1988. They resented having it imposed in 1989. To hold the match
at Old Trafford would have been a perfectly good and acceptable alternative. Indeed, the FA nom inated Old
Trafford as the venue for the replay should there be a draw at Hillsborough.

   270. M r Kelly, the FA’s C hief Executive, sought to give reasons for preferring Hillsborough, but the only one
which seemed to have any validity was that the 1988 match had been considered a successfully managed event.
He adm itted that a telephone call from the C hief Executive o f the Liverpool Club protesting and putting
Liverpool’s case had not been m entioned to the FA committee which finally decided the venue. M r Kelly
frankly conceded that “there was an element o f unfairness” to Liverpool in choosing Hillsborough for a second
time. I think the decision was ill-considered. No doubt in future the FA will be more sensitive and responsive
to reasonable representations.

  271. However, it was not suggested that the choice o f venue was causative o f this disaster. The only basis on
which that could be said would be that, because o f its layout, the Leppings Lane end was incapable o f being
successfully policed for this semi-final. I do not believe that to be so.
                                                 CHAPTER 18

                                                    POLICE

Choice of Ends by the Police
   272. There was much bitterness amongst Liverpool supporters that they had to m ake do again for the
second year with the Leppings Lane end. But, cogent as their complaints were, they a m ounted to reasons for
choosing a different ground altogether. Given Hillsborough as the venue, I think the police were right to
allocate the sections o f the ground as they did. The direction o f arrival and the need for segregation m ade it
sensible an d to reverse the 1988 arrangements would have m ade for confusion. As with choice o f venue, 1 do
not consider choice o f ends was causative o f the disaster. Had it been reversed, the disaster could well have
occurred in a similar m an n e r but to Nottingham supporters.

Police Planning
  273. T h e Operational O rder for 1989 left much unsaid. Apart from the lack o f any provision for late or
congested arrivals, or any provision for the avoidance o f overcrowding on the terraces, there was a num ber of
other omissions. For example, there was no specific deployment o f officers to man the perimeter gates. The
Order did not detail the duties o f the m ounted officers deployed at the Leppings Lane entrance, who included
Liverpool officers to assist in marshalling their own fans. The duties o f Superintendents (especially Mr
Greenwood an d M r Marshall) were not defined so as to achieve clarity and efficiency. By an oversight, the
provision requiring mobile (Tango) patrols to assist the emergency services was omitted from the text.

  274. T h e 1988 O rder was never substantially reviewed save to reduce the num ber o f officers deployed in
shopping areas and to emphasise in capital letters the embargo on fans having access to the pitch. Satisfaction
with the 1988 event led to complacency. T hat some thought the pens overfull in 1988 and that the tunnel was
closed o ff on th a t occasion did not figure in or influence the plan for 1989.

  275. M r Duckenfield was prom oted and put in charge o f F Division only 21 days before this semi-final. The
pre-planning was already in progress under Mr Mole who had been in com m and both in 1987 and in 1988. It
might have been wiser to have left M r Mole in charge o f this operation. On the other hand, it is quite
understandable that M r Duckenfield should have been expected to take com m and o f events in his Division
from the date o f his promotion. In view o f his lack o f experience at Hillsborough and o f a semi-final match,
however, it was imperative that he be fully briefed and that he should also brief himself.

   276. He was not inform ed o f the crushing incident in 1981 nor did he make inquiries which would have
revealed it. He did not know the arrangement as between Club and police for monitoring the Leppings Lane
terraces. He did not visit and tour the ground before approving the Operational Order. Although he attended a
match on 2 April, there was only a small crowd present and he left control o f the game to the Superintendents.

Policing on the Day
  277. One o f the regrettable features o f the football scene as it has developed is the enorm ous expenditure of
money, tim e and effort in employing large numbers o f police all over the country to guard against the sort of
disorder and misbehaviour which have become endemic. Police managem ent o f a game o f football has become
a military operation. The problems faced and the responses received must be disheartening and may have
tended to h a rd e n police attitudes to supporters in general.

   278. It is fair to state th at over many years the South Yorkshire Police have given excellent service to the
public. They have handled crowd problems sensitively and successfully at a large num b e r o f football games
including m a jo r matches, during strikes in the coal industry and the steel industry, and in other contexts.
Unfortunately, their policing on 15 April broke down in the ways already described and, although there were
o ther causes, the main reason for the disaster was the failure o f police control.

   279. In all som e 65 police officers gave oral evidence at the Inquiry. Sadly I must report that for the most
part the quality o f their evidence was in inverse proportion to their rank. There were m any young Constables
who as witnesses were alert, intelligent and open. On the day, they and many others strove heroically in ghastly
circumstances aggravated by hostility to rescue and succour victims. They inspired confidence and hope.

  280. By contrast, with some notable exceptions, the senior officers in com m and were defensive and evasive
witnesses. T h e ir feelings o f grief and sorrow were obvious and genuine. No doubt those feelings were
intensified by the knowledge that such a disaster had occurred under their m anagement. But, neither their
handling o f problems on the day nor their account o f it in evidence showed the qualities o f leadership to be
expected o f th e ir rank.


                                                        49
   281. M r Duckenfield leant heavily on Mr M urray’s experience. Between them they misjudged the build-up
at the turnstiles and did little about it until they received M r Marshall’s request to open the gate. They did not,
for example, check the turnstile figures available from Club control or check with Tango units as to the
num bers still to come. They did not alert M r Greenwood to the situation at the fringe o f his area o f command.
They gave no instructions as to the management o f the crowd at Leppings Lane. Inflexibly they declined to
postpone kick-off.

  282. W hen M r Marshall’s request came, Mr Duckenfield’s capacity to take decisions and give orders
seemed to collapse. Having sanctioned, at last, the opening o f the gates, he failed to give necessary
consequential orders or to exert any control when the disaster occurred. He m isinterpreted the emergence of
fans from pens 3 and 4. W hen he was unsure o f the problem, he sent others down to “assess the situation”
rather th an descend to see for himself. He gave no information to the crowd.

   283. Most surprisingly, he gave M r Kelly and others to think that there had been an inrush due to Liverpool
fans forcing open a gate. This was not only untruthful. It set off a widely reported allegation against the
supporters which caused grave offence and distress. It revived against football fans, and especially those from
Liverpool, accusations o f hooliganism which caused reaction not only nationwide but from Europe too. I can
only assume th a t M r Duckenfield’s lack o f candour on this occasion was out o f character. He said his reason for
not telling the tru th was that if the crowd became aware o f it there might be a very hostile reaction and this
might im pede rescue work. He did not wish to divulge what had happened until he had spoken to a senior
officer. However, reluctance to tell M r Kelly the truth did not require that he be told a falsehood. Moreover,
although Assistant C hief Constable Jackson was at hand, M r Duckenfield did not disclose the truth to him
until m uch later.

  284. T he likeliest explanation o f M r D uckenfield’s conduct is that he simply could not face the enorm ity o f
the decision to open the gates and all that flowed therefrom. That would explain what he said to M r Kelly, what
he d id not say to M r J ackson, his aversion to addressing the crowd and his failure to take effective control o f the
disaster situation. He froze.

The Police Case at the Inquiry
  285. It is a m atter o f regret that at the hearing, and in their submissions, the South Yorkshire Police were not
prepared to concede they were in any respect at fault in what occurred. M r Duckenfield, under pressure of
cross-examination, apologised for blaming the Liverpool fans for causing the deaths. But, that apart, the police
case was to blam e the fans for being late and drunk, and to blame the Club for failing to m onitor the pens. It was
argued that the fatal crush was not caused by the influx through gate C but was due to barrier 124a being
defective. Such an unrealistic approach gives cause for anxiety as to whether lessons have been learnt. It would
have been m ore seemly and encouraging for the future if responsibility had been faced.

                         THE CITY COUNCIL AND THE SAFETY CERTIFICATE

   286. The performance by the City Council o f its duties in regard to the Safety Certificate was inefficient and
dilatory. The failure to revise or am e n d the certificate over the period o f three years preceding this disaster,
despite im portant changes in the layout o f the ground, was a serious breach o f duty. There were, as a result, no
fixed capacities for the pens. T he certificate took no account o f the 1981 and 1985 alterations to the ground.

  287. A num ber o f breaches o f Green Guide standards were perm itted and persisted eg the spacing o f the
crush barriers, the width o f perim eter gates and the gradient in the tunnel (1 in 6 as against the Green Guide
m axim um o f 1 in 10).

  288. The Advisory G roup lacked a proper structure: its procedure was casual and unbusinesslike. Its
accountability to the General Purposes Panel was ill-defined. Decisions were taken informally and too much
was left to M r Bownes. In particular, the decision to remove barrier 144 was not referred to the Panel and ought
not to have been made.




                                                         51
                                                  CHAPTER 20

                                      T H E CLUB AN D DR EASTWOOD

   289. It should be recorded th at in general the Club has over the years adopted a responsible and
conscientious approach to its responsibilities. It retained the services o f D r Eastwood as consultant engineer
a(id abided by his advice. For his part, D r Eastwood is skilled and experienced in this field, as already
indicated, and he sought I have no doubt to act efficiently and professionally in his advice and practical work.
T he Club also retained Mr Lock who had acquired great experience and knowledge o f Hillsborough during his
police service. A num ber o f witnesses described Hillsborough as a very good ground, “one o f the best in the
country” . The police agreed that relations between them and the Club were good. Over the last four years, the
Club had spent some £ 1'Amillion on ground improvements.

   290. Nevertheless, there are a num b e r o f respects in which failure by the Club contributed to this disaster.
They were responsible as occupiers and invitors for the layout and structure o f the ground. The Leppings Lane
end was unsatisfactory and ill-suited to ad m it the num bers invited, for reasons already spelt out. The Club was
aware o f these problems and discussed solving them in various ways between 1981 and 1986. In the result,
there remained the same num b e r o f turnstiles, and the same problems outside and inside them. The plan for
this semi-final, involving as it did the loss o f 12 turnstiles for the north stand and large numbers to be fed in
from Leppings Lane, was one agreed between the Club and the police. The Club knew best what rate o f
adm ission the turnstiles could manage and ought to have alerted the police to the risks o f the turnstiles being
swamped.

   291. The alterations inside the turnstiles and on the terraces clearly affected capacity, but no specific
allowance was m ade for them. In that respect, both D r Eastwood and the Club should have taken a more
positive approach. Either a scheme such as one o f those D r Eastwood put forward should have been adopted
giving more turnstiles and total separation o f areas or at the very least the capacity o f the new pens and o f the
terraces as a whole should have been treated more cautiously. The police view in 1981 that 10,100 was too high
a figure was known to the Club (although D r Eastwood says not to him). Yet, despite that and the sub-division
into pens, the figure remained.

   292. Although the police had assum ed responsibility for monitoring the pens, the Club had a duty to its
visitors and the Club’s officials ought to have alerted the police to the grossly uneven distribution o f fans on the
terraces. The Club operated and read the closed circuit television and the com puter totaliser. Liaison between
Club and police on the day failed to alert the latter to the num ber o f Liverpool supporters still to come. The
onus here was on the Club as well as on the police.

   293. The removal o f barrier 144 was the responsibility o f the Club although it clearly acted on the advice o f
D r Eastwood and the Advisory G ro u p which in this instance was misguided.

  294. Likewise, the breaches o f the G reen G u id e were m atters which the Club should have appreciated and
remedied.

    295. Lastly, as already indicated, the po o r signposting on the concourse tended to produce under-filling o f
the wing pens and over-filling o f pens 3 a n d 4. Poor signposting outside the turnstiles and the unhelpful format
o f the tickets also led to confusion aggravating the build-up in the turnstile area.




                                                         52

                                FIRST AID AND EMERGENCY SERVICES

No Fault by the Emergency Services                           ;
   296. I say at the outset o f this chapter that no valid criticism can be made o f the response by the St John
Ambulance Brigade, by SYMAS or by the fire brigade on 15 April. Indeed, no represented party ventured any
criticism o f them. The only attack on SYMAS came from two Liverpool doctors. One claimed that ambulances
did not arrive swiftly or with sufficient equipm ent and that there was a lack o f triage. He was proved to be
wrong in all three respects. U nfortunately he had seen fit to go on television on 15 April when he said more
lives could have been saved if staff and equipm ent had arrived earlier. Apart from being proved wrong in fact
as to the times o f arrival o f ambulances, he conceded in evidence that it was not possible to say whether lives
could have been saved. His com m ents on television were irresponsible. T he other doctor com plained o f the
absence o f defibrillators. I am satisfied on overwhelming evidence that to attem pt to use a defibrillator on the
pitch with people milling about would have been highly dangerous owing to the risk of injury from the electric
charge.

  297. I find that all three o f the emergency services nam ed above responded promptly when alerted, that
they brought appropriate equipm ent and that their personnel operated efficiently.

  298. It would be unreasonable to expect, at any sports stadium, medical facilities capable o f dealing with a
major disaster such as occurred. To have in advance at the ground, oxygen, resuscitators, stretchers, other
equipm ent and medical staff sufficient to deal with over 100 casualties is not practicable.

  299. W hat is required is a basic level o f provision for first aid, for professional medical attention and for
ambulance attendance, together with a system o f co-ordination with the emergency services which will bring
them to the scene swiftly in whatever numbers are required. W hat will am ount to an appropriate basic
provision for the future ?g th e equipnient in a first aid room, requires expert evaluation and advice.

   300. O n the day, there was no clear understanding between the Club and D r Purcell as to his role. He
believed he was prim arily there to attend to the players. The Club regarded him also as the “physician available
to attend at the first aid room if required”, as laid down in the Safety Certificate.

  301. There was insufficiently close co-operation between the police and the emergency services. It is clear
that SYMAS and the fire brigade should have been called earlier than they were. However, in view o f the nature
and extent o f the crushing, the tim e when police rescue began and the pathetically short period for which those
unable to breathe could survive, it is improbable that quicker recourse to the emergency services would have
saved m ore lives.

   302. Finally, there was evidence that an advertising board had to be knocked down at the north-east corner
o f the ground to allow an am bulance onto the pitch and that at the top o f the ramp leading to the pitch the
access for am bulances was inadequate. There was also evidence that the pre-match arrangem ent for
am bulances to use the two gates from Penistone Road at the north-east end o f the ground as in and out routes
was frustrated by the presence o f vehicles just inside the ground. In the event, none o f these m atters affected
operations. The hoarding was quickly knocked down. The difficult access to the ram p was negotiated and
ambulances used one entrance satisfactorily by backing out when loaded.

                                          COM M UNICATIONS

   303.      One problem which im peded police control and the gathering o f intelligence was the intermittent
failure o f com m unication by radio. There was the period o f two or three minutes when the control room was
out o f radio contact. Even when that was remedied, it was only by using a hand set in the control room. This
m eant that control could not override any other messages. No effective radio com m unication seems to have
reached control from the perim eter track at the relevant tim e. Mr G reenw ood’s request for the match to be    ^
stopped and various messages from Constables reporting the distress in the pens did not register. Likewise.      '
com m unication from Leppings Lane to control was unreliable. U ndoubtedly these breakdowns m ade it more
difficult for those in com m and to make proper assessments and exercise effective com m and.

                                      CHAPTER 23 - INTRODUCTION

Limited Objectives     !
  304. It is im portant to stress the limited objectives o f the interim recom m endations I can make in this
Report. My purpose is to propose instant measures capable o f being im plem ented forthwith and where
possible before the com m encem ent o f the 1989/1990 season. They are designed to prevent overcrowding and
crushing on terraces in the short term and to improve safety procedures. They do not and cannot meet all the
problems or address all the issues o f post-Hillsborough football. W ider issues such as m em bership schemes,
identity cards, all-seater stadia, super-stadia and long term recom m endations fall to be considered in my Final
Report. So do a num ber o f other specific matters such as a comprehensive review o f the G reen Guide, the
problem o f excessive pre-match drinking, fans without tickets and ticket touts. I m ention these matters lest it
be thought I have decided no recom m endations need be made concerning them. I have not. But before
deciding what if any recom m endations to make about these and other matters, more evidence and study is
required.

  305. Accordingly, the main thrust o f these interim recom m endations, as a holding exercise, is to reduce
numbers on the terraces, to increase vigilance and to achieve a proper balance in crowd control between
prevention o f disorder and m aintenance o f safety.


Perimeter Fences
   306. It would be impractical and unwise to recom m end works o f construction or radical structural changes
now, before completing the extensive study and consultation which will form stage two o f this Inquiry. Hasty
interim recom m endations o f that kind might well prove to be ill-judged after further study and require to be
changed in a m atter o f m onths.
                                       N-

   307. In particular, I do not aTthis stage make any recom m endation as to removing perim eter fences or
replacing them with structures o f different design. Understandably, there was a wave o f popular feeling against
such fences in the im m ediate afterm ath o f Hillsborough. The horrifying spectacle o f people being crushed
against the fencing focussed blam e for the disaster on the fences themselves. There were pleas to dismantle
them and em otive references to the fans being treated like “ caged anim als” . Some clubs removed their fencing
straightaway. It was therefore very tem pting to consider at an early stage making a recom m endation that the
fences should be removed. I confess to being so tempted.

  308. Regrettably, only a m on th after Hillsborough, there were incidents which showed that violence and
hooliganism are still liable to erupt at football grounds. On 13 May at Selhurst Park, Birmingham City
supporters invaded the pitch and fought with supporters o f the hom e club, Crystal Palace. Five police officers
and 16 supporters were injured and required treatm ent at a local hospital. O n the same day at a match between
Bristol City and Sheffield U nited, spectators spilt onto the pitch and there was fighting on the terraces. At the
Cup Final between Liverpool and Everton on 20 May, there was a pitch invasion, albeit a comparatively
benign one.

  309. Even the Football Supporters’ Association (FSA) felt it necessary to say in their final submission,

       “ W ith some reservations, the FSA accept that perim eter fences are necessary for crowd control.”

   310. Bearing in m ind those matters, and the need to consider further expert evidence, I have decided that it
would be unwise and p rem ature for me to make any recom m endations now either to remove or to preserve or
to alter the structure o f p erim eter fences. I shall make recom m endations about them in my Final Report.

   311. For the present, I would em phasise that, although the fencing prevented escape, the real cause o f the
Hillsborough disaster was overcrowding and it is against that danger th a t my interim recom m endations are
prim arily directed. Whilst declining to recom m end the removal o f the fences, I do consider that the gates to the
pitch should be kept open whilst the terraces are occupied. T his will have, I hope, three beneficial effects.
Obviously, an open gate is a m ore ready escape route than one which has to be locked. Secondly, the sight o f
open gates will be reassuring to spectators on the terraces. Thirdly, the existence o f gaps in the fencing by
reason o f the open gates will concentrate the m inds o f police officers or stewards on the track to the need for
careful m onitoring o f those on the terraces.


                                                        55
  312. It will o f course be necessary to have a police presence sufficient to prevent pitch invasion for im proper
reasons through the open gates. However, I am encouraged to think that this is not an insuperable problem by
the fact that, for example at Anfield, Liverpool’s ground, there were no gates in the perimeter fencing before it
was taken down. There were instead gaps or “ access points” as they are called in the Green G u id e (paragraph
215). T heir existence did not, so far as I am aware, prevent the authorities from maintaining order. Also, 'the
gates were open throughout the replay o f this ill-fated semi-final at Old Trafford on 7 May 1989.              j

Reduced Numbers
   313. In the assessment o f figures for capacity, the criteria in C hapter 16 o f the Green G uide were not at
Hillsborough, and may not elsewhere, have been applied with sufficient rigour. Therefore, in addition to
rem inding and enjoining local authorities and clubs to m ake all necessary deductions when assessing the
figure for m ax im u m capacity in accordance with the Green Guide, I recommend reducing that figure by a
further 15% as an interim measure.


Safety Certificate
  314. T he Safety Certificate procedure should, if it is properly adm inistered and enforced, go far towards
achieving crowd safety. W hether it succeeds depends upon the vigilance and com m itm ent o f the local
authority issuing the Certificate. I do not know w hether the poor performance o f the local authority at
Hillsborough was typical. Arguments have been put to me suggesting the need for some national oversight or
inspection o f local authority certification procedures. This raises complex issues which I shall want to consider
further at stage two o f the Inquiry. For the present, I make recom m endations as to the content of Safety
Certificates and arrangem ents for issuing, monitoring, enforcing, reviewing, am ending and renewing them.




                                                         56
                                CHAPTER 24 - T H E RECOMMENDATIONS

   315. The recom m endations which follow are the m inim um necessary to ensure that existing football
grounds can for the present be safely used, based upon the evidence which I have heard at Sheffield and other
inform ation I have received. T hey com plem ent the recom m endations which M r Justice Popplewell set out
after his inquiry at Bradford.

   316. Those which are asterisked should be carried out before the 1989/90 season starts. The rest should be
started forthw ith and com pleted as soon as possible.

Maximum Capacities for Terraces
★     1. Where a viewing terrace is divided into pens or areas which are self-contained, the Safety Certificate
    should specify the maximum number of spectators to be admitted to each such pen or area.

    A pen or area is to be deemed “self-contained” notwithstanding that it has a gate or gates affording access to
    another pen or area and whether such gate or gates be open or shut.

★    2. Each figure for maximum capacity should be assessed in accordance with Chapter 16 of the Green
    Guide (“the Green Guide figure”) subject to the following qualifications:-

    (a) in arriving at “the Green Guide figure”, proper and realistic allowance must be made for all factors
        which should reduce the permissible density in accordance with the range of maximum figures specified
        in paragraphs 221 and 222 of the Green Guide;

    (b) after assessing “the Green Guide figure”, a deduction of 15% should be made to improve the safety
        margin.

★    3. Arrangements should be made:-

    (a) to limit the number of spectators entering each self-contained pen or area to the maximum capacity
        figure assessed in accordance with Recommendation 2 above either electronically, mechanically, by a
        ticketing arrangement, by counting or otherwise, and

    (b) to close off further access to such pen or area when its maximum capacity is about to be reached.


Filling and Monitoring Terraces
★     4. There should be a written agreement between the club and the police setting out their respective
    responsibilities for crowd safety and control and in particular for the filling of each self-contained pen or
    other terraced area and the monitoring of spectators in each such pen or area to avoid overcrowding. Any
    variation of the agreement in respect of an individual match should be agreed in writing in advance.

★     5. At each match, there should be on the perimeter track, for each self-contained pen or other terraced
    area, a steward (if the club is monitoring that area) or a police officer (if the police are monitoring it) whose
    sole duty is to check crowd conditions in that area for possible overcrowding or distress throughout the
    period the area is occupied by spectators. Whoever is so appointed should be in addition to any other steward
    or police presence. He should have ready access to the police officer authorised under Recommendation 9
    below, and by radio to the control room.


Fences and Gates
       6.    All police officers and stewards with duties in relation to the terraced areas and especially those with
    duties under Recommendation 5 above, should be fully briefed and trained with regard to the recognition of
    crowd densities, to the recognition of signs of distress and to crowd dynamics. Training should include
    demonstrations at the ground and photographs, designed to enable stewards and officers to recognise
    different crowd densities.

★     7. All gates in radial or perimeter fences of pens or other self-contained areas should be painted in a
    different colour from the rest of the fence and marked “Emergency Exit”.



                                                         57
★    8. Where there are perimeter fences, all gates to the pitch should be kept fully open during the period
    when spectators are on the terrace.

★     9. There should be in respect of each gate in a perimeter fence (or group of gates if they are close together)
    a police officer authorised to decide whether or not to allow spectators through a gate to relieve overcrowding.    ,
    The officer so authorised in respect of each gate should be identified for each match and known to be so by all     j
    stewards and police officers in that vicinity. He should be able to make radio contact with the control room
    either himself or via an officer close at hand.

★     10. Suitable and sufficient cutting equipment should be provided by the club at each ground where there
    are perimeter fences to permit the immediate removal of enough fencing to release numbers of spectators if
    necessary. Agreement should be reached as to whether the equipment should be used by police, the fire
    brigade or stewards. Whoever is to use it should be trained to do so. Whether to use it should be a decision of a
    nominated senior police officer at the ground.


Crush Barriers
★     11. All crush barriers should be visually inspecte d immediately for signs of corrosion. Any barrier found
    to be affected by a significant degree of corrosion should be repaired or replaced.

★     12. The layout of barriers in each pen or terrace. i, ea should be reviewed immediately to ensure that it
    complies with the criteria contained in Chapter 9 o. iie Green Guide. If it does not, the assessment of the
    maximum capacity figure for that pen or terraced an i, in accordance with Recommendation 2 above, should
    reflect the fact.


Safety Certificates
      13. There should be an immediate review of eac Safety Certificate by the responsible local authority,
    which should consult the club in respect of which the Certificate is issued, the police, the fire service, the
    ambulance service and the building authority. Such i review should include an inspection of the stadium. Its
    object should be to ensure that the operative condi-ions of the Certificate are complied with and to add or
    substitute any condition shown to be necessary as a matter of urgency following the findings and
    recommendations in this report.

      14. Any local authority within whose area there ex ists a sports stadium designated under the 1975 Act for
    which no Safety Certificate has yet been issued should proceed forthwith to remedy the situation.

      15. Every Safety Certificate should be reviewed by the local authority at least once annually and each
    Certificate should require to be renewed annually.


       16. Each local authority should review its arrangements for issuing, monitoring, enforcing, reviewing,
    amending and renewing Safety Certificates. Such review should require that there exists or is provided an
    accountable administrative structure whereby the functions of the local authority are regularly and
    effectively supervised by senior officers and electeci members and decisions are properly taken in accordance
    with the local authority’s rules.

       17. To assist the local authority in exercising its functions, it should set up an Advisory Group consisting
    of appropriate members of its own staff, representatives of the police, of the fire and ambulance services, of
    the building authority, of the club and of a recognised supporters’ club. The Advisory Group’s terms of
    reference should encompass all matters concerned with crowd safety and should require regular visits to the
    ground and attendance at matches. The Advisory Group should have a chairman from the local authority,
    and an effective procedure. Its resolutions should be recorded and it should be required to produce regular
    written reports for consideration by the local authority.


Duties of each Football Club
★     18. Each turnstile should be inspected and its potential rate of flow measured. Thereafter, regular
    inspections should be made to ensure that each turnstile remains capable of admitting spectators at the rate
    anticipated.



                                                         58
★     19. The correlation between each viewing area in the stadium and the turnstiles serving it should be such
    as to ensure that all the spectators intended to be admitted to that viewing area can pass through the
    turnstiles within one hour. If that cannot be done, the capacity of that viewing area should be reduced
    accordingly.

★     20. Turnstiles should be closed when the permitted capacity of the area served by them is about to be
    reached and arrangements should be made to ensure quick and effective communication with turnstile
    operators for this purpose.

      21.    Closed circuit television should be so installed as to enable crowd densities outside the ground, within
    concourse areas and in pens and other standing areas, to be monitored before and throughout a match.

★     22. All signposting for spectators both outside and inside the ground should be comprehensively
    reviewed. It should, in relation to the arrangements for each match, be unambiguous, eye-catching, simple
    and clear and should be designed to ensure the rapid movement of spectators to their appropriate viewing
    area.

★     23. Information on tickets should be unambiguous, simple and clear and should correlate absolutely with
    the information provided in respect of each match both outside and inside the ground. Retained ticket stubs
    should contain information necessary to guide spectators once inside the ground.

★    24. Information on tickets requesting spectar -rs to be in position by a particular time should be reviewed
    by clubs in conjunction with the police to ensure that it corresponds with the planned arrangements for
    admitting spectators to the ground.

      25. Each club should consult with a recognised supporters’ club as to the provision of pre-match
    entertainment aimed at attracting spectators to ti e ground in good time.


Police Planning
★     26. The Chief Constable of each police fore .n whose area there is one designated stadium or more
    should nominate a chief officer to liaise with         management of each football club and local authority
    concerned in respect of the safety and control of ci jwds.

★      27. The Operational Order for each match at a designated stadium and the pre-match briefing of all
    officers on duty there should alert such officers to the importance of preventing any overcrowding and, if any
    is detected, of taking appropriate steps to remedy it.

★    28. The Operational Order for each match at a designated stadium should enable the police to cope with
    any foreseeable pattern in the arrival of spectators at a match and in their departure. It should provide for
    sufficient reserves to enable rapid deployment of officers to be made at any point inside or outside the ground.

★    29. The option to postpone kick-off shouM be in the discretion of the officer in command at the ground.
    Crowd safety should be the paramount consideration in deciding whether to exercise it.

       30.     There should be available in the police control room the results of all closed circuit television
    monitoring outside and inside the ground and the record of any electronic or mechanical counting of numbers
    at turnstiles or of numbers admitted to any area of the ground. Officers in the control room should be skilled
    in the interpretation and use of these data.


Communications
      31.     There should be sufficient operators in the police control room to enable all radio transmissions to be
    received, evaluated and answered. The radio system should be such as to give operators in the control room
    priority over, and the capacity to override, others using the same channel. Additional channels should be
    used, where necessary, to prevent overcrowding of the airwaves. Consideration should be given to
    sound-proofing the control room against excessive crowd noise.




                                                         59
       32. To complement radio communications, there should be a completely separate system of land lines
     with telephone links between the control room and key points at the ground.

       33. Within the control room, there should be a public address system to communicate with individual
     areas outside and inside the ground, with groups of areas or with the whole ground. Important
     announcements should be preceded by a loud signal to catch the attention of the crowd despite a high level of
     noise in the ground. This arrangement should be prominently advertised on every programme sold for every
     match.

       34. Use should be made where possible of illuminated advertising boards to address the crowd.
     Consideration should also be given to the use by police officers of a simple code of hand signals to indicate to
     the control room the existence of certain emergencies or requirements.


Co-ordination of Emergency Services
★       35. The police, fire and ambulance services should maintain through senior nominated officers regular
     liaison concerning crowd safety at each stadium.

★      36. Before each match at a designated stadium, the police should ensure that the fire service and
     ambulance service are given full details about the event, including its venue, its timing, the number of
     spectators expected, their likely routes of entry and exit, and any anticipated or potential difficulties
     concerning the control or movement of the crowd. Such details should be readily available in the control
     rooms of each of the emergency services.

★      37. Contingency plans for the arrival at each designated stadium of emergency vehicles from all three
     services should be reviewed. They should include routes of access, rendezvous points, and accessibility
     within the ground itself.

★      38. Police officers posted at the entrances to the ground should be briefed as to the contingency plans for
     the arrival of emergency services and should be informed when such services are called as to where and why
     they are required.


First Aid, Medical Facilities and Ambulances
★      39. There should be at each stadium at each match at least one trained first aider per 1,000 spectators.The
     club should have the responsibility for securing such attendance.

       40. There should be at each stadium one or more first aid rooms. The number of such rooms and the
     equipment to be maintained'within them should be specified by the local authority after taking professional
     medical advice and should be made a requirement of any Safety Certificate.

•k     41. The club should employ a medical practitioner to be present at each match and available to deal with
     any medical exigency at the ground. He should be trained and competent in advanced first aid. He should be
     present at the ground at least an hour before kick-off and should remain until half an hour after the end of the
     match. H is whereabouts should be known to those in the police control room and he should be immediately
     contactable.

★      42. At least one fully equipped ambulance from the appropriate ambulance authority should be in
     attendance at all matches with an expected crowd of 5,000 or more.

       43. The number of ambulances to be in attendance for matches where larger crowds are expected should
     be specified by the local authority after consultation with the ambulance service and should be made a
     requirement of the Safety Certificate.

                                         SPECIFIC INCIDENTS

Hicks’ Evidence
  M r and Mrs Hicks’ two daughters died in the disaster. They had arrived early en famille but had tickets
lifferent sections. The two daughters had standing tickets; they went into pen 3. Mrs Hicks had a seat in the
 h stand. M r Hicks took up a standing position in pen 1just below and to the west o f the police box at about
■ pm From there, he had a view o f the centre pens. He kept an eye on them as they filled up since he knew his
ghters to be there.                                                                                                    I
  His evidence was that by 2.50 pm he could see people were in distress. At about 2.55 pm he and others
:d to a senior police officer at the top o f the steps to the control box to draw his attention to the crushing. M r
ks was only about 10 feet from the officer. He described him as wearing a flat cap with gold or silver braid
a light coloured anorak. M r Hicks believed he was the officer who stopped the match. M r Greenwood, who
stop the match, was certainly not wearing a light coloured anorak, as can clearly be seen on the video.

. M r Hicks says that he and others shouted several times to this officer in attem pts to alert him to the
ress i the pens. There was no reaction although M r Hicks believes the officer must have been in earshot.

. T hat officer descended from the steps and two cam eram en whom M r Hicks believed were from
v ir~ n cam e and appeared to direct their cam eras towards the pens. A nother senior officer appeared two
>s c - ./n from the platform. He was a stocky figure; he also wore a flat cap but with black braid. M r Hicks
>that he and two or three others tried several tim es to capture this officer’s attention w ithout success. Then
Hicks says he shouted “For Christ’s sake! Can’t you see what’s going on? We can, and you have cam eras”. The
cer is said to have replied dismissively “Shut your fucking prattle” .

. W hen the disaste ' occurr i the two Hicks girls were crushed. Victoria was put in an am bulance and M r
ks accom panied he -o hosr tal where she was found to be dead. Sarah died at the ground.

. M r Hicks was an i npres^ive witness and, despite his grievous loss, remarkably stoical. He gave his
ience clearly and with out rancour. He was certainly m istaken about M r Greenwood being one o f those on
 steps and it has not been possible to identify either officer from M r Hicks’ descriptions. He may well also
 e been imprecise as to timings. Nevertheless, I see no reason to doubt that what he described did occur in
ition to two office? s. As M r Hicks generously said himself, the dismissive abuse from the second officer
hough reprehensible) may have been due to his being preoccupied with trying to see w hat was happening at
is 3 and 4 around kick-off time.

j Goalkeeper and Gate 4
 . M r Barnbrock, a Liverpool supporter, said he went through the tunnel. He would have liked to have
ned back when he saw how crowded the pens were. He went with his father and 13 year old brother Stephen
'ards the front o f pen 4. H e saw the team s com e onto the pitch. Conditions at the front were, he said, alright
 il; ut 2 minutes to 3. Then the pressure in the pen increased and he and his father becam e separated. His
t came off the ground. He shouted to police officers through the fence to get them out and help them . The
ice did not react. T he Liverpool goalkeeper, Bruce Grobbelaar, spoke to a policeman on the track. The gate
s then opened by a blonde policewoman and about 25 to 30 people went through it. They included the
ness’s father and his brother Stephen who had a broken arm. A police Constable shut the gate. It was then
pened by the same policewoman, the witness thought, and he got out.

5. M r Eccleston, a male nurse and an impressive witness, was sitting in the north stand. He noticed pens 3
i 4 were full and realised som ething was wrong when fans started coming over the p erim eter fence but did
: invade the pitch. H e said the Liverpool goalkeeper appeared to notice this too.

). M r G robbelaar was out o f the country d uring the Inquiry and was therefore not called. However, he
de a statem ent which was put in as his evidence. In the course o f it he said:-

‘Kick-off happened and we got into our stride pretty quickly - we forced a corner pretty early on and the ball
:ame down to my end - I rolled it out to the full back once and play went on until Peter Beardsley hit the
:rossbar o f the N ottingham Forest goal from a co rn er and cam e back into play. I re m em ber just after that
here were shouts and screams from the crowd just behind me, it was different; not the ordinary crowd noise
ind I tu rn ed around to look. W hat am azed m e first was the concentration and squash o f fans in the centre



                                                       63
section, the end areas still had plenty of space. It was only then I became conscious th at the crowd was
squashing forward and wasn’t able to go sideways an d th a t’s when I noticed the fencing alongside them
holding them in. I saw fans being pulled up into the stand above the terraces, I saw fans climbing over into the
em pty areas at the side and I saw fans climbing out over the front onto the pitch which was particularly
difficult because o f the spikes on the top o f the fencing but they were getting out.
   “Play was still going on and I was in a terrible position trying to concentrate on play and having my
attention taken by what was happening behind me. The ball came down to our end and N ottingham Forest
won a corner, it was taken and we cleared our box area and as play was going forward over the centre line I
heard a shout, ‘Bruce - please help’ - a desperate shout from a fan squashed up against the fencing to the
right o f my goal as I looked at Leppings Lane terraces. He screamed, ‘Please get the fucking gate open - Help,
help’. All the people who could speak were pleading for help. There were two policemen near the gate right
alongside the fan who had shouted to me and so I shouted to them, ‘Get the gate open’. I was still trying to
concentrate on play and was still having my attention taken by what was happening behind me - there were
lots o f fans on the pitch behind the goal area by them too. I called again to the policemen, ‘O pen the fucking
gate’ and one just turned away from me and looked back at the crowd but the other went to the gate and
opened it and it was like taking the top off a shaken coke bottle - people were everywhere on the play area
around my goal. Play was still going on and it cam e down towards me again for the left hand corner. It was
a N ottingham Forest throw-in, away to my left, the ball was out o f play and a fan came up to me on the
pitch and said, ‘Bruce, they’re killing us’. I said ‘W ho’s killing you?’, and he said ‘They’re crushing us-our
fans’. I said ‘Go and get some help’, and then a policem an came on and spoke to this fan. I don’t know
who the fan was, and then he led him off. It was about this tim e I saw a policeman running onto the pitch
from my right across my box and to the referee who blew up, recovered the ball and told all players to clear
the pitch.”
   10. It is Clear from the video th at M r G robbelaar’s recollection o f the sequence o f events, even with regard
to the game, is inaccurate in a n u m b er o f respects. For example, the two N ottingham Forest corner kicks
occurred m inutes before Beardsley struck the bar. Further, it seems highly probable from other evidence that
gates 3 and 4 were open continuously well before M r G robbelaar says the fan asked him to get the gate open. It
seems surprising too that with all the noise M r G robbelaar would hear the precise words o f an individual fan,
let alone respond twice to them , whilst the game was in progress.
   11. As to M r B arnbrock’s account, the evidence o f PC Fiona R ichardson was that she was the only
policew oman on the track in the early stages although others came from the seated area as the incident
developed. P C R ichardson began at gate 1 and, although she did go and help people out through gate 3, she
did not go to gate 4, and did not open it twice or even once. The two officers who spoke o f opening gate 4 were
both male.
    12. I think M r G robbelaar did become conscious o f distress in the crowd behind him and did speak to a
police officer at som e stage, probably earlier th an he now thinks. N ot to reach that broad conclusion would
involve attributing his whole account to invention or fantasy and I see no grounds for doing so. However, his
detailed account was not tested in cross-examination an d its inconsistencies and errors when com pared with
o th er incontrovertible evidence would make it unsafe to derive more than the broad conclusion stated above.
T he incident shows how honest witnesses can becom e confused and their evidence flawed when recollecting
events experienced under tension o r emotion.
   13. As to the opening of gate 4 there was an apparent conflict o f evidence. PC Illingworth said that about
five m inutes to 3 he opened it and guided fans emerging through it to gate 5. PC Hooson said th a t it was he
who opened gate 4 ju st before kick-off. I am satisfied from the evidence o f a nu m b er o f fans that, like gate 3,
gate 4 was opened m ore than once. The probability is, therefore, th at whilst PC Illingworth was shepherding
fans to gate 5, gate 4 had been closed again until it was re-opened by PC H ooson two or three m inutes later.
Oxygen
   14. It was alleged by a doctor th a t an oxygen cylinder provided to him on the pitch was empty. D r Phillips, a
Liverpool supporter, had been in pen 3 with his b ro th e r and others. He cam e u n d e r pressure and climbed into
pen 2. W hen the disaster occurred and gate 2 was opened, he went through it, injuring his head as he did so. He
cam e onto the pitch sometime after 3.10 pm an d started resuscitation procedures. He was given an oxygen
cylinder. He believes this was from St John A m bulance. It was, he thought, too early to be the fire service. T he
cylinder was switched on but D r Phillips says it gave no oxygen since it was empty. There was one oxygen
cylinder on the St Jo h n ’s am bulance which cam e to the scene. M r Wells, the D ivisional Superintendent o f St
John, took th at cylinder onto the pitch. He said it was effective. In particular, he recalls going to a patient being
treated by D r Phillips and says that oxygen was flowing into that patient. Moreover, M r Wells tested the
cylinder afterwards and found it was still h alf full. It has a capacity that will last for 5 hours 40 m inutes on a
high setting.


                                                         64
   15. There was evidence from Assistant Chief Fire Officer Hornsby that a M axam an resuscitator had failed
to work properly. It was delivering an oxygen flow appropriate to a “child” setting rather th an a full “adult”
flow. On exam ination, it was found that a retaining nut in the control knob had worked loose, possibly due to
vibration in transit, and this had affected the flow o f oxygen. The device had last been tested on 10 April 1989.
  16. I accept the evidence o f M r Wells that the St John Ambulance cylinder was charged with oxygen and
working properly. In my view, D r Phillips may have been mistaken as to the cylinder o f which he complains
being empty. He agreed he was u n d e r great pressure, in an awkward situation; his head was injured and he
became very angry at what he regarded then as wholly the fault o f the police. He conceded that if the cylinder
was not em pty there was a possible alternative - that the master tank top valve was shut. It seems unlikely that
he could have been referring to the fire service resuscitator as he was clear that the bottle he received was a
simple piece o f equipm ent not designed to breathe for the patient but merely to supply oxygen.
  17. I conclude that on a balance o f probabilities the evidence does not justify a finding that an empty
cylinder was brought to the scene.
Calling the Fire Service
   18. PC B ichard’s call to police H eadquarters at 3.13 pm for the fire service to bring hydraulic cutting
equipm ent to cut metal fences (see paragraph 101 supra) was heard by C hief Inspector Edm undson. He went
into the adjacent operations room to give instructions for the message to be passed to the fire service. There, a
tem porary control room assistant was already speaking to the fire service about a house fire. M r E dm undson
interrupted the call and asked the assistant to tell the fire service that cutting equipm ent was wanted at
Hillsborough. There followed a conversation between the assistant and Miss Davies at the fire service in the
following terms:-
  Police         Can we have cutting gear for Hillsborough, please - straight away?
  Fire Control   Just a m inute. Right - what’s the address?
  Police         C utting e q u ip m e n t for Hillsborough football ground - straight away.
  Fire Control   Hillsborough football ground?
  Police         Yes, Hillsborough football ground.
  Fire Control   W hat road is th a t on? D o you know?
  Police         There has been a m a jo r accident, all the ambulances are up there.
  Fire Control   W hat road is it on?
  Police         I have no idea; Hillsborough football ground.
  Fire Control   W hat road is it on? D o you know?
  Police         “Hillsborough football ground - what road is it on?” (this was said to som eone in Police
                 Force Control) - “Penistone R oad” (to Fire Control).
  Fire Control   Penistone R oad.
  Police         Penistone R oad, OK.
  Fire Control   Penistone R oad, ju st a m inute - w hat’s exactly involved?
  Police         It’s football, a big m atch, Liverpool v Notts Forest.
  Fire Control   Yes, but why do you want us; you said it was an RTA [Road Traffic Accident],
  Police         No, no, no; m a jo r incident inside the ground.
  Fire Control   M ajor incident inside - do you know exactly what it is?
  Police         No, I d o n ’t; they want all the cutting gear.
  Fire Control   For what - do you know?
  Police         Hang on a sec.
  At that poinl : C h ief Inspector E dm undson intervened and spoke for the police. The conversation
concluded;-
  Police         (Male voice) - Hello!



                                                          65
  Fire Control    Hello! Now you wnt some cutting gear - what exactly is it for?

  Police          There has been a major accident at Hillsborough football ground where the semi-final is;
                  the crowds have forced their way in, they have broken fences and gates down. I d on’t know
                  exactly what it is but there are people trapped.

  Fire Control    Right! O K - leave it with us.

  That conversation took I m inute 13 seconds. It was published in a num ber o f newspapers with strong
critical com m ent mostly against the fire service. The thrust o f the criticism was that valuable tim e was wasted
by the fire service asking unnecessary questions as to where and why cutting equipm ent was required.

   19. There was a meeting o f the emergency services in August 1988 to discuss procedure in the event o f a
m ajor disaster at Sheffield W ednesday’s ground. It was pointed out an d m inuted that “It was imperative that
the Police Control give the exact location o f any fire or incident and as m uch detail as possible. N o senior fire
officer is on duty at the match. . . Fire service will attend via Penistone R oad or Leppings Lane as directed by
the police.”

   20. The message from PC Bichard contained all the necessary inform ation - Leppings Lane end, hydraulic
cutting equipm ent, to cut metal fences. Regrettably, it was not passed on by Headquarters in those terms. Miss
Davies had rightly been trained to require a precise location a n d needed to know the problem which would face
the fire service so th at the app ropriate response could be made. In fact, there are several football grounds in the
Hillsborough district although clearly Sheffield W ednesday’s ground is the principal one. In the result,
although C hief Inspector E dm undson clarified, to an extent, the nature o f the problem, the locus which
emerged in the course o f the conversation (Penistone Road) was not th at contained in the original message
from ground control (ie “Leppings Lane end.”) Whilst on the face o f the conversation the fire service may seem
to have been slow in the uptake or perhaps pedantic, in my view the police ought to have been more specific.
They had the necessary inform ation to be so.

  21. I am satisfied, however, th a t the delay o f 1 m inute 13 seconds over the call, and even the delay
occasioned by the cutting e q u ip m en t going to Penistone Road rather th a n Leppings Lane, did not affect the
outcome. Even h a d those with cutting equipm ent gone directly after a briefer ’phone call they would not have
arrived at a stage early enough to make cutting the fencing a helpful exercise.

Mr Kenny Dalglish
  22. W hen the Liverpool m anager went to the control room a n d agreed to make the announcem en t
broadcast a t 3.56 pm, he says in a statem ent th a t he could n o t get the Tannoy to work. Spectators could see
him trying to address them a n d indicated to him manually that nothing could be heard. An officer pressed
buttons on the m achine and M r Dalglish says he tried again with sim ilar lack o f success. He was then taken
under the police box to the room used by the disc jockey to broadcast pre-m atch music. There, the m icrophone
worked and he broadcast his message.

   23. M r Dalglish was not called. There was no other evidence abo ut this incident. I accept it occurred as he
described. W hy the Tannoy could not at th at tim e be successfully operated from the police box is, however,
strange and unexplained. U nlike the radio, it had operated satisfactorily from the police box at the critical
tim es save th a t its messages may not always have been heard above the prevailing noise. It had worked at about
3.30 pm when it called for medical staff. I can see no grounds for criticising the police in regard to this incident
a n d certain it is th a t the brief delay in relaying M r Dalglish’s message can have had no significant effect.

 Recommendations
    1. Evacuation procedures should be a m atter o f police training and form p a rt o f the briefing by police
 officers before a football m atch (Paragraph 3 .9 ).

   2. T he local authority team responsible fo r issuing safety certificates in respect of designated g rou nds

Provisional Recommendations (T o be reviewed in the Final R eport)
    1. I am m inded to recommend th a t in England and Wales the police should be given the unfettered right
o f search before entry to football grounds by statute. (Paragraph 3.41)

   2. I am m inded to recommend th at Section 10 o f the Fire Precautions A c t 1971 should be am ended with
a view to giving the Fire A uthority pow er in cases other than those which are regarded as wholly exceptional.
(Paragraph 3.61)

    3. Linked with the above, I am minded to recommend that consideration should be given to introducing
legislation giving powers fo r the Fire A uthority to apply to the High Court fo r an injunction (or to the Court
o f Session fo r an interdict in Scotland) under Section 10 o f the Fire Precautions A c t 1971. (Paragraph 3.61)

   4. I am m inded to recommend that Section 10 o f the S a fe ty at Sports Grounds A c t 1975 should be
am ended in like m an ner to Section 10 o f the Fire Precautions A ct 1971 (see Provisional R ecom m endations
2 and 3) an d a n application to the High C o u rt for an injunction (or to the C ourt o f Session for an interdict
in Scotland) should be an alternative remedy. (Paragraph 3.76)

spdrts grounds, whatever their size, to include indoor as well as outdoor activities. (Paragraphs 3.145)

my to go to Rotherham District General Hospital, where they were expecting
casualties from the Hillsborough incident to be taken, and liaise with the
hospital staff, etc. I immediately changed into my uniform and went to
Rotherham Ambulance Station where I commandeered a Standards & Efficiency
staff car, for radio contact, and travelled to the Rotherham District
General Hospital casualty ambulance parking area, I parked at the side of
a police traffic car and established contact with the crew.  I called
Control on channel two of the car radio and informed them of my arrival. I
also asked which channel I was to operate on and was told to stay on
channel two. I then introduced myself to the casualty Sister, and informed
them where they could contact me, I stopped outside within earshot of the
car radio and liaising with the traffic car crew. Within minutes another
police car arrived and the crew man introduced himself to me as P.C.
       ~|, and he established contact on a direct line, within the hospital
(ext. 316), with his forces casualty bureaux. At 1926
telephoned from the Royal Hallamshire Hospital and informed us that there
would not be any patients transported to the Rotherham District General and
that we could stand down.

I returned to Rotherham Ambulance Station and contacted Control by
landline, and it was suggested I return to Control, which I did. I must
add that at no time did an ambulance bring any casualties from Hillsborough
to Rotherham District General, although a man named                  aged
52, of                               believed to be a Steward at the
ground, came in at 1811 by relatives car, suffering from shock, and was
treated and released.

We    had    just    dropped    a patient         off at    the Northern          General Hospital          for
admission.          We heard on a radio inside the hospital that the match had been
stopped.       We returned to our vehicle and prepared to call but the air space
was     busy    with       details   being    given        to    another     vehicle,       regarding       the
Hillsborough          incident.       Once    the    radio       messages      were       passed    I    called
'Green'.        We were       instructed     to go     to the Hillsborough Football                     Ground,
Gymnasium Entrance on Penistone Road.


We proceeded 'Red'.            As we proceeded I heard the controller ask vehicles to
become 'Green' as soon as possible.                       A Police Officer directed us down to
Herries Road and when we got to the roundabout another Police Officer was
directing us down Leppings Lane.                    Although we were conscious of the fact
that we should be going to Penistone Road Gymnasium Entrance, he was very
insistent that we go to Leppings Lane.                          As the Officer was indicating to
Leppings Lane and as far as I am aware was saying "it's all down there" and
due to the fact that Penistone Road was severely congested, we carried on
to Leppings Lane.


As we       arrived    in Leppings      Lane,      I observed         two    fire    appliances and         two
Ambulances parked.             I heard at some point Control state this was a Major
Incident       and    we    should   tune    to    ERC.         We   tuned   to     ERC   and   experienced
problems from crackling on the radio.                     We assumed a position at the rear of
the   line of Ambulances.             I got out of              the vehicle and at          this time was
still unaware of what the incident involved.


                                                                                                   /continued

    I went to speak to the other Ambulance staff present, who were Ambulanceman

*                , Ambulanceman            :            and       Ambulanceman                 .      They    were     all
    working     on     individual       patients.            I    tried        to ascertain exactly what               had
    happened but they were unsure.                     I then, although I had already seen bodies
    on the floor near the Ambulances,                        started to check for signs of life.                             I
    checked two male patients as indicated on my first journey plan and could
    find no     signs of        life.          I told a Police Officer                  that in my opinion the
    patients were dead.              At this time dozens of people were shouting, some for
    help, others were saying,                  "Get something done" and I was able to cope with
    the situation at this time.


    I then saw three more bodies as indicated, I went and checked these out and
    I could      find no signs of              life.     I again told Police Officers                        that these
    patients were dead.               I ran back         to my Ambulance,               picked up the portable
    radio      and    Portogen       and       told    Ambulanceman                     that    it    was    a    serious
    incident         and   I   was    going       further          in     to    check    on    the    situation         (as
    indicated).            Ambulanceman                 stayed          with     the    vehicle.        I    then      went
    towards 'C' Gate and on approaching it, I recall at or near that location,
    three bodies laying close to Gate 'C'.                              I again checked them out for signs
    of life and found none.


    I   then    moved      forward      towards        the       West    Stand     Tunnel      entrance      which      was
    congested, I was grabbed by a Policewoman who said, "I've got one here who
    is not breathing".               I saw two bodies near                 the entrance to           the West Stand,
    but went with the Police to a further body to the right of the                                          entrance to
    the West         Stand.     I found         this body          also    had no      signs   of    life,       but   the
    Police Officer could not be informed as she had disappeared.




                                                                                                             /continued

So at this stage I called Control about 3 times, but got no response, with
a view to requesting the attendance of a Senior Officer, whilst I was on
the radio         I was heading towards            the two bodies originally seen near        the
tunnel but not checked.             I checked one and found no signs of life the other
one   a male        about   20 years,       cyanosed,   dilated     pupils but with a carotid
pulse.        I    instructed     two     Police   Officers   and   a civilian    to carry   this
patient down towards the Ambulances.                  I was being jostled by anxious people
whom I tried to collate into one area.


People were wandering from the West Stand tunnel to 'C' gate in a dazed and
shocked condition.               I went    towards    and entered    the West    Stand tunnel,   I
honestly feared for my own safety and although I saw some bodies on the
floor    of       the   tunnel   I retreated       because of     the volume    of people   coming

towards me.


I then returned towards the Ambulances.                   This area was congested with many
agitated people.            I saw at least two people getting very aggressive towards
the uniformed staff there.                 One person had to be physically removed by two
Police Officers.            As I approached my Ambulance,            I could see at least two
bodies    (as      indicated).       There were also many shocked people sitting near
the Ambulances.             I then went over to my colleague who was attending to the
patient I had sent down from the tunnel area.                       We removed a eot from our
vehicle and loaded him on.                 The condition of our patient was critical and
we decided to move off immediately to hospital.


I attempted         to contact      Control via ERC,       I am not sure if my message was
received but I asked if there was a designated hospital and after no reply
I switched to Channel 2.




                                                                                       /continued

I explained reference lack of contact via ERC and asked which hospital I
was    to go to and explained that my patient was in respiratory arrest and
that    two    vehicles    had    just     left    for    the Northern         General with        critical
cases   on board so           I felt     it necessary          to go    the the Royal Hallamshire.
Control agreed and said the Hallamshire would be informed.


I arrived at the Royal Hallamshire at 1540 hours, I said to a nurse "You
know we       have    a major     incident        on"    and    she    replied     "Yes,   we   have    been
informed".       I     then     informed     the    Charge       Nurse      that   they    could     expect
appreciable numbers of dead and injured, I noted at this time they were not
prepared for a Major Incident.


We    returned       to our vehicle        and     set off      towards      Hillsborough,      we   called
Control and informed them we were returning towards Hillsborough, we were
instructed to carry on.                I noted that we were now receiving ERC without any
problem.       We made our way back to the Penistone Road Gymnasium entrance.
Penistone Road was heavily congested with Service vehicles and we were met
by Mr Dale.          He explained what was happening in relation to vehicles moving
casualties and the nature of the incident and told us to stay where we were
on the main road.             We told him this was our second visit to the scene and
was he aware of the amount of casualties and bodies at Leppings Lane?                                       He
replied "Have you seen the bodies round here" and pointed to the area of
the Gymnasium.          Mr Dale waved a vehicle out of the Gymnasium entrance and
directed us to reverse in which we did.


I got out of          the vehicle with my attendant and went                       to the rear of our
vehicle.        I did     not    leave    the vehicle          unattended.         I noticed    something
happening at         the rear of        the vehicle       that I had parked at              the side of,
which    was    three    or     four    people     trying      to     get   into   that    vehicle     in   an
aggiatated state.
                                                                                                /continued

It was only at this time that I saw Mr Hopkins, he asked what was happening
and I replied that I did not know what they were up to and pushed them out
of the way to gain entry to the Ambulance and told them to go away and let
us get on with our job.


On opening   the rear     doors   I saw two    civilians   attempting CPR on a male
casualty.    I asked who they were and he replied "I'm a doctor and he is a
first aider".       I told them to carry on.     It was at this time we realised we
had a problem because the driver of this vehicle was missing.           It was then
that Mr Morley said "transfer this patient to your vehicle".          Before we had
a chance to move the casualty, the driver appeared and took the patient to
hospital.


Mr Hopkins came across and said stay with your vehicle, my attendant was
administering to the walking wounded.           Someone then requested a stretcher
for a patient that was on the pitch.          Mr Higgins appeared and requested our
scoop stretcher.       A patient appeared from somewhere on one of our cots, so
we took one of ours out and put him in.           As this patient was in a serious
condition we loaded some walking wounded with him and proceeded to leave to
the Northern General Hospital.


Comments were passed by staff at the Northern General that they were full
and would    like    casualties   to go   to other   hospitals.   We discharged our
patients and returned towards the Football Ground.          We proceeded back
towards the Leppings Lane end, from where we were re-directed by ACMAO
Jones to the Penistone Road entrance.         We were about third in line on our
arrival and waited until we had loaded our patients off the road, the
patient was on a cot and accompanied by a doctor.          The doctor was satisfied
that the patient was stable so we waited for further casualties.


                                                                         /continued

When none arrived after several minutes the doctor was concerned for the
patient so we proceeded to the Royal Hallamshire, we went via Leppings Lane
escorted by 2 motor cycle policeman.   I did notice that some scuffles were
taking place between individuals during our travel along Leppings Lane.
When we had discharged our patient we went to Infirmary Road to stand-by
and contacted Control who after a further half an hour, returned us to
base.

   Dear
   HILLSBOROUGH SYMPOSIUM - 19 JUNE 1990               -------
  You will be aware that it is proposed to hold a symposium between
  representatives from Trent and Mersey RHAs to which you are formally invited.
  The main purpose is to consider the lessons for health care professionals
  arising from the Hillsborough disaster. The symposium will be held on
  Tuesday 19 June 1990 from 9.00 am - 4.15 pm at the Tytherington Club,
  Macclesfield. A programme is enclosed together with details and a map of the
  venue.
   The purpose of the symposium is to enable the experience gained by the two
   authorities in dealing with the tragedy and its aftermath to be shared; to
   highlight the lessons which have already been learnt; and to produce a report
   to the two regional health authorities.
  The programme will include presentations and discussions to highlight what
  worked well and identify areas of concern. In order to assist with the
  organisation on the day and the compilation of the final report presenters
  are asked to let me have a copy of their presentation in advance of the
  symposium.
   Please contact me if I can be of any further assistance.
  Yours sincerely

        DISTRICT HEALTH AUTHORITY PERSPECTIVE

        MERSEY PERSPECTIVE
        Many of the above were replicated on Merseyside despite having no
        consultation (in the early stages).
        Problem of the poor quality information reaching Mersey from S. Yorks

           Dear

           ENQUIRY BY LORD              JUSTICE TAYLOR -   INTERIM        REPORT HILLSBOROUGH
           STADIUM DISASTER

           I write to clarify the Scottish Ambulance Service position in
           regard to the recommendations contained in the interim report of
           the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster Inquiry following some negative
           responses from Scottish Football League Clubs.

           The Secretary of State has directed that appropriate bodies in
           Scotland should act without delay on the interim recommendations
           pending the longer term findings of the Inquiry's final report.
           I have carefully considered the full       implications for the
           Ambulance Service and have pursued the necessary action,      in
^ *        liaison with the Police and voluntary agencies, to ensure the
           Ambulance Service meets    its obligations with effect from the
           start of the football season.

           You   will   recall that the main thrust of        the   Report's
           recommendation was to ensure a professional    Ambulance Service
           presence which could immediately identify      potentially life-
           threatening or injurious situations and effect an immediate and
           appropriate paramedical response.   This entails more than merely
           the attendance of professional     ambulance crews.    Rather it
           includes the effective co-ordination of ambulance and first aid
           facilities,  the provision of on-site advanced treatment,     the
           maintenance of medical and paramedical communication on the
           ground and between the ground,ambulance control and the receiving
           hospitals.  To achieve this the presence of ambulance officers is
           necessary to closely liaise with the Police and club medical
           officer and in the event of a major incident ensure a fast back­
           up response and on-site paramedical command and control.

    Dear Mr Panton

    LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S REPORT - HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER


    I refer to your letter of the 12th March re the above.                                             I detail below
    my response which addresses;


     i)     Scottish Ambulance Service Operational Policy,

    ii)    comments / current deficiencies identified by Chief Ambulance

           Officers throughout Scotland.


    CO-ORDINATION OF EMERGENCY SERVICES


    Paragraph 59


    i)      Following the issue of Lord Taylor's interim report, the

           SMT concluded that discussions would take place between the

           SAS and the Regional Council's Safety at Sports Grounds

          Committees to examine the R e p o r t 's recommendations and their

          implementation.                  It was proposed that the Ambulance

          Service would be represented on "Safety at Sports Grounds

          Committees              (Assistant Chief Ambulance Officer - Operations,
                           A division of the COMMON SERVICES AGENCY of the Scottish Health Service
      attending).   The Chief Ambulance Officer's recommendations in

      terms of operational deployment at sports events would be

      integrated within the conditions of the Safety Certificate.        The

      Safety at Sports Grounds Committees provides a forum for detailed

      and ongoing liaison in respect of crowd safety at designated

      sports grounds.


ii)   Argyll & Clyde Area have indicated that it will be necessary to

      have amendments made to Regional / District Council standing

      orders to permit the inclusion of the Ambulance Service in any

      consultations regarding safety certificate requirements.


Paragraph 60

 i)   The Chief Constable will issue, prior to each sports event, a

      notification document detailing all relevant information in

      respect of location, date, time, anticipated attendance,

      recommended routes, police control telephone numbers etc.        The

      Scottish Ambulance Service produce, for each event, an

      Operational Order   (Appendix 1 ), which in addition to the police

      information, details the attendance category of the event, the

      Ambulance Service Officers and staff attending, and the cellular

      telephone number for the Mobile Ambulance Control Unit (M.A.C.U.)


ii)   Argyll & Clyde Area have identified a reluctance from some

      Divisions of Strathclyde Constabulary to notify the Ambulance

      Service, in w r i t i n g , of likely venues of sports events and likely

      numbers of spectators.
      Highlands & Western Isles Area have recommended that written

      notification of sports events should be passed to all Services no

      later than 14 days prior to the event.


Paragraph 61


Effective communications at such events is vital.     The Scottish

Ambulance Service communications network consists of —

 i)   UHF handsets are issued to all Officers,   Staff, Voluntary First

      Aid Group members and the Match Doctor on site.     These provide

      handset to handset personal communications;    handset to M.A.C.U.

      communications; a talk through facility, providing handset to

      Ambulance Base Control communications.


      The M.A.C.U. has a cellular telephone facility

      safeguarded by "ACCOLC" offering a secondary communications link

      to that provided by radio telephone.


      All officers, whether on or off duty, carry message pagers which

      provide early notification / mobilisation in the event of a Major

      Incident situation developing.


ii) There is a general view that the Ambulance Officer in attendance

      should be located within the Police Control Box, thus providing

      ongoing liaison communications facilities and access CCTV.     There

       is considerable reluctance from Constabularies to accept this

      concept.   Whilst some stadium Control Boxes are very small, where

      extension work is taking place, no consideration is being given

       to locating the Ambulance Officer within the Police Control Box.

      Where space will not allow location of the Ambulance Officer,
      consideration should be given to providing an Ambulance Service

      portable radio to the Senior Police Officer thus ensuring a

      direct communications link with the Ambulance Officer in

      attendance.


Paragraph 62


 i)   Historically contingency plans were developed for all sports

      stadium and these have been reviewed as a consequence of Lord

      Taylor's report. This review considered access / egress routes,

      rendezvous points, on site command points and accessibility

      within stadia.


ii)   It is vital to ensure that all Services Plan and Procedures are


       i)   compatible

      ii)   fully understood by all Service personnel


Paragraph 63


Police Responsibility.


FIRST AID, MEDICAL FACILITIES AND AMBULANCES


Paragraph 64


This is a club responsibility.


In terms of Voluntary First Aid Groups involvement,     liaison has taken

place with St Andrews Ambulance Association and their deployment,

operations and communications is co-ordinated by the Senior Ambulance

Officer in attendance.    The Scottish Ambulance Service have offered to
provide first aid input at Steward Training Sessions and a training

protocol has been drawn up.    The SED Circular should reflect this.


Paragraph 65


In its role as co-ordinator of on site first aid facilities, the

Scottish Ambulance Service has produced,   in consultation with a Senior

A & E Consultant, a specification document detailing the design and

layout of first aid rooms, and a recommended list of patient care

equipment to be held at these locations    (Appendix 2).   Compatibility

with equipment in use by the Scottish Ambulance Service is a prime

consideration.


Paragraph 66


 i)   This is a club responsibility.   The Senior Ambulance

      Officer present at events will contact the Duty Doctor and will

      maintain a close liaison throughout the event, a portable

      Ambulance Service handset will be issued to the Duty Doctor,

      providing a direct communications link to the Ambulance Officer

      on duty.


ii)   It has been identified within Fife, Lothian and Borders area that

      Duty Doctors are refusing to accept the offer of a portable

      Ambulance Service radio.   This is clearly unacceptable and SED

      Guidance should reflect the need for this vital communications

      link to be maintained.


      It is recommended that the Duty Doctor should be suitably

      identified by a H.V. waistcoat clearly marked on front and rear

      with "DOCTOR".
Paragraph 67 / 68


 i)    Following the issue of Lord Taylor's interim report the Director

       and Chief Officers of the Scottish Ambulance Service met and

       discussed Ambulance Service provision at sporting events in terms

       of anticipated crowd attendance.   It was agreed to apply

       nationally (in Scotland) the following attendance levels;


Anticipated Crowd Attendance                SAS Attendance

 5,000 - 25,000                             1 A & E ambulance
                                            1 District Ambulance Officer
                                            (Category A)


25,000 - 45,000                             2 A & E ambulances
                                            2 District Ambulance Officers
                                            1 Control Assistant / M.A.C.U
                                            (Category B)

45,000 +                                     3 A & E ambulances
                                             2 District Ambulance Officers
                                             1 Control Assistant / M.A.C.U
                                             (Category C)



       Note   : On the advice of police intelligence the minimum

       attendance levels will be increased at the discretion of the

       Chief Ambulance Officer, this would form a requirement of the

       safety certificate.


ii)    All ambulances attending should be double manned, the use of

       extended skilled staff should be considered.


Paragraph 69


  i)   The Scottish Ambulance Service has recently designed a Major

        Incident Equipment Vehicle, based on a 4 x 4 chassis, to provide
      to an incident site sufficient patient care and stretcher

      equipment to deal with up to 50 casualties.   This vehicle will

      also carry an inflatable casualty tent for use as a Casualty

      Clearing Centre should this be required.   In the interim

      ambulances are in use in Glasgow and Edinburgh providing a

      similar level of equipment provision at sporting events where a

      crowd in excess of 25,000 is expected.


ii)   The attendance of the Major Incident Equipment Vehicle should be

      incorporated within local plans and a designated parking point

      identified.


Paragraph 70 / 71


This is a police responsibility.


On considering the minimum Ambulance Service attendance at sporting

events,   the Director and Chief Ambulance Officers of the Scottish

Ambulance Service carefully considered the provisions necessary to

provide early evaluation of a potential medical emergency developing.

In such a situation effective communications and early installation of

command and control is paramount.    It is noted that in paragraph 232

of his Final Report Lord Justice Taylor comments on the use of Private

Ambulance Services.   On consideration that Private Ambulance Services

have no nationally applied operational standards and consequently are

unable to initiate a command and control system or communications
 links with the other Emergency Services / Health Boards, it is

 recommended that they are not considered for use in attendance

 sports events.

 Yours sincerely

                                             All we could do was sit and wait                Not much more than this was said
                                             As we heard the death toll climb to eight       Except he was in a hospital bed
                                             The football news no longer mattered            At last at seven ten that night
                                             Cause their whole world could soon be           We heard that my brother was alright
                                               shattered
FEAR       IS...                                                                             The death toll rose to 95
                                             We waited for the phone to ring                 But at least all my family are still alive
At 3.06 we heard the news                    For the dreadful news the police might          My brother’s at home, well and safe
A pitch invasion was someone’s view            bring                                         But now in big crowds I have no faith
By half past three the facts were hazy       The deaths were up to 30 or more
TV pictures show people going crazy          But still no knock upon the door                BY JOHN ENGLISH aged 12,
                                                                                             Potters Bar, Hertfordshire
By five to four we heard one dead            It was up to 40 by half past five
Suddenly my stomach filled with dread        But still no news, were they dead or alive
My brother was there, my uncle, his friend   At half past 6, from my uncles wife
Among the crowd at the Liverpool end         We learned that he hadn’t lost his life

I wanted to piece together what had

hooliganism had killed 95.         I saw the

isn’t hooliganism, just mismanagement.”
I’ve said it in the book. At 3 o’clock on a
Saturday afternoon it’s a player’s job to
make sure he’s physically and mentally
right to perform at the highest level. It’s the
fans jobs to make sure they can afford the
fare and the ticket down there. The police’s
job is to police, and the ticket people’s job
is to ticket, and they screwed up. They
always harp on about drunken fans arriving
late without tickets. Their brothers and
sisters from the same family went to Villa
Park and there were probably a few drunk
and ticketiess fans there - so what? They
were correctly marshalled and correctly
ticketed and that’s why no-one died at that
ground.

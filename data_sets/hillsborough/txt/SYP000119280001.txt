                given by Chief Superintendent Duckenfieid.                  Police Sergeant Chapman

               was -our serial Sergeant and we were to take up duties on the

               perimeter track of the playing area.                 Inspector Darling was in charge

               of the serials on the perimeter track.                 I can specifically remember

               Chief Superintendent Duckenfield stating during the briefing                     that "AT

               THIS STAGE THERE IS NO PROVISION FOR THE KICK OFF TO 6E PUT B A C K ,"

               and “UNDER NO CIRCUhSTANCES              IS ANYONE TO BE ALLOWED ONTO THE

               At     10.45 a.m.      the same day,     I took up my usual    position on the

               end)       of the ground.         During the following four hours the Hop filled

               up at a steady           rate.    The Nottingham Forest supporters were         coming

               into the ground reasonably early arid were for the greater                    part very

               well       behaved.      During this period we received frequent visits from

               C h i e f Inspector Beal and Superintendent Greenwood checking on tne

supporters            across       the        front      of the Kop            in front          of    the N o t t i n g h a m

supporters            and into           the r a i s e d        section.           I pointed           out    to Ins p e c t o r

Darling         that       this    w o u l d be d a n g e r o u s           to m y s e l f and         the    Li v e r p o o l

supporters.                However,           Inspector Darling                   insisted        that       I escort        the

Liverpool             supporters              in front          of the       Fo r e s t    fans; and not          across

the      perimeter          track,        some      20 yards,            to the        safety of gate               'O'.

Fortunately            Police       Constable             Holmes         a c c o m p a n i e d me wit h         the

Liverpool            supporters           as far as the m a i n                   exit/entrance              underneath

the      end of       the    raised           section.           I then a c c o m p a n i e d          the    Liv e r p o o l

fans      from       the    rear    of        the Kop       into       the Kop and t h r o u g h a very

densely         populated          K o p and         into the          raised       section.

As    I returned            ac r o s s    the back          of the          Kop    towards        gate       'O',     I saw

ma n y   Police        Officers           rush i n g      thro u g h        gate     'O'    towards          the p e r i m e t e r

track.          I     returned           to    the p e r i m e t e r track           and saw that            a large

number         of     Liverpool           supporters             were s p i l l i n g      onto the        pitch at          the

Leppings            Lane    end.         I assu m e d       it was          a pitch        invasion          and as many

officers            were    rushing           up to that             end,    I returned           to gate        2.      A few

seconds         later C h i e f          Inspector          Beal       a p p r o a c h e d myself,           Police

Constable            Green     and Police             Constable             Helliwell           and    i n s t r u c t e d us to

stay      at    the Kop        and South S tand                  area       to p r e v e n t     N o t t i n g h a m Forest

fans      from       coming       onto        the pitch.              Approximately              5 to 10 minutes

later      we       were    reinforced             by at least              another        serial.           Suddenly

about      40-50 L i v e r p o o l            fans c h a r g e d d o w n to            the S p i o n      Kop end from

the      half-way          line.         M y s e l f and other              officers        intercepted             them.

These      supporters             were        o b v i o u s l y upset,         mos t      were    d runk and were

screaming            and s h o u t i n g angr i l y             at    the F o r e s t      fans,       who were

chanting            at the     Liverpool             fans       obviously          making        them more          and more

upset.          We    turned       the        Liv e r p o o l    fans       around        and    sent     them back

From      around          1.30       pm radio        communications               had been very          bad,     the

sound       becoming            wobbly       and disto r t e d .             However,     I cannot        remember

any      radio       message          being     passed       from       the C o n t r o l Room     from ar o u n d

3 •0 8    pm.

Liverpool            supporters             began      to run        dow n    towards     us and b r e a k up

advertising               hoardings.            I began          to a s s i s t     them in this.            I then

helped         to carry          an a d v e r t i s i n g    hoarding          up to the L e p p i n g s        Lane    end

and      was    helped          by    a Liverpool           supporter          to bring        it over       towards

the      Control          Room.

Three       or four          Liverpool           fans      loaded       up a body         onto the     hoarding

s aying,        "TAKE HI M OUT OF HERE,                      HE'S       DEAD".        M y s e l f and m aybe      4 or 5

Liverpool            fans       ran w ith        the    hoarding         towards       the exit        between      the

North       Stand         and    the    Kop.         The    exit       was    very    crow d e d with        supporters

and      hoardings           and      injured        and dead          people.        I lost my        grip     of the

hoarding         as       it d i s a p p e a r e d     towards         the    gymnasium.        I was     knocked         to

one      side    and e v e n t u a l l y         returned         to    gate      2 and    the S o u t h Stand.

Chief       Inspector            Beal       i n s t r u c t e d me     to assist Police           Constable

Helliwell            at    the S o u t h S t a n d wit h             spontaneous         fights    breaking         out

in    the S o u t h Stand.                  Man y N o t t i n g h a m For e s t       supporters         were     still

abusing         Liverpool             supporters           and    fights       were    breaking        out     in the

S o u t h Stand.             Many      Liverpool           fans      were     still    swarming        d own    towards

the      Forest       end       of    the    ground,        obviously          upset     and    trying       to pick

fights.          Many        of these          Liverpool          fans       were    drunk.      I could        smell

intoxicants               and    they were           unsteady          on their       feet,     some     c ould    hardly

stand.

On    the      p i t c h were         Chief      Inspectors            Beal    and Su m n e r    and

Superintendent                  Greenwood.             It was        utter     chaos.

Eventually,               a bout      4.05     pm things          seemed       to be r u n n i n g more         smoothly

and h a l f of serial             2 were        pla c e d     near    to the       players        e n t rance    on

standby.           Many    Li v e r p o o l    fans were           still   wandering            about    the pitch,

intoxicated.

At 6 . 0 0 pm I a t t e n d e d         the     'de-brief'           in the N o r t h S t a n d         and   then

helped     colleagues            from     'Fl'       are a wit h      their       emotional        problems.           I

went    off duty          at    1.00    am on 16 A p r i l           1989-

As r e g a r d s    the    p o l i c i n g at    the       event     and my       previous        experience          of

football matches               at H i l l s b o r o u g h ,    I would       add    the     following:

1.      In p r e v i o u s     matc h e s      which       have     involved       Liverpool        at

        Hillsborough             there        have b e e n m any       drunk       supporters           getting

        into       the    ground,       f i g h t i n g broke        out    in the        league    match       at the

        end of the             1984/85        season,       and at last ye a r ' s              semi-final       there

        was    a pitch          i n v asion     at    the     end of the          game,     Liverpool         fans

        s w a r m e d onto       the pitch,           attempting           to goad        and    fight    with

        Nottingham             supporters.            The     Nottingham          supporters        wrecked       the

        exit       gates       and some        fencing        at    the Kop       end,     while     f e n c i n g was

        torn down at             the L e p p i n g s       Lane     end.     No b o d y    lear n e d    from    this,

        last       yea r ' s    semi-final           was    seen as a success.

2.      In p r e v i o u s      years C h i e f S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Mole           w o u l d wal k    a round

        the    p e r i m e t e r .track as k i n g          o f f icers     how    things        were    g o i n g and

        obviously          noting       the     gro u n d     capacity.

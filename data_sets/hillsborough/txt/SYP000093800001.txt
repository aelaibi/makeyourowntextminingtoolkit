             At 8.00am       (0800) Saturday 15th April             1989 <150489/?,      I arrived on duty

             at West Bar,       At 9.00am        (0900)   I attended a briefing            in the gym and at

             10.00am (1000),       I joined my Serial, Serial 7 / the Inspector                       in charge

             was    Insp HARPER, and I attended at the Midland Station in order to

             supervise the Nottingham Forest fans to the ground on specially

             provided buses.



             I escorted three buses down to the ground in all,                         the last one being

             at about 2.30pm <1430).



             The fans on the buses were in a good mood but quite rowdy.                              As we were

             travelling along Penistone Road to the ground I noted that large

             crowds that were gathering outside the pubs.

                  By the last bus at 2.30pm         (1430)   I estimated groups of 1 0 0 + outside

                  the majority of the pubs and the fans seemed to be making no effort to

                  make their way to the ground even though they were a good walking

                  distance away.



                  On my arrival at the ground I patrolled the perimeter for a short

                  meal.



                  Before         I was able to start my meal, Operation Support was     called and I

                  was instructed to go onto the pitch.            I had no idea what was happening

                  and was never told,



                  When I got onto the pitch I was instructed to form a line /n front of

                  the Liverpool f a n s , this I did with other Officers but thle line soon

                  broke down as it became obvious that fans entering the pitch needed

                  ass ist an ce.



                  I could see that fans entering the pitch were walking around in a

                  daze,     some were sitting or lying but some were very angry,         towards the

                  po 1 i c e .



                  I could also see that Officers at the perimeter fence were helping

                  fans out of the terrace and onto the pitch and I could see fans from

                  very aggressive manner and began to push me around,            telling me that

                  people were dead on the terrace.            I tried to calm him down but he did

             I did not really believe that he had seen any dead people because up

             until now the fans on the pitch that I had seen were                      really only dazed

             and shocked or angry.        I still did not know what had taken place.



             1 carried on attending       to the fans trying to keep them calm and trying

             to advise people what to do who had lost contact with their relatives.

      ^7                     a   y ° u n 9 m a l e . His friend * s       tugging at    my trouser leg,

           0 asking me to do something.         I could see/that the young               lad was dead

 Ho        ' but    began to give him heart massage A n d a St                J o h n ’s ambulanceman

             then   joined me and gave mouth to moulh.



             We carried on doing this for some time before an ambulance                      crew

             arrived,   looked   at the lad and told us to stop. The body was then

             carried o-f^f the   pitch on an advertising board by other                  officers.



             I remained on the pitch and by this time there were several/bodies

             lying on the pitch.       I assisted in lifting them onto stret/hers and

             boards and trying to deal with the fans who were by thisM,ime

             obviously fully aware of the situation and no longer angry but in

             shock etc.



             I was given a handbag that somebody had found on the terrace.                          The bag

             had valuables and I/D in.         I held on to this until            it was eventually

             conveyed to the casualty bureau.



             I cannot remember how long I stayed at the ground or exactly what                          I

         did, after leaving the pitch,     before I was instructed to make my way

         back to the Midland Station,    escorting the fans who were now making

         their way back on the buses,    private   cars and on foot.



         I walked back to the Midland Station and supervised fans getting on

         the trains before I eventually returned to West Bar.



         I went off duty at 8 pm (2000).

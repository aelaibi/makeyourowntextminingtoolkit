PETER TOOTLE



1.   Peter Tootle,       the son of the Applicants Peter and Joan                        j'V-

     Tootle,     attended       the   match     with     a    friend,        Colin
                                                                                         ST*
     Frodsham.     The y were both in enclosure 3.
                                                                                         m


2.   At the mini       inquest Dr. David Slater              put forward his             Ig*
                                                                         ,
     vi e w that the      cause of death was           traumatic asphyxia.               ge

     The rest of the        evidence was given by Police Sergeant

     John Killock        and Detective        Inspector Michael          L a yto n

     which,     wh e n taken     together,      produced the       following

     chronological account.            Colin Frodsham         was separated

     fro m Mr. Tootle when the crowd in the enclosure surged

     forward,    after     which he     fell unconscious.            Whe n      he   ^

     came round he        saw Mr. Tootle lying on the             ground.        A

     police officer        then attempted to resuscitate                h im for

     about 1 0 - 2 0     seconds.     Atflsome time between. 3.20 anc

     3.40 p.m.     Police Constable           Friend saw Mr.       T oo tl e at

     the end     of the ground        opposite to the         Leppings Lane

     end where he examined him and then with P.C. Grifo.i<-h,

     carried him into the temporary mortuary.                  At 3.54 p.m.

     Peter Tootle was          certified dead by Dr.          M a t t he w Eull,

     who   certified dead         a   total     of thirty       Hills bor ou gh

     victims in a period of twenty minutes.



     At the main inquest no evidence whatsoever was addu ce d

     whi ch related to Peter Tootle.             His name was me n t i o n e d




ANNAAD
                 only when the verdicts were returned.               Yet the purpose

                of the main          inquest was to deal with        the question of

                ho w Mr. Tootle met his death.



      4.        The complaint of the            Applicants therefore extends far

                beyond one levelled at           the decision of the coroner to

                di sallow      evidence relating       to    events that      occurred

                after 3.15 p.m.          More fundamentally it concerns thei r

                belief that there has been no inquest at all, into the

             most important           question concerning their          sons death,
             namely how he came to die.



     5.     This          is so not merely       because no         evidence concerning

            this          issue was     heard    at   the main     inquest but      also

            because the         issue     of lack of care          was not put to the

            jury          as   a possible       inference to      draw      from   the

            evidence.          The    Applicants      submit     that the    minimum

 ^          requirements for a fair and proper hearing at the m a i n

           inquest required            the following        to be put    before the

           jury:      a     summary of the evidence that           had been hear d

           at      the mini     inquest and       the evidence      of Dr.     Glynn

           Phillips,       Dr. John      A s ht on and Mr. F.     Eccleston.       The

           jury should         then have     been informed        that a     finding

           that death was aggravated by               lack of care was open to
           them.

KEVIN DANIEL WILLIAMS



     Kevin Daniel Williams the son           of the Applicants James

     Stephen and Anne Williams was born on 27th May,             1973,

     and was 15 years old when he died at Hillsborough

     football ground on 15th April,          1989.



2.   He went to the stadium with friends but became

     separated from all but one, Andr ew Duncan.           Together

     they took up positions in enclosure 4 at 1.30 p.m.,

     but some time before 2.45 p.m»          they mo ve d into

     enclosure 3.



3.   During the course of Kevin's mini inquest on 2nd May,               1990,

     the following evidence was put before the jury through

     the witnesses Detective Sergeant John Killoch,

     Dr. Da vi d Slater, Detective Inspector Michael Layton,

     and And re w Duncan:-       Andrew Duncan lost sight of Kevin

     Williams immediately after the first surge in

     enclosure 3.        At about 3.28 p.m.,    P.C. Michael Craighill

     went into enclosure 3 and carried Kevin onto the pitch

     where he attempted unsuccessfully to resuscitate him.

     Derek Bruder,       an off duty Police Constable saw Kevin

     lying on the pitch near the Spion Kop, North stand of the

     ground.      He stated that Kevin was having convulsions.

     Mr. Bruder,      on seeing Kevin went on to the pitch

     where he gave mouth to mouth resuscitation and an

     ambulanceman carried out cardiac massage.            They were

     later joined by an ambulance woman who took over from

     Mr. Bruder.        After a short time the St. Johns Ambulanceman

     S-t-atPr) -f-hat- Tfpvi n    r)<=ar).
Some time later special Constable Debra Martin assisted

in carrying Kevin from the pitch to the temporary

mortuary.     She claimed that when they reached the

mortuary he stopped breathing.        She then gave him

mouth to mouth resuscitation and did some heart massage,

after which he opened his eyes,       said the word "mum" and

then died.     At 4.06 p.m. Dr. Curpen examined Kevin and

certified him dead.



Dr. David Slater,       stated in evidence that Kevin died of

traumatic asphyxia.        His case was one of the worst of

those he dealt with from the Hillsborough incident.           In

his opinion Kevin would have fallen unconscious within

3 to 5 seconds of being crushed.        He stated that persons

suffering from asphyxia can have fits.        He was not of

the view,    however,   as SC Martin had suggested,   that

Kevin could have spoken.       The autopsy showed that Kevin

had four fractures of his voice box and irreversible

brain damage,    both of which he believed,    would on their

own have prohibited communication.       Any sound that might

have emerged he put down to the expulsion of air from

Kevin's stomach but stated that this would not explain

the opening of Kevin's eyes.       He believed that because

of the seriousness of Kevin's case,      he would have suffered

irrecoverable brain damage and brain death within 3 to 6

minutes.

6   .   The mini inquest into Kevin was then adjourned until

        a date to be fixed.



7.      On 3rd May,   1990,   an officer from the West Midlands

        Police Force, visited the Applicants at their home.

        The officer stated that Mr. Bruder had now changed his

        statement as he realised he must have been mistaken.

        Mr. Bruder was now saying that there was no vomit near

        to Kevin that it could have been mucous.      Mr. Bruder

        was also saying that Kevin wasn't convulsing when he

        attended him,   that it must have been body twitches.

        The police officer told Kevin's parents that it would

        be better if the family did not speak to Mr. Bruder.

        He said that Special Constable Martin was still

        sticking to her original statement but that she was

        young and inexperienced and that she had undergone a

        traumatic experience.      In the circumstances,   he said

        her statement would be discounted.      He then stated

        that there would be another inquest into Kevin the

        following day but that the Applicants need not attend,

        as the purpose of the inquest was to prove to the jury

        that Kevin could not have been alive.



        On 4th May,   1990,   the coroner returned to Kevin's mini

        inquest and further evidence was put to the jury by

        Sergeant John Killoch,     Inspector Matthew Robert Sawers,

        Dr. David Slater and Doctor Ernest John Wallace Gumpert,
                      - 4 -



which, when taken together produced the following account

of events:   When Mr. bruder made his first statement he

stated that he came across Kevin at the Spion Kop end

having convulsions.   This happened after 3.32.        He also

said he could feel a pulse.

                  Mr. Bruder gave mouth to mouth resuscitation

and an ambulanceman carried out cardiac massage.         After 7

minutes they swapped roles.      About 6 minutes later an

ambulancewoman took over from Mr. Bruder.      Whilst

Mr. Bruder was attempting to resuscitate Kevin he observed

an ambulance entering the stadium.      He asked the St. Johns

Ambulance colleague who was assisting him to stop the

ambulance as he was considering utilising it.

During resuscitation efforts he no ti ce d Kevin's face

going grey and withdrawn.



In his evidence Inspector Matthew Robert Sawers of the

West Midlands Police confirmed that he had visited

m r . Bruder the previous day.    He stated that Mr. Bruder

on reflection thought that the word     'convulsions'       was

not applicable,   that twitching was a more appropriate

term to describe Kevin's condition and that if he had

seen any part of the body move,     it was the head.        He

reported that Mr. Bruder said that he may well have been

mistaken about feeling a pulse.      He added that,    in

contrast to his original statement,     he could no longer

say that he definitely saw Kevin's skin colour change
                               - 5 -



         from normal to grey

                   but that the fluid he saw coming from Kevin's

         mouth might have been spittle or phlegm.       Mr. Bruder

         had confirmed that he attempted to resuscitate Kevin

         for a period of time of between 10 and 15 minutes and

         that the ambulance he saw was definitely entering the

         stadium and not exiting.



         In his further evidence Dr.       Slater stated that Kevin

         wo ul d have suffered irrecoverable brain damage and

         death within 3 to 6 minutes,      that is, by the time

         Mr. Bruder reached him,       and that although he was brain

         dead his heart may have gone on beating for a short

         while longer,   and his nerves may have lived on thus

         causing the twitching.        He brain had died near to the

         time of the crushing,    but his whole body died at the

         time that P.C. Bruder was with him and saw him turn

         grey.



11   .   Dr. Ernest Gumpert was of the view that Kevin was

         probably dead before he was even removed from enclosure 4,

         in the sense that he was brain dead and was going to die.

         He also thought it conceivable that his heart continued

         to operate for a time as did his peripheral nervous

         system.   But after Kevin had suffered brain death the

         only way to keep him alive would have been by artificial

         means.
On 15th December,     1991,     the Applicant Ann'Williams met

with mr. Bruder.      A note of this meeting is exhibited

at Page            appended hereto.       From those notes

it would appear that Mr. Bruder refutes the interpretation

placed by D.I.      Robert Sawers upon the statement made by

Mr. Bruder on 3rd May,        1990.



From November 1991 the Applicants made repeated requests

to South Yorkshire Police to release copies of the statements

made by Special Constable Martin and Mr. Bruder.

The Applicants eventually received the said statements

from the Coroner's office on 19th February,          1992.     In

relation to Mr. B r u d e r 's initial statement made on 2 7th

April,    1989,   the following matter caused grave concern

to the Applicants

(a)   Mr. Bruder describes seeing a police cordon in front

      of the North stand.         Kevin was lying on the ground

      behind the police cordon having convulsions.             None

      of the police officers left the cordon to assist

      people who were lying on the pitch.          (See Page    ....).


(b)   Shortly after Mr. Bruder began resuscitation attempts

      on Kevin an ambulance entered the ground and drove

      towards the Lapping Lane end.          He told the St. Johns

      man to try and stop it.         He tried to flage it down

      but it continued on as if it had been ordered not

      to stop.      (See Page    ....).
                                    - 7 -


         Details of the aforementioned matters were not referred

         to in the police summary of evidence presented at the

         inquest.  The Applicants feel that such omissions
                                    of
         illustrate the shortcomings^presenting evidence in

         summary form.     A copy of Mr. B r u d e r 's first statement

         and the West Midland's Police Summary of Evidence is

         annexed hereto.




•   14
         In relation to m r . B r u d e r 's second statement made on

         3rd May,   1990, he states in the first paragraph thereof

         that he had "been asked to think about a number of points

         which are raised in the statement I made nearly a

         fortnight after the Hillsborough Stadium disaster".

         See Page    ....hereof).    In the Applicants'    view, this

         remark,    taken together with the notes of the meeting held

         with Mr. Bruder on 15th December,        1991,   indicate that

         improper pressure was indeed exerted upon M r . Bruder

         to retract or qualify in part his previous statement.

         Further,    since receiving the copy statements the

         Applicants have viewed a BBC video of events as they

         unfolded on the day of the d i s a s t e r .   It is evident from

         the video that a SYMAS Ambulance entered the Spion Kop

         end of the pitch at 3.36 p.m.       at which time it has been

         established that Mr. Bruder was attempting to resuscitate

         Kevin.     The Applicants are concerned that despite its

         availability this evidence was not put before the jury.

         Rather, Mr. Bruder was asked to consider whether the

         ambulance he had originally referred to as entering the

         stadium was in fact exiting.

                                     \
                          -   8   -




15.   At the same time as efforts were being made to

      secure copies of witness statements attempts were made to

      contact Special Constable Martin.    On 20th February 1992

      the Applicant Ann Williams received a phone call from

      the Special Constable which culminated in a meeting

      at the Applicants home on 22nd February 1992.    At that

      meeting Special Constable Martin confirmed the contents

      of her first statement made on 8th May 1989 wherein she

      described the events set out in paragraph 4 hereof.

      She stated that this statement was made up from notes which

      she had made in her pocketbook immediately after the disaster

      She explained that her later statement dated 17th March

      1990 was compiled by an officer from the West Midlands

      Police Force who visi ted her at her home.    This officer

      tried to convince Special Constable Martin that her

      original statement was untrue.     The Special Constable

      signed the statement prepared by this officer without

      reading i t .   She was unable to read it due to the state

      of distress brought on by the officer's behaviour.     She

      signed the statement because of the pressure exerted by the

      officer and because she wanted to put Hillsborough behind

      her.



      Special Constable Martin has now signed a statement,       in

      the presence of a solicitor,    confirming the truth of her

      original statement dated 8th May 1989,    and explaining the

      circumstances relating to the compilation of the later

      statement dated 17th March 1990.
A copy of this statement is appended hereto at Page                .......


The Applicants firmly believe that the statement dated

17th March 1990 led to the undermining of Special

Constable Martin's statement at the mini inquest on 2nd

May 1990         (see in particular page 7, para D.E. of transcript

p r o c e e d i n g s ).


Subsequent to the me eting with Special Constable Martin

the Applicants sought the advice of their general

practitioner as to the contents of Kevin's autopsy report.


In his view the injuries to Kevins larynx would not have

preve nt ed him from speaking.            A copy of this opinion

is appended hereto at page             .......


Now in receipt of most of the evidence relating to

Kevin's death,             the Applicants contend that the inquest

proceedings into Kevin's death and the result and verdict

of accidental death are highly unsatisfactory by reason

of the following matters

(a)        The jury never heard from Mr.Bruder himself,

           nor did they hear from Special Constable

           Debra Martin.         The jury were merely presented

           with excerpts from their respective statements.

           The Applicants contend that the evidence

           relating to Kevin was presented to the jury

           in a confusing and incoherent fashion.

(b)        They are par ticulary concerned at the inactivity

           of the police officers in the cordon whilst

           Kevin was convulsincr and the unsuccessful attempt
                           -   1 0   -




            to flag down an ambulance.           In their view both

            these matters indicate a lack of response on the

            part of the emergency s e r v i c e s .

      (c)   Notwithstanding the evidence of Dr.David Slater

            and Dr.Ernest Gumpert they believe that Kevin

            was alive for some time after 3.32 and hence

            for some time after the 3.15 p.m,            cut off time.

            This belief is heightened by a recent article in

            the British Medical          Journal dated 30th November 1991.

            This article       states that the accident and emergency

            departments of the Northern General and Royal

            Hallamshire Hospitals,          Sheffield,   were never

            formally told to implement the major disaster

            plan.    Further,        the article states that most of

            the seriously injured arrived at hospital between

            3.30 p.m.   and 4.00 p.m.         Nine of those injured were

            convulsing upon admission.           A further 6 were confused

            upon arrival and then began having severe convulsions.

            It is known that some of these people survived with

            no long term physical effects.

      (d)   The further evidence which has come to light since

            the inquest indicates in particular a suppression

            of evidence,       irregularity of proceedings and

            discovery of new evidence.



19.   The Applicants submit that in the light of these matters

      and had Mr.Bruder and Debra Martin been called as

      witnesses there may have been sufficient evidence for
      the jury to conclude that Kevin's death was due to or

      aggravated by lack of care.
M E E T I N G BETWEEN ANNS WILLIAMS AND P.C. BRUDER -

15TH DECEMBER,     1991



P.C. Bruder     made his original statement                approximately ten

days after the disaster.



At that time he asked the West Midlands Police for the name

of    the boy    he had     attempted to       resuscitate      (i.e.     Kevin

Williams).      This was refused.



A t the meeting wi t h P.C.         Bruder on 15th December,        1991, he

stated that      he came        across Kevin      on the     pitch and      that

Ke v i n   was either     convulsing or        twitching.       Kevin had       a

pu l s e and there was vomit in Kevin's mouth.                As he tried to

resuscitate Kevin an ambulance approached going towards the

Leppings      Lane end     of     the   ground.      He     shouted for      the

ambulance to stop in order to put              Kevin in it, but it went

straight past.



On 3rd May,     1990, P.C. Bruder was          visited in his home by a

Wes t Midlands Police Officer           who asked him to        'reconsider'

his statement.       He    was asked if        he was mistaken          w he n he

stated that     Kevin was        convulsing and had         a pulse.       P.C.

Brude r stated that he was not mistaken.




ANNAAJ
N.B.     It     was cniy at this         time      (i.e. 3rd May,         1990)    that

P.C.     Bruder learnt          for   the     first time the        name of         the

p e r s o n he had cried to help.



At     the     same    time      as   the       West Midlands       Officer         was

interviewing h im in his              homs, the Coroner rang P.C. Bruder

and tried to          persuade h i m that the facts           of his statement

w e r e incorrect in          particular that the ambulance                could not

have     been     driving onto         the    pitch    but might          have     been

dri vin g off it.         Again,      P.C. Bruder refused          to admit that

he had been m is t a k e n and        was adamant that the ambulance                had

b e e n driving onto the pitch.



The    West     Midlands       Officer       was    with    P.C.    Bruder         from

approximately 10.00 a.m.              - 4.00 p.m. on 3rd May.



P.C.   Bruder     told the       Officer that he           didn't want           to see

Kevin's parents but if they wished to meet with him then he

w o u l d be   prepared to meet          them anywhere.        (N . B .    Wh e n the

W est Midlands        Officer visited         Mr. and      Mrs. Williams            the

same day       he informed them          that P.C. Bruder would             not see

them).



P.C. Bruder       stated the          reasons behind       the West        Midlands

O fficer visiting h im          whe n he stated "when he            came down to

see me it was wit h a brief - to get me to change my mind."




ANNAAJ
                                         - 3 -



In response to whet her or not              he would be prepared to make

another statement,         P.C. Bruder       replied that     he wo uld    be

prepared to         stand up     in Court     and state    that Kevin     was

convulsing,         that there    was     a pulse




A s k e d whether     or not Kevin was           alive when he got   to him,

P.C. Bruder replied "there was a                 pulse and if that means he

was alive then he was alive."



W h e n P.C.   Bruder left       Kevin he was certain         that he     was

dead.    He                               then went home.     He destroyed

all the clothes he was wearing on that day.                 He stated that

he has     never re ceived any          counselling and has     dealt with

the disaster "in his own way."

IDENTIFICATION EVIDENCE:          On the morning of Sunday 16 April 1989,

James Stephen WILLIAMS identified the body of his step son, Kevin Daniel

WILLIAMS, to PC 1269 GLAVE in the Temporary Mortuary at Hillsborough Stadium.
CIRCUMSTANCES

At about 0700 hours on Saturday, 15 April
1989, Mr James Stephen WILLIAMS saw his son,
Kevin Daniel WILLIAMS, deceased, leave the
family home with the intention of travelling
to Sheffield.     He was to travel by train with
a number of his friends to watch the F.A. Cup
Semi Final football match at Hillsborough
Stadium.     Kevin Daniel WILLIAMS had a ticket
for the match.


Andrew DUNCAN travelled to Sheffield with
Kevin Daniel WILLIAMS, Thomas James NICKSON
and Gregory FAGEN by train arriving at
Sheffield at about 1040 hours.     Gregory FAGEN
left the others at the station.     The other
three youths caught a bus from the station to
Hillsborough Stadium where Thomas NICKSON
left them.


Andrew DUNCAN entered the stadium with Kevin
Daniel WILLIAMS at about 1330 hours via the
Leppings Lane turnstiles.     They initially
stood together in Pen 4 but after a short
time moved into Pen 3. At about 144o hours
Andrew DUNCAN saw other friends on the
terraces including Anthony Maxwell GRIER and
Stuart THOMPSON (Deceased Reference Number
 At about 1455 hours Andrew DUNCAN was still
 with Kevin WILLIAMS and although the crowd in
 the pen was tightly packed he was not too
 concerned at that time.     As the match started
 he was pushed forwards down the terrace and
 did not see Kevin Daniel WILLIAMS again.


 Following the severe crushing in.the West
 Stand terracing Police Constable 1790 Michael
 John CRAIGHILL went into Pen 3 and assisted a
 number of casualties.     Police Constable
 CRAIGHILL assisted to carry a youth, he now
 believes to be Kevin Daniel WILLIAMS, from
 the gate in the perimeter fencing of Pen 3
onto the pitch.    The officer attempted
resuscitation but without success.


Derek William BRUDER is a Police Constable
with Merseyside Police and was at the match
as a spectator in the North Stand.     He
recalls seeing a person lying on the pitch
near the Spion Kop/North Stand having
convulsions.   Mr BRUDER went onto the pitch
and gave mouth to mouth resuscitation aided
by a St Johns Ambulanceman who carried out
cardiac massage.   Mr BRUDER recalls that a
friend of the casualty was with him on the
pitch.   Resuscitation was continued and they
 were joined by a St Jonns Ambulance woman who
 took over from Mr BRUDER.   After a short time
 the St Johns Ambulanceman said that the
 casualty was dead.   Mr BRUDER then left the
 scene.


 Neither of the St Johns Ambulance personnel
 or the 'friend' of the casualty have been
 identified. The person Mr BRUDER tried to
 resuscitate is now known to be Kevin Daniel
 WILLIAMS.


 Special Constable 221 Debra Jane MARTIN went
 onto the pitch to assist and helped to carry
 several deceased and also many injured to the
 gymnasium.   She assisted to carry one young
boy, now known to be Kevin Daniel WILLIAMS,
 into the gymnasium and remained with him.


At 1606 hours Doctor Naderassen Carpoosamv
CURPEN examined Kevin Daniel WILLIAMS in the
gymnasium which had been established as a
temporary mortuary and certified life
extinct.


Special Constable MARTIN later escorted the
body of Kevin Daniel WILLIAMS to the Medico
Legal Centre and confirmed the identification
by Reference Number to Detective Constable
638 Simon WEIGOLD.
                           4.



 11     On Sunday, 16 April 1989 Mr James Stephen
        WILLIAMS identified the body of his son to
        Police Constable 1269 Scott 6LAVE.


 12.   On Sunday, 16 April 1989 following
        identification by Detective Constable
        WEIGOLD, Doctor David SLATER carried out an
        autopsy and submitted a report giving cause
        of death.


        BLOOD ETHANOL ANALYSIS

 13.   Evidence is included regarding the analysis
        of the blood sample from the deceased where
        the presence of ethanol was detected.    The
       witnesses proving continuity of the blood
       sample are Detective Constable 1076 David
       Michael 6REEN, Detective Sergeant 2616 John
       Albert TURNER and Detective Sergeant 1098
       James Norman FLETCHER.    Doctor Alexander
       Robert FORREST carried out the analysis.

       WILLIAMS was a ticket counterfoil which
       confirms his entry to the stadium via a
       turnstile.


       VISUAL EVIDENCE

15.    An examination of video film and photographic
       evidence has been made by Police Inspector
  LAYTON and Kevin Daniel WILLIAMS has been
  identified in Pen 3. being carried across the
  pitch and at the Spion Kop end of the pitch.


 Photograph Reference DAC 3/1 shows Kevin
 Daniel WILLIAMS apparently unconscious near
 the perimeter fencing in Pen 3.    Video
 Reference MAP 7. 1528:33:22 shows him being
 removed from the terraces via Gate 3.


 Police Constable CRAIGHILL has signed a Plan
 of the pitch showing where he first came into
 contact with Kevin WILLIAMS and where he laid
 him on the ground.    The officer identified
'himself on Video Reference MAP 7. 1528:43:24
 carrying a youth now known to be Keith
 WILLIAMS from gate 3 and onto the pitch. The
 officer did not know the identity of the
youth and first believed it to be another
deceased.


Photographs Reference PR5/32 and PR5/33 timed
at 1532 hours, show Kevin WILLIAMS being
carried across the pitch on a temporary
stretcher by a number of spectators and two
police officers.   Police Constable 437 Garrv
HAYES has confirmed his identification on the
photographs.   The officer assisted to carry
two deceased persons on temporary stretchers
but could not recall any further details. He
did not know the identity of the persons he
carried, he merely assisted to carry the
temporary stretcher.

A number of photographs including Photograph
Reference TT1/30. show Kevin WILLIAMS
being given mouth to mouth on the pitch by Mr
BRUDER who has confirmed this identification.


The parents of Kevin Daniel WILLIAMS have
viewed visual evidence and confirm the
identifications of their son.

                 TNQUEST INTO TH E DEATH OF KEVIN DANIEL WILLIAMS

                 MR. FRASER:        Sir, you will now hear evidence
           to Kevin Daniel Williams.         Kevin's mum and dad are in
           with the social w ork er from Merseyside who has been
           assist in g them.     The so li citors for Kevin's mum     dad are
           memb er s of my G r o u p and I therefore appear in tl.e usual
     B     guise as their agent to the Steering Committee-

                   THE CORONER:   Good morning, Mr. and Mrs- Williams-
           Before we begin I am going to explain to you the genera
           format of the Inquest because you weren t here a lortnigh
           ago, were you, and even if you were you might have
           forgotten-     We will start in a moment or two by m e reading
           to you what was said on 18th April 1989 which i» when I
           opened the Inquest in this very room.      Then if there are any
           am endme nt s which need to be made, if we have got some ot the
           facts wrong, we will sort that out.      I will then tell you
           what the blood alcohol levels were, as measured by
           Dr. Forrest, and then we will turn to Dr. Slater, who is.
           Pathologist si tting up there behind you-      He will give us
           the pathological evidence.      I think I can safely say that
           if, after this Inquest over, you feel you would like to talk
     D     t o D r . Slater private ly he is quite happy to do that if it
           would be-of any help to you.      When Dr. Slater has finished
                                                      pr epared
           the West Mi dlands Police Officers have prep          a nummary
                                                           ar ed a
           for me and he will deal with that and tell me about it.

                 Then we will hear from Inspector Layton, another We»t
            Midlands Police Officer, who will deal with the visua
            evidence.  He will first of all tell me all about the pla
            and so on and that is sometimes a bit c on fu si ng ^ ec a^ ®
            there are a lot of references given but when he has t i n ^ h e
            talking about it he comes over and shows us on these d g
            plans so that all of us, that is me, you, the Jury and
            everybody else can follow it.   Then when that is done we
            conclude and take no further evidenc e at this stage.         »
            that reasonably clear?   I like to tell you so that you know
            what to expect.  Otherwise you d o n 11 know what is coming.

                 This then is the resumed Inquest which was opened on
            18th April 1989 and on that occasion Neil Anthony Parkin,
            Acting Coroner' s Officer, said:

                 "The body which is the subject of this Inquest has been
                 identified.to PC 1269 Glave of the South Yorkshire
                 Police as that of Kevin Daniel Williams by James
                 Stephen Williams, his father.   He was 15 years of age
                 having b een born on 27th Way 1973_at So u t h p o r t ^ ^

                 i a s Sf schoo lbo y by occupation. He diid at Hills bo ro ug h
                 Football Grou nd following an incident there on




                                                                         1009
                                                          nR. DAVID NEIL SLATER



           .Saturday, 15th April 1989.    PC Glave caused the body to
           be removed to the Medico L e g a l Centre and there he
            identified it to Detective Constable Simon Weigola who
           subsequ en tl y identified the same body to Dr. slater-
            It is the family wish that the body should be
           cremated."

         I adjourne d the Inquest at that point.   I wrote to you
    shortly afterw ard s and you, Mr. Williams, very kindly signed
    it on 1st May 1989 and I checked with you the details and
    you confirmed the name, that we had got it right, date ot
    birth 27.5.73, that is right, isn't it, and the place o ^
    birth which was Southport wasn't it?    We typed it into the
    wrong spot in your case but you spotted that.

         Dr. Forrest did the alcohol levels for many of the
    people who died, including Kevin, and the level in respect
    of Kevin was 56 milligrammes per 100 mils.

                         DR.     DAVID NEIL SLATER ~ Called

                                     Bv THE C O R O N E R :

Q. Dr. Slater. .- A. Sir, my name is Dr. David Neil Slater. I
   am a Consultant Histopathologist and a Fellow of the Royal
   College of Pathologists.

         THE CORONER:   Before I go o n , Mr.                 Williams,   you are
    true dad of this lad-

           MR.    WILLIAMS:          Stepfather.

         THE CORONER:   Thank you very much.  You are mum, yes-
    Mr. Fraser, so that we get the record right.  Is this an
    informal or a proper adoption because obviously the lad
    carries the same surname?

         MR. FRASER:               There is no formal ado pt io n but      it is a
    twelve years plus.

           THE C O R O N E R :      Pardon?

         MR. FRASER:    There has been no formal adop ti on by
    Mr. Williams as such but the re lat io ns hi p is more than
    twelve ye ar s old.

Q           T H E CORONER:
                         I am very sorry, Dr. Slater, to ha^ e
    i n t e r r u p t e d you.
                       Just remind us of your name because I have
    forgotten whfere.we were up to?  Just s t a r t again?          • y
    name is Dr. David Neil Slater, Consultant H i s t o p a t h o l o g i s t ,

Q. Dr. S l a t e r , i n the usual way you are satisfied t h a t the
   evidence you are going to give me in this case rela

                                                                             51    is
             Ke vin Daniel Williams who was also identified as No.
             that right? - A. That is correct, sir.
                                                                     you are
        Q.   Identification was done by Inspector Timms so far as
             concerned:' - A- That was the initial ident ificat ion.

                           doubt     in your m i n d about    the identity;
        Q. But there is no
        A. N o .
        Q.   There were various marks on the body i t s e i r to
    B   A.   Sir, Kevin was clearly labelled both by number and          y

        Q.   Dr. Slater, would you be kind enough then to take me through
             the post mo rtem? - A. My exa mination of Kevin showed tha
             the main finding was that of asphyxia.     This opinion
             formed through the extensive bl ue ne ss on the face an    pp
             part o f the chest.    In addition there were small
             haemorrhages in both the face and internal organs including
             the brain, heart and lungs.     This asphyxia had clearly
             resulted f r o m compression of the neck and chest and this
             opinion was support ed by the presence of three small
             scratches over the left side of the neck and also over the
             front of the voice box.     This had also resulted in four
             fractures to the small bones in the actual voice box.      in
             ad dition there was evidence of b ruisi ng to the lungs, again
    D        supporting compre ss io n of the chest.

                    My autopsy showed that Kevin was a normally developed,
             fit    healthy, young male with no evidence of any natural
             disease which could have contrib ut ed towards death and 1
             was my opinion that Kevin had a normal life expectancy,
             terms of the mode of death the co mpression of the neck or
             chest has occurred here and un con sci ousn ess occurs very
             rapidly      certainly within a few seconds, a nd there is one
             reported case of it occurring a p p a ren tly instantaneous y.
             Fo ll ow in g un co nsciousness then there is no discomtort an
             pain.     Death then occurs after appr ox ima te ly three to five
             minutes, sir.

        Q. So be cause when we say asphyxia peop le think of agony for
           ages and ages.     What you are s ayi ng is that the person
           him self would very rapidly not know any th in g J t ua11
           what was hap pening? - A. I should say the word       asphyxia is
           unfor tu na te in that scie ntifically it partly includes simply
           that there is not enough oxygen in the blood.        It doesn
           imply actual suffocation and prolong ed death.

        Q. Did you say there were four fractures to the voice box? -
        A. Yes, there are two bones in the voice box, as you know, sir,
           a n d ' both these showed two fractures each.

        Q. Now the reason why I asked you was this, and I want to P u *
           this to you bec ause I would like to get your view on it, one
           Offic er will be dealing with the value of this evidence

             moment bat she says that at a point when this lad was in the
             gymnasium, in other words he had already been moved across
             the pitch, she says she hel pe d him into the gym from the
             pitch, presum ab ly she carried him.      He stopped breathing.
             She gave him the kiss of life, did some heart massage, he
             opened h-is eyes said a word and died.       Now in the light of
             your pathological findings, is that in fact a possibility,
             do you think? - A. Well, sir, I was aware of this statement
             and therefore I have clearly given this matter co nsiderable
             thought, sir.        I think there are several comments to make
    B        but the mo de ra te ly large number of autopsies I did from this
             incident, sir, this was certain ly the most severe case of
             traumatic as phyxia that I actually dealt with-       This was
             both in terms of blueness of the face and also the area of
             pallor of whiteness around the mouth-        Sir, it was a very
             very severe form of asphyxia and I do not think that
             unconsciou sn es s would have been qu icker than ’•hree oi five
             seconds.    I have no reason to alter what I have already said
             on that a s p e c t .

                  The other very significant thing about this, and it alsc
             supports the severity of this case, is that again of the
             autopsies I did approximately 15 per cent had some sort of
             fracture to the voice box, the larynx.    This case was highly
             unusual in that in fact it had four fractures to the larynx.
    D        It was by far the most severe case of voice box fractures.
             Not only does this indicate the severity of the traumatic
             asphyxia at the time but it also in fact makes it virtually
             impossible for the person to have spoken by virtue of the
             fact that there were fractures to the voice box, sir.    So
             all I can say, sir, that sc ien tifically and medically I find
             that inconceivable that the person could have spoken.

        Q. The other thing I notice is that you show in this pa rt icular
           case extensive congestion of the cerebral veins and
           cereb al lu m and cortical coning and if a person speaks his
           neurons are working, aren't they? - A. That is right.

        Q- That ev idence would indicate there had been extensive brain
           damage and he couldn't really communicate.    Would that be
           right?   I don't want to put words in your mouth but I want
           to be sure about that? - A. The coning indicates the
           severity of the asphyxia and again that would have resulted
           in irreversible brain damage   which again would totally
           prohibit any form of communication.

        Q.   I have thought about this comment as w e l l , of course, and
             there are several exp lanations (1) that it didn't occur and
             that the ob serv er is mistaken but ano th er possibility that
             has oc curred to me and I want to put it to you and please
             disagree if it is not either     right or you don't accept it;
             it is possible,    is it not, that if a person having died is
             moved air or stomach contents might be expelled and might
             make a sound as it escapes, so to speak?      Is that a

p o ss ibi lity ? - A- It is an interesting comment, sir, because
it is a p o s s i b i l i t y 1 c o n sid ere d also m y self and that is
cer ta in ly an e x p l a n a t i o n to the noise which could have been
made which may ha ve mim ic ke d the wor d "mum" but it would not
e x p la in the o p e n i n g of the eyes, sir.

No.   - A- Eut   it w o u l d exp lain the noise.

     MR. FRASER:        No questions, sir, but thank you very
much, Dr. Slater,      for that s ym pat heti c and detailed
explanation.

          THE CORONER:    Any other q u es tio ns for Dr. Slater?
Thank you very much, Dr. Slater.           We spent a lot of time
t hi nkin g about thi s sentence beca us e it w a s difficult.     I
didn't think it was possible from what I knew of the
e vi de nc e but, on the other hand, we didn't want you to f ® ® 1

Mr. James S t e phe n W illia ms saw his son, Kev in Daniel^
Williams, leave the family home with the intention of
tr avell in g to Sheffield.      He was to travel by train with a
number of friends to watch the Semi Final football match at
Hi llsb o r o u g h Stadium. Ke vi n had a ticket for the match.

        Andrew D unca n travelled to S he f f i e l d with Kevin, Thom as
James N i c k s o n and Gr egory Fagen.   T h e y t ra v e l l e d by train

Nic kson left them.

     Andrew Duncan entered the s t a diu m with Kevi n at about
1330 hours via the Leppi ng s Lane turnstiles.          They initia  y

friends on the terraces, including A n t h o n y Maxwell Grier an
Stuart Thompson.    Stuart, of course, als o lost his lite at
Hillsborough.

      At about 1455 hours Andrew Du nc an was still with Kevin
and al tho ugh the crowd in the enc los ure was tightly packed
he was not too c onc ern ed at that stage.   As the match
sta rted he was p u shed forward do wn the terrace and did not
see Kevi n again.

         Fo l lowi ng the severe cr us hin g in the West Stand
t e rr aci ng Police Constable Michael John Craighill went into
E n cl osu re 3 a n d ass ist ed a number of casualties.     Police
Cons tabl e Craighill assisted to carry a youth, he now ^
belie ve s to be Kevin, from the gate in the perimeter tence
of Enclo su re 3 and on to the pitch.          The Offi cer attempted
r e s u sc ita tion but without success.

       Derek W i l l iam Bruder, an off- du ty Police Constable from
the Me rseys id e Police who was a sp ectat or at the match,
recalls seein g a person lying on the pitch ne ar the Spion
K op/ No rt h Stand of the ground.      The per son   as having
convulsions.         Mr- Bruder went on to the pitch and gave mouth
to mouth re su sc ita tio n aided by a St. Johns Amb ulanceman wio
carri ed out ca rd iac massage.       Mr. Bru der rec al ls that a
friend of the casualty was with him on the pitch-
Re sus cit atio n was continued and they were joined by a bt,
Johns A m b u l a nc ewom an who took over from Mr. cruder.     Alter a
short time the St. Johns Amb u lan cema n said that the casualty
was dead.       Mr. Brude r then left the scene.

     Neit he r of the St. Johns Am bu la nc e personnel or the
friend of the casualty have bee n identified.       The person
Mr. Bruder tried to resuscitate is now known to be Kevin.

      Special Cons ta bl e Debra Mar tin went on to the pitch to
assist and she hel pe d to carry several dec e a s e d persons and
many injured pe rsons to the gymnasium.      S h e ass ist ed to
carry one youth who she now knows to be Ke vin into the

      At 1606 hours Dr- Curpen exa mi ne d Kev in in the
gymn asiu m which had been estab li sh ed as a tempora ry

                   Evidence is included regard ing the analys is of a blood
             sample taken from Kev in where the pre se nc e of ethanol was
             detected.   The wi tn ess es pr ov in g con t i n u i t y of the blood

             Robert Forrest ca rr ied out the analysis.

                      Foun d in K e v i n ' s personal eff e cts was a ticket
             counte rf oi l whi ch is consistent with his entry to the
             s t a di um via a turnstile.         That con c l u d e s my evidence, sir-
    B        There is visual evidence.

             I think I am right in saying, am I not, that Mr. Bruder (I
             am looking at page 47) identifies Kevi n from clothing, is
             that right? - A. He has been shown p h o t o gra phs which show
             K ev in which Mr. L ayto n will deal with later and one of the
             p h o t o g raph s I be lieve does show Mr. B r u d e r actually giving
             first aid.

        Q-   50    there   is no doubt about     it that Mr.       Br ud er was involved?
        A.   No

        Q. His personal recoll ect ion isn't as s t r o n g ? - A- No, but what
           he does recollect is corrobo ra te d by the visual evidence.

    D   Q.   We have already m en ti on ed the evi den ce of Special Constable
             Mart in who said about the lad speaking.       In no way do I want
             to run poor Special Constable Martin d o w n becau se she had a
             very hard day but it is right she was obvi ou sl y from her
             st ateme nt s very distr ess ed ? - A. I also wouldn't want to
             crit ic is e WPC Mar tin in any way but I have interviewed her
             twice, sir, and she was par tic ular ly upset as indeed many
             people were but it affected her part i c u l a r l y badly the
             even ts of that day.

                  THE CORONER:   Well,          I won't ask you to draw a
             conclusion.  Mr. Fraser.

                   MR. FRASER:     The re is a ma tt er ari sin g out of what the
             Offi ce r says whi ch may perhaps leave a doubt in Kevin s
             parents' minds.     Can I ask you to ask Dr. Slater to deal
             with the point that was made in p a ragr aph six of the
             summary, sir?

                     THE CORONER:      About the c o n v u l s i o n s ?

                     MR- FRASER       Yes. sir-

          MR. FRASER:       No,   thank you,    sir.

          THE CORONER:        I will recall Dr. Slater.

                   DR. DAVID NEIL SLATER - Recalled

                              Bv THE C O R O N E R :

Q. Dr. Slater, the point that is being made, of course, you
   have got to remember that Mr. Bruder was at the Spion Kop
   end, the bottom end and not the top, and he says, “ I saw
   this man lying on the floor havi ng convulsions".       Ca n you
   help us about that? What do es that add or not to your
   pathological op in io n? - A. It is obviously very distressing.
   Unfor tu na te ly when people have not got enough o xyg en in the
   brain, as I said in my earlier evidence, which is really
   what the word "asphyxia" means, individuals can in fact have
   fits.    This is one of the me ch anisms that leads towards
   death and makes the asphyxia worse.      This does, however,
   only occur when the individual is totally unconscious-          It
   does not mean there will 'be any pain or discomfort.        The
   person will not know they are fitting and actually I have to
   accept that some individuals do have convulsions and it is
   one of the mechanisntys leading to death in traumatic
   asphyxia, sir.

Q. Does it make you feel the other evidence about the lad
   breathing and speaking either more or less likely because
   obviously this would be much closer in time to Special
   Constable Ma rtin's evidence than what had happened on the
   terrace? - A. Yes.   For somebody to have convulsions, this
   would imply that the amount of asphyxia is such that there
   must be virtually irreversible brain damage present and
   again this would fully support the concept that the evidence
   of opening eyes and speaking is not really conceivable, sir.

          THE CORONER:       Does that help, Mr. Fraser.

                     C ro ss-Ex am in ed bv MR.    FRASER:

          MR. FRASER:    I am sure it does, Dr- Slater.   It is
     difficult to find the phrase to sum the situation up.     Kevin
     at that stage w as beyond help.  He was as good as d ead ? - A.
     Yes, that is right, absolutely.

Q. And would feel not hing and know nothing? - A. Absolutely.
   He would know nothing.

                                 Officers.   PC Hayes has confirmed his identification on
                                 those photographs.    T h e Of ficer assisted to carry t w o people

                                 couldn't recall any other details and he didn't know the

                                 assisted in carrying.      We have mentioned that before.           It is

                                       A number of photographs, including a photograph
                                  referenced TT1/30 show Kevin being given mouth to mouth
                                  resuscitation on the pitch by PC Bruder who contirmed his
                                  identification.  Sir, you mentioned this Officer earlier.
                                  In fact, it is true to say Mr- and Mrs. Williams have
                                  previously seen visual evidence.  They have in fact seen
                                  some of that visual evidence again today and I think    arn
                                  right in saying they have confirmed that Kevin is shown on
                                  that photograph so, as it were, PC Bruder is confirmed as
                                  having given mouth to mouth resuscitat ion to Kevin.

                               Q. The reason I ask ed is because it refers to a friend and
                                  there doesn't see m to be any other evidence of that.
                               A. No, that is right;   It is true to say the initial
                                  identification was from cl othing but it has subsequently
                                  been confirmed-

Yes,   C 2 0 - And NWJL41     which is a plan of the pitch.

MJC2 are they the same markings? - A. I would say, sir, that
in fact although there are two ma rkings the reference to MAP
7 on the previous plan actually would deal with PC Craighill
on that occasion.

So MWJL41 we make C 2 0 2 . Let us i n c l u d e that one as well
MJC2 will be C 2 0 3 . - A. Which is PC C r a i g h i l l ' s p l a n .
(moved to p l a n ) Sir, if we can deal with the plan MWJL40,
which is the plan of the terraces, the first photograph
DAC3/1 referred to in this sumrnary indicates the position
here (indicat i ng) and this indicates Enclosure No- 3 and it
is at this point here (indicat i n g ) that Kevin is shown quite
close to the perime ter fence.

     the second identification, MAP 7, the BBC tape, refers
to the identification by PC Craighill and the point at which
we see Kevin is ap pr ox im at el y here ( indicat ing) and it if
prior to his removal via Gate 3.

     Then, sir, in respect of PC Cra ig hil l' s plan, MJC2, it
is a terrace plan he refers to but he act ua ll y indicates a.
position here (indi cat i n g) in front of Gate 3 and a further
position which is shown just off the plan but it is here.
It is just on to the pitch-

It is d iagrarnmat ic ? - A'. Yes.

Certai nl y the second location can't be taken as giving us
any sense of distance? - A- No, but factually the next plan
will do that.    I think, sir, just to correct myself I should
have been pointing there.

Yes. - A. Sir, in respect of M W J L 4 1 , the video reference on
BBC tape, MAP 7, indicates a position here C indi cat ing.)
which accords with PC Craigh il l' s recollection.     There is
also photographic identification on PR5/32 which is where
Kevin is being ca rr ie d across the pitch and the location
re ferred to is there (i n d icat ing ) -

Rem ind me do we know the time for that one? - A- Yes, 1
think it is 1532, sir-       Yes, 1532.  A further photograph,
sir, TT1/30, which I think refers to PC B r u d e r , the location
of that is ap pro xi mat el y this position here ( indi cat- i n & )
which is towards the Spion Kop end of the pitch.

                                               Cr oss- Ex am in ed bv MR.   CATCHFOLE:

                               Q- Andrew Duncan, did he show any visual evidence or did he
                                                             * - last
                                  give a plan showing where he   ’-   saw Kevin, when they
                                                                              Can you just give
                           B      parted co mpany? - A- 1 don't believe so
                                  me a moment?   The answer is we don't have a plan from
                                  fir Duncan.

                                         THE CORONER:      If I can help you a little bit on that
                                  one, what Andrew Dun ca n says is, "We stood up and were
                                  standing about two to two and a qu arter y a r d s from the
                                  peri me te r fence around the pitch-     We were waiting for t e
                                  game to start.      At about 1445 or so a gr ou p of friends were
                                  standing behind me, Stuart Thompson and Tony Grier.         I wa&
                                  st and in g with Ke vin Williams".    Then he describes the people
                                  coming out and he says, "When the game kicked off I was
                                  pushed forward down the terrace about two y a r d s . ^ After this
                                  push I lost Kevin and did not see him again".        His final
                                  remark is that he saw Kevin for the last time on the terrace
                                  just before the crush started.        "The last time I saw Kevin
                           D      was on the terrace just before the crush started.        After
                                  this I did not see him again".        That is his statement   just
                                  bo  that we know what it is which one we are ta lking about
                                  dated 17.5.89.      Any th ing else, Mr- Fraser, you want to ask/

                                       MR-   FRASER:    No   sir

                                        THE CORONER:         Mr- and Mrs. Williams, that is the
                           E      evidence we are going to take.           As I said to you in the
                                  middle of the        heari ng we spent quite a lot of time wondering
                                  what we should do for          the best.   Obviously we knew Kevin
                                  lost his life and we were worried about upsetting you in
                                  Court but I think on balance we have done the right thing
                                  because you have heard within the limits of what we are
                                  doing and s u m m a r isi ng the evidence what happened and what
                                  went on.      Fortunately, Dr. Slater has been able to be here
                                  and he has been        able to give you his opinion as to what     ^
                                  happen ed in his       view and what in his view is possible and i
                                  think I am sure        that will help you - not to come to terms
                                  with the loss        of your son but it is very difficult to come
                                  to terms with that loss at all but just to appre ci at e in the
                                  stress situa ti on in which people found them se lv es
                                  rec oll ec ti on s tend some ti me s to be mistaken and indeed there
                                  are lots of mis take n recollections not only in re lation to
                                  Kevin but also in relation to many of the other people o
                                  which we have heard.          That is not at all un common and occurs
                                  in normal fatal incidents as well-           It is exc eedingly
                                  difficult when you are suddenly confronted with a situation
                                  to then recount exactly what happened.

                                      I realise Kevin was a young boy, just fifteen, which ii
                               very very young of course and I would like you ’to know how
                               ver.v sorry we are that he should have lost his life at such
                               an early age in this tragedy.    The Jury have had to deal
                               with many cases but today, at this moment, we are just
                               dealing with yours and so far as we are able we w o u l d like
                               you to know we are conscious of t h a t . Thank you for being
                               here .
                       B            Ladies and gentlemen, we rise for a moment or two and
                               then we proceed to deal with our next Inquest.

                    FURTHER EVIDENCE IN

               THE INQUEST INTO THE DEATH'OF

                   KEVIN DANIEL WILLIAMS


       THE CORONER:    Mow you may remember on Wednesday I
  kept you late.    I said I had to go out and do a little
  bit of thinking, and that is what we are going to deal
  with this afternoon.

        What we were thinking about was that one of the
  inquests which we had done related to Kevin Daniel
  Williams.    I will remind you of this inquest.   This
  was the case of another young man, in fact he was only
  15.    The problem in that case was that the evidence
  was difficult to unravel as to when he died and what
  had happened when he was being taken across the pitch
  and had he said something in the temporary mortuary and
  so on

        After the inquest was concluded my attention was
  drawn by some of my legal colleagues, and very
  rightlybecause they were realised it was a sensitive
  problem and did not want to upset the family, so they
  brought it to my attention privately first.    The point
  which they were bringing to my attention was that one
  of the witnesses appeared to say that when he came to
  this young man at the Spion Kop end, more or less, of
  the ground, he had convulsions and he also said he
  could feel a pulse.     We knew from the visual evidence
  - we are going to repeat all the relevant evidence in a
  moment - we knew that he was being taken across the
  pitch and we had a timing at 1532.    Assuming that was
  right, this convulsion or whatever it was, was
  happening after that point of time.    The question was:
  what on earth was going on?

      I agreed that this was a valid point. I think    we
 were so concerned about the event which happened after
 that, namely, what happened in the gymnasium, did he
 speak or did he not speak - this was the lad with the
 fractured voice box - that we may not have put quite
 enough concentration and thought into the earlier
 evidence, but we are going to do it now.  We are going
 to sort it out so that we know, as far as we are able,
 so that we understand, if we can, what happened.

       I think if Sergeant Killoch could come back.

                         1
             sF.RC KANT JOHN KILLOCH. R e c all ed
                      By THE CORONER:

      THIS WITNESS:  Sergeant John        Killocb    from the
 West Midlands Police.

 Sergeant Killoch, if you read - we are not ^oing Jo
 read the whole summary again because we don t need to
 but I think paragraph 5 which is where somebody starts
 describing helping him from the terraces. - A.
 Following the severe crushing in the West Stand
 terracing Police Constable Michael John Craighill went
 into enclosure 3 and assisted a number of casualties.
 Police Constable Craighill assisted to carry a young
 rnan he now believes to be Kevin Daniel Williams from
 the gate in the perimeter fencing of enclosure 3 and on
 to the pitch.

  The officer attempted resuscitation but without
  success.
  Derek William Bruder is a Police Constable with         the
  Merseyside Police who was off-duty at the match         that
  day.   He was a spectator in the North Stand.           He
  recalls seeing a person lying on the pitch n££r         th£
  Soion ICop and North Standing and describes that        person
  as having convulsion^.
  Mr. Bruder went on to the pitch and gave mouth to mouth
  resuscitation, aided by a St. John's Ambulanceman who
  carried out cardiac massage.      Mr. Bruder recalls that
  a frieod of the casualty was with him on the pitch.
  Resuscitation was conci-nuecf and cney were joined by a
  St. John's Ambulancewoman who took over from Mr. Bruder
  and after a short time by a St. John s Ambulanceman.

  The St. John's Ambulanceman said the casualty was dead
  and Mr. Bruder then left the scene.

  Neither of the St. John's Ambulance personnel or the
  friend of the casualty have been identified.

  The person Mr. Bruder tried to resuscitate is known to
  be Kevin Daniel Williams and there is visual evidence
  to show that, sir.

). Then the next paragraph deals with the lady police
   officer.   Just read that next paragraph as well. - a .
   Special Constable Debra Jane Martin went on to the
   pitch to assist and helped to carry several deceased
   and many injured to the gymnasium.   She assisted to
   carry one young boy, now known to be kevin, into the
   gymnasium and she remained with him.

                              2
                          -       -
                                                                   1 02 4
                           A([.   Now what she said we are not going to deal with because
                                  that was satisfactorily explained.   What we are
                                  interested in is that bit which has been read.    If we
                                  turn to page 41, I think I arn right in saying that what
                                  Mr. Hruder says - he says he saw a person about a
                                  quarter of the pitch length away from the Spion Kop? -
                                  A. l'es.
                           ®f . He was lying on the ground or thereabouts? - A. That is
                                correct, sir.

                                  He says he can remember this because he recollects an
                                  ambulance going past which locates it in his mind and
                                  in fact he tried to flag it down? - A. Yes.

                                  Then he says:

                                       "I saw this man lying on the floor having
                                       convulsions."

                                  - A. That is his exact wording.

                                  Then if we turn over the page and pick out the bits
                                  that are relevant.   He says he went down and he went
                           D      up to this man:
                                       "...and then went to the man having convulsions."

                                  - A. Yes, sir.

                                  Then he says:

                                       "I was joined by a St. John's Ambulanceman.

                                  - A. Yes.
                                       "That chap said, 'You do mouth to mouth and I will
                                       do heart massage'"

                                  - A. That is correct.

                               (&. He goes on to say:
                                       "I then took his pulse in his neck.    I could feel
                                       a slight pulse."

                                  - A. Y e s , sir. *   .

                                  He then tried to resuscitate him, mouth to mouth, and
                                  undressed him so he could do it more conveniently
                                  probably. - A. Yes.

                               0. Then he says:

                                       five minutes he went grey and his face was
                                       withdrawn."

                                  - A. That is right, sir.



                           B
                                  Me also noticed there was something unusual about his
                                  rib cage:

                                       "As I did heart massage his ribs were unnaturally
                                       prominent."

                                  - A. Yes.

                               J. -Then eventually another St. John's Ambulance person
                                  came and he left the man? - A. That is right.

                               }. This whole thing took quite a few minutes? - A. Yes,
                                  obviously the officer had no conception of time.
                           D ).   Can you remind me about the visual evidence?    It is
                                  just to make sure I have got it rignt that there is
                                  visual evidence, both of Mr. Bruder.•• ~ A. One
                                  photographic print was mentioned, sir, and was given
                                  the reference number TT.1/30.   That is a photograph
                                  which shows Kevin lying on the pitch.   The person has
                                  been identified by Kevin's parents.   Shown about to
                                  give mouth to mouth resuscitation of Kevin is a man who
                                  has been identified as Police Constable Bruder.    PC
                                  Bruder has identified himself on that photograph.

                               5. Then there is another timed print, is it PR.5/32 or
                                  PR.5/33, showing Kevin being carried across, paragraph
                                  18? - A. There are two photographs, sir:   PR.5/A/32,
                                  which is timed at 1532 and PR.5/A/33.    That is also
                                  timed at 1532.
                                       THE CORONER:   Inspector Layton, just show us
                                  where those photographs are.

                                       INSPECTOR LAYTON:   Yes, sir.       They are referred
                                  to in the plan MWJL.42.   PR.5/32 is approximately at
                                  this Dosition here on the pitch.       That is the timed
                                  photograph, sir.   TT.130 is not timed, but I believe
                                  it is somewhere in this area h e r e .   From recollection
                                  I think I did that actually from what Mr. Bruder says
                                  in his statement, about the positioning on the pitch.

                                    THE CORONER:   Now Inspector Sawers went to see
                               Mr. Bruder because we wanted to be sure we had the
                               facts.

                                      INSPECTOR MATTHEW ROBERT SAWERS Called

                                                  By THE CORONER:
                           B        THE WITNESS:   Matthew Robert Sawers, Inspector,
                               West Midlands Police.

                               I believe you went to see him yesterday.7 - A. Yes, sir.

                               In fact it was Mr. Bruder's day off but he very
                               willingly gave his time? - A. He did.

                               Now can you summarise for me what he says? - A. Yes,
                               sir.   He starts off by referring and identifying his
                               two previous    statements to us, sir, the first of which
                               was approximately a fortnight afJtjsr the disaster
                               itself, and ci aciuohci statement in August of last year
                               was a very short statement in which he merely
                               identifies himself on the photographs that you have
                           D   heard reference to, sir.

                               He goes on to say that I had shown him a number of
                               documents and plans, from which he was able to refresh
                               his memory.     He refers to the fact he had made some
                               notes on the   day after the disaster but that they did
                               not refer specifically to his dealings with this
                               casualty.

                               He refers, sir, to joining Merseyside Constabulary in
                               1987 and receiving basic first-aid instruction during
                               his initial training.    That was both in theory and
                               practical application.    He refers, sir, following the
                               incident and his dealings with this youth, to feeling
                               he was inadequately trained in his own confidence,
                               although it is also true to say that he is absolutely
                               satisfied that the first aid he rendered on the day was
                               the very best he could do and he felt he could do no
                               more.    He goes on to say as a result of feeling
                               depressed about the incident he applied of his own
                               volition for further first-aid training within
                               Merseyside Police.    Indeed, he attended a full week,
                               Monday to Friday course, leading to a further
                               qualification and much greater confidence in his own
                               ability.    However, with the benefit of that training,
                               sir, he is able to reflect on his actions of the day
                               and he is still absolutely satisfied that the first aid
                               he rendered in terms of mouth to mouth and heart
                               massage were correct and he could have done no more for
                               Kevin.

He goes on then, sir, to deal with specific matters
that I referred him to in his original statement.
Specifically, sir, from the transcript and police file
he deals with page 41 of the police file statements,
which is naee 6 of his original statement in April last
year.   He reters and confirms seeing Kevin a quarter
of the length of the pitch.from the Spion Kop end of
the ground.   He refers to his being on the floor and
clarifies that as on the grass surface of the pitch.

He has given very careful consideration, sir, to the
expression that he used of having convulsions and in
the light of his further training and what he now knows
and thinks about the incident was that "convulsions"
was not the word that was applicable to these
circumstances.   He refers specifically to having seen
epileptic fits and says that what he originally
described as a convulsion was not anything like an
epileptic fit.   He goes on to say later, sir, that if
there was a part of the body that he saw move it was
his head and that the word that he best thinks
describes this movement is that of a twitch.

He refers to comments he made originally about
approaching the body, the body that was convulsing.
Having specifically considered it again, sir, he does
say that the body was not convulsing as he approached
it.   He referred originally, sir, to feeling for a
carotid pulse and originally he thought he had detected
a slight pulse.   On reflection, sir, he feels he would
be much more skilful if he were required to perform
this action again and he cannot discount the
possibility that he did not feel immediately in the
right place for the carotid artery.    He certainly felt
in the neck region where he  thought he would find the
artery but he cannot say he would have gone to it
directly.

I put to him, sir, the specific point I believe Or.
Slater made in his evidence  about this inquest a couple
of days ago and PC Bruder specifically discounts having
felt for the carotid artery with his thumb.    He refers
to the first two fingers of his left hand.

fie says in dealing with the carotid pulse that  he may
have touched other areas around the neck region,
including the Adam's apple and that whatever h£ felt
there he cannot be categoric it was a pulse.     He feels
he may well be mistaken in that matter, sir.

Later in his statement of April last year, sir, he
referred to the face of Kevin Williams going grey and
being withdrawn.   He wanted you to know, sir, that he
cannot specifically say he saw the face change from a


                                                            1028
                               normal pallor, or colour, to grey.   He mentioned it in
                               his statement, sir, in the sequence that it occurred to
                               him that he was now noticing that he was grey.   He may
                               have been grey as he approached him before he mentioned
                               it, or it may have occurred as he noticed it.



                           B




                               He referred in his original statement to the original
                           D   resuscitation attempts whereby he gave mouth to mouth
                               resuscitation and the St. John's Ambulanceman commenced
                               heart compressions.   His original thought, sir, was
                               that that was for approximately seven minutes and, give
                               or take, he is happy with that time and thinks it is
                               reasonably accurate.     He then later referred to
                               swopping over with the St. John's Ambulanceman and PC
                               Derek Bruder was then involved in external heart
                               compressions and this was when he noticed the unusual
                               rib cage and he had earlier referred, sir, to
                               unbuttoning his shirt, I believe.     He referred to
                               unzipping his trousers [~ "    "



                               I have put to him the apparent difficulties in the time
                               sequence of the action that he describes near the Spion
                               Kop end of the ground and his specific reference to am
                               ambulance and asking the St. Jphn's Ambulance colleague
                               whp was assisting nim and who hjts nuc been identified,
                               fco stop tne aifouianuc because he was considering
                               utilising it, sir.

                               I have drawn his attention to the problems in relation
                               to the known timing of ambulances arriving on the
                               pitch, both of St. John's and of the South Yorkshire
                               Metropolitan Ambulance Service and I have drawn his
                               attention to the qpp^rent discrepancy in relation to
                               the time shown on photographs PR.5/A.32 and 3, sir.


                           H                        - 7 -                                1029

                 A ). The point is that the ambulances were known to arrive
                      at about 1515 and 1517 or thereabouts? - A. Yes, sir.

                     . And the photograph, PR.5/A/32 and so on, is timed at
                       1532? - A. That is correct, sir.

                     . We are saying he was dealing with this young boy after
                       that? - A. That is correct.

                     . In fact I put the wrong times to you.   It is 1515 on
                       the pitch for the St. John's Ambulance and 1520 for the
                       first South Yorkshire... - A. That is correct, sir,
                       irrespective of which...

                     . It is still earlier... - A. It is still earlier than
                       1532, sir, and that point has been put specifically to
                       Hr. Bruder and try as he may he is simply ur. ible to
                       reconcile those differences.   I have put to him, sir,
                       was it for instance a question of one of those
                       ambulances actually exiting the stadium across the
                       pitch rather than entering the stadium.   He has
                       considered that point and try as he may his
                       recollection is still of it being an ambulance that
                 D     entered the stadium.

                       He refers then to being joined by the woman St. John s
                       Ambulance Officer, who he refers to pushing him out of
                       the way to become involved as a trained first aider and
                       recollects this was approximately six minutes after he
                       changed places with the male ambulance officer#   for
                       that reason, with the original seven minutes mouth to
                 E     mouth resuscitation, PC Bruder feels that that total of
                       thirteen minutes he could amend to a period of time of
                       between ten and fifteen minutes of sustained attempts
                       to resuscitate Kevin.

*                      It was at this point, sir, that after approximately two
                       minutes of the involvement of the woman St. John s
                       Ambulance Officer, that the male St. John's Ambulance
                 F     Officer stood up and said, "He's gone."    He referred
                       to the expression being completely grey and would seek
                       to reaffirm that choice of words as his description of
                       Kevin at that particular moment in time.   He says,
                       sir, and I quote:

                            "There is absolutely no doubt in my mind, both now
                            and with the benefit of further training, that
                            then at the moment the youth I had tried to save
                            was dead, certainly dead, and beyond any further
                            help.   I and St. John's Ambulance personnel would
                            not have stopped if there had been any glimmer of

He refers to the personal description of Kevin again,
sir, and refers to the fact he is r.bsolutely satisfied
it was Kevin Williams that he was attempting to
resuscitate.

     THE CORONER:   I just want to make it crystal
clear that there is no suggestion in any of this of any
criticism of PC Bruder*   I think he did absolutely
valiantly and did his best.   Not only did he do his
best on the day, he is doing his best today as well,
through Inspector Sawers, to try and help us understand
what he remembers and I want that clearly understood by
everybody.   I don't want you to think w e are knocking
him.  We are not.  All I am trying to do is finding out
what happened.

      Mr. Fraser, any questions of this o f f i c e r o n this
part?    I had Detter tell you who else I am going to be
calling.    Dr. Slater and Dr. Gurnpert, whom I will tell
you about when he comes.    He is a neuro physiologist,
a clinician, and an expert on this sort of thing.

     MR. FRASER:    No, sir, I have no specific
questions, save to say that I understand, Officer, you
have spoken to Mr. and Mrs. Williams, having spoken to
the officer?    I rise because I appear for Mr. and Mrs.
Williams and obviously have their interests at heart.

     THE WITNESS:   I did go and. visit Mr. and Mrs.
Williams, sir, yesterday evening, having seen PC Bruder
and I have outlined briefly to them the contents of PC
Bruder's further thoughts and recollections for Kevin
on the day.

     MR. FRASER:   Sir, I understand they are
appreciative, both of the efforts the officer has made
and of his visit and they have no questions.   They
have decided not to come today, sir, for reasons which
I am sure you will understand but they are fully aware
of exactly what is going on on their behalf.

     THE CORONER:      Thank you.    Have you got any
questions?

      MR. LIMB:     No, thank you.

      MR. CATCHPOLE:     No, thank you, sir.

     THE CORONER:   When we have heard the rest of the
evidence I am quite prepared to recall any of these
officers, or, indeed, any of these witnesses because I
want us to understand it.

      Dr. Slater.

                                                                 1031
                        A                        DR. DAVID SLATER Recalled
                                                      Bv THE CORONER:

                                3. Dr. Slater, you have, of course, already dealt with
                                   this case a couple of days ago.      If I remember rightly
                                   you said, among other things, that (a) this lad had a
                                   broken voice box.   It was broken in four places.
                        B          Also (b) he was, of all the cases you dealt with,
                                   perhaps the most asphyxiated, if one can judge that by
                                   cyanosis and so on.   Would that be a correct      ^
                                   recollection? - A. That is absolutely correct, sir.      Ot
                                   all the cases I dealt with Kevin showed really the
                                   worst injuries to the neck in that there were four
                                   fractures to the voice box.      In addition there were
                                   three very large scratches; to the neck.     In addition
                                   to cne normal signs ot asphyxia, the blueness and the
                                   hemorrhages which were v e r y marked, there is no doubt
                                   this was a very, very severe case of asphyxia and
                                   probably the worst one I dealt with, sir.

                                -Q. We established to everybody's satisfaction what had
                                    happened in the gymnasium and the account, we dealt
                                    with that as to whether this lad could have spoken and
                        D           so on, so we don't need to be concerned about that.
                                    What we are interested in this afternoon is the
                                    evidence relating to Mr. Bruder.   I will also remind
                                    you that in general that what has been said is that a
                                    person becomes unconscious in an asphyxial situation
                                    within anything from zero to twenty to thirty seconds.
                                    There is a slight variation amongst pathologists, but
                            E       quickly.   Then that death usual supervenes within four
                                    to six minutes or thereabouts.   The problem is, as you
                                    have already heard, that whichever way you look at it,
                                    Mr. Bruder was dealing with this young man quite a few
                                    minutes after he had been taken out from the Leppings
                                    Lane terraces.

                                   In the light of the evidence can you help us as to
                                   you think was going on on? - A. Yes, sir.   I will dea
                                   with this in three general areas and then Dr. Gumpert
                                   certainly will come and enlarge on these and help us
                                   out further.
                                   Firstly, and I apologise if this is an emotive area, I
                                   think I need just to spend thirty seconds in explaining
                                   what death is. - - Death is a sequence of events.   It is
                                   not one set event and the sequence I will put to you is
                                   an individual becoming unconscious;    whilst they are
                                   unconscious they quickly lose all sensation of pain and
                                   discomfort;  then there is a period of various tissues
                                   in the body which are susceptible to a lack of oxygen,
                                   dying.   The most important one of these is, of course,
                                   the brain, and after about three to six minutes the

                            H                             - 10 -                                 1032

    brain undergoes irreversible brain damage.    There is
    then a point which we call brain death.    This is a
    difficult concept, but by this I am implying that the
    brain is irreversibly damaged.   The brain is no longer
    able to control respiration and in fact that person,
    for effective purposes, is dead, irreversibly.    That
    is a medico legal definition, #t least one medico legal
    definition, of death.
B
    The problem now comes that I have not mentioned other
    tissues in the body.   For example, the heart, a very
    emotive organ.   When somebody is brain dead it is
    quite possible that the heart is still alive and still
    beating and this can go on for a few minutes or longer,
    perhaps even half an hour.
C   Then we come to the point where the brain is dead, not
    controlling respiration, and finally the heart stops
    and that is really the point of whole body death and
    that is really what the lay person understands by
    death.  A doctor going up, putting the stethoscope on
    the chest, no heart beat, no respiration, then that
    person is unequivocally dead.
D   I hasten to add there that although the person is truly
    medico legally dead, in fact even then there are
    tissues in the body that are still alive.^    The skin is
    still living.    The kidneys are still living.   This is
    how we can then transplant them.     In fact it is an
    emotive area and although that person is dead, there
    are still tissues living.    It then takes another six
E   to twelve hours for all the tissues in the body to die.

    Really, when we use the word "death" we have to be
    very, very careful we are not talking about one set
    event at one point in time.   We are talking about a
    whole continuum of events that go on.

    I mentioned that some tissues do not die as rapidly as
F   the brain and this includes both nerves and muscle.
    In fact one can have a situation of somebody being
    brain dead but the muscles and the nerves in what we
    call the peripheral nervous system - not the brain -
    are still living and in fact these can occasionally
    function in some way.

    Sir, that is a -general comment on death.

    In relation to the Hillsborough incident, the sequence
    that myself has given, and although I have not heard
    the other pathologists I understand they have given a
    very similar sequence of events, has been a rapid loss
    of consciousness, perhaps five to ten seconds.   I
    understand I have been the nearest by quoting a paper
H
                                                                1033
A       where unconsciousness can be instantaneous.       That is
        the rapid loss of consciousness.

        As soon as that person becomes unconscious I have said
        several times that pain modalities, discomfort, again
        disappear very, very quickly, perhaps within a second
        or five seconds.

B       In very general terms, certainly myself - and I have
        tried to keep it general - I then said that death - and
        I have used the word very broadly, as you will
        appreciate in iny previous evidence - that death occurs
        five, ten perhaps fifteen minutes after.    I purposely
        kept that very open because human beings are very
        variable.   You cannot say that somebody is going to
        die in fifteen minutes, and not in fifteen minutes.
C
        I am trying to put the concept that although I have
        talked about averages, very occasionally you are going
        to have additional extremes.   I think K e v i n w a s one of
        these extremes that did not fall into this five, ten or
        fifteen minute sequence of somatic death, whole body
        death, but in fact this was extended.
D       Having said that, Kevin had extremely severe asphyxia.
        I have no doubt in my own mind that he had suffered
        irrecoverable brain damage and death within the three
        to six minutes that I said.   Therefore, I am quite
        confident at that cime cnat Kevin was dead and there is
        nothing that anybody on this earth could have done for
        him after that time, including PC Bruder and any
E       ambulance people who arrived.

        Again, you will appreciate from what I have said to you
        that although Kevin was brain dead I have not said that
        other tissues in the body may not have been living -
        the heart, muscles, nerves.      In fact I know Dr-
        Gi'mi>ert will explain in a minutfi that in fact there are
        mechanisms whereby wTien aomeDody is brain dead in fact
F       the muscles in the body can twitch.      This will come as
        a surprise, and I apologise if it is emotive, this can
        even happen to somebody who hasn't got a head.      That
        person is clearly dead, they haven't got a head, but
        those persons can actually have twitches in their^
        muscles.     This is what happened to Kevin.    He died
        early - brain death - but unfortunately in this
        particular instance we are talking about an extreme^
G       case where perhaps the heart beating went on for a bit
        longer and we noticed these twitches, at least PC.
        Bruder noticed these twitches in the body.

    I   I feel this is what happened in the case of Kevin.



                                                                        1034
From the description - in fact it is only fair to say
yon also had a word with PC Bruder because you were
concerned, you wanted to be quite sure that you
understood his evidence personally, so to speak? - A.
Yes, sir.

In the light of what you heard and what we have heard
now, do you feel that this lad died, if you like, in
the totality sense, I don't meant that- his skin was
dead, but in lay terms at the point in time when Mr.
Bruder was with him? - A. Yes, sir, I am quite
confident of that.   When one speaks to lay people who
have experienced people dying, a word which is
recurrent in these descriptions of death is the way
that individuals turn grey.   In fact I was very
impressed by the content in PC Bruder's statement of
the word "grey", recurring several times.    To me as a
doctor that implied that that was the point of whole
body death.   In fact I feel that it was probably
around that time that Kevin's whole body died.    His
brain had died twenty/twenty five minutes before that
at the time of the crusning, but his whole body died at
the time PC Bruder was with him.

We have mentioned these twitches and I think sometimes
they are referred to as spinal reflexes? - A. that is
correct, sir.

     THE CORONER:   Now, Mr. Fraser, is that reasonably
clear?

     MR. FRASER:   Even to me, sir, thank you, and I am
sure it will be clear to the family.

     THE CORONER:   Any questions?

            Cross-Examined by MR. LIMB:

Doctor, it is an emotive subject.   I remember in your
evidence about Kevin you described death in terms of a
process rather than as a moment? - A. Yes.

I would like to ask you a few questions about the
process following unconsciousness.   As I understand
it, in the cases of these victims, unconsciousness has
come ten to twenty seconds after compression of the
chest? - A. Yes«-

Tnat is as a result of oxygen to blood mix leading to
unconsciousness? - A. Yes.   There are various...    We
are now not talking about the actual cause of death,
but mechanisms.   One very profound view that has been
put forward of crush asphyxia, traumatic asphyxia, it
is not simply only the reduction of oxygen going to the

                     - 13 -
                                                          1035
brain, but the fact that in fact there cannot be
circulation through the brain.   The pressure from the
chest is reflected up into the brain so in fact
effectively the cerebral circulation stops, so it comes
up against a dead end and it cannot circulate round.
But, yes, your concept then is right.

Following unconsciousness, that is to say, twenty
seconds^ say, after the start of the crush becoming^
        is the body capable of facial expressions or
uoes it have a neutral expression? - A. First of all
the word "unconscious" itself is a very vague term, as
you probably appreciate.    There are varying degrees of
unconsciousness - superficial unconsciousness, perhaps
a sort of sleeping...    You are unconscious, really,
vfhen you are sleeping, and then, of course,
unconsciousness becomes deeper and deeper and deeper.
The deeper bit is when one truly loses pain sensations
and in fact in this particular instance having spoken
both to Dr. Gumpert and, indeed, a consultant
anaesthetist, everybody I have spoken to is confident
that pain modalities have disappeared very quickly,
perhaps within one or two seconds, five seconds is the
longest I have heard somebody express.

As I understand your evidence, following that short
period of five, ten, twenty seconds at the most, there
is profound unconsciousness rather than, say, the
unconsciousness of sleep.   Is the face then of the
unconscious person, the profoundly unconscious person,
capable of expression of any sort, or is there a
neutral expression? - A. I think I prefer to leave that
to Dr. Gumpert because you are into a clinical^area
there of what we call reflexes.   I am not trying to
avoid the question.   I think he will be able to give
you a very expert professional witness reply to that.
Would that be reasonable to you?

     MR. LIMB:   Certainly.     Sir, may I pursue that
matter with Mr. Gumpert?

        THE CORONER:    Certainly.    I want to be as
helpful as I can.       It is a difficult subject and in a
sense we are slotting it into the inquest. of^this poor
boy, but it is a more general topic and it wilij^ot
c u m s e , apply in a sense to everybodyt but t don t see
how we can avoid doing it.        Please do pursue it with
Dr. Gumpert.

     Thank you, Dr. Slater.

                                  fact you dropped all your other arrangements in order
                                  to be here.    Thank you very much.   Dr. Guinpert, you,
                                  of course, had nothing whatever to do with this ^a s e *
                                  I think you dealt with quite a lot of the injured
                       D          following Hillsborough ana inueea you may well know one
                                  or two people I will be referring to later, but this
                                  particular case was not one you came across.     You have
                                  heard the evidence which has been put regarding this^
                                  young man.    What I would like you to do now is to give
                                  us a short explanation, as you see death, in the rirst
                                  instance and then we will try and relate it to this
                           E      young man and particularly Mr. Bruder s evrdence
                                  relating to him. - A. In about 1979 or 1980 when it
                                  became possible to carry out renal transplantations or
                                  kidney transplantations, it became very important that
                                   the supply of kidneys of people who had died acutely,
                                  usually in accidents, could be increased because the
                                   life of a patient who has had a kidney transplant is
                                  completely different to the life of a patient
                                   to have dialysis three times a week.    They can go back
                                   to normal life.
                                   A hypothesis of brain death was then discussed, agreed
                                   and published.    This consisted of certain examinations
                                   of the back part of the brain, the part we call the
                                   brain stem.    If you imagine the brain as being like
                                   walnut, and it is., it is like having a c a r r o t stuck
                                   underneath the walnut, and it is the carrot that
                                   matters.    This is where blood pressure, pulse,
                                   respiration and a whole variety of other functions are
                                   controlled.    Once this part of the brain is dead, and
                                   this death occurs, as you heard from Dr. Slater, in
                                   between four and six minutes after deprivation of
                                   oxygen, then the person is going to die.        They can be

                                   kept alive by artificial means and some of you may
                                   remember the case in America which was kept alive for
                                   thirteen and a half years.

                                   Some of us were concerned that the guidelines that were
                                   drawn up were not strict enough and that there was no
                                   call for them to be repeated after a passage of time.
                                   Perhaps unwisely we said this and this resulted in a
                          B        BBC "Panorama" programme one night at ten o clock when
                                   the medical profession for once actually debated it,
                                   <;ight of us.   As a result of that debate the
                                   regulations were hardened.    They had to be carried out
                                   by senior people who were used to doing it and they had
                                   to be repeated.    A satisfactory outcome from my
                                   personal point of view, although I don't know whether
                                   the anguish was worth it really.

                                   As a consequence of that I suppose in the next three
                                   years I had to go through this rather unpleasant
                                   procedure many times.   It was part of m y professional
                                   duty but still to this day I cannot certify someone
                                   dead without being disturbed by it still.

                                   From this I suppose I have gained a great deal of
                          D        experience of brain death and brain damage. ^ It seems
                                   clear to me, sir, in this case that poor Kevin was
                                   grobablv dead before he was .got out of. thfi area in
                                   yjiich he was standing.   I would agree with Dr. Slater.
                                   I would think consciousness was lost probably within
                                   ten seconds.    I would say loss of pain would be almost
                                   instantaneous - not quite, but almost.

                                   I cannot explain the.Liverpool Police Constable s term
                                   "convulsion"
                                    L .U I I V     because to me
                                                               w a
                                                                 - convulsion
                                                                   w — - - - ----------------------------- is a f major ,
                                   epileptic attack and he has quite clearly said he does
                                   not mean that, so I don't know what he does mean.                                      I
                                   think it would be wrong for me to try and guess what he
                                   means.      I think we could accept that he does not mean
                                   any significant movement.
                                   Unfortunately, after people are brain stem dead, they
                                   can twitch and very unnerving it is too.        1S
                                   really due to a spinal reflex.  What we think happens
                                   in anoxia - lack of oxygen - is that the brain stem
                                   dies first.   The cortex, that is the thinking part of
                                   the brain, your walnut, probably goes on quite ^ “l t .
                                   longer and the-peripheral nervous system probably quite
                                   a bit long still and I think that is the explanation of
                                   what has been described by the Liverpool officer.

                              Q.
                                   I know the Liverpool officer in his supplemental
                                   statement when he was discussing the question of a
                                   pulse says he may have been mistaken, but let us
                                   hypothesise that in fact he wasn't and he had felt a
                          H                                          -   16   -

                                                                                                                              1038

       pulse when he approached this young man on the pitch,
       would that fit in with your understanding...   Is that
       a possibility? - A. It la a possibility, sir.   I would
       like just to observe that feeling the carotid pulse is
       quite difficult in somebody who has got a low blood
       pressure, as would have been here.   In fact it can be
       so difficult it is impossible and you have to put an
       electrocardiogram on to know whether the heart has
B      stopped or not.

       I would also like to say something about resuscitation.
       I was very fortunate when I qualified that I became
       house surgeon of a famous heart surgeon called Lord
       Brock at Guy's Hospital.   That was in the days when we
       did open cardiac massage.   In other words, if somebody
       died you opened their chest and you massaged their
       heart between your hands.   A terrifying experience.
       It was while I was working for him that one day three
       of us were doing it one morning, that he stopped it,
       and that was the start of external cardiac massage.
       Even to somebody like me who has been doing it f°r
       twenty-five years, it is still very difficult.    The
       last time I tried to do it I failed completely.    Even
       to a trained person it is difficult.   Indeed, when
T)
       junior doctors are examined for this now, as they are,
       a significant number fail rather than pass.    It is
       quite difficult and for the lay person it must be
       incredibly difficult.

     0. You heard Dr. Slater's account of death, shall we say.
        Would you go along with that? - A. I thought it was
E       eloquent.   I felt quite nervous!

     Q. You mentioned this point about unconsciousness and the
        loss of pain and I think you distinguish slightly
        there.   Can you give me any idea that if a person
        becomes unconscious, can he feel pain, and for how long
        can he feel pain, in your judgment? - A. Again, Dr.
        Slater put it very clearly.      You all read in the
        newspapers about patients - particularly when they have
        had caesarean sections, the ladies as usual - being ^
        able to tell what the doctors were talking about during
        the operation.     Again I have experienced this at first
        hand when I was doing heart surgery because then it was
        often very important not to depress the state of      ^
        consciousness too far because things were pretty tricky
        anyhow-.   When- we. used to resuscitate the patients we
        used to give them an electric shock.      Lord Brock used
        to always shout, "Give it two fast ones."      The patient
        would then ask you the following morning two fast ones
        were.    Then you would ask, "Did you hear anything
        else?" and they didn't, so it is all very much a
        question of degree.

                                  I think slipping from slight unconsciousness to deep
                                  unconsciousness in this circumstance, one, because of
                                  the compression and two because of the asphyxia and^
                                  three because as Dr. Slater again explained everything
                                  is shoved up into the head and so there is nothing
                                  moving around, it would have been very quick, almost as
                                  quick as a rabbit punch I would have thought.

                           B           THE CORONER:     Mr. Fraser?

                                       MR. FRASER:     No questions,    sir.

                                              Cross-Examined by MR. LIMB:

                               Q. Dr. Guinpert you have spoken in terms of passing in a
                                  very quick space of time from slight unconsciousness to
                                  deep unconsciousness.    Following deep unconsciousness,
                                  do the eyelids remain open or are they closed? - A.
                                  Either may occur.   There is no particular rule.   The
                                  thing we all see on the cinema of the person going to
                                  close the dead person's eyes.    I don't think I have
                                  had to do that more than two or three times in my life.
                                  Most of the people I have seen die have died with their
                           D      eyes shut.

                               Q. Deep unconsciousness is associated with no longer
                                  feeling any pain or discomfort.   Is then the face of
                                  the person who is profoundly unconscious capable of ^
                                  grimaces or expressions which might be taken as showing-
                                  pain or discomfort? - A. Not in my view, sir.

                           E Q.   Is it in fact capable of any facial expression? - A.
                                  Not in my view.

                               0. Following profound unconsciousness, is it right that
                                  the face will become discoloured towards the next stage
                                  of the sequence of events, namely, brain damage and
                                  thereafter brain death?

                                       THE CORONER:     Could you repeat that question?

                                       MR. LIMB:   I am referring back to the process, or
                                  the sequences of events as outlined by Dr. Slater,
                                  Firstly, unconsciousness, thereafter brain damage and
                                  thereafter again brain death.   The nature of my
                                  inquiry was as to whether following profound
                                  unconsciousness^ although there may be no outward
                                  expressions there is this change that the face becomes
                                  discoloured?

                                       THE CORONER:      The greyness you are driving at?

                                       HR. LIMB:      Sir,    that is right.

                                  think the greyness came on or just the way it changed.I
                                  cannot tell you when it came on.      I think probably jj.t
                                  came on during the unconscious stage and I don t think
                                  the Face would change when the moment of death came,
                                  total somatic death, I d o n ’t think there would be any
                                  change.
                           B o.        MR. LIMB:   Doctor, I am asking whether it happens
                                  following the entry into unconsciousness towards the
                                  next stage in the sequence, namely, brain damage? - A.
                                  I don't think there is a change of facial expression at
                                  the time of brain damage necessarily.   This change of
                                  expression will be a gradually evolving process from
                                  the minute the crush started.

                                          MR. LIMB:      Thank you, sir.

                                  a person that  they  are dead or unconscious, at least I
                                    n't.
                                  can't.   You  can by  feeling them but you can t by
                                  looking at them.

                           D                          Further bv THE CORONER:

                               0. If a person has been, shall we say, somatically dead
                                  for long enough, would you accept or would you agree
                                  that sometimes the face goes paler? - A. Oh, it goes
                                  paler, and becomes rigid and takes on a stare.   Yes,
                                  that is quite different.

                           E              THE CORONER:      Anything else you wanted to ask on
                                  that?

                                          MR. LIMB:      No, thank you, sir.

                                          MR. CATCHPOLE:      No questions, sir.

                                       THE CORONER:         Is there anything else we want to
                                  ask Dr. Slater?         (No)

                                       Ladies and gentlemen, I will give you a chance.
                                  It is emotive but it is also v ery interesting.  Is
                                  there anything else while we have two experts here?
                                  You have understood it as far as one is able to
                                  understand it?

                                          THE FOREMAN:'     Yes.

                                       THE CORONER:  Dr. Gumpert and Dr. Slater, may I
                                  say to both of you, you have done remarkably well in
                                  explaining what is clearly a very (a) emotive and (b;^
                                  difficult subject, succinctly and clearly to all of us
                                  and I very much appreciate your help.   Dr. Slater has
                           H                                 - 19 -

                           A   had to come as well, but not quite so far, and I am
                                very grateful to you for taking the trouble and the
                                time to come and I am sure it will be of benefit not
                                just to Kevin's family, but to other people who of
                                course are involved in this tragedy as well.    Thank
                                you very much indeed.

                           _         MR. FRASER:    Sir, I will certainly make sure that
                           ®   Kevin's family have the opportunity to see the
                                transcript of what the doctors have said and I am sure
                                they will feel some benefit from that when they feel
                                able to look at it.    Thank you, sir.

   There were people getting off the train who obviously
   weren't going to the match*    If you were like a lad they
   asked, they said, "Are you going to the match?      If you
   said, "Yes*', they said, "Go that way."

Q.   Did they check your tickets or anything at all that     you

Q.    Did you go straight in or did you do a bit of shopping?
     A. Well, the ground wasn't open so we walked round for a
     bit.    We went to the shops and just walked round until
     about half past one.

Q. That was you and Kevin? - A. Yes.
          Q. Both of you had tickets, I take it? - A. Yes.

          Q. Were there people going down the tunnel at that time
               already or... - A. There were a few, but there wasn t
               many people.

          Q-   It wasn't too bad anyway? - A. No.

          Q. You came out of the tunnel and you entered the terracing?
               - A. Yes.
               Did you go left or right, can you remember? - A. At first
               we went left and then we decided to go to the right.

          Q« You just thought that would be better? - A.   i e s.


          Q. There wasn't any other reason for changing at that point?
               - A. No.
               Do you know what time it was when you got into the right
               hand pen? - A. Probably about twenty-five to two/twenty
               to two.
               How would you describe it at that time? - A. Well, it was
               pretty empty because we actually sat down on tne
               terracing.

          Q. With the passage of time of course it started filling up?
               - A. Yes.
               You were standing fairly near to the perimeter fence, is
          Q.
               that right? - A. Yes.

          Q. Fairly near to the front?     In line with the goal, or a
               bit further? - A. Just right of the goal.
                                                 A. DUNCAN


You were lust talking and waiting for the x.atch to start?
- A- Yes.'

At that scaga I taka it nothing concerned you,_ apart from
the fact that Liverpool shouldn't lose? - A. Yes.

It happened that you actually saw two of your friends,
Stuart Thompson and Tony Grier, is that right? - A. Yes.

I know what time you said in your statement, but do you
remember about what time you saw them? -A. Well, it was
pretty full then so we didn't speak to them, we just saw
them.   They were further up.

They were behind you, were they? - A. Yes.

when you saw them can you remember Tony climbing up on to
a barrier? - A. M o .

You don't remember that? - A. No.

It doesn't matter, you may not have been watching him at
that particular moment.   Do you remember a beach ball
being knocked about? - A. Yes.

Was that at about the same time as you saw Tony or was it
earlier or later? - A. I can't remember.

Can you remember the players coming on to the pitch,
pre kick-off? - A. Yes.

Were you still in the same position? - A. Yes.

At that point, what was it like? - A. Just like a normal
game, really.   A bit of pushing and that but not bad.

Nothing that concerned you at that stage? - A. No.

You of course were excited, the match was going to oeg-n
soon, you hoped.  Did you see the kick-off? - A. They
were about to kick-off - I didn't actually see it because
of people pushing about.   You were sort of moving round
everywhere.

So when the players came out pre kick-off, it was
like a normal match as far as you were concerned. - A.
Yes.
Just before kick-off something had happened.   Tell me
what had happened in that period between the players
coming out and kick-off? - A. Well, there was a bit of  _
pushing and moving round and that, then I don t know.   I
just don't remember actually seeing any of the game, so 1
obviously can't remember seeing the kick-off.
                                                   A. DUNCAN


You say you don't, remember the game at all? - A. Not
reallv.

When the slavers tame cut         vou ao rememoer, was
Kevin still with you? - A. Yes.

What happened to Kevin?    When did you last catch a
glimpse of him? - A. .Well, there was a big push forward
and he went off to the right a bit.    He said something,
"It's a bit packed, isn't it?"    Then I didn't see nim
after that.

Are you saying you felt a big push then? - A. Yes.

Where did that push take you?   Did it leave you.in the
position that you were in, but more squashed, or did it
move you? - A. It moved you forward and you were
squashed, but normally what would happen is it would go
back.   You know, people would push back.

That's what didn't happen? - A. No.

We have tended to use the word "surge", but you can use
"push", it doesn't matter.   How many of these pushes did
you feel, just the one or more than one? - A. Well, there
was the first one and then it didn't move back andthen
another one came, a bigger one.

There was a bigger one after the first one.   Did the
first one move back or not? - A. It did slightly.  It
eased off slightly.

Not as much as you would expect? - A. No.

Then the second one was much stronger? - A. Yes.

But you don't know what was happening with the game.     - A.
No
You were fairly near the front. Had you seen    the gate
which is in the fence? - A. Yes.

You had seen that.   Could you see what happened to that
gate? - A. Well, there were people shouting for tne
Police or stewards or whatever on the other side^or tne
fence, for them to open it because they were. getting
crushed.   No-one opened it and then I think some_o. tne
crowd who were in front of it started pushing on it to
get it open and it came open.   Then a few Policemen ran
over and shut it again and were leaning on it.   After
about five minutes or so - I think they got it locked
again, and then after about five minutes or so one or
them opened it.
                                                                             45

    Q. So you wera saying this happened.  Did this happen
       after kick-off cr just at kick-off cr iefcra kick-
       off? - A. It was aftar the kick-off.
B
    Q. You think it was aftar? - A. Yes.

    Q. You are saying it was opened by some fans who pushed
       it open? - A. Yes.

    Q.   Did you see any of them run on to the field? - A. A
         few ran out and then when the Police had seen them
         run out they ran over and shut it, leaned against it.

    Q. Did they get them back in, can you ramember? - A.
       They tried to.  I.am not sure whether they ran off in
       another direction, I am not sure.

    Q. I cannot hear you? - A. I am not sure whether they
       ran off in a different direction or the Police could
       not get them.

    Q. We have heard from several young men who were
       standing at the gate and who ran out into the field.
       What I am trying to find out is what you remember.
       You remember this happening.  You remember the gate
       being shut? - A. Yes.

    Q. How confident are you about your timings? - A. I
       could not really tell you.  I am not tco c a r t a m .

    Q.   Do you know how long the match        played frcm c e g m n i n g
         to end? - A.I did not know at         the time.  I have
         heard since.

    Q. Pardon? - A. I have heard sinca but I d i d n ’t knew at
       the time.

    Q. What I am trying to find out is whether you ara
       saying the gate was shut for the whole of the
       duration of the match because the match only played
       for five minutes? - A. I do not think sc.

    Q. Did you see a Police Officer open the cata or was it
       the fans that opened it the second time z z a z you
       noticed? - A. I could not really be certain.     I- was
       either a Policeman or am ambulanceman, I thank,     one
       of the St. John Ambulance or what have you.

    Q. You were standing in the crowd and there was a man in
       front of you who was not very well, is that righ .
       A. Yes.
    q   . Somebody shouted to you and said,        "Try and revive
          him", is that right? - A. Yes.

A. Yes.
And surging, as you have told us, with people coming

You said that you started to feel, and I am
paraphrasing now I think the impression you 9^v® anc-
tall'me if I am wrong about this or if I am right.
It started to get bad when this first big surge came
just when they were about to kick off? - A. Yes.

I wanted to ask you about that because you were asked
by the Coroner whether you actually saw the kick-of^
and you said you had not.  By that you meant you did
not actually see someone kicking the ball?  You did
not see Rush kicking the ball? - A. No.

When you say they were just about to kick off, do you
mean they were standing in the centre circle ready wC
kick off? ~ A. Yes.

     THE CORONER:  Mr. Manning, shall we adjourn new?
Did you say, yes or no, Mr. Manning?

witness. Shall we try?
     THE CORONER:  It is easier for him but I do not
want anybody to feel rushed.

     MR. MANNING:    I actually think it would be
better.
     THE CORONER:   Go bead, Mr. Manning.

the       and tia. is when he said or you said, I sun
net sura, "It is a bit packed, isn't it?"? - A. Yes,
he said it.

It was him who said it and you agreed with him at
that time? - A. Yes.

The first time you had the push it eased back a bit.
The second time it did not ease back at all? - A.
Yes.
     MR. XING:  Do I understand the evidence of
Andrew correctly that he lost two friends?

     THE CORONER:- Two.  He went with Kevin Williams

     MR. KING:  I do not think it will serve any
purpose to question him.

     THE CORONER:     Yes.

     MR. KING:  I just want to say to Andrew, thank
you for coming, because I suspect it is difficult for
you to relive it.

To whom it may concern


Dear Sir/Madam

Re Mrs Anne Williams,


I have been asked by my patient, Mrs Anne Williams, to
give my opinion concerning the death of her son Kevin at
the Hillsbrough disaster in 1989.  I can confirm that I
have read the report of the autopsy dated 16 April 1989
and have counselled Mrs Williams regularly since that date.
Mrs Williams has been able to interview witnesses at the scene
of Kevin’s death only two weeks ago and was able to discuss with
a Mrs Deborah Martin in detail the final few minutes of Kevin's
life.  I have been asked to give my opinion on whether or not
Kevin was able to utter the word "Mum" following attempted
resuscitation by Mrs Martin of Kevin.  It is my opinion that fron
the given information from Mrs Williams and the detailed report of
the autopsy, it would not be impossible for Kevin to have utterec the
word "Mum" and I have informed Mrs Williams accordingly.


Yours faithfully

          I am a serving Police Officer with Merseyside Police, on Saturday 15th

          April 1989 (150489) I was off duty and went to support Liverpool in

          the match against Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough Football Ground.

          I want to the game in my own car with my friend
                       Liverpool.   He had bought our tickets for seats in the

          North Stand for #14.00, fron Liverpool football club supporters club I

          think.
          We drove to the ground via Huddersfield where I dropped my sister off

          at Polytechnic and then carried on to Hillsborough.     O n the way to the

          ground there was a short delay at the Manchester Interchange on the

          M62 with roadworks.

          Aftar we arrived at Sheffield I vent w ________________ -°       GatewaY

          stcre on the continuation of Halifax Foad.   This being ware v s parked

          the car at about l.lOpn (1310).    At the Gateway store there were

          between 200-300 Liverpool fans.    We stayed with them and were allowed

          into the store in small numbers to buy drinks.               1 bought

          four cans of lager between us and then went outside and sat on a

          grass verge together with the other 200-300 fans and we drank two cans




                                                                                       3;

each.    The group of fans was well behaved and I didn't see any

-drunkeness.   We were supervised by a Merseyside and South Yorkshire'

Folice Officer who were sat on two horses outside the Ccmet

Superstore.
Whilst I was sat on this verge everyone was happy and amenable and at

one point I saw a uniform Superintendent and Chief Inspector WALK past

us.     Between 1.45pn and 2pn (1345) (1400) the two mounted police

officers     came over and told us it was getting on and time to make our

way to the ground.    The whole crowd moved on without any problems at

all. I renenber it was the Merseyside Officer who actually spoke to

the crowd.
Wte walked to the ground and when we got into Leppings lane itself it

was packed with people even half a mile from the ground itself.

Because of the crowd my friend asked a policeman for directions to

the ground, he was manning a junction either two or three roads up

from the ground off Leppings Lane.     He then directed us to go back the

wav we had cate and round to the Spion Kop end. .I didn't think that

was right but followed his directions and walked back the way we had

core and to the Spion Kop.     This was about 2.20pn (1420).

We then went to the Spion Kcp but three quarters of the way round on



walked back.

The time was getting on now and the walk round was long because a lot

of the connecting roads between Leppings Lane and Penis tone Read were

blocked by Police.     Because of the time I approached a police officer

on one of the barriers and he alleged us to take this short cut when I

explained what had happened and shewed him my police warrant card.        We

arrived back at Leppings Lane at 2.30pn (1430).     W h e n ----------1

arrived back at the turnstiles there were no queues whatsoever and a

large mass of people all trying to get through the turr^tiles and into

the ground.    It had reached the point of every man for thenselves in

order to get to the turnstiles.
I made for and entered the far left hand side turnstile of turnstiles

1-15.    There was no police officer by my turnstile.   Cver to my far

riant I saw a number of police officers on horses.      I could not see

any police officers on foot but could not say whether this was

because there were none or they were blocked from my view by the

crowd.
Outside the ground my friend had both our tickets and to try and stay^

toeether I had hold of his jeans, •However, the pushing of the

pecpie was that much that we were pushed apart and separated.

Onca we were apart I decided to make for the turnstile on my own.

         had got in before me and once I reached the turnstile he handed

ny ticket out to me and I was allowed inside.    I handed my ticket into

the turnstile operator and retained the stub of the ticket.

I had difficulty in finding the entry point only by the misdirection

of the police officer, but once I got back into Leppings Lane, I found

the turnstile but had difficulties getting in because of the sheer

nuiccer of people.   At the tine of my entry I saw no gates open other

than the turnstiles.     I did not see any of the gates cpen.

As I was trying to get to the turnstiles I saw about five or six

teenagers climb over a concertina gate inmediately to the left of the

turnstiles. After the first five or six went over I saw a number of

others climb to the top of this gate but then drop back into the crcvri

outside as if there was someone in authority on the inside telling

them to get back.
Onca |           11 had got into the ground I saw a police sergeant and

four constables imnediately behind the concertina gate where I had

ae^ - \ the teenagers climb over.    I approached    the sergeant and said

Scir= > th ing along the lines of "I am a Police Officer frcm Merseyside,

theres a huge crowd outside and they're pushing to get in, can you do

sarsthing about it or get something done?”.          At this time, I was with

         but I did not produce my warrant card or formally identify

mysslf. He ^          no reply to me and by this time it was close to

kicic off time so I left it at that.

Onca inside the ground I saw no direction signs to my seat in the

North stand and had difficulty in finding it because the sections of

seating were given letters of the alphabet, however, the letters did

not follow alphabetical order ie ABFDGCM, though I can't remember the

exact order.

I entered the North Stand through a tunnel, there was no crowd within

this tunnel and no problems at all.       I saw no Police within the

tunnel and only a few stewards right at the beginning.

Once inside the ground I saw no alcohol being drunk at all.

I    took my seat along with         just as the two teams came out onto

the pitch.       This was about 2.57 pm (1457).     Once through the

tunnel and up the stairs, I went to the section of my seats where two

stewards directed us to our particular seats.         These were right by the

entrance to this section of seating.       People continued to enter after

me and after about ten minutes between ten and twenty people arrived

at this entrance and didn't appear to have tickets for this stand.           I

actually saw two people holding tickets which were for the West

Stand.       This was after the incident in pens 3 and 4 and people had

started to come cut onto the pitch.       Everyone started to discuss what

was going on and these trwo men said that they should be in those pens

and shewed the tickets which were complete without the counterfoil

being removed.




                                                                                     3 fl

r s-cceriencsd no personal crowd crush within the ground only that

cut    side which was about 2.45 pm (1445).      I did not see any crowd

s t i r z e   within the ground and was not injured.

At about the time these men had appeared at the entrance to my section

of seating which was three quarters of the way along the North Stand

nearest to the Spion Kop about ten rows from the front, I saw people

climbing over the fences fran pens three and four of the Leppings Lane

stand fran kick off but initially they were directed behind hoardings

and sat near to the pitch.          I could not see whether they were directed

by stewards or Police.
Aftar about five minutes a Police officer ran on to the pitch and

stepped the g a m s .      People then began to climb over the front fencing

onto the pitch at will and I could also see people pulled up into the

seating area above.          At no point did I see any gates opened to allow

escape fran the pens.
Onca play had been stopped the Nottingham Forest fans in the Spion Kop

j^ecan to taunt the Liverpool Supporters.

A fan then ran onto the pitch and then ran up to the Spion Kop and

 began shouting and making 'V' signs with two fingers at the Forest

 supporters. Myself and other fans in the North stand began to shout

 telling him to go away because we could see there was something wrong

 in the Leppings Lane end.         This man who was in his early twenties with

 long hair and a black capped sleeve T shirt was then turned back by

 either stewards or Police and ran back towards Leppings Lane but was

 detained by Police before he got back.
 Another older man then ran up to the Spion Kcp and then began to wave

 his hands at the Forest fans.          Ke wasn't taunting, he was signalling

  for then to calm down and trying to tell them there was something

 wrong. Shortly after this the Police formed a cordon across the

ha
par-le in the Leppings Lane end then ripped down advertising hoardings

and began to carry people on them up towards the c o m e r formed by the

cpion Kcp and the North Stand.         I could see that sane of then were

presumed dead as they had coats over their faces and one man in

particular had a jumper pulled back to cover his face.         These people

wera then rolled onto the pitch and the carriers went back for more

pecole or bodies.
The police then fonred a further cordon in front of the North stand.

Around the sane time a number of people wearing tracksuit trousers arfd

sweatshirts came fran the direction of the players tunnel and went to

the Spion Kop end.        They then pulled down more hoardings here and went

to help carry more people up fran Leppings Lane.

A number of people were also carried up to the c o m e r in front of me

bodily.   There were a large number of people in this c o m e r either

laid out behind the police on the pitch or sitting with their heads in

their hands.
 I did not see any of the Police in the cordon in front of the North

Stand break ranks to assist these people.

/I saw one person on the pitch about a quarter of the pitch length away

 frcm the Spion Kcp about twenty feet from the hoardings in front of

 the North stand.        I distinctly remember this because later on as I

will   describe an ambulance drove directly past us and a St John's

Ambulance   ma n   who   wa s with me tried to flag it down but it carried on.

 I am not sure if this man had been carried on a hoarding or by his

 friand who was with him.        I   saw this man lying on the floor having

 convulsions.
 the Police cordon in front of the fterth Stand appeared unconcerned and

 'smarmy', this agitated the supporters in the stand who were shouting


                                                                                 ^r-i

for then to go and help the people on the pitch.    None of the Police

officers left the cordon.
j W2S V B r y dose to the pitch so I went down the aisle, over a snail’

five foot wall with hoardings on, I walked through the cordon without

being challenged at all and then v^nt to the man having convulsions.

Almost iirmediately I was joined by a St John's Ambulance man.     I

identified, myself to the St Johns man as an off duty Police Officer.

He then said to me - You do mouth to mouth and I'll do heart massage".

I then took his pulse in his neck.     I could feel a slight pulse.    I

then carmenced mouth to mouth resuscitation and the St John's man

started heart massage.    I undid two buttons on the top of the man's

shirt.    If I remember rightly the bottom of the shirt appeared

ripped.
we zontinued to work on the man tat after about five minutes he Mint

grey and his face was withdrawn.     As I had approached the man his head

had ncved as if he was being sick.     When I got to him I cleared his

mouth and the back of his threat|             pefore cc^encing .rcuth to

five minutes when the man vent grey,




After about seven minutes I swapped places with the St John's

Ambulance man and he cotmenced mouth to mouth and I heart massage.         As

 I did heart massage his ribs were unnaturally praninent in the whole

 of his rib cage even though he was only thinly built.     His stanach

was depressed and abnormally lower than his ribcage.

 Aftar a short tii« I undid the button on his trousers and riEE*d open

 the zip.   I then continued heart massage.
 Shortly afterwards an ambulance entered the ground.     It appeared

a Haalth Authority ambulance as opposed to St Johns.     It began to

drive dcwn towards Leppings Lane.     I then told-the St John's man to

try and step it.     He tried to flag it dcwn but it continued on as if

it had been ordered not to stop in the top c o m e r but to go to the

Leppings Lane end.

The St John's man then rejoined me and continued to give mouth to

mouth resuscitation.

Shortly after this we were joined by one of the men I described

earlier in the tracksuit trousers and I think green sweatshirt.        He

askad me if I was all right and knew what I was doing.                      **

I said "I'm an off duty bobby, i'm all right", with that he left as if

to go scnewhere where he could be of more use with other injured

persons.

Shortly after this man, which must have been about six minutes since I

had changed places with the St Johns man, a female St Johns Ambulance

officer came over and pushed me out of the way and took over fran me.

I then steed up and watched as she was obviously better trained in

First Aid than me.

I then steed by the injured man together with his friend who had been

there all along, telling us to keep going and not to let his mate die.

Within two minutes of this, the St Johns Ambulance man told the Su

Johns Ambulance weman, "He's gene", and stood up.      I looked at the

man's friend who was standing by his head, he was completely grey.

By this tine, I felt ill myself and just turned away as there was

nothing else I could do.
I would describethe man who died as:- between 17 and      20 years of age,

approx 5'8 - 5'9tall, short sandy or reddish coloured hair, slim

build, no facialhair, white eurcpean, I could see no cuts or

abrasions cn him.     I seen to   remember freckles     on hischeeks, but I      m

freckles. As I said previously he had an unusually prominent rib cage

anc depressed stomach.
He was wearing a light, possibly white button up shirt, light grey or

beige cotton trousers, j                   boxer shorts.   I noticed no

jewellery or footwear.
His friend I would describe as 21 or 22 years of age, dark brown hair,

shortish hair, about 5'9 tall.      I cannot rananber much of his clothing

but he appeared quite plump with a slight beer belly.         He had no

fac ial hair nor glasses.
The St John's man was in uniform, the only thing I can remenber was

that he had dark hair and was thirty plus years of age.

The St John's woman was in uniform again very slimly built and no

older than 18 years of age/
After the St John's man had said the man was dead I'd seen enough,

I felt ill and had to get out of the ground.        I knew]       would have

stayed where he was because he knows no First Aid.         I went over to the

wall where I had climbed in.       As I got there I saw a photographer

kneeling dcwn with an orange tabard he was taking photographs of the

injured and dying.
A fen who was already on the pitch went over to him and said "Fuck

off, you're taking pictures of my injured mates”.

The photographer carried on taking pictures so the fan started pushing

him.       The photographer stood up and the fan then pushed him back to

the wall and tried to take the camera from him.         The camera then swung

and smashed into the wall.       I then climbed over the wall using the

photographers case as a step.       I then rejoined

He said to me "Cane on we're going", and we both then left.          I cannot

say what time this was.

Whilst at Hillsborough the only criminal offences were of a minor

public order nature ie, the fans climbing over the gates etc.    After

the disaster within the stand, I saw a number of instances such as

the photographer's camera and sausage rolls thrown at the cordon in

frcnt of the North Stand and one old man who threw a cup of tea at an

officer in the cordon.
This was caused purely by agitation amongst the crowd by the apparent

callousness of the photographer and apparent inactivity of the police

with regard to the injured and dying.

I witnessed no serious offences.

There were a number of factors which I believe contributed to the

number of deaths and injuries.

Outside the ground there appeared to be a lack of co-ordination

between the mounted and foot police officers.   The approach roads to

the ground were well manned with Police officers at junctions and

outside pubs and off licences.   However, I made a caiment about being

misdirected by the police officer to another officer and he said it

was understandable because a let of the officers were drafted in fran

outside stations and had poor local knowledge of the area.      This may

have contributed to the build up outside the ground which caused the

initial crush outside.
Inside the ground once the disaster had occurred there appeared a lack

of ro-ordination between senior police officers and lewer ranks on the

pitch.   The actual scale of the incident wasn't appreciated

imrediately which resulted in a delay in the response and personnel

beina despatched to deal with it.

From my own personal experience I and most Police officers have only

basic First Aid knowledge.   When I administered first aid to the man

felt totally inadequate on reflection.   However with that particular
                                DEREK WILLIAM                                     11

        man,   I don't think more knowledge would have helped but it might have

        in others.
        I would also like to add that though the Police in the cordon did not

        assist the injured and dying I saw a number of other officers who did.

        In oarticular two small policewomen who tried to help a very large man

        but couldn't carry him until helped by fans.

 Further to my previous statements of 27 April 19S9 and 17 August: 1969, I

 have been asked to think abcut a number of the points which are raised in

 the statement I made nearly a fortnight'after the Hillsborough Stadium

disaster on 15 April 1969-



Before clarifying a number of these points I would point out that I have

today been shewn a number cf photographs, plans and documents by Inspector

SAWERS cf West Midlands Police which I have used to re'fresh my memory.                                                             I-s

also fair to say that my first statement (27.4.89) was the first occasion

that involvement with the disaster was set dcwn in any detail, in writing,

although I did make some brief nctes myself on Sunday,                                                  16 April 1969-          1

retain these in my possession and wculd say that they do not relate to my

dealings with any deceased casualty that day.

 I am a single man and joined Merseyside Police on 27 October 198, .                                                        Dur...*

 initial training at Bruche District Training Centre, Wcrringtcn, I receive

 basic first aid resuscitation in both theoretical and practical

 a n o U cation.         I obtained a pass and was issued with an identifying carc

 qualifying me for, I think, 2 or 3 years.                                      On 15 April 1989 I had receive;

 no further instruction or refresher training in basic first aid.                                                          ^c-e/e.

 as a direct result of the situation I found myself in on the day cf^ the

 disaster I personally felt inadequately equipped in either theory-cr

  practise of            first aid.           I am absolutely satisfied that the first aic I

  rendered in            terms of mouth to mouth resuscitation and heart massage were

  correct and that I could have done no more, but, nevertheless,                                                      i fe_.      -

  didn't know enough and regretted not having taken that aspect cf initial

I will now deal with a number cf specific points from my original statemer.o

(27.4.S9) using the page numcers of that statement.                                                I understand tha.* the

numbers I will use in brackets are these of the file of statements

contained in respect of Kevin Daniel WILLIAMS,                                         prepared by West Midlands

Police under the deceased reference number 51 .



On Pace 6 (File page 41 ) I first refer to the youth I new know to be Kevin

Daniel WILLIAMS lying a 1/4 length of the pitch from the Spion K o p ;                                                    I

refer to him being "on the fleer", meaning the pitch s u n ace, and "having

convulsions".-          I have thought accut this carefully today and with the added

benefit of my training I can say that this was not a process that lasted

for any time.           It certianly wasn't anything similar to an epileptic fit,

for example.           It was an impression that I had which I originally associate-

with the lad vomitting.                     I will say that I did net see the casualty vomit

nor did I see any sick on the body or grassed area around him.                                                        I will

correct further references to vcmit as they occur in my original. Soaoement.




Cr. pase 7 (42) I describe approaching the body.                                           He was net convulsing as I

did so (line



I refer to feeling for a carotid pulse in the neck and said originally t..a~

hand, I believe, to the carotid artery.                                     I cannot say absolutely that I

felt for the pulse before I started acuth to mcuth or at-er, ncr inde_-

whether I did both simultaneously.                                Whilst I wculd new have much mcr-

accurately straight to the carotid artery.




For all those reasons, I can say that I felt for a pulse in xfce reg-cn cf

the carotid artery, but I may have also touched the area of the "Acams

Apple" or felt something in the neck region which I originally thoug..t Wa~

a pulse but may have been mistaken.



I refer to the face going "grey" and "his face was withdrawn".                                                          I cannot

I canncz reconcile the-time sequences and I am still sure that I aid see an

ambulance, distinguish in my own mind that it was not of St Johns but

Health Authority and that I told the St Johns man with me to stop the

ambulance.         I have considered that what I referred to may have been this

ambulance exiting from the stadium but I don't think it was.                                                        My

recollection is still that it was entering the stadium.




I refer to being joined by a woman St Johns Ambulance Officer who pushed me

out of the way.             I recollected this to have been about 6 minutes after I

had changed places with the male St Johns Officer.                                             That makes a total,

from recollection, of 13 minutes joint resuscitation with the St Johns

male.     I would standby these estimates only in as much as I feel we

attempted resuscitation for between 10 and 15 minutes. Within a further two

minutes of both St Johns people working together the man declared "He's

gene" and steed up.                I referred to and re-affirm that he was "completely

grey" and there is absolutely no doubt in my mind, both new with the

benefit of further training, and then at that moment,                                              that the youth I haa

tried to save was dead; certainly dead and beyond any further neip.                                                          I and

the St Johns personnel would not have stopped if there nad been any

glimmer cf hope at ail - there was none.




I describe the bcdy of the youth on p. 8 and 9 (^3 i                                                    and believe tne

distinguishing features I referred to 12 months ago are plain to see cn

photographs.

DATED: 080589



   ®     I a.u Debra Jane MARTIN and I live at the above address. I am
                               /
                                                    I am also a Special Police
         single.
         Constable number 221 based at WXDSEATS (E2 Sub-divisicn) of South

         Yorkshire Police.

         Cn Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489) I paraded for duty at 9.00am

             (0900) at HILLSSCRCUGi Football stadium where there was a briefing          for

             all officers involved in the semi-final between LIVERPOOL and

             NCinNG-IAM FOREST.   The briefing was at 9.45am (0945).

             At 10.20am (1020) I returned to the gym at the football ground for a

             separate briefing for special constables.
             At 10.35am (1035) I left HTLLSECFCUGi stadium to patrol HERRIES PCAD

             SOUTH to step the parking of cars by fans cn the hard shoulders.        I

             did this with S.C.206 EAKER.      We continued to patrol KERRIES PCAD

             SOUTH, which is a very long road, until about l.lQon (1310) that

             aftamocn.   At this time «e had orders to go to EETJZSICHE RD to cover

             traffic outside the main entrance gates for the NOTTS FOREST f-ns.

             At this point I saw about 6 ticket touts.      I saw then selling tickets

             and money changing hands.   I also saw numerous fans both Liverpool
MAPriN                 DEBRA   JANE


fans and Notts Forest, who were obviously drunk, although at this

stage they were behaving reasonably.
At about 2 .45pm (1445) I started to make my way to the LEPPING3 LM®.
                                                                              )
entrance, as I passed what I think is the main entrance to the SPICN^

KDF, the turnstiles were shut dcv/n.
At about 2.50pn (1450) there was trouble at these turnstiles wnen the

Notts Forest fans, realising they v*=re being locked out, were trying

any way they could to get in, this included paying money to the

turnstiles stewards and trying to buy tickets fran the touts.     The

crowd became very abusive and angry and I had to assist in the

removal of fans frcm the ground, . I was on the read side and the

police inside were passing fans back out over the turnstiles and

there was a very large number of fans trying to get in still, so much

that mounted officers and their horses were being pushed up against

the wall.     The next thing I kne* is a large blue gate was opened and

a large majority of the crowd pushed their way into the ground.       I

 found myself being carried along with the crc**i unable to resist.       A

mounted officer grabbed my collar but had to let go, because he would

 have been pulled fran his horse.      I got pushed to the floor, but I

managed to get back to my feet by pulling myself up a man's back.         I

 then rem-mber opening my eyes and finding myself inside the ground,

 at the bcttan of theJpion Kcpand_the_aates had been shut behind----

 me.     I asked the steward on the gate to let me out, but at first he

 refused, it was only when a ireunted officer, the same one who had

 triad to help me a few manents earlier, put his horse up against the

 gata, he opened it a short way and let me out.

 Onca outside I found myself surrounded by drunken fans, screaming

 abuse, and the area covered by police.      An officer used my radio to

 try and call for back up but to no avail because the channel was
,aFnN                  DEBRA

fu11 of static.    My radio was handed back to me and I ran to the

Le e ?i-ngs Lane end of the ground-   Ambulances and police cars were

rusnina to that end of the ground.      When I got to the Loppings Lane

enc of the ground I saw a vast crowd outside the turnstiles trying

to get in, it must have been about four times larger than the crcwd

I lsf* at the other end, so that would mean the crowd at the Spion

Kcp end numbered about 1000 plus and I would estimate about 4000

outside Leppings Lane end.

I can't really remsnber how, but sanehcw I got inside the ground,            |

through the large blue gate which was open, and I ended up on the            j .

pitch.   I did not go through the tunnel.

Onca on the pitch I saw a lot of people who were obviously injured

and I can renanber a man caning up to me shouting, "THERE'S TWO DEAD

YOU BASTARD".     I then saw people who appeared to be dead.   People

vers screaming and shouting and ambulances were driving onto the pitch.

I assisted other police officers with dead and injured people and

helped to take them on stretchers to the gym, and I can remember

seeing officers fran E2 (WXDSEATS) everywhere.

I tcck about 6 dead to the gym, as well as many injured and whilst I

was trying to revive a young boy I renenber something hitting me on

the back of my head, but I didn't really notice until much later when

 I fcund a large swelling.     I could see many bodies being put on the

pitrh, sane of then appeared to be dying.       I lost count of the number

of bodies I helped carry into the gym.

 I halted carry a young toy into the gym frcm the pitch nearby.         Ke

 steeped breathing so I gave hi* the kiss of life, and heart passage

 and a doctor also helped-     He started breathing and opened his eyes,

 his only word was "M31' and then he died.

.At 4.06pm (1606) Dr CURPEN certified death and I stayed with him.               I
mafi -
     in                debra   jane


would describe him as white male, 5'6-5'7, 14-15 yrs, slim build and

brc*n hair, with a cut under his chin.             _______ ____________
          there were no other marks on the body.       He was wearing a white

shirt, green sweat shirt, beige trousers, white socks, white Feeboks

and ^                 boxer shorts. He had a gold metal chain with a

gold horn, a bus ticket, a train ticket and an entrance ticket.               He

had no identification or money.           I later found cut the number given

to this boy was 51.
I stayed with the body and at 5.20am (0520) Sunday 16 April

(160489) an ambulance arrived and I went with the bccy together with .

DC PONT and GRIFFITHS to the Medico Legal Centre, WATER LANE,

Sheffield.     I stayed with the body until he was stripped and details

tak=n fran me.     I finally went off duty at 6.30 (0630) on Sunday

16 April 1989 (160489).
At about 6.30pn (1830) Monday 8 May 1989 (080589) I saw PC's MORGAN

and GODWIN fran West Midlands Police at my hone.           PC ? shewed to me a

partially completed report of death form that I identified as being

the form- I filled in whilst in charge of the body, details of name

and other personal details are missing because there had been no

 identification made by the time I went hone.          All I can say is this

 form relates to body 51.      I new knew this is Kevin David WILLIAMS,

            Further to iny previous statements I would like to add the following,

           Cn Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489) I worked in the capacity of

           Special Constable at the F.A. Semi-Final football match between

           Liverpool F.C. and Nottingham Forest F.C. which was being played at

            the Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield.

           My recollection of the events of that day are vague and confused.

           As a result of the disaster I was prescribed medication by my Doctor

            to assist me to sleep.         I was really upset by the whole incident and

           was cn medication for about a week.                The result being that I was in a

            state of what I can only describe as seni-conscicusness.                  I felt like

            a 'Zombie.'

           As a result of this I feel that my memory, my recollection of that day

            is ocssibly inaccurate. I am unsure of what time I arrived at the

           Lee pines Lane entrance to the ground or even how I came to be cn the

           pitch but I did.

           Ev time I get onto the pitch it sesned to be mass confusion, there

           wera police officers and supporters all over the place.                    I could see

           pec ole who appeared to be injured and possibly dead, lying on the
                                                                                                    L.

             i was in a state of shock. I didn't knew what to do but my
    pit-*'1*
       cural instinct was to help these people in the best way that I could.

    I can't describe              t o you in any detail my exact movements over the next

    half an hour or so.                   I knew that I approached several people lying on

    the pitch and assisted if possible.                           I did not give any of these

    people nouth-to-mouth or heart massage.

    I dacided that there were enough people dealing with the situation

    at the Lepuings Lane end of the ground and made my way to the Spion

    Kop end of the ground.
    I could see that bodies were being carried from the Lappings I*me end^

0   to the Spion Kcp end of the ground and then being placed on the pitch.

    I assisted to carry a number of dead and injured people fran the Spicn

    Kop end of the pitch, into the gymnasium where a temporary mortuary

    had been set up.                 I was talking to sane of these people, contorting

    them and trying to reassure then.                         I am unable to describe any of

    these people in the detail.
    By this time I really «as in a stats of shock, I couldn't believe what

    I was seeing.               I seened to be on autonatic pilot.                 My memories are

    y g s -ry C O n f U S S d 3 T ld d l S tO x .    •

    I can recall carrying a youth who I new know to be, Kevin Daniel

    WILLIAMS fran the pitch to the gymnasium.                               He was the last person that

    I assisted in carrying.                         I first saw Kevin WILLIAMS lying on the pitch

    near to the goal area at the Spion Kop end of the ground.                              At that

    stage he wasn't on a hoarding or a stretcher.

    I renetiber that there were several people around where he was lying.

    I can't recall anyone giving him mouth to mouth.                               With the help of

    othar people, who I can't recall, Ifevin WILLIAMS was placed onto a

    hoarding and carried into the gymnasium.                            Saneone instructed me to

    stay with the body.




                                                         (£   &     £   )
£ didn't knew what to do.   I didn't want to believe the boy was dead.

I didn't knew if he was dead or not but I decided that I had got to

attanpt to revive him.   I started to give him mcuth-to-mouth but

sciracne, I don't knew who, touched me on the shoulder and told me he

was dead.    By this time my head had gone, I wasn't aware of what I was

doing or what was really happening.

At 16.06 hours (1606) Doctor CURPEN examined Kevin WILLIAMS and

certified him dead.
I rananber a detective officer, DC Paul M3NFREDI helping me to

corolete the GEN 18 form (sudden death form).                           -

I stayed with the body until the -early hours of Sunday 16th April

(160489) when I escorted Kevin WILLIAMS, who at this stage had not

been identified, to the Medico legal Centre.

I identified the body by the number allocated, which in the case was

Number 51.    I had no further dealings with Kevin WILLIAMS.

This statement is irade to the best of my recollection and I believe it

to be the truth.    However, under the circumstances I cannot be

positive that the details are accurate.    I have been quite badly

affacted by the whole incident and I am trying to erase it fran my

merory.
I have marked on a plan of the pitch (Reference D.J.M.l) the

approximate location where I first came into contact with the

decaased, Kevin Daniel WILLIAMS.

At ab o u t   2*   10 pm (141Q) we arr ived at the ground.                M a n y fan* were

inside the turnstile.             I visited the Gents and then we made our way
to the t e r r a c i n g - the c e n t r e 'section.     Wal king thr o u g h the tunnel t

the t e r r a c i n g was not difficult, there was no pushing or crowding at

that stage.          On reaching the terrace we found that it wa* alr eady
quits full.          We dec ided to move to the right (looking at the pitch)

 away from the tunnel.


 Two of US rea ched the point stout ten yar ds f r o m th. pit ch fence and

 B e t w e e n 2 . 2 0 pm (1420) and 3.00 pm (1500) we g r a d u a l l y became more
 and mor e t ig htly packed.           Much more so than even in a tight crowd on

 the A n f i e l d Kop.    It    became «o .tight that o c c a . i o n a l l y .urges of

I    looked    up. from time to time to the front of the sta nd above and                             *,,,

t e r r a c i n g but not really doihjj^much.


A few p o l i c e m e n on the pitch side of the perimeter fence d id not seer

to have n o t i c e d <1> how t i g h t ‘we were packed and (2) that the side

s e c t i o n was n o t i c e a b l y more empty.


Fans      t-egan to express their dis comfo rt by criticis ing the                           ground. I

brought no response in terms of a c t i o n from the police.


 I v a g u e l y remember a tannoy a n n o u n c e m e n t asking us to mo^e dovnn to

the front - there were i r o n i c ‘jeers from the crowd in res ponse to

 this.


 The game started.             I didn't feel any surge in terms of m o v e m e n t -
 just a n o t h e r noticeab le increase in the by now a b n o r m a l level of bed
    p re ssure all round.           People stood on barriers in front and sho uted

    "Get back, get back."              This was impossible,          we were all pinned

    s t a t i o n a r y by the pressure from front, sides            and back.


    P o l i c e m e n at the perimeter fence at last seemed.; to not ice                     the
    problem.      ,The gate was opened;            A pol icema n trie'* in v a i n           to pull a

    fan out.      I could not see the game w h i c h had s t a r e d nev er m i n d what

Of the six min utes of the mat ch (I heard later it was six minutes) I

fence a few yards away.                   Ha seemed okay but I couldn't get near him

anyway.


Fans s e e m e d to spill over the front perimeter fences but they were

w a l k i n g a n d running although obv iously shaken.


The m a t c h sto p p e d and many police arr ived at the per imeter fence.


Fans next to the side fence had begun to climb over in small numbers

to reach the side sec tion of terracing.                              A very d i s t r a u g h t young fnan

on the oth er side of the fence (he had pr e v i o u s l y been in the centre

section) s h o u t e d "Get over the fence - they're g et ting s q u a s h e d at

the bot t o m . "


One by one fans climbed over. I f ol lowed my brother over and by then

I saw the first of the injured or dead being lifted out at the
front.      I i m m e d iat ely heeded for the pitch gate.                             At the gate there

S o m e b o d y was crouched over it.           I asked is he breathing, has he

pulse,   the answers were no.                I saw he was cya nosed a n d was
pul seles s.       I knelt next to iji| ‘Vhumpsd and thu mped his chest herd
three times.         I commenced m o u t h to mou th r e s u s c i t a t i o n a n d i n s t r u c t # ’,

As we c o n t inue d to give CPR I sho uted to nearby p o l i c e m e n te find

o u t if we could get a D e f i b r i 1 lator and some oxygen.                    We c o n t i n u e d ,

w i t h CPR and I d i s c o v e r e d my ass istan t was a male nurse.


We wer e by now s u r round ed by mil ling figures in black - pol ic e m e n an-

policewo men.        A distraught teenage fan came over and put his face up

to that of the body and ye l l e d words like "Come on mate* don t die,
you can't die, you're a Liv erpoo l fan."                     I was tol d that there was- n-

D e f i b r i l l a t o r but I was given an oxygen cylinder a n d i n f o r m e d that i
was s w i t c h e d on.    I pulled the flimsy ven ti m a s k off the tube and put

the open tube in my own mouth to enrich the o x y g e n in the air I was

giv ing to the patient.


We c o n t inue d wit h CPR.         I soon realised nothing was coming out of                         th
tube.     The valve was turned on and I looked at the gau ge w h i c h

 I could not         see any thing that "was hap pening at the front of the

At about f i f t e e n m in utes I was about to say to a p o l i c e m a n to cover

the bod y w h e n his heart sprang to life a n d he d e v e l o p e d a good

As I s t o o d up I saw for the first time some s u g g e s t i o n of the scale
of the casualti es.            To get to the a m b u l a n c e we had to s t e p over about

 back to the L e p p i n g s LN end.            i   passed t h r o u g h the line of pol icemen

.across the e n t r a n c e (what were they doing,                  I thought - not muchl').’*-

 As 1 wen t t h r o u g h I ask ed f o u r or five of them if they could tell t^e

 w h e r e there mig ht be injured'jjfople I could help.                       The general reply
 was that the y c o u l d n ’t and that they were sorry.



 I am f a i r l y sure that I went liack into the goal a r e a at the Lep p i n g s

 a doctor,        can you tell me where the inj ured m a y have been t a k e n so I
 might h e l p ? "    No she could not.



 The re did not seem to be muc h I could do at that end.                             Some people
 lying d o w n w i t h people helping said they were okay.                        I could not f i m

lads w h a t had h a p p e n e d on the pitch.                 All of a s u d d e n for the first

time I felt a searing pain in my head and said " G o d / my h e a d hurts."



At no time at H i l l s b o r o u g h did I realise people had d i e d in the

tun nel.          At no time did I see any thing to s u b s t a n t i a t e claims that
p o l i c e m e n wer e a s s a u l t e d or bodies were looted.               I saw brave young

fans t r y i n g to save lives hopelessly.                      I saw brave lads o rg anise
t h e m s e l v e s to make mak es h i f t stretchers to carry the dead.                          I saw

some p o l i c e d e s p e r a t e l y trying to save lives.              I also saw some polict

s t a n d i n g idly - not knowing what was happening or m a k i n g any attempt,
to f i n d o u t .



I did not see at any time any fan (whether before or aft er the brief
game) m i s b e h a v e d e l i b e r a t e l y in any way.



A f t e r the game had been a b a n d o n e d we left the g r o u n d via the centre

s e c t i o n on the tunnel.          R e m e m b e r i n g the fan we had r e s u s c i t a t e d I
gave a p o l i c e m a n my name and address.                  I felt it ver y u n l i k e l y that

he w o u l d have s u r v i v e d and rec oncil ed my s e l f by the fact that if he
h ad he w o u l d have been brain damaged.

                                 Hillsborough, 15th April 1989
                                          Dr John Ashton



I    am    a medical        practitioner       and    senior       lecturer    in    Community    (Public)

Health                                                         On Saturday 15th April I went to

the FA Cup semi-final match at Sheffield with other members of my family.
This year we travelled by way of the M62 and Ml because for the same event
last year we had travelled on the direct route through the peak district
and there had been very bad build-ups of traffic on the way home.                                  We left
Liverpool at about 10.15 am and arrived in Sheffield at about 12.15 - 12.30
pm.       We had a meal at a pub some distance from the ground and afterwards
walked perhaps 2 miles to the match.                     While we were at the pub a coach-load
of Liverpool supporters came in.                     They were boisterous but well behaved and
there was good humour between them and the local people who were eating in

the dining area.


We arrived at the Leppings Lane end of the ground at around 2.30 - 2.35 pm


It was       immediately apparent that it was going to be difficult to get in.
We     had    four    tickets        together    for    row    2    of   the   West    Stand,    above   the
Leppings Lane             terrace.     I had been particularly relieved to obtain seats
this year because                at last year's        game    in the     semi-final we were        in the
terrace itself (in the right hand corner behind the goal) and it had been

terribly crowded and unpleasant.


On Saturday we found that outside the ground there were a large number of
    supporters trying to get in to a small number of turnstiles a&d .that there
was       very,   little^ police presence.             I saw no stewards outside the ground.
There appeared to have been no attempt to marshal the supporters into lines
    in advance of our approaching the turnstile areas.


We     managed       to    get   nearer   to    the    turnstiles        but   the    crush was    becoming
    unpleasant.       I heard a police officer telling the supporters                           that it was

    their own fault for coming late.



                                                         1
I decided_that X did not            want to go        on because it           was so unpleasant,
said   it   would     only    get   worse    and      that    he   was        going    in.
                                                      and they stayed where they were as
I withdrew to the wrought-iron fence.


After a few minutes I thought I would try again.                   I could not see my family
and assumed that they had managed to get through the turnstiles.                             When I
approached again it was now much worse and again I withdrew.                          I was aware
of an officer trying to close one of the wrought iron gates, but he had no
chance on     his own.        I noticed that there was now         a police landrover in the
lane just     outside the gates and my instincts and experience of 30 years as
a Liverpool supporter told me that things were going badly wrong.                            I went
to the police landrover and obtained the attention of one of the officers.
I said to him,        "you've got to get a grip of this             situation,      it is out of
control,      there     is    going    to    be a   tragedy."       He     seemed   bemused      and
unresponsive.       People were closing in around the landrover and I withdrew
to the other side of the            road to see if it would ease off and              I could try
again.      The time now must have been 2.45 - 2.50.


After a few minutes           I suddenly realised that everybody had gone in and I
was able to walk up to the turnstiles and gain admission without difficulty
after tendering my ticket.


Once inside the turnstile it was at first unclear where I should go.                          Thecfi
were   no    stewards    in    sight   and    the   section     labelling    was    confusing.     I
realised where the entrance was to the West Stand and went to get in after
buying a programme.           At this stage I had no idea that things had actually
now deteriorated to the extent that they had done.                       It must have been just
after 3.00 pm.


When I went to the gate into the West Stand there were a few other people
in the process of getting in and two policemen were checking their tickets.
I then became aware of a man crying and beseeching the police.                         "There are
kids dying in there," he said,              "you've got to do something."           He seemed to
have come out of the terraced area.                 The police were unresponsive to him.
They checked my ticket and let me in.
Once   insijJe the stand area I               turned up the stairs,          now worried to check
that M                                           fere   alright.      As I got to the top of the
stairs it was difficult tomake progress because there were so many people
in the aisle.             At the top        of the stairs I could begin to see why.               Many
people were being pulled up out of the terrace and into the front of the

s tand.


I could neither          attempt to get down to row 2 nor see the boys. I decided
to make my            way along the adjacent row.               Everybody was helpful and        I was
able to do        this without difficulty.              It must have been about row 20.               When
I got     some        way along   it -I looked          down to see       if I could see the      boys.
                                                                 I was able to make my way down

to them over the seats.


When I reached them I could see that there were a large number of people on
the pitch,        people       trying to get out of the terrace on to the pitch and
people were continuing to come up in to the stand.                           There seemed to be few
St. Johns Ambulance people attending the people who were lying around the
pitch and I could see people lying on the pitch unattended.                               There was a
large line of police officers across the pitch at the centre circle.                                   The
tannoy told the supporters who were on the pitch to get off it.


The pressure was bad where we were so I made my way back some rows with
                                  stayed where he was to help pull people up from the
terrace.         When     we    got    further    back     we   had   a    clear   view   of   what    was
happening        on    the pitch;       it seemed incredible.             The   time must have been

about 3.15 pm.


The overwhelming impression was of a large and growing number of casualties
and not much response.                The supporters were now impatient and angry at the
 slowness of the response to the emergencies.                      There appeared to be only one
 or two stretchers on the pitch and one ambulance was making its way around
 from the    far corner.              The   supporters were chanting for assistance               to be
brought to the injured who were lying on the pitch.                                The next thing was
 that many of the supporters who were on the pitch began to tear down the
advertising boards         and organise    themselves    into stretcher parties.         This

all happened very quickly.


I heard     the   tannoy    appeal   for   doctors   to help.    I could    see   that    the
situation was really bad and could count six people who appeared to be dead
near the goal mouth.         I made sure that                ~             were safe with
       and that I knew where they were and made my way out down the back of

the Leppings Lane Stand.


On    the   stairs   a policeman was       attending    somebody who was   injured.       The
injuries     did not appear to be critical so I asked the policeman where I
should report to help.          He did not know.         I went back into the stand and
brought the boys out and down the stairs to place them somewhere safe and
in sight.      I then tried to find somebody in charge to tell me who to report
to.     I asked several officers, but none of them knew.              There were people
lying everywhere in the yard area between the Stand and the turnstiles.                         I
asked the officer who was in charge and he indicated a senior officer.                          I
approached this officer and told him that I was a doctor and asked him who
was in charge of emergencies and where I should report.               He said he did not
know and that he had just arrived.            By this stage I realised that there was
no organised response and I was angry.               I asked the officer for his number
but he did not appear to have one.              I asked for his name.      He said he was
Inspector Grace.        I left him and went to see what I could do.


All around were people either dead or unconscious, or seriously hurt.                      The
 supporters were fantastic.          They were all helping each other and trying to
 resuscitate people.          Individual police officers were also doing what they
 could.     At no time did I see anybody attack a police officer, nor did I see

 anybody who was drunk.


 I came to the conclusion that somebody needed to take an overview of the
 situationand began to go round all the casualties to appraise them.                     There
 did not seem to be any St. Johns Ambulance workers around at all.                 I became
 aware that some casualties were being taken out into Leppings Lane itself
 and I went out there.          There was one ambulance.         The time must have been

 about 3.30 - 3.35 pm.
The policy were beginning to put people into the ambulance and I realised
that a system of prioritising by triage was needed.                             So I did this.             I went
around    and    either        checked       people     myself    or    asked     the    person        who    was
attending them.          There were two or three other health workers in evidence
who    were     assessing,          resuscitating       and     doing    what     they    could.             There

appeared to be no medical or emergency equipment.


The    dead were       taken to one side and I allocated the other casualties                                   to
category one or category two.                    I told the police who should be despatched
by ambulance next and who could wait.                         The officers were mostly very good.
They     took my       instructions        and acted on          them immediately.              By    this    time
there was a steady flow of ambulances.                         It must have been 3.45 or 3.50.                      I
became aware of a local general practitioner who had arrived at the scene.
Over     the    next    half       an   hour    we    worked    together     as   a     team,    sorting       the
casualties and despatching them in the ambulances.                              An anaesthetist arrived
 from somewhere and fire-engines came with resuscitation equipment, but all
 of this was          really       too late.         By 4.25 pm it was all over.                     The serious
 casualties had gone               to hospital and what remained were people with minor
 injuries,      shock and distress and a line of dead people.                              I went to check
 that my family was alright and when I came back a police officer asked me
 to certify the deaths.                 A general practitioner had already started this at
 one end of the row of bodies.                       I started at the other.              I think the time
 was 4.27 or 4.29 and I think                    I certified five or six dead.                   Only one of

 whom could be identified from                   documents on            his body.


 During this whole period the                    public were fantastic,           although            shocked and
 angry.        On one occasion             at    the end a group of young men came past                         the
 dead,    and    one     of    them     expressed his          anger    at police       who     were       standing
 there.        I told him to "cool it", that it was not helpful and he stopped.                                      I
 saw     no    other    episodes        like     this   at     all,    although    there       was     a    general,
 atmosphere of anger at what had been happening.                                I remember thinking how

 restrained everybody was.


 It must have been about 4.30                     - 4.35.       There did not seem to be anything
  else    for    me    to     do    behind      Leppings      Lane.      I   checked      that--------------
                Lere    alright with            Carl    and    then made     my way       to    the     gymnasium
around th£ side of the ground to see if I could be of any help there.                                       I
had become aware that other casualties had been taken to the gymnasium.


At first I had difficulty finding it as nobody could give me directions.
When I arrived there I went in and found that it was all over.                                  At one end
there were tables (I think three) which must have been used for processing
details of the injured.                There were now no           casualties in this area.            At the
•near end of the gym were rows of bodies.                        On my way past I noticed a large
display     of    photographs         and    information      on    the    wall    of    the   gym    showing
Liverpool supporters who were thought to be pickpockets, etc.


I left      the gym and returned round to the Leppings Lane end to check my
family again.           They were alright.          I thought that I should go back to the
gym    to   see    if    there    would      be   a debriefing         of people         involved       in the
emergency        response,       so    all   four   of   us    went       round.        This   time     it was
 difficult to get near the gym because there was a large cordon of police
 around it.       I spoke to an officer and he let us through when he knew I was
 a doctor and I left                                                           behind them and went to
 the   gym.       This    time    it was very difficult               to get in.          There wastight
 control on       the door.           I explained why I wanted to go in and was allowed to

 enter.


 I asked      about      a debriefing but nobody could help.                        Those who had been
 helping were being cleared out of the                        gym.        Just then a senior officer
 called     all    the    officers       together   at     one      end   of   the hall        for    a police

 briefing.        I don't know what it was about.                    I left.


 On our way back to Leppings Lane we encountered a police officer who                                   was in
 great distress and being comforted by another.                            I put my arm around him to
 comfort him as well.             He was sobbing uncontrollably and saying that now the
 police would get the blame.                  Another officer was angry and fold me that he
 felt    that     they had been let down by                the .senior officers.               He said that
 nobody nad taken charge and that when senior officers had come they had

 been of little use and just got in the way.
                    ,,  A returned to the car to drive home.              We must have
We    left the ground and returned

I arrived at the approach     to the Leppings Hoad end of the Hillsborough
Stadium at lh.25 hours.        I was accompanied by cy 27 year old son and
a young man of 17.       *e all had a valid ground ticket.    The immediate
approach to the turnstiles, a distance of some 70 yards, was full of
a jostling crowd of ticket holders tiying to make their way to the
turnstiles.      There was no semblence of orderly cueues, with some kind
of order trying to be maintained by three mounted police officers.
Despite the lack of organisation and frustration the mood of the fans
remained reasonably co -operative.      To emphasise this, one of the horses
was very close to me and accidentally almost knocked my spectacles off.
The officer apologised and we e.changed smiles and I stroked the horse's

nose.


The nearer one got to the actual turnstiles tne pushing and crushing
became severe.     After approximately ten minutes all three of -us were
literally catapulted through the turnstiles.       Over the last ten yards
one had no control whatsoever over car movements.


Once through the turnstile all three of ny party came together.            son
attempted to remonstrate with a police officer regarding the lack of
organisation on the approach to the turnstile.      ne was warned by a
steward standing alongside the officer to keep ouiet "because other fans
who had made similar protests had been forcicly     "ejected from the ground.


'We then moved away and vent to use the toilet situated in front of us
under the stand.       As we came out of the toilet we were directly facing
the rear of the turnstile area and were immediately aware of the
opening of one of the gates alongside the turnstiles.        The time was now
just after I h . h O hours.   Anticipating the ensuing rush I took   my
 companions to the right, aiming to take our place high up on the terracing
 to the left of the Lepping Road Stand facing the playing area.      The
 previous y e a r ’s experience had alerted me that this was a sensible area
 to stand, both from a safety viewpoint and it also provided an excellent
 view.        I have a vivid mental picture, as we hurried past the now
 infamous tunnel leading to the ill-fated sections, of turning my head
 and noticing there vas nobody to be seen, either spectator or official.
The high up area we entered was very full, but with no crash.        We

positioned ourselves within feet of the "blue boards.      Looking down from

my high vantage spot I could see the two middle Dens immediately "behind

the goal were .jammed to caDacity with a seething mass of people.     To my

surprise, the pens on the left and right were half empty.       The area on

the far ri^it around the electronic scoreboard was also half empty.

The time of this observation was 14.50 hrs.



Ifor attention then became diverted when the Liverpool 'team took to the

field, followed a couple of minutes later by the opposition.        At the same

time I was conscious of a few people entering our section behind and

alongside me.      There was no large influx just before the kick-off where

I was standing.



The     ° had b°sn in progress for some five minutes witn Liverpool p.essing

home an attack at the far end, with a c o m e r followed by a shot which hit

 the woodwork.     I believe this shot to be significant because it meant

 a tremendous surge down the Dens behind the LiverD 0 0 l goal to try and see

 what was happening.     This is the normal reaction on the terracing at any

 football match.        From my vantage point I was then immediately aware

 of fans trying to come over the metal fence behind the goal.       Some had

 been successful and were being led down the touchline by the police.        Others

 were being stopped climbing out of the pens despite their obvious protests.

 At the same time a senior police officer ran from behind the Liverpool goal

 and approached the referee.     He immediately stopped the game taking both

 teams off the pitch.        By this time a few more fans had managed to

 escape from the pens.      One fan on the field of Dlay appeared to be

 pleading whilst he was being forcibly led to the side of the playing area.

 Behind the goal the two Dens were a seething mass of people with little

 or no movement either backwards or forwards.     A few people were being

 passed from the back of the Dens to the front.         The front of the pens
  next to the fence seemed to "be flat without the usual bobbing heads.


  Within two minutes of the teams leaving the field I realised something was

. very wrong.     On reflection I have come to the conclusion that my alarm was

  confirmed due to a combination of medical experience combined with an

  intimate knowledge of years of attendance at football matches on the

  terracing.


  I quickly realised that help would be required on the pitch.      I informed my

  son what I was doing and because I was so close to the entrance to the

  terracing I had entered I quickly made my way down the stairs to find a

  Steward to get me to the side of the pitch.       I quickly found a Steward who

^^.ccepted what I was telling him and he took me through a tunnel under the main

  stand where a Police Officer again accepted my explanation of being a trained

  nurse and let me on to the pitch.


  I raced to the area immediately behind the goal net.      The narrow gate belonging

  to the pen behind the net was open with police officers trying to pull flaying

  bodies through the narrow opening.       Other officers appeared to be trying to

  instruct the fans to push tack ir. the pens.      I helped officers pull people

  through the gate.       We were pull ins any part of their body we could get hold

  of.   On reflection I realise now because their bodies were level with the

  bottom of the gate that they must have beer, lying on top of people because

^ ^ . h e gap between the bottom of the gate to the floor of the terracing was some

  three feet.



  The first casualties I helped pull through the gate were conscious, but very

  shocked.      I attended to them at the back of the goalmouth on the netting.

  Their recovery was comparatively quick and simple were moved away from the

  immediate area.       Very quickly I was aware that we were pulling out

  unconscious bodies.     I can next recall working on a young man who once he

  was conscious seemed to have chest injuries.      I looked around the goalmouth

  for a stretcher or something to remove him to a place for him to get treatment.
     The scene around me remained completely chaotic with everyone trying to do

     their own thing, fans and police all mingling together.         I eventually found

    ' a stretcher lying on the pitch with which I quickly returned to the injured man.

     I literally ordered three police officers to help me lift the patient on to the

     stretcher.    $y this time he was complaining about the pain in his chest.           We

     quickly made our way to the c o m e r of the field between the m a m   stand and the

     Kop and took the young man behind the stand to the St. J o h n ’s Ambulance room.

     I then ran back on to the field to the goalmouth.       In that short interval of

     time & lot more bodies were lying behind the goal.        People of all descriptions

     were attempting mouth to mouth resuscitation ar.d cardiac massage.        On the right

(     iand side of the goal net a young girl was being worked on by a man who stated

        was a surgeon.     I moved to the body next in line and worked with a young

     police officer until the patient appeared to be starting to come round.            I

     then moved on to the next person who was lying unconscious and unattended in

     the goalmouth.      I was working alone in this instance giving both mouth to mouth

     and cardiac massage, an impossible and hopeless situation.        The patient started

     vomiting to complicate the issue.       I was conscious of an elderly w m t e haired

     St. John’s Ambulance man working alongside me.        I requested some swabs to clear

     an airway, all that was forthcoming was a dry sponge.          By this time it was

     after 15.30 hours and we still had no equipment of any sort to work with.          It

    ^^.s just after that that I was conscious of the first ambulances beginning to

     make their way on to the pitch.        Eventually I realised that I had lost the

     battle for this young m a n ’s life.     I looked around but I could not see anymore

     unattended bodies.      By that time our ranks had been swelled by ambulance crews

     and firemen with some oxygen.


     I next left the field making my way behind the main stand to the gymnasium wnere

     I understood some of the injured were being taken.        Again I found another scene

     of chaos.     The only entrance to the gym was a door of similar dimensions

     to that found in any household room.       Directly outside this door was the

     St. John’s Ambulance Room.       The space was becoming jammed full of people

     with comparatively minor injuries.       The area was also rapidly filling with

     people presumed dead.
I next assisted police to make some sort of pathway to the door of the gym "by-

helping and organising the movement of "both the prospectuve dead and the

seriously injured.       Inside the gymnasium the space was roughly divided

into two, half for the dead and the rest for the living, with tables set up

to interview the relatives.      I began to work with the injured in the

gymnasium at around 15*55 hours.      I was conscious of around three doctors in

attendance, but when I arrived there there was still no medical equipment of

any sort.      One doctor shouted across the gym for some drags to treat an

injured fan who was in obvious pain.      There was nothing available so I

volunteered to go to the St. J o h n ’s Ambulance room.    I was informed that

the?/- were not allowed to carry any drugs.      I rushed back to the gym asking

^some Senior Police Officer on.the-way if they could obtain some equipment

for" us.     Quickly three small plastic boxes arrived with medical equipment

plus an emergency case with drugs in it.       I began passing out the meagre

items of equipment to the doctors present.        There were still only roughly

a dozen injured in the area.      I prepared ten intravenous lines ready for the

Medical Officer to set up, and we commandeered police officers to hold the

I.V. packs because we had no stands to attach them to.           3y then some

 semblance of order was being maintained in the part of the gymnasium given

over to the injured.        The other side of the gymnasium was rapidl;/- filling

with the                dead.    One of the doctors present had taken one of the
fthree   stethoscopes available to enable him to declare them clinically dead.


I next tidied up the medical equipment as most of the injured were being

rapidly removed to hospital.      I then began to realise the full extent of

the disaster for there were already over fifty bodies lying on the floor,

fty final act in this carnage was to comfort and stay with the husband of the

young girl whom I had seen attended to behind the goal.       At least I knew

she had had the best of attention that had been available in the

circumstances.      I stayed with him whilst he gave the necessary details

to the police, and then a local vicar took over from me.

When I left the gymnasium, to my amazement it was. still only 16.45 hours.

The longest hour and a half of my life.
PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS



1.       Comparison of the organisation with the previous year.

         The previous year I arrived at the same area of admission at 14*50 hours

         with my daughter.   Before we reached the turnstiles at Leppings Lane

         we had to go through a police filter system, whereby it was ascertained

         that we did have the appropriate match tickets.

         This year no such system was set up.



2.       3oth years I was delayed because of travelling difficulties.     The

^        appropriate Authorities had decided to initiate roadworks on the Mo2

         to commence around a week before each game.      Surely tne matches could

         have been taken into consideration when setting up these roadworks.




    3.   When we cane through the turnstiles for the 1988 game we were met by a

         line of stewards and police officers who gently but flroly prevented us

         from entering the tunnel to the middle sections.      It had been decided

         that these sections were already full to capacity.

         This year no such precaution was in operation.



    4.   I can understand the Police Officers at the turnstiles wishing to open

         the gates to relieve pressure and avoid injury to life or limb, out

         in these davs of ultra m o d e m and sophisticated personal communications

         surely it could have been done in conjunction with i,heir central police

          control area at the side of the electronic scoreboard.




    5.   Very recent national publicity has assured us that surveillance cameras

          at football grounds means that any problems can be dealt with within

         two minutes of their occurrence.

          Surely with the police central control post with all its battery of

         T.V. monitors available, they should have been able to ascertain the
need "to close "the middle sections when "they became full.



6.   Observing from the outside it appears to have taken far too long

     for the authorities to decide that it was not a security problem and

     that the fans genuinely needed help.    VJorking with    etnd alongside

     the individual police officers in the immediate disaster area, I

     have tremendous praise and admiration for their efforts.        Overall

     at the scene, however, there appeared to be a lack of co-ordination

     and genuine leadership.



     "5'or an extremelv long time we were without any form of medical

     equipment of any description.      X still cannot understand why tne

     local Health Authority’s Major Medical Disaster Team was not called

     upon.    I understand that all Health Authorities in this country

     have a major disaster policy.     It is impossible to accurately

      estimate the difference, this would have made m   saving life.

      I do, however, believe that the Liverpool fans should have been

      given the chance.

                                                         12th February, 1991




     Dear Dr. Popper.

     At the mini inquests we attempted to ask a series of questions concerning
     the aftermath at Hillsborough, we were left with the impression that the
     luestions would be dealt with at a later stage.

     However since then you have ruled that it 1s not necessary to proceed after
     15.15pm and it now appears that our questions will not be addressed, you
     did say that in an Ideal world everyone would have ended up in hospital and
     you suggested that we were naive 1n thinking that the medical response was
     Inadequate, that sort of answer is not conducive to the facts as shown In
     the video, and reports from Medical Personnel who were trying valiantly to
     assist the injured.

     The video shows 1t took till at least 15.35pm before all the casualties
     were removed from the pens, a fairly lengthy delay which obviously did
     nothing to help their chances of survival.

      Reports and recommendations from the Medical Personnel (please find
      enclosed) certainly imply that in their opinion, the response left a lot to
     ^be desired.

     He also know of people who were removed in an unconscious state, a prime
     example being Mr. Edward Spearritt who according to Mr. Spearritt was not
     admitted to hospital until 17.00 hours and who subsequently recovered, that
     it was possible for people 1n the crush who suffered severe Injury to
     survive with a reasonable amount of aftercare.

     At the very least this raises questions 1n the eyes of the families that
     the inefficiency of the major incident response could have contributed to
     the number of deaths occurring at Hillsborough and therefore we consider-
     that this should have been part of your enquiries into the reason for the
     deaths.

     You have promised to look into individual questions of concern, therefore
     1t would not take a great deal of your time to enquire into this matter.

      He would suggest the two most qualified Medical Personnel niamely Dr. John
      Ashton and Or. Glynn Phillips be called to give evidence at your Inquests,
      so they can be questioned as to their medical opinion of whether the
      response contributed at all to the amount of fatalities.

      He think you realise the seriousness which we place on this matter, and we
      feel that if you fall to address this situation, that this failure will
      obviously form part of a case for judicial review no matter what verdict 1s
      reached.

      Trusting you will give this matter your earnest consideration.

                                   Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Jones

Thank you for your letter dated 12 February 1991, the contents of
which I have noted and have read with care.

Whilst I would not for one moment question the seriousness with which
you view the points raised, I do not think that it is either right
or appropriate for me to enter into a dialogue with you regarding
the issue which you have raised.

However, in order to avoid any possible misunderstanding, I do have
to say that it is not my intention to call either Dr Ashton or
Dr Phillips.

I have also read your penultimate paragraph. Whether or not you
apply for a judicial review is a matter entirely for you and/or your
advisors arid I do not think that I should comment on this either.

Yours siycfcerely

     MR.   CALLAGHAN:    Sir, you know the representation on
previous occasions and I should say it is my intention to stay
only for today and in the case of one or two witnesses. I
will not take any major part in the Inquiry.

     THE CORONER:   I have got no particular objection to
you being here.   I thought you probably would not be here
continuously but I wanted to be sure about that.    Perhaps
the best thing would be if we started with you really and
if we started with appropriate legal submissions.    It may
be easiest if we start with Mr.. King and then we will move
across the table, so to speak.

     MR. KING:    Sir, my primary legal submission is
directed to your preliminary ruling on the last occasion
that this Inquest should be concerned only with events up
to about 3.15 pm.    As I understand your ruling, sir, it
was designed to ensure that this Inquest would only be
concerned with events leading to the crushing on the
terraces and the first arrival of an ambulance.

     As you know, sir, the families whom I represent are
very anxious that this Inquest should deal with what to
them is a very major issue, as to how their loved ones came
by their deaths, namely how the services and the rescue
services, and those attending with the emergency, coped
with it immediately after people were brought off the
terraces because death was not certified in many, if not
most, cases until after 4 pm.   Sir, I do not know if you
have had an opportunity to read these.    I did ask those
instructing me to send to you statements from each of the
families whom I represent setting out a number of
individual questions directed to their own Inquest but also
incorporating in their individual cases why they were
anxious to learn of what happened between the time there
was a first sighting of any loved one being brought off the
terracing and the pronouncement of death.    I do not know
if you had an opportunity to read them.

     THE CORONER:   I have briefly because these did not
arrive until Friday afternoon but I have looked at them.

     MR. KING:    What I would like to do is take you
through some individual examples in order to persuade you
that this is a question which ought to be gone into at this
particular Inquest.    I do not know whether that is a
format you want to follow or whether you want first to hear
some other representatives as to their attitude to my
submission.    I am happy to go into considerable detail
about it.

     THE CORONER:   There are several points which have
occurred to me and the first point I would like you to deal
with is this; you were not present but you will be aware
that in April/May this year we sat for two-and-a-half weeks
approximately and we dealt with the 95 deceased and we
dealt with three issues which Coroners deal with; who the
deceased was, when he/she died and where he/she died.    I
specifically excluded from discussion at that time the
question of how he or she died because as you will
recollect the DPP was still actively considering the matter
and we did not want to trammel his investigation but, on
the other hand, I felt it was right we should allow people
to hear what we could deal with.
     I will raise the second point at the same time because
it may be easier for you to deal with the two things
together.   At those hearings we dealt in considerable
detail, in fact infinitely more detail than we would
normally deal with in an Inquest, with events after the
pathological cause of death and I did it because I realised
that the families were desperately anxious to know what had
happened immediately after the incident.   My question to
you is - and I think this is what we need to deal with and
get right - bearing in mind we have only dealt with the
question of who, when and where and that we have done it in
considerably greater detail than one would normally expect
to do, why is it necessary to review that very activity
again which I think is what you are really asking me to do?

      MR. KING:    Sir, as I understand the individual
Inquests there was not an enquiry into, in the individual
cases, the impact of the organisation rescue on the
survival or otherwise of the particular loved one.       All
that was done when     one looks at those Inquests was to
identify the time of a first sighting,that is to say,
somebody who seemed to be unconscious, and of a time when
effort was made to resuscitate in any given case and then
death was certified.      In many of the cases there was a
large gap of time after 3.15 pm when it was not
investigated at the individual Inquests the nature of the
services available to deal with those being brought off and
if I can just give     one or two examples of that, you have
examples of people     who are brought off at 1522 and it is
said that there was an effort to resuscitate by a lay
individual and then that particular lay individual is not
heard of again, or the officer is not, and it is said that
the given loved one arrives at the temporary mortuary.
There has been no investigation directed to thealobal
organisation_of what happgngd immediately after they were
brought off ,the t*»rrsres._ certainly I have ueen through
the” inaj.vxduax transcripts and there does not seem to be
any evidence directed to that issue and those witnesses who
were called could not deal with those issues, sir.
                                                         s




     THE CORONER:   Are you suggesting that the cause of
death in respect of these individuals is not in fact the
pathological cause of death which we have been given but due
to a novus actus in effect by person or persons whose
evidence you have not yet heard?

     MR. KING:    Certainly the families, and I put it as
openly as this, sir, and putting it bluntly, cards on the
table, are not convinced at all that had there been a far
more sensible, logical organisation of the rescue services,
of the major disaster team being brought in, of proper       ,
medical equipment being available, of proper triage being     ‘
carried out, that those measures, had they been there, in
several cases, would not have resulted in the survival of
their loved ones.    They cannot - obviously they were not
there - produce through me concrete evidence of that at this
stage but at every stage of an Inquiry into this disaster,
and this certainly is true even in the Taylor Inquiry, that
particular aspect of the disaster has never properly been
gone into.

     Again putting it very simply to you, sir, most of the
families I represent feel there has been a complete blanket
(not a deliberate blanket) been held down over what happened
after they were brought off the terraces and before
individuals were certified dead and there has been no effort
made systematically to analyse what was the organisation at
the time for the rescue, what might have been, and what could
have made a difference.   A very simple example again is that
I am instructed there is evidence of Dr. Gumpert given at the
Inquest that without an electrocardiogram we can never be
sure whether or not there is a pulse and when dealing with
individual loved ones taken off the terraces and simply dealt
with by lay people, the absence of such sort of equipment
means that one would never know whether or not that
individual was alive or dead at that stage.   It is a
matter - and I do not mean this pejoratively - which is swept
under the carpet as if to say, "All we are interested in is
the immediate crushing leading to those being brought off the
terraces".   I cannot put it any more firmly than that, sir.

     THE CORONER:    You have put it very plainlyand I
appreciate it.    I will give a ruling on your application in
a few moments but do you want to develop it further?
Obviously I want an opportunity to hear from your colleagues. '

     MR. KING:   Have you the individual statements which
were supplied?

     THE CORONER:   I do have those in front of me.   I would
not want to go through all of them but if you wish to pick
one or two as examples I am prepared to listen to you and
indeed it also makes it easier for everybody else.
     MR. KING:    Sir, if you were to turn to No. 11 to start
with, which is the submissions to you of the Jones family,
Richard Jones, I do not know whether you have been given one
or two documents.    I have two documents in relation to Mr.
Jones one headed "Dear Miss Steel” and one headed "Dear Mr.
King".

     THE CORONER:      No. 11, did you say?

     MR. KING:     Yes, sir.   I beg your pardon, sir, it is
No. 10.      Sir, if you look ----

     THE CORONER:    Mr. King, may I just stop you for one
moment because something has occurred to me, and I have been
reminded, which I ought to say to the Press before we go
further?    The session this morning is being heard without
the Jury and the reason we have not got the Jury is because
we are dealing with legal points.    That means no doubt that
you can report we are in session but you should not actually
report what is being said.    You will no doubt be familiar
with the provisions of Subsection 2 of Section 4 of the
Contempt of Court Act and I say you must not report what we
are discussing.    If we had wanted the Jury to hear we would
have had them present but we do not wish them to hear at thii
stage.     You may, when we have finished the Inquest, if you
still feel it is a reportable and interesting aspect then,      o j

course, that is a different matter but for the moment please
do not report the content of the legal matters we are
discussing.    Mr. King, I am sorry to interrupt you, would
you continue?

     MR. KING:   Sir, the document I am looking at and I
appreciate those alongside me are not looking at any document
but it is just to help you is one headed to myself, "Dear Mr.
King".

     THE CORONER:   I have a document headed "Dear Miss
Steel" dated 22nd October.

     MR. KING:      Sir, this is dated 7th November.

     THE CORONER:      I have not got it I am afraid.   It is
not in front of me.

     MR. KING:   Iapologise for that and I will take you
through, if I may, through five points which are raised by
Mr. and Mrs. Jones.   Sir, they make the basic point that th«
report into the death of their loved one,' Richard, was
certified at 1600 hours in the temporary mortuary and,
therefore, so far as the family are concerned, so far as
evidence is concerned, they presume, as they say they must b<
entitled to, up to that time the evidence of death is not
clear as having already occurred.

w ^ Po^nt N o * 2 > air., is extracted from the evidence given
by Dr. Gumpert at theInquest already held here and in fact
it was evidence given       on the occasion of Kevin Tyrrell   and
         1S a quotation from his evidence which you may
r6Call •

     "I would like to observe that feeling the carotid pulse
     is quite difficult in someone who has a low blood
     pressure as would have been here.   In fact it can be so
     difficult it is impossible and you have to have an
     electrocardiogram on to know whether the heart has
     stopped or not;"

     Then there is the statement of Mr. Eccleston, which is
certainly a statement in the large bundle of statements given
to the West Midlands Police, and indeed Mr. Eccleston gave
evidence to the Taylor Inquiry in which he says this:


                                   /"For an extremely long.
                                                                                                 8




            "tor an e x t r e m e l y long time we were wit hout an/ form

            bel ieve that the L i v e r p o o l fans should have been
            given tne c ha nce".

     And the q u e s t i o n rai sed by Mr. and Mrs. Jones is this,
     sir:   tnere w a s a m a j o r i nc ident vehicle.             Why <*as it not
     cal led? Lac k of e q u i p m e n t u n d o u b t e d l y res ulted in deaths.

             Sir, I pause there.      Of course, Mr. and Mrs. Jones
     w e r e not there and of c o u r s e they are n o t experts, but you
     will .see, sir, from the b a s i s of that e v i d e n c e they are
     firmly of the b e l i e f that one ca n n o t just ignore an
     inquiry, an inquest, into that aspect.

               Sir, n u m b e r 4 point m a d e by Mr. and Mrs. Jones comes
r\   from the s t a t e m e n t made, a g a i n in the large bundle, sir,
     from Dr. G l y n n P h i l lips , p a r t i c u l a r l y w h e r e he says that
     a ft er 3.15 p.m. he gav e m o u t h to mou t r e s u s c i t a t i o n to a
     m an for 15 min u t e s , and jus t as he                   giv ing up the heart
     sprang to life, and a f t e r that the m a n started b r e a t h i n g
     on his own. We k n o w that this does not prove this man
     lived, or if he did he m a y have bee n brain dam aged, but
     the point we are t ry ing to put across to the c o r o n e r is
     that after 3.15 p.m. not all the pe o p l e w ho were later
     c e r t i f i e d dea d wer e n e c e s s a r i l y dead.

              Sir, f i n a l l y Mr. and Mrs. Jo n e s d i r e c t your a t t e n t i o n
     to the long s t a t e m e n t w h i c h I a.“ sura you have seen, sir,

     they were, a f t e r the p e o p l e were br o u g h t off the terraces.

     in the short letter, sir, w h i c h you have, w h i c h you have
     al r e a d y r e f e r r e d me to, sir, they e m p h a s i s e an issue as to
     the failure to i m p l e m e n t triage a f t e r the d i s a s t e r

         HR. K I N G : Sir, it is not o f t e n that i n s t r u c t i o n s to
C ou n s e l are giv en in a d v a n c e to the Tribunal, and I
suspect, sir, that it is not a wis e mov e in m o s t cases.

       T H E COtvONER:      You are p r o b a b l y right.
        MR. KING:           Sir, it was an eff ort in tne rel ative ly
short time since we wer e b e f o r e you to put b e f o r e you the
var i o u s m a t t e r s w h i c h the fam ilies wi s h e d to place be f o r e
you and it was felt this was the eas i e s t way to do so,
sir.
                                           •

         Sir, if I can then turn to Mr. Pemberton, you will
see that he mak es the f o l l o w i n g points:            tne report into
the d e a t h of his loved one Roy that life a g a i n in his case
vas pr o n o u n c e d ext inct at 16.00 hours nours, and ag a i n in
tne a b s e n c e of m e d i c a l e v i d e n c e to the contrary, the
family can only assume that t.neir loved one was alive
until that hour, and sir, if you then go to p a r a g r a p h 3
that d o c u m e n t you will see there is a ref erence to tne
s t a t e m e n t of Mr. Sa x t o n of the St. J o h n s A m b u l a n c e
Service, b ec ause he refers to tae r e s u s c i t a t i o n of a you ng
man at 15.50 hours, i n d i c a t i n g in the h e a r t - f e l t v i e « of
Mr. Pemberton, as w i t h a ll the o t h e r families, that d e a t h
mus t have o c c u r r e d a f t e r 3.15 p.m.
            Ag a i n he refers you, sir, in p a r a g r a p h 4, to tne
 s t a t e m e n t of Dr. Byrne w h e n he quo tes tnat he was
  a p p r o a c n e d by a senior Po l i c e O f f i c e r and as k e d to start
 c e r t i f y i n g the dead as there may be some still alive, and
 .sir, again, the point has been m a d e that as we only '<now
  for cer t a i n that d e a t h was at 4 o'clock, to ign ore these
  c o n c e r n s as to the a d e q u a c y of the a t t e n t i o n s and the

  well have b#»en a m a j o r r e a s o n for why som ebody d i e d and
  d id not survive.
           T he final point on Mr. Pem berto n, sir, in p a r a g r a p h
 7, is the q u e s t i o n he asks: why was it that the very
 s e r i o u s l y ill and dying, and those w ho a p p e a r e d to be
 dead, w e r e not taken to the h o s p i t a l in the ver y first
 a v a i l a b l e amb ulanc e, and ne rai ses h i m s e l f the issue as to
 why the se r i o u s a c c i d e n t r e s p o n s e veh icle was not cal led
 out to the stadium, as he u n d e r s t a n d s to be the case.

         Sir, if I can then d e a l w i t h per h a p s one e x a m p l e of
 m in utiae , of detail, if one turns to the cas es of the
 Hicks sisters, of V i c t o r i a and S a r a h Hicks, sir, w n i c n is
 at num bers 7 and 3 in y o u r list, sir, you w i l l not ice the
 c a s e of Victoria, that on .the face of tne sum m a r y w n i c h
 was      pro d u c e d at the I n q u e s t pri or to today, there was a
 gap      in time. There is a g a p in time            between 15.21, w h i c h
^was the time whe n Police C o n s t a b l e M c G u i n n e s s rescued

they express the flavour of all the other submissions
that, in fact, we can not k n o w that a cut               off point at this

    A


             As a comment on what Mr. King has said, strictly it appears
        to us that he is saying that there is the possibility, to put it
        in a legal term, of a novus actus, i.e. something which
        intervened after the crushing and before the deaths, which caused
    B   or contributed to the deaths of at least some of the people, and
        the response of the Chief Constable to that submission, if I put
        it correctly, is that we can quite see that is something which
        people would wish to see investigated on the question of how it
        came about. I only make that comment in an endeavour to be
        helpful, but the position of the Chief Constable is that he has
        no submissions one way or the other.

             May I just say while I am on my feet with regard to what Mr!
    C   Hale has just said, as a matter of fact it is not correct that
        the Police have admitted negligence. It is well known and has
        been well publicised that what has happened is that the Police
        have agreed to make payments to those people who were injured anc
        to the dependents of those who died, and that such payments are
        in the process of being made.   Also there has been a civil actior
        in respect of apportionment of liability in respect of those
        matters.

    D        THE CORONER:   Thank you very much, indeed. I accept
        entirely what you say and in a sense I accept what Mr. Manning
        says as well. It is not really relevant to my proceedings
        whether or not negligence has been admitted or not admitted. It
i
        is neither here nor there. So I did not comment on it, but I
        appreciate what you have said.

             MR. ISAACS:   I think, sir, in fact, that is Mr. Hale.      Mr.
        Manning sits to my left.
    E        THE CORONER:     I beg your pardon.   Forgive me, please, both
        of you.

             MR. ISAACS:   Sir, I have no submissions. It is entirely a
        matter for you having regard to the breadth or depth which you
        consider appropriate for this particular Inquest.

             MR. MANNING:   Sir, I have exactly similar comments as far
        as my client is concerned.
    F
             MISS SINCLAIR:     I have no submissions on this matter, sir.

             MR. CATCHPOLE:   I add to that. The matter is entirely for
        you. You are the best person, having read all the evidence, to
        make that judgment, and no doubt that was the reason we had, as
        you have already pointed out, sir, a fairly detailed
        investigation into the earlier Inquests.
    G        MR. CALLAGHAN:   Sir, this is not an application of which I
        have had previous notice, and which in the circumstances of the
I       application is some surprise to me. All I think I should, sir,
        is this is not the time and place for some sort of Public Inquiry
        into the activities of the Ambulance Service and the Emergency
1       Services, and it is not appropriate to bring such a matter into
                                                            15




the srena   as a sort of side wind.   Beyond that, sir, it is
obviously   a matter for you.

     MISS ADDELMANN:    Sir, I have no observations or submissions
about the point, and Ican do no better than echo those remarks
made by my learned friend, Mr. Catchpole.

     MR. RUSSELL:   I too endorse those remarks. None of us
other than my learned friend. Mr. King, has seen the original
statements, and so are being invited to comment upon a course in
the dark because we have not seen the nature of an example of the
material he now seeks to rely upon. I recognise it is a matter
for you, and if you decide I d6n't take a stance one way or the
other.

     THE CORONER:   Shall I then deal with this point? Is there
anybody else wants to say anything on this issue? Mr. King?

     MR. KING:   Sir, only to emphasise that it is not a side
wind which I am embarking on. I am seeking to address causes,
contributory causes to the deaths, and I am concentrating on
that, and it is in that context I have invited the Court to look
beyond 3.15, and certainly we are dealing with it from the point
of view of possibilities of novus actus, yes, I accept that.

     THE CORONER:   I have listened hopefully with attention, anc
perhaps I ought to say this to you, Mr. Russell, before I go on.
I know you have not had the advantage of seeing the letter, but
it is only fair to say Mr. King in his summary of the points as
far as I can see summarised the points which his clients were
making entirely fairly. There is nothing extra in the letter, sc
to speak, except connecting words, basically. That is for your
reassurance, if I can put it like that.

      Throughout, and in fact almost from the word "go” on the
 15th April, 1989, when I first learned about this incident, one
of the underlying criteria which I tried to apply in thinking
how to set about dealing with the Inquests was to as far as
possible treat the Inquests as if they were completely
standard, if I can put it like that - it is a horrible word -
but completely normal Inquests. The fact that it was national
news, that it was 95 young people, that it created a terrible
amount of anxiety, pain and so on, in some ways is unique
because of the numbers, but each individual death I dealt with
families are in exactly the same situation, and I tried to
think and I still try to think, what and how would I set about
if I had had a road traffic incident or a works accident as
opposed to an incident in a football stadium. I have thought
back on many occasions to say a road traffic incident where
somebody might have suffered a serious head injury. That
person may well have been at the road side for X number of
minutes while one was waiting for the ambulance services to
attend. They may then have been taken by an ambulance to a
hospital. They may have gone into the resuscitation room.
They may have been worked on by the doctors. They may have gone
into hospital and they may have then died two, three days, may
be longer after the incident. Or alternatively, you could have
                    /
                     /here by chance the road traffic incident occurs on
                    /a doctor happens to be. He walks up to the
                   /ks and says, "I am sorry, the injury is so severe
                  yerson is dead". Or you could have a situation where
                 /has this road traffic incident and is taken into
                 Ad is certified dead on arrival.

                  zione of those instances would I as a matter of routine
                 /dence of what happened after the incident ;itself was
                ,ed, and indeed, the pathologists in the example which i
               sed would have given as cause of death serious head injury,
              istance, or multiple injuries with fracture of the skull, 01
              hing of jhat nature. It seems to me that the fact that the
            jn may survive an injury for a number of minutes or hours or
           i days, isnot the question which I as Coroner have to
         £ider. M^task is to establish who the person was - I am
        f r y to repet this      - where he died, when he died and how he
        &d.It isjrom my          understanding of the pathological evidence,
       »he overwheling pathological evidence is and was that the people
      ilied as a reflit of crushing or traumatic asphyxia. Different
      fwords were usd, but the sense was always the same. The
       underlying ppblem which these poor men and women were subjected
    /* to was an iroility to breathe.

/          That d<S not mean to say that some of them did not in fact
      respire for^period of time dr even have a heart beat
      thereafter, t the damage was done, and indeed, both Dr.
      Gumpert, Dr later. Prof. Usher, who dealt with this question ir
      an overall nt of view, all in fact said, as I understand theii
      evidence.    tly the same.

           One          points, Mr. King, which you have made is that
      because                                                                   r
                                                                      _      With

                           /I do understand the anxiety.
      I do understand the anxiety which a lot of the families
 nave about this issue, but as I have already said the
 overwhelming medical evidence, the pathological evidence
 and that is the crucial one I am interested in, is the *
 damage that caused the death was done due to the crushing.

           Now I picked the arrival, of the first ambulanp-g not
 because there is anything magical about that but because
 when we look at the videos we can actually see that and it
 is aajcgnvenient marker? that is all.            If the first
 ambulance had arrived at 3.30 I would have picked that time.
 It is simply intended as a marker, but, and this is an
 important point, I considered the medical evidence. The
 medical evidence was that once - I am not quoting verbatim -
 but the sense of what Professor Usher said, .and, indeed, the
 Ot h e r s as wel l                    nro'iwimrrmin«A.» i■'




      Now I felt that the evidence which I had heard and in
 the light of what I had read that                  the


                                                     before, but let us

     1 have already indicated that at the - I will call them
the interim inquests if I may just for the sake of a name -

  lat sense n>rolce my own rule straight away because I said
I wanted to treat this matter as if it were a completely
standard normal road traffic incident, if you like.    I
didn t, I gave a great deal of information for various
reasons which I don*t need to go into now.

     As an aside I can assure you that within the limits of
our ability the summaries and the evidence which was given
was an accurate reflection of what people said and if there
wa? f faP»    instance, as has been suggested in some cases
which is unexplained |
                   e wh l c n w e n a ve put under the curtaILn,
but because we'didn't know of it or couldn't find it or it
doesn t exist. The truth of the matter, of course, is that
people weren t being watched individually continuously by
somebody else   recording what was happening.   It is entirely
fortuitous as   to whether or not there is a witness or
witnesses who   happens (a) to have been with a person, (b)
who remembers   who he is and (c) has some idea of the timing.

     Some of you who were there will remember that in some
cases we had a great deal of evidence with regard to what
had happened post-crush, shall I say, and in others we had
next to nothing because it is very sad particularly for
those families where we have got so little to share with
them, but we are living in the real world and in some cases
there was overwhelming - for instance, there were dozens of
photographs as you know - some of the people were all over
the newspapers and in others we could not find any.     It
can't be helped, it is just one of those things.

     Bearing in mind that IjiltfrTirt1 1"*“i*‘v<"
       pi-auestion;of^hoy. and I do intend to deal with it
reasonably comprehensively, I have to remember two things:
that my powers are limited.     I don't have an open ended
authority to carry out an investigation.          The Rules and the
Act, indeed, are quite clear as to the limits of what the
coronal inquiry should be.     I admit that the word ’’how" is
a little bit flexible and assuming we call all those
witnesses on that preliminary list which I have circulated I
hope you will agree that I have been reasonably flexible
with that word, but nevertheless I do have to draw a line.
Indeed, this was done in other inquests.          If you think back
to the Zeebrugge inquest, for instance. The learned Coroner
there drew a line.    He was judicially reviewed on where he
drew it and in that particular case the Divisional Court or
the Court of Appeal, I can't remember now, clearly said that
a line has to be drawn and in the Zeebrugge case they agreed
it was right.   I am doing my best.         I am trying to draw a
line as well.
      If you think of the other major disasters where
inquests have already taken place, you will find that lines
were drawn there as well and I think you will find that the
line with regard to the question which we are now thinking
about was very, very much tighter than what we have already
done.
     In answer to your submission, I still consider that as
a general proposition we are going to accept - I am going to
take these inquests and deal with the question of how on the
basis of what happened to about 3.15 or thereabouts.   I
have explained it to you so I am not going to repeat it and
I base it mainly upon the pathological medical evidence.
          Having said that, I think it is probably right to say
 because we will be calling witnesses it may be that w m esftf
TjflftfWijfrhitnp ic.h.^o                        ~to >a;*min o r1

       . 1 have also got to say, it is only right, that wha

  understand it, e-outside-m p ’autbortey^tid^S^H^.     I also
  seem to recollect, although Lord Justice Taylor s Inquiry
  isn t - as I have already said to you at the business
  meeting, I don't really want to spend too much time on it -
  but I do recollect that the emergency services were very
  well represented at that Inquiry and, indeed, a lot of
  discussion, from my reading of the transcripts, did deal
  with the issues of the medical response.

       Whether or not that was satisfactory, whether Lord
  Justice Taylor should have done more, whether somebody else
  should look into that when we have finished that is nothing
  to do with me.   However, as far as I am concerned, my
  intention is to stick with what I gave you as my initial
  preliminary intention.

       I have, of course, already looked through the documents
 which you sent me and insofar as in one or two instances
 witnesses are mentioned, if I think, and, indeed, I have
  thought that one or two of these in fact I think three at
  the moment, you have got a point.   It would perhaps be
 advantageous to.call those persons and we are making
 appropriate arrangements.    Please don't think that I have
 said, Good grief, fifty pages, I am not dealing with that,"
 I have already spent quite a bit of time thinking about it
 and I will hopefully have another look.    If I were - which
 is highly unlikely - in any particular instance to feel we
 ought to go a little bit further down that line because
 there is a specific point to be made in any particular
 instance, then I will if I think it necessary, tell you.
 However, I think it is unlikely from what I have seen and
 what I have read and for the reasons which I have given you.




              MR. KING:       Sir, thank you for that
                                                          20




     MR. KING:   Thank you for that.   Can I raise a
separate matter, sir, which is not connected with the issue
of cut off but is connected with the issue of 50 pages
which you have referred to?

     THE CORONER:     I was not saying that as a criticism.

     MR. KING:   Not at all, sir.    One only has to state
the number of families whom I represent to know that.
Sir, a number of the families have raised specific
questions relating to the summaries which were put before
you in their individual Inquests.    I just give one
example, sir; in the case of No. 13, Jonathan Owens, you
will note they have a particular concern as to the timing
when their son came to the ground and a particular concern
to the fact that the summary suggests he joined the crowd
at twenty to three when, in fact, they point out to you
that the positive video evidence shows they were standing,
not having joined the crowd at all, round about ten to or
eight minutes to three.    I put that as an example.
     Are you willing, sir, to go through those individual
questions - not now - and indicate at some stage, perhaps
even in writing to us, whether or not you would be prepared
to reopen those individual Inquests to deal with those -
may be small points in the whole but to the individual
families - important points of factual errors which seem, to,
have crept in by reference to positive evidence whicn can
now be laid before you?
     THE CORONER:   My recollection of the papers is that
they affected very few or where I feel it is justified.    I
think those two things go together.   As I say, I have not
had sufficient time to study it in detail but if I were to
think there was a genuine error and that that error was
actually relevant - the incident which you have given me
indicates with respect to the family it is an anxiety to
them - but the crucial point is not whether he was standing
in a crowd or whether he was standing aside but where was
he or at least at what time was he still outside the
ground?   One has to ask the question, does it actually get
us any further forward?

     MR. KING:   May I just interpose to say that the
example I gave was directed as much to the timings outside
the ground in fact.

     THE CORONER:   If we have made a mistake, and we will
be checking that...

     MR. KING:      I am obliged.
                                                           21




     THE CORONER:   When points have been made of actual
error we have been trying to check.    If we agree with
them, as Mr. Fraser and some of the others will remember,
we have made from time to time a<| hoc amendments when
points of error were pointed out to us.    I am not averse
to that, not in principle anyway, and if it helps somebody
by clarifying something then I will be pleased to do so but
I would not want necessarily to spend endless time on
clarifying minutiae which, in the final analysis, do not
matter so far as the Jury are concerned.    I am sure you
accept that.

     MR. KING:   I understand that, sir, but I am sure when
families are supplied with an "agreed" summary and they see
matters which are of great concern to them which appear to
be incorrect then obviously they are desirous that that
should be rectified as quickly as possible.

     THE CORONER:      I take it none of you have any adverse
comments on that?

     MR. KING:   What I am going to suggest is that those
instructing me extract from those documents which do
confuse two issues, those which are directed specifically
to individual questions and they can be then sent to you in
a more orderly manner which enables us the more quickly to
obtain help from you.

     THE CORONER:   That would be very helpful indeed
because then we would really know what we are looking at
and what we have got to concentrate on.

     MR. KING:      Yes, sir.

     THE CORONER:      Are there any other comments from
anybody?

     MR.   ISAACS:   Yes, sir.   I just wondered how we are
going to   deal with these matters.   I know that you started
with Mr.   King and I thought probably what you would do is
run down   the line so to speak.

     THE CORONER:   Yes, we will do that.     Have you got
any submissions to make?

     MISS HAMPTON:   I have no submissions raised by Mr.
King, though he has raised one particular matter which
concerns the City Council with regard to the agreed summary
of facts.   They have been through the proposed summary
prepared for today's hearing and there are one or two
matters, they have instructed me on, which concerns them,
sir.
   ' THE CORONER:   I think I will be able to short circuit
this submission. You will recollect, ladies and gentlemen,
at the business meeting a suggestion was made that we
should try and extract various paragraphs out of Lord
Justice Taylor’s Report as an agreed statement.   I was not
particularly enamoured of the view and for some reason
which at the moment I cannot account for I forgot to
mention at the meeting that we were actually in the process
of preparing what we thought was an actual non-
controversial, entirely neutral, account of various
activities which we hoped it.would be possible to put to
the Jury so that they had an underlying base on which one
could build the edifice, so to speak.
     In the events which have happened, we have heard from
most of you, if not all, but whilst quite a lot of you have
actually come back and said that you are reasonably happy
with the summary there have been quite a number of you who
have had substantial points of criticism to make with
regard to the content.   Unfortunately some of these points
- and I do not think I am criticising anybody and I am not
going to name any names either - were not made until Friday
or even later.   When I say Friday, I mean Friday late
afternoon.   I have come to the conclusion that we are not
going to use these summaries at all.   We will build, if
that is the right word, what we need as we go along.
     I mention that now, and I will mention it when the
Jury are here, but what we are going to do is that we have
got some two dozen slides which we are going to show.
They are shots of the ground from the air and so on in
order to give the Jury some idea of what we are talking
about and then we will just build the evidence on it as far
as is necessary for the purposes of the Inquest.   I think
that probably deals with your point.   I know that many of
you thought it was a jolly good idea but in the event it
has not worked out.   I thought it was a jolly good idea as
well which is why I intended to do it but I would rather
not.   Some of the points which were made, I could see what
was being said and some were very good, but I would rather
not have anything which people were not entirely happy on.
Some of you might feel you have been pushed because you
have been asked to agree to something.   If you are not
happy with the evidence, that is another matter altogether.
I take no responsibility for what the witnesses say.    We
have to accept the evidence that is given.   Are there any
other submissions you want to make, Miss Hampton?

     MISS HAMPTON:    No, thank you, sir.

     THE CORONER:    Mr. Hale, what about you?
                C ? ^ s e ». js .Rule 22 Of the Coroners Rules of
 198-4, dealing with self-incrimination, sub-Rule 1 - and
 tnis is the matter that I referred to:

        "No witness at an inquest shall be obliged to answer
        any question tending to incriminate nirnself."

 And then Section 14 of the Civil Evidence Act, which in my
 submission is to the same effect but I refer to it for the
 sake of completeness.  That is the Civil Evidence Act of
 l“o o , sub-section 1:
        II                     *
         The right of a person in any legal proceedings,
        other than criminal proceedings, to refuse to answer
        any question or produce any document or thing if to
        do so would tend to expose that person to proceedings
        for an offence or for the recovery of a penalty, (a)
        shall apply only as regards criminal offences under
        the law of any part of the United Kingdom, and the
        penalties provided for by such law and (b; shall
        include a like right to refuse to answer any question
        or produce any document or thing if to do so would
        tend to expose the husband or wife of that person to
        proceedings for any such criminal offence or for the
        recovery of any such penalties."

I mention sub-section (b) only because it is there not
because, of course, it is in any way relevant to this
case.

    _ s°, sir, that is the position.      Mr. Duckinfield, as
with any witness before you and before the Jury, has that
privilege not to answer any question which may tend to
incriminate him.     So, sir, what does that mean?    Could I
then ask you to turn to the bundle?       My submission is that
tnere are two cases, one in the Court of Appeal one in the
House of Lords which followed, in which the House of Lords
confirmed the decision of the Court of Appeal, which eiv^s
you a great deal of guidance as to v.iat constitutes a
risk, a^tendency, of incrimination.       The first one is that
in tne Court of Appeal, the case of Re Westinghouse
Llcictric Corporation Uranium Contract Litigation MDL
uocket ^o. 235 (,N o . 2 ) , reported in tne third volume of
the All tnqland Reports of 1977 at page 717, and I would
ask you at this stage, sir, to find that, which is at
folder 6.

        Sir, the fact, of that case are wholly different to
the facts of this, but of course it is the statement of
principle, th| ratio of the case to which I wish to refer.
‘
. ay      f l rst of all read that part of the preamble to the
hea d n o t e :

      Evidence - Privilege - Incrimination of witness or
     spouse - Belief that evidence would expose witness to
     proceedings for offence or recovery of penalty -
   /    Reasonable ground for belief - Sufficient to show
        real and appreciable risk that proceedings would be
        taken or increase of an existing risk of proceeding:;
        •   • •



and then it goes on to deal with discovery of documents,
production of documents and I don*t weary you with that
now, sir.

     Sir, I don *t think it will be helpful to you or to
taose who are listening to this submission to deal with
the facts of that cas , oth^r than to say that it was
action involving an American corporation against RTZ, Rio
Tinto Zinc Corporation Limited, and there was an
application for discovery of documents which Rio Tinto
Zinc did not wish to produce because they said that to
produce those documents would give rise to the possibility
that they may well face prosecution or a penalty within
European Community law, but I now deal with what was held,
and this, sir, is at page 718, and these are the
statements of general principle wnich in my submission
apply to the giving of evidence in any Court, and
tnerefore before you, sir.

     THE COKONER:   May I just stop you - the page numbers
are missing off mine.

       MR. ISAACS:    It is the second page - the next paze
a*- ter toe first.   I do apologise, sir.
       it                                                       1
        Held - A witness was protected from incriminating
       himself by the production of documents ...."

  and, it therefore follows,    by the giving of any answer
to any question -

       "... if he could satisfy the court that there was
       reasonable ground to believe that production of the
       documents would furnish evidence against him which
       would be used in proceedings for a penalty ...."

- and agair;, that was, of course, relevant to that case,
but it applies to proceedings for a criminal offence, and
indeed it could be said, having regard to the wide ambit
or trie Coroners Rules, for example proceedings in relation
to disciplinary matters, wnich of course you, sir, know
tlr. Duckinfleld along with others still faces.

       "Reasonable ground for the belief might appear from
       tne.circumstances of the case or from matters put
       forward by the witness himself, but the witness was
       required to show only that tnere was a real and
       appreciable risk, or an increase of an existing risk,
       that proceedings would be taken against him for an
       existing penalty offence, and not that proceedings
       were likely to be or would probably be taken*11

of the                      l   f °Ver: pags 721 • the right-hand side
t j n       j     judgment which was that of the Master of the Rolls
Lord Denning.        It is the right-hand side of the page and he
deals with the common law as to self-incrimination, ’l ask you tc
look first of all at between D-E:                                y

            "Today We are not dealing with a party to a cause we
            are dealing with a witness. At common law, when a
           witness is being examined in the witness box or is
           subpoenaed to produce documents to the court then,
           quite understandably, he may have something he
           wishes to keep secret to himself so that his
           neighbours or his competitors should not get to
           know of it; something which he might reasonably
           believe he ought not to be compelled to disclose.
           Not, at any rate, if it exposes him to risk of
           some ill befalling him. The common law does in
           some circumstances cast its protection over him.
           It adopts the maxim nemo tenetur seipsum prodere.
           No ;one is bound to furnish evidence against
           himself. It says:   'If a witness claims the
           protection of the court, on the ground that the
           answer would tend to incriminate himself and there
           appears reasonable ground to believe that it would
           do so, he is not compellable to answer".
Then there is some reference by the Master of the Rolls to a
                        ?hlc!> 1 sha11 n°t weary you with, because
they are all dealt with in the judgment itself and the statements
or principle in the judgment.

     Could you go down to H on that same page:

          "But if it appears to the judge that, by being
          compelled to answer, a witness may" (I stress the "may*
          sir) "may be furnishing evidence against himself, whicf
          could" (I stress the "could" sir) "be used against him
          in criminal proceedings or in proceedings for a
          penalty, then his objection should be upheld.

          There is the further point: once it appears that a
          witness is f»t risk, then 'great latitude should be
          allowed to him in judging for himself of the effect of
          any particular question': see R. v. Boyes".
                                                                  30

             "It   may only be one link in he chain, or only
             corroborative of existing material, but still he i=
             bound to answer if he believes on reasonable grounc
             that it could be used against him. it is not neces
             tor him to show that proceedings are likely to be t
             against him, or could probably be taken against him
             It may be improbable that they will be taken but
             nevertheless, if there is some risk of their being
             taken, a real and appreciable risk as distinct from
             remote or insubstantial risk, then he should not be
             made to answer or to disclose the documents".
 I stop/there for my purposes in relation to this authority            a
 least in the judgment of Lord Denning.

        Could I then ask you to turn over to the next page. We i
 move to the judgment of Lord Justice Roskill, which is pages
 a5 * k 25,page
 of the      and at
                  1ask
                    D. you to look at Page 725, theright-hand sic

             "It has long been a rule of English law, as Lord
            Denning MR has pointed out, that a person cannot
             be required to answer questions or produce documents
            which may lead to his being, if I may be forgiven a
            colloquialism, ’convicted out of his own mouth*. Tt
            is a long line of authorities dealing with this topi
            of which the earliest cited to us was R . v . Boves. a
            decision of the Court of the Queen’s Bench subsequen
            expressly approved by this court in Re Reynolds
            Bgrte Reynolds. Those two cases, and there are othe
            to the same effect, show clearly that a mere asserti
            of a claim for privilege on the ground of an alleged
            risk of self-incrimination is not enough to enable t
            privilege to be successfully claimed. Nor, of cours
            will the court uphold such a claim for privilege whe
            it is made in bad faith.”

          ft^P*Jhere for a moment’ sir. An example of that would
has forni ! ^ e ar? reported cases to this effect, where a man
        ?! example, given a statement to the Police. He goes int.
k ™ " itness box as a prosecution witness.     May be because he h.
n n I ^ f i VenK munity he says*    do not wish to answer these
questions because the answers may incriminate me” , when in fac^
he does not wish to protect himself but what he is trying to dc
is to protect another by not giving that evidence, for example
no?Vh^Uf ®“pl°yer or a friend, in those circumstances he woul<
        not b2SUphefd      falth bUt In bad faith and the privuege
At F:

            The first question which a court must ask itself is
           whether the facts proved in evidence disclose the
           commission of an offence, in some cases a criminal
                                                          31




           offence. The first question here is whether those
           facts disclose that there is a liability on Rio Tinto
           for what counsel for Rio Tinto called ’a penalty


          What, then is the degree of risk of penalty proceeding.'
          following? It seems to me that once a party to legal
          proceedings who is resisting production of documents
          can show facts which establish the existence of a
          penalty offence (or in other cases the commission of a
          criminal offence) the courts should be slow to deprive
          that party of his privilege against self-incrimination
          which the common law now for some three centuries, and
          s 14 of the Civil Evidence Act 1968 today, accords him
          In the absence of bad faith, to say that there is no
          risk of proceedings may in all but the plainest cases
          involve a court claiming for itself a degree of
          prescient foresight to which it would not be wise to
          pretend for it its forecast were wrong and if
          proceedings and penalties were to follow, damage will
          or at least may be done by an erroneous decision of th«
          court which it would not be easy thereafter to undo or
          redress.”

I ask you to turn over the page again to what would be 726. the
left-hand side of the page at D. Again, after a review of the
authorities, Lord Justice Roskill says:

          "It cannot, I think, be right in these cases for
          the court to attempt a quantitative assessment of
          the probability one way or the other of the risk
          of proceedings ultimately being taken, and then
          to seek to draw the line one way where the
          Probabilities in the view of the court are
          thought to be more or less evenly balanced and
          the other where the balance is more disparate.
          It is not for the court to resolve problems of
          this kind by calculating odds. I think that the
          right question to ask is that posed by Shaw LJ; can
          exposure to the risk of penalties (or in other cases t<
          the risk of prosecution for a criminal offence) be
          regarded as so far beyond the bounds of reason as to b.
          no more than a fanciful possibility?”

In fact, later on Lord Justice Shaw said exactly that.

     Could I ask you to turn from that case to part 7 of the
folder you have been handed, because the case ended up in the
House of Lords, where as I say the Court of Appeal’s view was
upheld, as were the dicta of the Master of the Rolls and the
learned Lord Justices. It is interesting to note when the House
of Lords dealt with the case what was said in relation to this
question of the information already being in the possession of,
let us call them in the context of this case, the prosecuting
authorities.  I anticipate you are lacking in numbers again. If
I could ask you to turn over the first page and go to the second
This would be page 437 on the right-hand side, sir, dealing with
                                                         32




that part of the case as to what was held by their Lordships.. I
would draw your attention to (ii) starting with "The RTZ
companies".


          "(ii) The RTZ companies were entitled to claim the
          privilege from the production of documents given by s
          14(1) of the 1968 Act notwithstanding that the
          commission had knowledge of the cartel and had not
          taken any action in respect of it, for if the documents
          were produced under the letters rogatory the RTZ
          companies would be exposed to a greater risk of
          proceedings being brought against them by the
          commission for recovery of a fine than they were
          exposed to at present, since production of the
          documents might authenticate and support the existing
          information in the hands of the commission and afford
          conclusive proof of a breach by the RTZ companies of
          the prohibition against cartels, and might cause the
          commission to decide to take action against the RTZ
          companies” .

So, sir, we have there the House of Lords dealing with the point
that may be raised in this case as to the decision that has been
taken by the Director in this case, but who knows what will
happen in the future.

     Could you then turn four pages on to what would be page 445
between B-C, still the speech of Lord Wilberforce. He says at C

          ”1 base that conclusion in part on evidence which was
          before and considered by the High Court and the Court
          of Appeal and in part on the proposition that the
          tendency to expose to a penalty would be increased if
          the documents in question were to be validated and
          connected with the RTZ companies by sworn evidence,
          as opposed to being, as they are now, pieces of paper
          found in a file".

Sir, it won’t have escaped you the difference between, albeit th<
evidence that was given before Lord Justice Taylor was all taken
down, it was not evidence that was given on oath, but of course
the evidence before you would be given on oath.

     Then, sir, could you turn another six pages, pages 456 and
457. "To give any evidence” . This is the speech of Viscount
Dilhorne, between G-H, and you appreciate, sir, I am only pickin.
those parts which are germane to this matter:

          ’’Secondly, it was argued that the discovery of the
          document would not in the circumstances tend to expose
          the RTZ companies to such proceedings". (That is for a
          penalty) "It was said that as the commission had
          knowledge from the ’Friends of the Earth' documents fo
          a considerable time of the existence of the cartel and
          had taken no action, there was no real risk of such
          proceedings if the documents in the possession of the
          RTZ companies were disclosed".


Then he deals with the arguments and reference to certain
authority.

     If you could move to page 457, the right-hand side, between
C-D, and he refers to what was said by Lord Denning in the Court
of Appeal to which I have just referred you, he says:

          "With these observations I respectfully agree. It was
          suggested that the reasoning in the Triplex case had
          reduced the burden which formerly lay on a person
          claiming privilege but I do not think that that is the
          case. In his judgment du Parq LJ reviewed the earlier
          cases and based his conclusions on them. Lord Denning
          MR contrasted a real and appreciable risk with a remote
          or insubstantial one, and once it appears that the risl
          is not fanciful, then it follows that it is real. If
          it is real, then there must be a reasonable ground to
          apprehend danger, and, if there is, great -latitude is
          to be allowed to the witness and to a person required
          to produce documents.

          If the RTZ companies are compelled to produce the
          documents which they were asked to produce, I
          cannot reach the conclusion that it would be
          fanciful to suppose that that would expose them to
          no greater risk than at present of proceedings for
          the recovery of a penalty being brought against
          them. The documents might well authenticate and
          support the information now in the hands of the
          commission” .

So what the learned Law Lord is saying, sir, in my submission,
that even though the Commission nad evidence before it which thei^
had decided to take no action on, the production of these
documents, the production of additional information, may well be
sufficient to cause them to take a different view.

     There is just one further part I would ask vou to look at,
and that is in the speech of Lord Diplock. Page 465 on the
right-hand side of a page which begins, "The privilege claimed b:
the RTZ companies". Could you go to the right-hand side, sir, a*
B:

          "I do not think that your Lordships are entitled to
          dismiss as fanciful the risk that if the documents
          relating to the cartel were produced at the trial in
          the Virginia proceedings and came, as they then would,
          into the public domain, the resulting publicity in thi:
          sensitive political field might result in pressure on
          the commission to take against the RTZ companies
          speedier and severer action than they might otherwise
          have done” .

Sir, having regard to both past and recent events, some events s-
s“ Lr:r£r?H;ss:"                 '        zr™
              /So, sir, that is the law
 misunderstood the situation so far as the Director's
 decision was concerned.   At that stage they indicated that
 Mr. Duckenfield would then be prepared to make a statement,
 or might be prepared to make a statement, for the purposes
 of the disciplinary proceedings.   They received bv letter
 of the 6th September, 1990, this reply:

      "You are correct when you say that the DPP has decided
      that there is insufficient evidence to prosecute your
      client for any criminal offence arising out of the
      Hillsborough tragedy.   It is also correct to say that
      the disciplinary issues now have to be considered by
      South Yorkshire Police in consultation with the Police
      Complaints Authority.   I believe you are also aware
      there are outstanding civil actions being brought by
      various parties with an interest in the matter and that
      there are ninety-five Coroner's inquests to be
      reconvened.

     I am aware that at the interview on the 3rd of July,
     1990, your client intimated that once the DPP had made
     his decision in respect of the criminal issues he would
     consider being interviewed in respect of any
     disciplinary matters.   If that is still his wish then
     I am ready to conduct that interview, but it must be
     understood that the disciplinary matters are very
     closely related to the criminal issues so any interview
     would have to be conducted under a Police and Criminal
     Evidence Act caution and the transcript of the
     questions and answers would have to be sent to the DPP
     for further consideration of the criminal matters.

     That is the position in respect of any new or
     additional evidence which comes to light, forexample,
     that which may arise out of the civil actions or the
     Coroner s inquests*   It is not for me to advise you or
     your client as to how you, or he, should proceed, but
     it seems to me that you should be aware of the
     foregoing information.”

     Sir, one could not have a clearer statement, in my
submission, of it being said that anything that is said by
any witness in these proceedings, but my concern is Chief
Superintendent Duckenfield, who after all is the only police
officer in this matter who was suspended and remains
suspended as a result of this tragedy, that anything that is
said by him will, as a matter of course, be sent to the
Director and, who knows, it may be that the Director on
receiving such information will reconsider his decision.

     In my submission it cannot be said that the risk    to
      Superintendent Duckenf ield is a fanciful one as   to the
likelihood of proceedings taking place.    Indeed, one   knows
that only a matter of days ago, and I ask you to look    at
something I mentioned earlier, and this is at section 3 of
the bundle:

     "Mr. Duckenfield, as with some other Officers, still
     has hanging over his head the disciplinary proceedings
     pursuant to the making of complaints under Regulation 7
     of the Police Disciplinary Regulations of 1985.”

Though documents have been served on him pursuant to
Regulation 7 dealing with those matters.




               Of course, anything he says..
     offence had been committed and that for other
     verdicts (except an open verdict) they had to be
     satisfied on the balance of probabilities.
     Furthermore, when directing a jury on
     manslaughter comprising unlawful killing alleged
     to have occurred because of neglect on the part
     of police, the coroner was required to direct the
     jury on four matters..."

I pause there.    My submission is this, against the
background of the submission I have already made, namely
that any question which Mr.'Duckenfield was asked would
have the tendency to incriminate that in relation to those
four matters that the Divisional Court referred to, if any
question is asked of Mr. Duckenfield which touches upon any
of these four matters, or of any of the four ingredients of
the first matter to which the Divisional Court refers,
there will be a tendency to incriminate him in the very
nature of the question itself because these are questions
which would be directed to the possible commission of a
criminal offence.    Those matters are these:

     " — firstly that they had to be satisfied, on the
     evidence, of four ingredients, namely (a) that
     the police were under a duty to have regard to
     the health and welfare of the deceased..."

So any question to Mr. Duckenfield as to his duty in
relation to the spectators at Hillsborough, or those who
tragically died, would require an answer which would have a
tendency to incriminate. It continues:

     "...(b) that in the circumstances there was a
     failure to do what should have been done for the
     health and welfare of the deceased..."

So any question asked of Mr. Duckenfield as to what he did
or did not do that day which touched upon the health and
welfare of the deceased would be a question which would
require an answer which would tend to incriminate him. It
goes on:

     "...(c) that the failure amounted to a
     substantial cause of death..."

So any question asked of him - of course this is only a
privilege of self-incrimination - as to causation between
what he did and any death or deaths, or the deaths of those
who died in general terms, would be a question which would
tend to incriminate, that is, the answer would tend to
incriminate and:
on that particular question Mr. Duckenfield or perhaps
myself saying, "Sir, I object to answering that question.
1 rely on privilege".   The risk of prejudice so far as the
Jury is then concerned is overwhelming both in so far as
Mr. Duckenfield is concerned and indeed the position so far
as the South Yorkshire Police themselves as a body are
concerned (and here I intrude a little on to Mr. Payne's
territory).

     One can perhaps, no matter how carefully you are
directing, see the difficulty that would be in the mind of
the Jury if to every question the position of privilege is
claimed. They would be bound to think, "What has this man
got to hide?" You, sir, know and my learned colleagues and
I know, that such a privilege is said not to be taken
against a man but lay people and lawyers are quite
different and there comes a time when they say to
themselves, "There is something funny here. We are not
being told the whole truth and whatever".   My concern is
that even in the asking of a question that may be
disallowed by you there will be sufficient in the question
to prejudice the Jury against either Mr. Duckenfield or
others.

     I come back to the point I made earlier about the line
being drawn.   Everything at the moment is above the line.
I am concerned there should be nothing below the line which
may prejudice Mr. Duckenfield.    May I go back to the
analogy you drew as to the straightforward case of the
reckless driver and the fatality?

      I anticipate that it would be your practice - let us
say no PACE interview had taken place - that the driver had
relied upon his right not to answer any questions, as has
taken place in this case so far Mr. Duckenfield was
concerned, and you would not in those circumstances with
the driver facing the possibility of prosecution say to the
driver, "You must answer these questions as to what you did
and what you thought" etc. You would not expect the driver
to answer those questions in those circumstances. Mr.
Duckenfield is in exactly the same position.

     It may be said that Mr. Duckenfield is such an
important participant in the events of that day that
without him what is the point of going on at all but in my
submission that would be misconceived because the privilege
is only against self-incrimination. There are many, many
people, both police officers and civilians who can give
evidence as to the facts and the factual decisions that Mr.
Duckenfield took on that day and so the Jury will not in
any way be deprived of the opportunity of hearing about
what happened. They would just be deprived of not being
told by Mr. Duckenfield.
     I come back again to the point that I made at the
outset.   Whilst this is a high profile Inquest, it is
important not to disregard the rights of any individual who
has interests of his own and important interests which are
affected by the law.

     I finally say this - and I know I have been on my feet
for quite some time and I do not want to weary you
further - that if it be felt necessary by you, and both you
and I know, sir, that there are no PACE statements or
interviews by Mr. Duckenfield, that the Jury must hear
something about what Mr. Duckenfield said about the day
then, sir, upon instructions - and it is only on this basis
that I put this - I have no complaint with what Mr.
Duckenfield said to the Taylor Inquiry going before the
Jury. I say that because that is all above the line as
opposed to anything new below the line.

     That has already been considered by the Director and
my concern is that there is something else. It may be
said, "We can ask him the same questions and if the
Director has already considered those matters, well then,
frankly what has he got to worry about?" Sir, the asking
of the question (a) is unlikely to be in the same terms and
(b) the answer is unlikely to be in the same terras and it
does not have to be an answer which is an admission of any
offence.   It only has to be, on the authorities, a step
possibly towards this, and again, sir, you have the dicta
where that is made abundantly clear.

     I fear, and I know you are mindful of this, sir, that
this is really the last opportunity for the families (and
one can understand their concern and I do not criticise
them at all) through my learned friend, Mr. King, or Mr.
Hytner who may well be brought in, as Mr. King mentioned on
the last occasion to, cross-examine Mr. Duckenfield or
other witnesses, to produce extra evidence to get that
which they have, which we see, been pressing for. It is in
those circumstances that seeking to protect Mr.
Duckenfield's interests, to be fair to him whilst being
fair to others, and being mindful of the restricted area of
Inquests as this is not a Public Inquiry, this is not the
Spanish Inquisition, this is not the Star Chamber, not only
should be the questions which he is to be asked that he
should not be obliged to give evidence at all. Those are
my submissions, sir.

     THE CORONER:   Can I just make two small points before
I call anybody else? Perhaps it was my fault, I do not
recollect, but if I instanced an RTA where the driver was
reckless then I made a mistake because if a driver had been
reckless he would have been charged with causing death by
reckless driving and under Section 16 of the Coroner's Act
I would have had to adjourn it sine die. The point I was
trying to make was that under normal circumstances it was
the ordinary driver.

     MR. ISAACS:   Let us say, it is probably my fault,
careless driving or driving without due care.

     THE CORONER:    It makes no difference to the argument
but I just wanted to be clear that we were talking about
the same thing.
                   I
     MR. ISAACS:   It is important. The seriousness of the
crime is neither here nor there.   It is a privilege, as you
and I know, against self-incrimination in any offence.   I
am obliged to you, sir.

     THE CORONER:   It is 1236 and in twenty minutes we
will be rising because at two o'clock we are starting with
the Jury. Can you indicate whether any of you feel you
wish to address me on the point which Mr. Isaacs has made?
What you are saying is that there is clear authority that a
person does not have to answer questions which tend to
incriminate him, to use the text of the rule, and you cited
the rule plus several cases. Do any of you feel you want
to address me on the point which Mr. Isaacs has made? As I
understand it, what you are saying is that there is clear
authority for saying that a person does not have to answer
a question which may tend to incriminate him and you cited
the rule plus several cases. It is exceedingly difficult
to formulate questions where people are in danger of
prosecution which are meaningful and in the circumstances
what is the point of getting the man or the witness to come
into the box at all? You are not suggesting that a PACE
statement, if there is one, or anybody else should be
excluded?

     MR. ISAACS:   No, sir, not at all.

     THE CORONER:   Have I summarised very, very briefly
the heart of your submission?

     MR. ISAACS:   Indeed you have, sir. To call him in
those circumstances would only serve to disadvantage him as
well as others in addition to the prejudice which would be
caused. You have summarised it absolutely correctly.

     THE CORONER:   The fourth point you have made is that
the damage of refusing to answer the questions is out of
proportion to the benefit of having him here as a witness?

     MR. ISAACS:   There is no benefit in having him here
because any question he is asked is bound to have the
tendency to incriminate him on the basis of the principles
I have put before you.                   '

     THE CORONER:   I look to Mr. King, first of all
because he is the most likely person to address me on the
issues. Are you likely to address me on this?

     MR. KING: Sir, I would wish to. There are two
matters. One I would wish to hear if anybody else has
anything to say in support and, secondly, in the light of
what has just fallen from my learned friend's lips as to
the use of the transcript I Vould like to take certain
instructions from those whom I represent.

     THE CORONER:   Mr. Isaacs, it seems to me that it
would be wise, before I give a ruling on your submission,
to allow other people to have their say so that I can hear
different points of view and secondly, it gives me a chance
to think about it as well. If you do not think it rude,
what I intend to do is not proceed with the point at this
stage because we cannot deal with the submissions on what
is quite an important point actually in twenty minutes and
we will deal with it either at four this afternoon, subject
to your agreement, when the Jury go or if it is more
convenient to you we can deal with it at four tomorrow or
any other day.




               /Mr. Duckenfield is not going.
Hr. Duckenfield is not going to be called in the immediate
future, so in that sense it is not urgent that we have eot
to have a ruling this morning.

     HR. ISAACS:   Sir, save for this, that I am afraid -
and you may have gleaned this from some of tne newspapers,
I think - that I will not have the privilege of being
before you on most days during this Inquest.

       THE CORONER:    I had not appreciated that.
        9

     HR. ISAACS:   You had not, sir, but no, I arc afraid
that is the position.  Without going into any details I am
afraid that the cost of representation would be so great,
and there is no sufficient funds for him at the present
time. The Police Authority have unfortunately failed to
agree that he or others in a similar position should have
their representation paid for, so I am afraid that he will
not be represented during the course of this inquest, sir,
other than on the days when, if you do decide that he
should be called, he is actually giving evidence.

     THE CORONER:    And presumably on the days when any
statement *• in fact, I think there is one,  it is not very
long but I think there is one - were to be dealt with?

     MR. ISAACS:   That may or may not be the case, sir,
but one can understand the difficulties.  May I say this,
in relation to what you said just a moment ago, and this
perhaps is a little special pleading? You said a moment
ago you did not want to be rude - I think I can speak on
behalf of all my learned friends, it is a long time since
we have been before a tribunal wiich is so courteous and
we are very grateful to you for that. We are not perhaps
used to being treated so well.

       THE CORONER:   Will you be here this afternoon?

       MR. ISAACS:    I shall be here this afternoon, sir.
yes.                                                     '■

     THE CORONER:    In that case shall we deal with it
this afternoon?   Is that agreeable to all of you? I know
it makes it a longer day but I did say at our business
meeting that the lawyers nave to put up with the strain.
I don t like to subject my jury to too heavy pressure,
because it is not fair on them, but we have just got to
put up with it, so to speak.   Is that agreeable to
everybody? Good.

     Is there any other --- perhaps you could outline the
nature of your submissions, so I know what we have got in
sfore, so to speak.

     MR. MANNING:   The first thing I am going to do, if I
may, is to pay tribute to the way in which my learned
   ' Z ....               iuc matter Detore vou, and the
second thing I am not going to do is to repeat it. It
does not get stronger or better by repetition.

     Vou know that   I represent Superintendent Hurray. He
nas made a statement under the Police and Criminal
Eyidence Act. * expect that in one form or another that
will be brought before this hearing at some stage, and
having done tnat I find myself adopting, and .li the more
so, the views thathave been canvassed before you.

     At*the end of tnis hearing the verdict will be one
for the Jury and as learned as we hope we may be in the
ways in which a Coroner's Inquest is to proceed, the fact
of the matter is that the probability is that most of the
people wio will be on the Jury have never been on any
jury, and I shall certainly be surprised if they have ever
been on a Coroner's Jury. With tne best directions in the
world, tha fact of the matter, as we know from juries and
experience, is that some people can take one \.’hat seems to
be minor and inconsequential point and make that the
deciding and turning factor upon which everything else
falls.

      It is impossible, in the words that have been read to
you by my learned friend, for it to be conceivable that a
Jury will not in its mind's eye say, "What on earth is
2>oing on here under this rule against self-
incrimination?", and "Why are we not being allowed to see
the person?” , and therefore there is damage beyond measure
in even going to that stage which suggests that a person
snould be called into a witness box, give their name and
address, and somebody, whether it is you or whether it is
the witness or the lawyer for that witness, referring to
the Rule, and w.iether then the Jury is asked to retire,
tne fact of the matter is they have got the whiff of
something and when they have got that scent the brain
begins to run wild and we can have no control over what
part that is likely to play in the ultimate decision
making process.

      Therefore, in adopting tne legal submissions and in
not seeking to put them before you over and over again, I
have to say that considering what questions may be raised,
and considering those criteria which have been put before
you as to the sorts of questions which clearly have to be
in the mind, and have to be enquired into, if those are
the questions which normally would be asked and there is
t?ie Rule and the law, and that is what we, and you, sir,
are here to uphold, the law, if the law says that a person
s.iould not be put in that position, categorically should
not, then it seems to me, with respect, that you should
therefore make a ruling that you are not going to have tne
witness put into it, and you can make whatever explanation
you want, because you can simply read the law to the Jury
                                                                   50




         and, make them clear that they should dismiss that from
         their minds.

               THE CO k OWE;:: Mr. King, I will skip you, if I may -
          not out of discourtesy.
    B
              MISS SINCLAIR:   Sir, I do not adopt the submissions
         made by my learned friend, Mr. Isaacs, and indeed, I have
         no other submissions to make at this stage.

             * THE   CORONER:   You do not?

               MISS SINCLAIR:     I do not.

                HR. CAICHt’OLE:   Sir, can I say* on behalf of tne
          Officers of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, that we
          came nere prepared and expecting to see every witness
          called to give evidence, subject to the normal rules, and
          indeed, as I hope has been made clear, we are anxious to
          help throughout.    I would like, however, to reserve my
          position in the light of any ruling you may make.    If the
          senior Police Officers are not going to be giving evidence
          at this inquiry naturally that is something I would like
           to have the opportunity of discussing with my clients.   I
          cannot predict what the outcome will be of that, and if
          necessary I will make an application at a later stage.    At
          present I have no observations actually on the
          applications made by my learned friends.

               MRS. McBRIEN:   Sir, I would personally be very
         pleased if Mr# Duckenfield would appear in this Court so
         that I can put questions to him directly.   As he was t*he
         main participant in the disaster I was looking forward to
         raeeting Mr. Duckenfield so that I would be able to meet
         him face to face.   That is all.

               MR. CALLAGHAN:    Sir, I have no observations to make.

                   ADD LEMAN:  Sir, as you are aware I represent
         the Police Federation and the ruling that you are about to
         make clearly will have a generalised application and apply
         to certain witnesses whom I represent.   Sir, in short, at
         tnis stage I would wish to say that in principle I also
         echo and adopt those submissions whicn have been made by
I        my learned friend, Mr. Isaacs.   Clearly individual
         decisions are going to have to be made by certain
         individuals, dependent upon your ruling.

           ...." S * 1 WKUJd       sir» in particular, is that in ray
         .respectful submission it would indeed be preferable for
         such individuals not to give evidence at all if that

    , Secondly, those of you who were here for Lord Justice
Taylor s Inquiry, we have been provided with the big rooms
on tne other side of the main staircase - one is called
the Mandela Room, the other I have forgotten the name of.
The Mandela Room has been laid out with a big screen like
this,-so if taere is an overflow or somebody wants to know
what is going on but does not want to be in the Court,
they can go and watch and near.    As I understand it, if we
use, for example, a video, you will see tne video but you
will not be able to see the Court, because we have only
got one camera.   In the normal course of events you will
be' able to see and near what* is going on in Court but in
certain circumstances you may have a slightly limited
recording, because of the facilities - we have had to draw
the line somewhere.

     The other room has been laid out and is intended
really mainly for the families, if they want to withdraw
and sit and be quiet.  That is one half of it and in the
other half we have built small partitions, cubicles, so if
any of you wish to speak to your clients you have got a
measure of privacy but they are not soundproof, so you
have to judge how good they are and whether you want to
use them.  They are there for your use if you wish.

     At the bask of the hall Ithink there is   a  list of
restaurants, which has not been putup by me,   so if you
want to go and look and see what is what and   where you can
go - and no doubt there are dozens of otners   as well - we
are rignt in the centre of town so it should   not be too
difficult to eat and have refreshments.

     We have had quite a long session.  I hope you will
forgive me, but I wanted to get on with it. We are going
to rise.  Is there anything - yes, Mrs. McErien?

     MRS. McBRIEN:   I just wanted to say something
relating to the other matter earlier in the day.  I was
wondering if the time limits could be extended, in the
individual inquests, the time limit of 3.15 for the day in
question could be extended for individual inquests but not
apply to the generic inquest?

     ^THE C0.10HER: The answer to that is that I took Mr.
King s submission to incorporate that point and I have
said what I want and am not going to change my mind on it.
I am going to stick to what I have said, 3.15 or
thereabouts, so I am not extending it but-we did say that
if there are any specific errors which you were going to
bring to my attention in the summaries, that I would
consider it, and that would apply, to you as well, of
course, as far as your boy is concerned.

     MRS. McBRIEN:   Thank you.
town so there are plenty of facilities, including a restaurant
upstairs.  So we are going to say to you, fend for yourselves-
and my Jury Officers will sort out the financial reimbursement
There are rules and limits, but they will have told you that.  I:
they have not, ask, so that you know how much you can spend
without being out of pocket.  It is adequate, you will find.

        One advantage of giving you sandwiches, was that we had vou
nicely segregated from everybody else, and we won’t have that if
we allow you to run free, but after all. you go home in the
evenings as well; don’t you, so I ca n ’t see any good reason why
you should not do whatever you wish, but please remember the rul<
is no discussion with anybody about the case.     It is very
difficult, but you must follow it. particularly in a building
like this where you can see there are quite a lot of people here
I have met quite a lot of these people and I still do n ’t
recognise most of them, and so it is very easy if you start
talking to strangers you may find you are talking to people who
you in no circumstances you should have opened your mouth to. S<
d o n ’t talk to anybody. So will you please do that for me?

      If you find I am going on for too long, because we won't be
rising quite as frequently as we did at the Medico Legal Centre
because it is slightly different now, but if you think I am goin;
on too long you are near enough now to attract my attention and
to say, ’’Can we stop and have a cup of coffee” , or something, an<
of course, if any of you need to stop because you are not feelin;
well or because you were indisposed in some way then obviously
you must let me know.   It is exceedingly important that vou are
all here, because if we are not we have to stop* We have no
control over Our lives completely, but unless there is a really
compelling reason why you cannot be here please be here.    It doe.
not actually inconvenience ne, because if I am not here I am
doing something else, but it inconveniences everybody else,
because- we would have to adjourn it until we are back again, so
to speak, as a group.

        I think that is all I need to say on domestic natters.. May
I ask, were any of you in Court this morning, because somebody
suggested that you were? None of you were in Court? That is
good, because we did not want you in Court. That is right, none
of you, members of the Jury, were in Court in the morning? That
is important, because if we have legal submissions and I ask you
to go out you must stay out.     It may be when it is all over and
we have finished I will explain to you why we do that, but I
d o n ’t think I will do it now because we have not got much time,
and it can wait, I am sure.

      I am not going to tell you the potential verdicts which you
will have to consider because we    are going to hearthe evidence,
find when we have heard the evidence I am going to sum it up,
hopefully, and I will direct you with regard to the law and
anything else I need to tell you, and then you will retire and
tak§“your time and so o n .

     I do want to draw one or two rules to your attention,
because it is exceedingly important that you should understand i
now and that everybody else should understand it. This is not
actually a rule but it is a general point. We are doing
Inquests. There are 95 of them but we are doing them together.
This is not a trial. Nobody is accused of anything in my Court.
It is not a Public Inquiry, so we don’t roam beyond my brief. I
is not adversarial in the sense that the parties can introduce
their own witnesses and put them up to me to listen to and then
make a judgment. I introduce the witnesses. That is not to say
that if parties want to draw my attention to a particular witnes
or witnesses whom they would like me to consider, they can do
that and have done because a lot of water has flowed under the
bridge since we last met, but in the final analysis it is my
decision whom we call, rightly or wrongly, and it is an
inquisition.

     The next thing to understand, and this is very, very
important, is that this is an inquisition not on behalf of the
relatives, not on behalf of the South Yorkshire Police, not on
behalf of the club, not on behalf of Eastwoods, not on behalf of
the supporters generally. It is an Inquiry by me, and if you
like because I am called Her Majesty’s Coroner you may take it i*
is on behalf of the State or Her Majesty the Queen. So it is
important to understand that, and I have to keep on reminding
myself of this as well, because otherwise we get misled into
thinking we are doing this for others, and of course you realise
and I am conscious and so are you and everyone else, of the
families, so it is important that the evidence which we call
should seek to be intelligible and relevant and answers as far a:
one can some of the things which concern and worry them. It is
very important to know that this is not done because they are
bereaved people. It is because somebody has died and the Act
says that when that happens the Coroner should hold an
inquisition either on his own or with a jury. Well, we are with
a jury, of course.

     I      have already indicated to you the ove***1! limitations o
an Inquest, so i am not going to repeat that, but there is
another very important corollary to this, and that is Rule 22.
am going to read this rule to you because you have got to
understand it, because it may be relevant at some point. It
won’t be relevant today, but I want to get it right at this
stage. What it says is:

          "(1) No witness at an Inquest shall be obliged to
          answer any question tending to incriminate himself.

          (2) Where it appears to the Coroner that the witness
          has been asked such a question the Coroner shall infon
          the witness that he may refuse to answer".

Now, this is a fundamental principle of Coronal Inquisitions, an*
it may well be a fundamental principle in a load of other courts
but I am not interested in what happens elsewhere. I am
interested here. An important thing to understand is that if
somebody exercises their right it is a right. It is not that
they may or may not. They have a right .not to answer questions
which may incriminate them. You must not draw inferences from
                                                         57




the exercise of their rights.
   ✓
     That does not mean to say that you may not hear evidence
from other people which may tend to incriminate them. That is
not the point, but you cannot expect somebody to stand up and
say, "I did it". It happens in TV series, but it does not happer
generally speaking in real life, but it is part and parcel of the
overall structure of Coronal jurisdiction, and it is designed (a)
to protect the individual or individuals who may be involved, anc
(b) to ensure that if it were to be that some other proceedings
were to take place in some other court we have not muddied the
water.




                          /So there is actually a dual
   ' MRS. McBRIEN:   Sir, and members of the Jury, I am
Joan McBrien and I appear on behalf of our family in this
matter.

     MR. CALLAGHAN:   Andrew Callaghan, solicitor, on
behalf of the Ambulance Service.

     MISS ADDELMANN:   My name is Andrea Addelmann of
Counsel.   I am instructed fry Russell, Jones and Walker
and I represent the Police Federation.

     MR. RUSSELL:   I am Christopher Russell.   I am a
barrister.   I am instructed by solicitors called Barlow,
Lyde and Gilbert and I represent the interests of
Superintendent Greenwood.

      THE CORONER:  You might ask, having told you all
about this inquisitorial system and how I do it all:
what are they doing here?   The answer is that the rules
which I have already referred to permit interested
parties to be present, obviously.   The rules permit them
to ask questions which is why Mrs. McBrien is there, and
the rules also provide that people can be represented by
their legal representatives and that is why they are
here.

     Of course, if it is correct and opportune they will
ask questions of the witnesses and within the limits
which I have outlined to you they will be permitted to do
so.

     Now without any further ado, all I will say is that
these inquests are concerned with a disaster vhich
happened at a football stadium known as Hillsborough
Football Stadium, on the 15th of April, 1990.   You will
learn as we go along more details about it.

     Now I think the first thing is we will call Steven
Brown.

                  STEVEN BROWN Sworn

                   Bv THE CORONER:

Can you give me your full name? - A. I am Police

         incident? - A. Most of them, yes, sir.

      Q. Can you put them up one at a time and we will number
         them.   Let's put the first one up.   We are going to
         give these all "C" numbers in our usual way.   This is
         C.249.   That is what? - A. Aerial photograph of the
         ground, sir.

              THE CORONER:   Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, in
       . football parlance, apparently, the stand is a place where
         you sit and the terrace is the place where you stand:

      Q. Yes, next please.    What is that?   (C.252) - A. It is a
         photograph, sir of the west terrace and west stand.

         in two bits, in effect? - A. That is correct, sir.

      Q« Can you put the second one up as well?   (C.254).   The
         next one please.   This is another aerial view.   That
         gives a better impression of the Leppings Lane end? - A.
         Yes, sir.

         (C.255).   Next please.   This is very similar to one you
         have already seen, but what are we intending to see on
         this one? - A. Sir, this shows the turnstiles 1 to 16.

      Q» Turnstiles 1 to 16?   (C.256).    This i§ what? - A. This
         shows the turnstiles A to G.

      Q* (*G%257).  Can you see the A to G on there?   There are
         the big "Bs" and then underneath it there are the
         letters, A, B, C, D, E, F, G.    Next. - A. This shows

     Q. Can you put that back?   That is turnstiles...   What is
j\      that? - A. That is turnstiles A, C and B, sir, also the
        courtyard and the metal wall.

     Q. I see, these are bracketed.   Nov put gate B up again,
        please.   That is one of the exit gates. (C.259).    What
        is that? - A. That shows gate C to the left of the wall.

     Q. Can you point at it? - A. Yes, sir.

     Q. (C.260). - A. Sir, this photograph shows the gate locks
        and the observation panel in the gate.

     Q. The observation panel is that little square thing? - A.

     Q.    (C.261). - A. Sir, this shows a view of the concourse
          beyond the turnstiles and a hole in the wall which leads
          round to the north-west terrace.

     Q. (C.262). - A. This shows the tunnel leading to enclosures
        3 and 4 and also shows the standing sign and the letters
        B and A above the tunnel.

     Q. This is behind the turnstiles... - A. Leading from the
        concourse into the enclosures.

     Q.    Down towards the terracing.      (C.263) - A. This
          photograph shows th<% standing    sign on a pillar at the far
          eight of the photograph.

     Q. Can you again point to it up there please?   If you had
        followed that you would have finished up in enclosure 1.

   concourse end of the tunnel.

Q. (C.265). - A. This shows the gates at the terrace end of
   the tunnel and the radial fence which separates the two
   enclosures.

Q. End on, of course, the radial fence? - A. Yes.

Q. (C.266).   This photograph was obviously taken very soon
   after the incident.   What is it? - A. This shows the
   gates at the rear of the enclosures giving access to all
   of the enclosures in the Leppings Lane terraces.

Q. Can you point where they are?   I can see them because I
   know where they are.   (C.267).   Just point to the
   tunnel exit.   Yes. - A. This photograph shows the
   barriers in enclosures 3 and 4.

Q« (C.268) Could you point out which is enclosure 3 and
   which is enclosure 4? - A. This is enclosure 3 and
   enclosure 4.

Q. It is just an overview. - A. This photograph shows the
   perimeter fences separating the terraces from the pitch.

Q* (C.269).    The people on that photograph had nothing to
   do with it*    It just happens that they were there. - A.
   This shows the top of those fences where the wire bends
   inwards towards the enclosures.

Q* (C.270). - This shows the radial fences separating the
   enclosures in the Leppings Lane terraces.

Q* (C.271). • A« This shows the police control box and the
   electric clock and display board above it.

Q. Just show us where the clock is. - A. This is the
   electric clock.

Q« Switched off* - A. Switched off, and the display board
   here.

Q* The police control box is that building with the word
    Skips" written on it, or that structure? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. (C.272). - A. Finally, sir, this is an internal view of
   the police control box.

Q. That will be C.273.

     MRS. McBRIEN:   Sir, have you a photograph of the
area past gate C, the no man's land area, where people
were not supposed to go but they went for safety reasons,
I think?   Have you any photographs where they could have
gone in that passageway?

     THE CORONER:   I know what Mrs. McBrien is after.
We will have a look and see whether we have got a
photograph of that area.   It is in fact on the aerial
shots if you look.   We will see whether we have got one
which might show that area for you.

        MRS. McBRIEN:             Thank you, sir.

      THE CORONER:   Thank you, Officer.   PC Brown will
 be back probably tomorrow morning with the videos.

     Next Michael Layton if he is here.    You are sworn
actually, Mr. Layton so you don't need to be sworn again.

      Ladies and gentlemen, witnesses who have already
 been sworn I can see no advantage in re-swearing. Are
 you happy with that or did you wish to hear him sworn?
 I cannot see any point in it.

  number of agencies.   This material which varied both in
  content, quality of picture and evidential value was
  viewed by members of the team, copied and scheduled.
  Each film and photograph were given a unique reference
  number.   The schedules prepared were in themselves a
  precis of the events shown on film.

  Ultimately, sir, a composite film was prepared in
  conjunction with the Treasury Solicitor's Department,
  which was shown at Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry.   This
  film was designed to show what was felt to be the most
  important scenes and sequence of events.

   Sir, that film was given the reference number MRE.2.

Q. Is that the one that I... - A. That is the composite
   film, sir.

Q. The compilation? - A..The compilation, sir, yes.

Q. I think it is right - you have said it but I just want
   you to confirm it - this wasn't prepared solely by the
   West Midlands, it was done in conjunction with the
   Treasury Solicitors? - A. That is absolutely correct,
   sir.

Q. They had. somebody there who was looking? - A. Physically
   present, yes, sir.

   Likewise photographic material was obtained from various
   sources which was examined and scheduled in the same
   manner.   Continuity in respect of all this material is
   not necessarily complete since the person handing over
   the material to the police is not necessarily the person
   originating that material.




               In an effort to analyse...
                                                               65




                                                       M LAYTON
In an effort to analyse the contents of the visual evidence
for the purposes of the Inquest some of the material has
been grouped into a number of key areas. As such the
sequence of events as referred to here in this statement do
not run in strictly chronological form, rather it deals
with a number of specific points.

   First of all, sir, having regard to the movements of
people at the Leppings Lane end of the ground I can make
the following observations with regard to the visual
evidence. On a video film reference TB2 which was filmed
on the South Yorkshire Police CCTV system using an operator
set database, in other words, this shows the date and time
on which the film was recorded, this camera has Dan
facilities.

   It should be noted that videos RJH1 and RJH2 have no
such time clock arid these relate to Sheffield Wednesday
Football Club's own video system, in order to try to
establish the times of events shown on these tapes a
comparison was made from events that occurred on the RJH2
tape which are also shown on the video referenced TB2 taken
from almost identical positions and which show almost
identical footage.

   To be specific at 14:47:38 hours on the tape referenced
TB2 a youth is seen to jump from the roof of Turnstiles A
to G into the concourse area. This same scene can be seen
on the tape referenced RJH2. On the tape referenced TB2
again at 14:52:30 hours a youth is seen standing against a
wall near to Gate C with his arm raised and an identical
scene is shown on the tape reference RJH2. The timings of
other events as they appear on RJH2 can then be calculated
using what is called a real time counter on a video player
from either side of these fixed points.

   THE CORONER:   Just pause for a minute.     (To the Jury)
Have you understood what he is saying?

Q. What you are saying is that two of these tapes did not
have a time clock on them? - A. That is right, yes.

Q. An operator one?   -   A.   Yes, that is right.

Q. Then you try to match scenes which were identical and
   once you had got a time for that scene* you could
. calculate backwards and forwards? - A. Yes, that
   is right, sir, using a real time counter-.

Q* “Please carry on? - A. By using this method of
    calculation it is estimated that the tape, referenced
                                                           M LAYTON
   RJH2, would have been switched on at about 12:56
   hours. The same will apply for all the tapes given
   the reference RJH because I understand they were all
   switched on at the same time by PC 1421 Guest of the
   South Yorkshire Police who I believe has since
   retired.

       On a video tape referenced TB2 at 12:00:48 hours,
   supporters are shown arriving in a slow trickle and
   entering the ground at the Leppings Lane end. At
   13:40 hours on the same video a steady flow of
   supporters are seen entering the ground and at
   13:56:33 hours on the same tape the volume of
   supporters has increased. At 14:35:30 hours there is
   a very dense crowd in the courtyard and the perimeter
   gate area. A view of the courtyard is also shown on
   the BBC tape which has been given the reference
   number Map 9. This is a digital reference of 0602
   and the estimated time of that is at 14:35 hours.

Q. Can you just pause there for a moment?   -   A.       Yes.

   THE CORONER:  Members of the Jury, are you happy with
that? I just wanted to be sure that we know what we are
talking about.

Q. I want to turn to the digital reference now?      -    A.
   Yes, sir.

Q. The advantage of having the digital reference is that
   you can find the frame, the scene on the tape, but it
   does not tell you anything about times, is that
   right?
A. At a period of time which in fact i have covered at
   the bottom of this page but it does not show an
   actual time.

Q. Carry on? — A. Again on Map 9, digital reference
   0842 a crowd is gathered in the Leppings Lane end and
   the courtyard is full. At a digital reference of
   0906 Superintendent Marshall is shown amongst the
   crowd. At a digital reference of 1034 youths are
   shown climbing over a metal ribbed gate o n t o the
   roof of Turnstile 16. Between a digital reference Of
   1212 and 1239 Superintendent Marshall is shown
   outside the gates in Leppings Lane, the whole area of
   which is heavily congested. With regard to the tape
   reference Map 9, as I have said, there is an operator
   set digital database on the film. In the initial
   vtages only an estimated time can be worked out on
   the basis that the BBC cameraman, Ian Young, states
                                                   M LAYTON
that filming took place outside the ground at the
Leppings Lane end between 14:35 hours and 14:50 hours
and indeed there are also apparent breaks in the
filming.  In respect of subsequent filming inside the
ground it is accurately timed and time based between
15:03:30 and 15:16:58.


    On a video tape referenced RJH2 at an estimated
time of 14:46 hours a number of youths are seen to
climb on to the roofs of Turnstiles A to G from
outside prior to dropping into the stadium. On a
video tape TB2 at 14:55:21, supporters are shown in
the concourse area moving towards the tunnel. A
number of these changed direction towards a gap in
the wall which gives access to the north side of the
ground.

    On video tape RJH2 which gives an estimated time
of 15:05 hours, the turnstile area and outside
courtyards are clear of incoming supporters. An
Officer in a flat cap and two Police Constables are
seen to run from outside Gate C along the perimeter
drive towards the south stand. Seconds afterwards a
Police Constable runs through Gate C towards the west
stand closely followed from all the Officers in the
turnstile area.

    Sir, in respect of vehicle movement at 14:08:20
hours on a video tape reference TB1, a South
Yorkshire Police video,traffic flowed quite freely
and continued to do so until 14:33:08 where it c m i be
seen that no traffic is able to flow due to
pedestrian congestion in Leppings Lane. At 14:33:27
on the tape TBl a bus and two cars are seen moving
slowly through the crowd in the roadway.

     At 14:35:56 hours on TB2 another bus moves
through the crowd and at 14:36:24 a car. At 14:41:15
a coach moves through the crowd and at 14:45:01 what
looks like a white roofed vehicle is seen arriving in
Leppings Lane immediately behind a bus from the
direction of Penistone Road. At 14:45:03 this bus
passes another one coming in the opposite direction
but the white roofed vehicle remains stationary in
the crowd. Sir, from research of the'written
evidence 1 believe in fact this vehicle was a Police
Landrover being driven by PC 1863 Buxton of the South
Yorkshire Police.

       THE CORONER:   He will be called in due course.
                                                 M LAYTON


Please continue. - a . No further vehicles apart
from this one are seen until at 14:55:35 hours a bus
and a car are seen and a further vehicle at 14:57:25
hours. These latter two vehicles come to a halt in
Leppings Lane and remain stationary. In the tape
RJH2 the vehicle believed to be the Police Landrover
drove through the courtyard area passed Gate C on the
perimeter drive at an estimated time of 15:06:49
hours.

     In relation to the perimeter gate which
separates the turnstile area from Leppings Lane I can
make the following observation with regard to the
visual evidence. At 14:35:22 hours on a video tape
referenced TB2 the perimeter gates are open giving
access to turnstiles and the area near to Gate C.

Can you point to which perimeter gates we are talking
about on the screen? Can you find the overhead and
put that up too? - A. Yes.      At 14:40:26 hours on
the same video all the perimeter gates appear closed.
At 14:52:57 on TB2 people can be seen to be climbing
over the closed perimeter gates. At 14:53:40 hours
this second gate from the left as you look at the
screen opens and supporters enter the turnstile area
in front of Turnstiles A to G.

I realise this is not the video you are referring to
as this is a still but is that the gate we are
talking about can you remember? - A. Yes, looking
®t it from the opposite direction the video camera is
there.

From the inside out and so it is the one that is on
the right on this photograph? - A. That is right,
sir, yes.

You heard the question from Mrs. McBrien about the
sterile area, is that the area where the van is
parked? ** A. I believe it is slightly further in
than where the van is parked.

Further in towards the ground are you saying? - A.
(to the Court Officer) If you could just perhaps
indicate Gate C for me I believe that 'the sterile
area was more or less to the far side of that gate.

   MR. HALE:   It is clear on the model, sir.
                                                  M LAYTON
     THE CORONER:   Could you please continue? I am
sorry to have interrupted you. - A. At 14:53:44
hours the left hand perimeter gates are open. At
14:55:17 hours the right hand perimeter gates canbe
seen open. At 14:56:32 hours the area in front of A
to G up to the perimeter gates appear clearer and
Police Officers can be seen holding the crowd back to
the roadside of the perimeter gates. At 15:02:11
hours there is a close up view of the perimeter gate
area which shows that they are open and relatively
clear with supporters entering the ground.

     Four photographs taken by Michael Warburton Lee
of the South Yorkshire Police show sane damage to a
retaining bolt of the second set of perimeter gates
as you look from the groundside towards Leppings
Lane. These photographs are referenced as DPP190.
There is no acetate available at the moment for you
to view.

     In respect of visual evidence relating to
mounted Officers at the Leppings Lane end of the
ground the video tapes that cover this area are South
Yorkshire Police CCTV and on tape referenced TB2,
also Sheffield Wednesday Football Club's CCTV on a
tape referenced RJH2 and a BBC TV outside broadcast
on a tape referenced Map 9.

     At a digital reference of 0602, estimated time
14:35 on video Map 9« two mounted Officers can be
seen directly in front of Turnstiles A to 6 near to
Gate P.

Pause again. Have we got the acetate plan of the
ground and if so put it up please? Carry on reading
but start again with "mounted Officers"? - A. At a
digital reference of 0602, estimated time 14:35 on
video Map 9, two mounted Officers can be seen
directly in front of Turnstiles A to G near to Gate
B. At 14:35:22 hours on video reference TB2 two
mounted Officers can be seen apparently talking to
supporters in front of Turnstiles A to G.

      Between digital references 0839 to 0847 on a
 video Map 9, nine mounted Officers can be seen in the
 courtyard area from the outer perimeter gates to the
 Turnstiles A to G. At 14:38:08 on video reference
 TB2 a mounted Officer can be seen attempting to ease
 the crowd back from Turnstiles and Gate C. At an
"estimated time of 14:48:23 on video reference RJH2 a
mounted Officer can be seen blocking the entry of
                                                 M LAYTON
supporters through Gate C. This can also be seen at
14:48:26 hours on vide reference TB2.

     At 14:49 hours on video referenced TB2 a mounted
officer can be seen outside Gate C controlling the
crowd. At 14:51:50 hours four mounted Officers can
be seen outside Gate C. At 14:53 hours four mounted
Officers can be seen controlling the crowd in the
area of Gate C. At 14:53:32 hours two mounted
Officers can be seen supervising the flow of
supporters through Gate C.

     In order to try and analyse the visual evidence
available in respect of the opening of the concertina
gates referred to as A, B and C, it is necessary to
refer to three video tapes. Video tapes referenced
RJH2 and RJH1 are black and white video, of poor
quality and with no sound. RJH2 refers to a fixed
site camera which overlooks the rear of Turnstiles A
to G and the concourse area. RJH1 is also part of
the system and covers the area of Gate A and the
concourse area. The particular reference to the
concertina Gate C # sir, it is apparent from visual
evidence on the day in question it was regularly
being used as an entrance and exit point for a number
of reasons i.e. the ejection of supports and tb?    "
movement of Police personnel.

     Being more specific on a tape referenced TB2
timed at 14:39:31 hours a boy is carried through Gate
C by Police Officers. The gate appears to be closed
at 14:40:45 hours. On a video tape referenced RJH2
with an estimated time of 14:48:04 hours Gate C was
opened to eject a support.

t     n r o u g h i.ie gat e into t=ie c o n c o u r s e arsa.

     On the same tape, at an estimated time of 14:48:31
     nours Gate C is closed. On the same tape at an
     estimated time of 14:52:00 hours Gate C is again
             ?? €a*lafiSe ,1umber of supporters entered
     through it itit > th* ground. At 14:57:40 hours, as
     snown on the tape referenced TB2, Gate C is closed.

    ?4 .^q^ioif0rtta>% refe5 e9 ced RJH2 at a" estimated time of
       I I1*- nours G ate C is again nnenod, with supporters
    entering the ground.       In respect of cite A on S' video
    tape referenced T62 it is apparently open at 14:58:09
    nours witn supporters entering via it. At a time
    estimated at 14:58 tne same cene is snown on the video
    1                  K -H ** 0n video tape referenced TB2 at
    14.58.23 a line or Police are shown supervising the
    supporters tn-*ough Gate A.

    T.iere is no clear evidence, sir,-of o w nings in
    relation to Gate B. The video tape from the camera
                 tnis arsa is one of two that were found to
    be missing wnen tney were originally taken possession


           feel it is important to point out in respect of
          J estimated timings, given that where seconds are
    indicated there are always likely to be slight
                   t26Se are dependent on the individual's
    interpretation of a particular sequence of film.

betw«e ! 14:00 and 15:02 hours on bof» 9th April. 1983
and 15th Aoril, 1989. This, sir, has been -,;iven the
reterenc number SDB1.

fooo t*is v;deo u cai1 *>« seen that at 14:00 hours in
1988 \.ie pe.-i^ieter gates nearest tne River Don are
cJc?.* creating: a sterile area along the side of -the
tur .stiles A-G, towards Gate C, wnereas in 1989 tiese
gates are open and people can be seen moving freelv in
t.iis area. At 14:16 nours in 1988 there is a build up
of supporters in front of turnstiles A-G, and back
along Leppings Lane.      In 1989 the build up is more
severe and the area near to Gate C has become very
crowed.    In 1988 at 14:29 nours the roadway in
Lepp;ngs Lan-:? remai :s relatively clear, although
crow»:d, whereas at 14:30 hours in 1989 the Leppings
Lan-s area has become very congested, with supporters
spilling into the centre of Leppings Lane and blocking
the road.

At 1^:43 hours ir. 1988, although it is very crowded,
traffic is still able to pass and the perimeter gates
are still closed, whereas at 14:46 hours in 1989 th-?
area in Cront of the turnstiles and Lepoines Lane is
t Tally blocker..
At 14:52 hours i 1*188 t*h • area adjacent remains
sterile, whereas at 14:52 hours in 1989 the concertina
Gate C was opened ty allow supporters into the ground.
Air 15:Ul nours in >oth 1988 and 1989 the crowd in
Leppings Lane is ver • similar in size and under
control.

Sir, during th.- course of the preliminary inquests I
:;ave evidence in respoct of locations at which it was
believed that tn^ deceased were either alive or dead or
 <oth in Enclosures 3 and 4.     Plans were produced in
respcct of individual deceased.      Subsequently composite
 • l m s were prepared of some of t.iese locations, based
on my evidenc , by Miss Da*’n Goodall, senior plan
f!.*3wer of the West tii 'lands Police.  Because of t ie
pr-'ole;ns associate^ wita tr.'i g to put all locations of
  eceased on t lese two »lans, tney actually only show
the las* position established alive, and th* first
w lere believed • eceased.

Sir, I pro luce a composite plan referenced DHG9 in
res .ct of t ie 1 -ation of the positions of deceased. .
alive, and a composite plan refere .ced D a GIO where they
were beiieved to be   eceased in the enclosures.    Sir,
th_*re are over eads avai-able of these two plans.




  /Q. Yes. - A. There is one point
                                        M. LAYTON


Sir, there are overheads available of these two plans. There
is one point which I need to raise in respect of one of the
plans, sir.  Since the limited Inquests, Mrs. Traynor. mother
of two of the deceased, has viewed visual evidence again. At
the limited Inquest a plan was produced which showed
Christopher in enclosure No. 3 at 14:45, and that location is
reproduced on the plan DRG.9. Since that time Mrs. Traynor
has found Christopher alive at 14:45 outside the ground. So
in fact I would ask you to disregard the one location in
relation to the deceased No. 60 as shown on that plan.

What time was he shown on the plan? Would you repeat the
time? - A. 14:52 outside the ground, sir, and 14:45 was the
original identification by Mrs. Traynor inside the ground.

So what you are saying is Mrs. Traynor has now reidentified
him but alive at an earlier time than she originally thought?
- A. In fact alive at a later time. So in fact, the point I
am making is on the plan 0RG.9 we should disregard the
location shown for that particular location.

We will deal with this again.

     THE CORONER:   This, Mr. King, is a typical example of
the corrections one would wish to make with regard to the
summaries. I did not know what Inspector Layton has just tolc
me, but it is clear it needs amendment, and obviously we woulc
want to get that right.

       THE WITNESS:   I can tell you the original plan which
was produced at the limited Inquest was given the reference
No. C.140.

  THE CORONER:   Before you put that up can we number that
plan of the ground C.274. The plan of the ground is C.274.
Can you put the next one up:

Inspector Layton, which one is this? - A. If we go
chronologically as far as the statement is concerned it shoulc
be the other way round. I don*t think it matters as such.

You mean the deceased first? - A. I am sorry, is this the
first one, sir? This is the deceased alive.

I think we will have the people alive first. - A. This plan
is DRG.9.

That is C.275.  These are the people last seen alive as far a:
you can establish based upon the evidence which you gave at
the interim Inquests? - A. That is correct, sir, and it is
this plan which bears the identification which I have just
referred to in respect of Christopher Traynor.

I— don't suppose you know where he is? - A, It is to the top.
just near to the top.   (Indicated on plan)

Can we get Miss Goodhall to delete it? - A. We can do, sir.
                                           M. LAYTON



And we will then reproduce it as an amended version,  it givei
you a visual impression of where the people were when last
seen alive on the visual evidence. Put the other one up now
please. - A. This plan is DRG.10.

That will be C.276.

     THE CORONER;   Members of the Jury, the purpose of this
is just to give you an impression where the people were to
save you looking at 9S individual plans:

That is right, is not it? - A. That is right.

It does not have 95 spots on it because we did not find
everybody on the visual evidence? - A. That is right, sir.
Finally, as I have already stated, the events outlined in thi:
statement are not actually in chronological order, and to
assist with this particular aspect a schedule has been
prepared which has been referenced SB.l, which seeks to place
some of the events into chronological order. I produce that
schedule.

Have we got that on an overhead as well, perchance? - A . I
understand the quality is not....

It is too difficult to read.     C.277.

     MR. KING:      Would it be possible to have photocopies of


     THE CORONER:      We will do that.   Tomorrow morning you
will have them.

     THE WITNESS;      Sir, that completes my evidence.

     THE CORONER;    What we are trying to.do with that
schedule is to pick out some of the aajor events. You have
given us an awful lot of detail which is useful, but that
picks out' some of the major events in chronological order as
to the outside of the ground and to the inside? - A. That is
right, sir, and where there is an "E", that is estimated tiae
sir.

     THE CORONER:   It is supposed to be an aide memoire so i
somebody says, "What time did that gate open?” , we can tell.
It is difficult to follow because there are so many numbers,
but basically he was telling us events which he and his team
found either on photographs or videos, and relating to variou
things. When you see the schedule it will be shorter. We
will have them available tomorrow morning.

     Any questions of Inspector Layton?
                                         M . LAYTON


                 Cross-Examined bv MR. PAYNE:

You referred at a point about quarter-of-the-way through your
evidence, to a photograph taken by a photographer called
Warburton Lee.  I just did not get the reference. — a . The
reference given is DPP.190

What was that of? - a . It is in relation to damage to a
retaining bolt of the second set of perimeter gates as you
look from the ground side towards Leppings Lane.

     THE CORONER:   Can you point? - A. It is the second set
of perimeter gates as you look from the ground side towards
Leppings Lane:

We will put the overhead on. Show us which one it is?
(Indicated) - A. That is right, sir, the second set of
perimeter gates from the ground side towards Leppings Lane.
Exactly where Mr. Brown is pointing.

That is C.254.

                 Cross-Examined bv MR. ISAACS:

Mr. Layton, could you help me with just a number of matters.
How many people in your team? - A. It varied initially from a
its height I think 12 to as a norm an average of 6.

Let us put to one side for a moment the accumulation of the
evidence.  I am only concerned with the looking at the
evidence, particularly of the video evidence, and you have
told us something of your observations, and when 1 say "you"
mean you and your team, of, for example, outside and then
inside the ground of certain parts of different videos. Coulc
you help me with this against that background. Taking, for
example, what was seen on the videos inside the ground. l o r
example, the BBC film that was being taken, in order to
produce the observations which you have produced how long
approximately would the film have been looked at for? I d o n ’
want it 5 minutes, 10 ninutes. How many hours? - A.
Countless. The process was never ending.   I think it would b
fair to say every time you view a video you see something
else, because there are so many images on the screen that it
is not possible to take them all in at one viewing.   It was a
continual process right up to the time of the limited
Inquests.  Indeed. I have no doubt since then it has continue
as well, albeit on a more limited scale.

So could you help us, have you done any of the watching
yourself? - A. I have done some of it. ’yes.

But are we talking about a video, for example, inside the
ground where you tell us that certain things were taking
place, being watched over 20 hours or 40 hours or 100 hours o
more than that? — A. It would be impossible to put a figure o
it. As I said at the beginning, the initial process after
retrieving the original video tapes, was to copy them.
                                                       M. LAYTON


         KS^ t iiey wffe c°Pied the copies were viewed and a
                     wJ}ich is a precis of events shown on the film
                           From that schedule really the continual

       oart o f t h ! ? either outside or inside the ground, and as
       part of that process we were continually viewing.

      the           7 A' P r i m a r i l y our brief Mas. having scheduled
      the tapes, to locate the deceased for the Inquests. There
      were other specific areas which were dealt with as the inquir
      progressed, but because of our brief to locate deceased it wa
      a continuing process.

 G. But as you were saying, as well as doing that you would see -
    when I say "you" - you and your team would see different
    incidents taking place on virtually each and every occasion

Q. As opposed to, for example, someone who was looking at that
                 and £arcel of the events of the day which would
   be quite different? - A. I am not sure I follow you.

°‘           ^ - cate fxactJy Mhat 1 ®ean. We have on the one hand
      Police Officers for the purposes of Lord Justice Taylor’s
      Inquiry and for the purposes of this Inquest looking over and

                      g dlfferent P ^ t o P s or something else in

   videos to either obtain evidence or to schedule them so as to
   become a sequence of events as to what to what took place,
   there is a difference between that and purely viewing it
   perhaps on a monitor.

      And it required from your point of view repeated lookings at,
      if I can use an inelegant phrase, in order to get a complete
               ~<A *          on Mhat we were seeking to establish.

Q. Arising out of that last question, if ©ne is looking for
   precise details, a particular individual, you need to look at
   a^video over and over again? - A. Exactly, yes, sir.

Q. If you are looking for a general impression, a build up of
   fans, emptiness of a pen, the fullness of a pen the first
   time is sufficient for that, is not it? - A. Yes. sir

       *             Cross-Examined bv MRS.   M c B R I E N" :

Q.    I would like to go back to the point where the fans entei^A
      the ground at 2:48 p.m.  Could you read that part out, plgD&e
        A. Yes, if you can just bear with me a second, please. QtA
      you want the whole section again?

Q. The wording you used? - A. Page 10, I think, sir.      On a v^dgo
   tape reference RJH.2 at an estimated time of 1 4 :4 8 :0 4 , Ga|~eC
   was opened to eject a supporter.  Is that the bit?

Q.    Yes. - A. Do you want me to go further?

Q.    Yes, just a little. - A. At this stage a large number of
      supporters rushed through the gate into the concourse area

Q. Yes, thank you.  It is the part that they rushed in, and ik,
   was established at the preliminary Inquest that the fans W e r e
   actually allowed in at that time, as Police Officers there,
   mistakenly thought that Gate C had been opened in response.^®
   Superintendent Marshall’s request.

           THE CORONER:   Mrs. McBrien,   I will phrase your quest
      for you:                                               .

Q. Mrs. McBrien is asking you whether this was the incident c ^
   the timing as far as you can establish from the video
   evidence, where the gate was opened as a result  of an o rd e r
   opposed to not? - A. No, that is not that particular openif\q
   of the gate, not the one you refer to.               '     ‘ >1

Q.        MRS. McBRIEN:      The transcript of Superintendent
     Marsha l l ’s evidence at the Taylor Inquiry....

           THE CORONER:   Mrs. McBrien,   I am sorry:

Q.   Inspector Layton, read the whole section through again, or ^
     you like specify the openings, because it may assist you.

           THE CORONER:   I think you may have your timings wron^

          MRS. M c B R I E N : We brought this point out at the
     Preliminary Inquest, and it was altered in the Preliminary
     Inquest.  it was altered to ’’allowed” , ’’they were allowed"
     "They were allowed in” .

          THE WITNESS:   The timing you are referring to is the
     occasion on which a person was ejected from the concourse
     area via Gate C and out.   Certainly it ‘is apparent when yo\3i
     view the video, and that; is why I have differentiated with q &
     it were, the official opening when people walked through,
     is certainly apparent on the video for this earlier openinq
     they did not go in in the same fashion.

          ^HE CORONER:   This was at 15:52, was not it?          So 14
     was one opening? - A. That is right, sir.
                                                M. LAYTON



Q. What time was it closed then? - A. At 14:48:31.
      /



Q. How long was it open? It was only open for 27 seconds'? - a
   That is right, sir, yes.

Q. And then it was reopened at 14:52.        Is that right? - a   That
   is right, sir.

O. And then it stayed open for how long? - A. At 14:57:40 the
   gate is shown closed.

Q. That is about 5 minutes? - a . Yes.      We are talking about two
   distinct openings there.

Q.         MRS. McBRIEN:  I was firmly under the impression that
     fans were encouraged through that gate at that particular
     time.

           THE CORONER:     We will be hearing evidence.     Inspector
     Layton has told you what he has seen on the visual evidence.
     He c a n ’t say any more than that.  It may be - it may be;     I
     say no more - that some of the other witnesses might be able
     to give you some more help on this.     I d o n ’t think Inspector
     Layton can.

          MRS. McBRIEN:     Thank you very much.

          THE CORONER:   When you say, Mrs. McBrien. there was a
     correction made at the interim Inquest, are you talking about
     the interim Inquest relating to your son?

          MRS. MCBRIEN:     Yes.

          THE CORONER:    I will have a look at it.  I will check it
     and see what is actually said, but not now beczvie I have not
     S°t it here.   Any other questions arising out of Inspector
     Layton *s evidence?

          Tomorrow we will give you a copy of the abbreviated
     schedule, and I think everybody will find it is a lot easier
     once we have that to look at:

O. Inspector Layton, as always I am exceedingly grateful to you.
   Thank you for your help.   The only thing I would ask you is ij
   you could arrange to have that plan redrawn with the
   amendments, and also let me have a short statement regarding
   this matter, and we will either deal with it by way of
   documentary evidence or I will have to bring you back,
   depending on what I think.   It is a poimt that has got to be
   corrected. - a .. I think P.C. Brown should be able to assist,
   sir.

          THE CORONER:      Ladies and gentlemen, we are aiming
     timewise to start at 10, rise about quarter-to-1, 1 o ’clock.
     Obviously we c a n ’t be absolutely sure.  We know that from

                (In the absence of the jury)

     THE CORONER:   Yes, Mr. Isaacs?

     MR. ISAACS:   Sir, before my learned friend Mr. King
makes such submissions he wishes to make in relation to the
submission that I made this morning, may I just take this
opportunity to draw to your attention the city late edition
of The Star.   If I hand my copy in - you, sir, have not had
the benefit of going out to the local news vendors.   If I
could be handed another copy.

     First of all I would ask you to read it. First of all
against the background of the submission that I made this
morning my argument is this that nothing could be more
designed to add fuel to the submission I made than what,
sir, you will now read.

     THE CORONER:    Well, Mr. Isaacs, I have to agree with
you that it was an unwise - if the quotation is correct and,
of course, I can't say whether it is or whether it isn't, I
think it was an unwise comment, bearing in mind that we are
sub judice here and it is a matter for this court, or my
jury, if you like, to take decisions on what will happen.

     MR. ISAACS:   Sir, that is another aspect of the matter
which perhaps I can refer to in a moment and which I know
others will refer to and that is.the question a3 to whether
The Star, rightly or wrongly, have been party to an attempt
to influence the jury to bring in a certain verdict.   That
is certainly one aspect of the matter.

     The aspect I would seek to address you upon in relation
to the contents of this article is this, that clearly,
however you see these inquests, and, of course, you are in
control, those who represent.••   I put it another way. The
families quite clearly see these inquests as an evidence
gathering exercise in order to produce fresh evidence which
will, they hope, enable them to persuade or enable the
Director to take the view that criminal charges should be
preferred.

     In my submission, so far as Chief Superintendent
Duckenfield is concerned he should not be put in a position
- should not even be put into the witness box where he could
be put in a position where, by asking him questions which
would then be disallowed, then be disallowed, then be
disallowed in the manner that I referred to this morning, so
as to increase the possibility, probability, what you will,
of the jury returning a verdict of unlawful killing.

     Discipline Regulations 1985, that constitute those
     disciplinary proceedings.   Perhaps I could invite you
     briefly to consider the nature of the complaints that have
     been made against Superintendent Greenwood because in my
     submission they show that the wider the scope of the offence
     the more difficult it is to conceive questions the answers
     to which will not tend to incriminate Superintendent
     Greenwood or anyone else in a similar position.

          The allegations of complaint come from two
     complainants, both of whom I note from the contents of
     letters and other documents put before you this morning, are
     represented by my learned friend Mr. King.   Mr. Jones -
     Leslie Jones - the father of Richard Jones, makes four
     allegations which constitute his complaint against
     Superintendent Greenwood and I say at the outset these are
     allegations which are, and will be, refuted by
     Superintendent Greenwood:

j;       "A. You failed to carry out your assigned duty by ‘
          placing yourself in a position by the players tunnel.
1        Using your radio and your eyes you should have been
          aware of the dangerous situation and controlled your
          officers accordingly.

 1       B. You failed to give instructions   to your officers to '
\        monitor the pens for over-crowding   in relation to the
,!      crowd safety at your briefings*

]       C. You were totally ineffective in mounting a rescue*
         That is, you made no attempt to organise the police
Si      officers in a way which would have helped to bring
•       about a successful rescue operation*

 I       D* You failed to send officers to the rear of pens 3
I        and 4 to relieve pressure when you were in control of
          the area*   This was when you knew that gate C was
          being opened to allow supporters in*"

         Sir, Mr* Trevor Hicks, who also instructs my learned
    friend Mr* King, is the other complainant*   He makes three,
    perhaps broader, allegations in his complaint:

         "1* You failed to prevent a dangerous build-up of
    |   supporters outside the gates*

    I   2* You failed to control the movement of supporters
         subsequent to the opening of gate C*.

         3* You failed to respond to the developing tragedy and *
    -   were slow to effect a rescue operation."

         I say again the totality of each of those allegations
    is refuted, but they do serve to show the wide nature of the
position of Superintendent Greenwood and the way in which
his position will have to be protected should he give
evidence.   I just invite you to consider the prejudicial
effect that the constant challenging of questions asked and
the jury being told that the officer need not answer them,
if matters are dealt with on a question at a time basis.

     Alternatively, if there is dispute about whether the
answer to a particular question might tend to incriminate
Superintendent Greenwood when such argument, if there is to
be such argument, takes place in the absence of the jury,
the effect and the impression that that will have upon the
members of the jury.

     In those circumstances I invite you to adopt the course
that has been suggested by Mr. Isaacs, that these officers,
certainly Superintendent Greenwood, should not be asked to
give evidence at all because of the prejudicial effect of
having to deal with each question on its merits and in
       j f^ces where it is difficult to conceive any question
which will not produce that response.




                  MR. KING:    Sir, the families...
                                                         87




   <THE CORONER:   Yes, Mr. King.

   MR. KING:   The families would have liked each of the
senior Officers to have come to give evidence here
voluntarily. That is what they would have liked. They would
have wished that the truth of the events which led to these
deaths could have come from their lips voluntarily so that
the Jury could hear it. The families are mindful of the law
as much as anybody else and I have advised them what the law
is. They know and appreciate that it is within the right of
any of those senior Officers that if any question is asked
tending to incriminate that he can refuse to give it. To
this extent they are in a dilemma because what they want and
have always wanted, is for this Jury to hear the whole of the
facts. It would be a very unreal world which this Jury would
be living in if they did not hear in some way from the
principal players in these events, by which I mean the senior


    One could make trite examples. The one going through mv
mind was hearing Julius Caesar but we did not hear from
Brutus and the whole of the Senate. That is not meant to be
trivial because these are vital witnesses.

    £ *ew weeks a9°# sir, I submitted to you matters relating
to the Taylor Inquiry Report and the transcripts. You know
if agreement were possible the families would wish that the
whole of the Taylor Report and the_ whole of the transcripts
should be before the Jury. Indeed, they would wish they
would go there without agreement but again they' accept
advice, as they must, that that is not possible without
agreement. If my learned friend on behalf of Mr. Duckenfield
is saying to this Inquiry he will agree and consent to the -«'f
whole of the transcript of Mr. Duckenfield*s evidence being ~
read out aloud to the Jury so that they can hear it and
assess it then that in fact from the families* point of view,
much as they would like Hr. Duckenfield in the witness box to
be cross-examined, will be far better in the effort they
generally have, not in making noises to the outside world, in
bringing the facts to the attention of this Jury.

    Sir, if that is the position, then much as they would
like M r . Duckenfield here, and much as I would say to you
that he ought to come into the witness box and be heard to
say, "I will not answer", if there is that alternative
genuinely being put forward, then I would say on behalf of
the families I represent that that is a course which is, in
fact, preferable as the lesser of two evi’ls from their point
of view. I say that not in any way reflecting on the right
of Mr. Duckenfield to take the stance he has but from the
point of view to prejudice of all the matters being before
the Jury.
                                                                 88

4-*,,?R:KISAAfS:  IJ,wish to ,Bake one thing very clear, sir. so
that there is no misunderstanding. The offer that I make is
iS              transcript of Mr. Duckenfielj** evidence both
           i    were and in cross-examination before Lord
              *,Can be read to this Jury as being a report of
     evidence he gave on that occasion. So far as my learned
          concerned he understood me correctly and I just
well    ensure, sir, that you understood me correctly as


   TOE CORONER:   What you are trying to say is that you are
not putting it forward as evidence of the truth of it but
purely of what was said?

     NR. ISAACS:^ That is what was said because that is
exactly the point you were making this mornina. as it w@r»
witn** CrimiSaL JUSJiSe Act state®ent when, of course, the'
m i*              asked, "Is that the statement you have

                               \o
   MR. KING:   I understand the point my learned friend is
saying on behalf of Mr. Ouckenfield as to the quality of that
evidence but it is certainly evidence which can go before a
Jury otherwise we would have no function, sir. I am not sure
now if I understand the distinction being made.

   THE CORONER:   This is the problem.   Mr. Payne.

   MR. PAYNE:   Sir, I was rising to make the point which was
mentioned by Mr. Isaacs simply as a matter of clarification.
If this Inquest is to proceed, as has been suggested, then it
should be on the basis that the evidence, and we are only
speaking for the moment about Mr. Duckenfield, that he should
not in fact give evidence but there should be read out at the
Inquest what he said at the Taylor Inquiry, not as his
evidence before you but as a report of what in fact he said
on that previous occasion. That is what Mr. Isaacs said to
you just now and I was rising to ensure that that was what
was being agreed.

   THE CORONER:   I have not agreed to anything yet, Mr.


   MR. KING:   So far so good. The next question was the ••
purpose for which the Jury could use that evidence and
certainly, sir, as I understand it, it should be capable of
being used as evidence of that which is stated in it, in
other words not as evidence to'you, sir, but as evidence of
what was said on previous occasions. Otherwise it would have
no value. I am not sure if my learned friend is trying to
say, "It can go before the Jury but the Jury must be told
that they cannot put any truth on that which is being
asserted".

   HR. PAYNE:   I think Mr. King can be helped by the fact
that the ordinary rules of evidence as we tend to know them
do not apply in these proceedings and certainly for our part
we can see no objection to the Jury being informed that what
was read out was a true report of what was said before the
Taylor Inquiry and the Jury could take it into account in
that context.

   THE CORONER:   Can I just put this to you because I think
I can understand the problem but you will appreciate that if
you say to the Jury, "here is a statement which has now been
read. It may or may not be true because we have not asked
Hr. Duckenfield but it is true that he said that because it
is a report of what he said. You, ladies and gentlemen, must
decide whether you believe it or whether you do not". Are
you in effect inviting me to view that statement in that
form? Have I understood you correctly?
                  Yef' 4.1 think -that is right. What is being
 of Shit was said              ?*” 5® r?ad OUt as a true account
    ???!       r    i the Taylor Inquiry and the Jury can take
 it xnto account and make what use of it they wish.

        K ™ ? : _ 0n that basis I am content as long as my
                  realises the import of what is being said, it
 is not simply a record. It is being put to the Jury as
 thev^hink        they cfn assess and «se and, if necessary and
 they think fxt, accept as truth.                          J

    THE CORONER:     I take it what you are saying is that
 because thxs statement is in the public domain, so to speak
               f ?lready been given - whether it has been giv4n
    k j  ° Z no* 5 s “either here nor there - it is there for
 anybody who wishes to get the transcripts out. That is
 really what you are saying, is it not?

 concessior^i^id          ?e5tainly right and in making that
 concession X did it so not because I felt there was anv
 weakness xn the submission I originally made to you but in an
               he;pful to «"»t the demaids of ySuHir, » S

      « clients. If I could put it this way, if the offer
            c k ! i unaccePtable then it can be withdrawn and I
rest on the submission that I have made which is still a
strong one, in my submission, but I hope to try and assist
the Court by saying that here at least ls L, S c “ nt^i ch

       iy advance the matter if a person is in a situation
 where an answer may incriminate him.                      °n

   MR. ISAACS:   That is exactly what I am telling you for
the purposes of this submission.                 9 you £or

   THE CORONER:   The fact that somebody does not aive
evidence is also prejudicial. In a sense the problem has
been made more difficult from the decision plint o f ^ i e ^
because of the exchange that has just taken place as to what
Taylor^s^Report^nd^r^ir^0 **2*,transcripts of Lord Justice
«    .  Report and Mr* King, who has the primary interest of
a good number of the bereaved, feels that thS^Lght bS 1
   ter bet than having somebody say, "I am not answerina
questions   and you obviously feel that as well.        '

     I am a little bit concerned about it, in fact, because
quite a bit of the evidence of Chief Superintendent
? £ k?nfJeJd \ S d We * * * * * him sii^ly because you took
the lead in this matter but it applies to others as well i am
sure, there is quite a lot of his evidence ^ h     is n i t
germane to an Inquest. It will be ever so interesting but it
is not germane to an Inquest. I could allow it if you as
    Jepre*entative, say, "I do not mind, let us read it all
thaTaIpectnofWihe matter! *“ * U t U e b U concerned about
   MR. ISAACS:    There are two ways of looking at it, with
respect. First of all, it can be edited by agreement and
indeed on your direction because you will have read his
evidence that he gave some time ago now to Lord Justice
Taylor's Inquiry. Alternatively it can go before the Jury
and you can give directions as to those parts which are
germane to the Jury’s task in this particular Inquiry. I
should point out, sir, that the offer I made was made on the
basis that he was not called. I think my learned friend
understood that and it was not in the way of holding a gun to
your head at all.   It was a view to being helpful.

   THE CORONER:   Mr. Isaacs, may I ask you this because it
seems to me that it might be possible to achieve the best of
all worlds in this situation bearing in mind the point which
you have made and the acceptance of the issue? It is my
reluctance in a sense to make a ruling that we were not
calling him because I am a little bit reluctant, despite the
very persuasiveness of a lot of what, you said to me, but it
seems to me that your client would not be in any particular
danger of prejudice if the solicitors, Mr. King in
particular, were to agree that if we were to put Mr.
Duckenfield in the witness box having either read his
transcript either i a toto or edited by agreement, that he
would agree not to pursue questions which clearly were
incriminatory because that would then give the advantage of
having Mr. Duckenfield here and yet without having the thing
which I perceive to be your main fear is that he will have to
answer hundreds of questions all of which he will answer by
saying, "I am not answering that question because it is
prejudicial**. What do you feel about that?

   MR. ISAACS:   What will happen is this, let us say it is
my learned friend and he will ask a question which he
believes does not have the tendency to incriminate. Either
yourself or Mr. Duckenfield or myself will say, "We take the
view that it is". The Jury will go out. There will be some
legal argument. There will be some reference perhaps to some
parts of the evidence he. has given. That matter having been
resolved the Jury will come back in. The next question will
be asked and exactly the same thing will happen. I can
foresee unfortunately that one will have a morning, a day,
two days or three days and after every question that is asked
the Jury will go out, there will be legal argument and so it
will go on.




                      /With respect, sir
With respect, sir, that cannot be right, and however much
you, sir, would like to see him here, unfortunately the
very nature of tho difficulty that he is in, and I stress
against tne inck^round that he does not accept that he has
committed any wrong-doing, but that others may take a
different view, that in those circumstances, and I say
this advisedly, the compromise that seems to have been
accepted is one which should commend itself to you, and
overcorae what I appreciate to be your natural reluctance
not to call, even to say, "What is your name?", a chief
player. Sir, that is th-a only way that I can put it, but
I do hope tnat perhaps Soth myself and Mr. King can manage
in the event to persuade you to take the course which is
now being put forward, ->oth of us no doubt for different
reasons but, having said tnat, reasons that are to each
CKher reasonably cogent.

        TH., CORONER:         Did you want, to say anything more, Mr.
King?

        MR. KING:       No.

     THE COilvMlER:           Did you want to say anythin?, Mrs.
McBrien?

     MllS. tlcBRIEN: I thin!; it would be useful to use the
transcripts from the Taylor Inquiry but we all know that
the Taylor Inquiry was never to blame anybody, it was a
different sort of inquiry to this one, but it would be
better than nothing, I think. Rather thanhave nothing    at
all I would be happy with that*

     THE COKONER:   You are going along with what is being
proposed as the best?

     MRS. McBRIEU:    Yes, but I really would prefer Mr.
Duckenfield to appear    in person so that Icould put
questions to him, not    in an incriminatory   way,just to
speak to him.

      TH.*2 CORONER: I think I ought to say that I know
Lord Justice Taylor said that he was not going to blame
anybody. In fact, it     is only fair to say   thatan inquest
is in exactly .tae same situation. We are not here to
blame people we are hsre to enquire into how a deceased
person died and, in fact, the rules I have already
referred to expressly say that you must -not give averdict
which in any way blames somebody, and I would follow that
ruling exceedingly strictly,, I can assure you of that. I
appreciate that you may want to ask the questions as
gefTCly as possible but that is not, in fact, the issue.
The issue is not wnetner you are asking a question nicely
or nastily, but what is the content of the question, and
does it tend to increase the risk even by a little bit
tnat a person might be prosecuted.    That is the point. It
is - ot now you ask t ;e question, wnich I am sure you ..ill
do in a ladylike manner, but that is not really the issue.

      MRS. McBillEN:    I think that he would be able to give
u.i far more information about that day than anybody elsa
as '.e <as ’..le prime actor.

       Tll.C CO'.’OrtEK:   Yes, but M rs. HcBrien, I thin’< it is
only fair to s a v , as I have already indicated, it is, in
fact, practic'llv impossible to frame a question, to put
•. *e question where a person is in tne position of Chief
Superintendent Duckenfielci, which is not incriminating.
It may i.ot be incrimi.mting but it is almost impossible to
frame it and the point is that ho does not have to answer
that question.         Wnetter it is incriminatory or not, you
c'.nnot dr a- a conclusion from it.         If I ask a driver,
"Were you doing 40 miles an nour in a 30 miles an hour
area?", h: can say, "This is an incriminatory question, I
an .ot ijiswevring it".        You cannot (’raw the conclusion that
h was doing 40 tailed an hour from that.           He might have
been but ne might not.          He might just not want to answer
tna q u e :tion and t tere is no w^y of finding out, not in
this Court, and that is tie difficulty in this situation.
It is a difficulty' wuich is almost insoluble I think.

     riRS. McBKlEN:    If I formed some questions and handed
ta-m t.'> you for you to look at ...?

     V:-E CO.UmER:  You could do it but it won't make any
differenc . *ou would be a ver.’ clever lady if you could
think of a question which actually gave you an answer.

     MRS. McSRJEK:       I would not be recriminatory.

      .HE CORONER*     Th an k you, Mrs. UcBrien.

        You will nave guessed that ray inclination had been to
turn your request d own from what I nave said, but on tae
o:. :2 r hand I h a v e to take into account what Mr. Kin g has
said, and I have heard, of course, what Mrs. Mc3rien has
said and I have to take that into account as well, though
it is clear, I am sure, to you that my experience is
similar ts? yours, tnat it is exceedingly difficult to

     T 1.. CO.iOiJEil: You cs.n be assured of that and, in

*:e have ,>ut it up at the back actually. It is there.
That is where we are going to put the list. We intend to
put tie list up at the back so that it is visible, j

     So tne plan tomorrow is morning, videos, afternoon,
four witnesses whose names I can't quite remember at the
moment.

     MR. KIllG:  The four witnesses at the top of the list
for Wednesday, sir?

     Til : COROiJEH: Yes, I think so. Certainly three of
  em but we may have had to shift the fifth and the fourth
arou d. It is the top end of the Wednesday list.

      I just vant to check one other thing. You remember I
meitionei the transcript*; to you at the business meeting?
We have he~rd from three firms. One said they did not
w n t one, two said thsy did. Is that correct? It is no
use turning up tomorrow morning and saying, "Yes, I did
w.nt a transcript". As I explained to you, it is entirely
up to you. It does not make ;*ny difference to me whether
you have th-2 ::i or not.

     HISS HAMPT:'K:  I thin: we would be a third firm that
would require a transcript.

     TH u COrfONER: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, .-.:,
thank you very much indeed. It has been quite a long day,
as Hr. Isaacs said - interesting, in many respects. We -
will adjourn then. •

    BECK cont:                 gives the Coroner so much discretion to
    define the parameters of the investigation.      The real question
    for the coroners       is why they use their discretion so
    conservatively.    In theory at least, their unique remit would
    seem to allow them to take the investigation where they want.
    So what's holding them back? Dr Stefan Popper was a coroner for
     six years. He retired last year after conducting the country's
     longest inquests into the deaths at Hillsborough. He argues that
     Coroners Courts need to be conservative in their remit, because
     they must avoid influencing what happens in other courts, either
     civil or criminal.      Dr Popper says (inquests are not about
^    apportioning blame or liability.

     POPPER:                       If        purpose of the inquest is to
     establish the four factors, who, when, where and how, then the
     inquest does actually have a part to play and fits in to the
     other jurisdictions. But X think in many cases, what people are
     actually looking for isn't the establishment of those factsT what
     happened; what they are trying to establish is liability or
     blameworthiness, and I don't think that as the law stands, the
      inquest is the right place for that.            The civil court ought to
      be concerned with aspects of negligence and compensation - has
      somebody done something for which a sum of -money ought to be paid
£     to compensate the injured?           And the criminal court is to be
      concerned,    or should be concerned with the question of, has
      somebody done something for which a punishment should be exacted?
      So those are the two venues where the issues of people liability,
      one civil, one criminal, ought to be dealt with, not by some
      circuitous means of dealing with it through the coronal Court.

      BECK:                           And the law makes clear that inquests
      must not stray into the territory of apportioning blame.              It was
       changed in 1977 after an inquest jury named Lord Lucan as the
       killer of his children's nanny.           Today, if an inquest begins to
       point the finger of blame, the Coroner is legally obliged to stop
       it.     But the barrister, Ed Fitzgerald, argues that coroners are
       mistaken in making an assumption that deaths in contentious

BECK cont:               Donna, Paul's sister and his mother
Sandra, heard his name mentioned only once in the entire 80 day
main inquest.

mbs STRINGER:             When * “ ked     clerk' 1 Mas told ****■
the witnesses I had requested to be brought in were after quarter
past three, and I couldn't have them brought in.


BECK:                      Why?

MRS STRINGER:             Because Dr Popper had decided on cutting
the inquest's time for quarter past three, and he told*me the
damage was already done then, that there was no need to bring
witnesses after quarter.past three. I kept asking why Paul was
never taken in an ambulance to a hospital. I'm still waiting for
 that question to be answered.    I still don't know why he was
 left; he was first to be taken from the terraces, at 3.15 - I was
 told that by a West Midlands police officer.

 SISTER:                    Because Paul died together with 94 other
 people, it was just like some sort of conveyor belt.     The times
  from quarter past three to 4.35 we don't know anything about;
  what time he was taken to the temporary mortuary, how long he was
  left there, who he was with, and it's just torment.       All the
  time.    You lie awake thinking who was he with, did anyone help
  him?     It's just torture all the time because you don't stop
  asking the questions.

  BECK:                      There is no doubt that the 3.15 cut off
  point caused more dispute than any other single decision at the
  inquest. Professor Phil Scraton is a lecturer in criminology at
  Edge Hill College.   His department is conducting a long term
  study into the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster and whilst
   he accepts that Dr Popper was completely within his powers to
   implement the cut off point, he thinks it was a wrong decision.
                                  - 14 -


    SCRATON:                  I feel that it was a profound mistake
    that the coroner ruled that there should be a 3.15 cut off. I
    feel that a lot of evidence that came after 3.15 should have been
    heard. I think it is an absolutely crucial issue, because what
    we're dealing with here is not the immediate moment at which
    death is invoked. I understand the logistical problem of calling
    all those people to give evidence, and how much longer the
    procedure would have gone on, but let me just put it         way.
  The reason that most families are upset over the 3.15 cut off is
  because there is crucial evidence that they know exists about
  people trying to revive and resuscitate their loved ones which
^  is never heard before the court. Now they have a right to hear
  that evidence heard, because it could be that in that situation,
  not. enough was done or too much of the wrong thing was given or
  whatever; I'm not in any way trying to assume guilt as to what
  happened after 3.15, but there is a right to investigate it and
  there is a riglit to make an informed judgement on it. That right
    has been completely abolished   in this case.   I just find it one
    of the saddest aspects o f the Hillsborough disaster; it's
    certainly the one that has had the most profound effect on the
    families.


    BECK:                      Dr Popper accepts that the cut off point
p a u s e d distress at the time of the inquest. But he believes that
“   it stemmed mainly from a mismatch between the expectations of the
    families and his remit as Coroner.


     POPPER:                    I know this caused a lot of anxiety to
     families, but I think it is misunderstanding of the duties and
     the powers that the Coroner has got.    Had people felt really
     strongly that I was making a mistake, they were all advised,
     legally advised I mean, there was opportunity for appeal and
     judicial review. X made it quite plain right from the beginning
     what I was intending to do; I gave my reasons for what they were
     worth, and it was open to people to challenge them, and they
     should have challenged them if they really felt strongly then.
     That's    not to   say that ;somebody else may not have   taken a

POPPER cont:              different view; I'm not saying that I'm
infallibly right.What   I am saying is, that was the view I took,
and I did it to the best of my ability at the time.

BECK;:                    Although the Coroner appears to have
great discretion to conduct broad or narrow investigations of
contentious deaths, in practice the pressure is mostly in the
direction of conservatism.    Better to be safe than sorry. But
barrister Tim Owen argues that the system can no longer afford
to rely on its inquisitorial purity. Controversial deaths, by
     Lr very nature, beg to be looked at in a wider context.

OWEN:                    In controversial cases, the idea that
you can avoid, if you like, an adversarial contest or conflict
is absurd. There plainly are frequently different views about
culpability, whether proper care was given, and it's absurd to
think that an inquest process can be shorn of that type of
controversy. And once you accept that the controversy exists,
then    the   current   procedure   is     not   a   satisfactory    one   for
resolving it, because it leaves too much discretion in the hands
of coroners, it keeps too much information back from people who
have a legitimate interest in knowing about it before the
 i*-~uest, and it leaves the jury and the Coroner with too narrow
# function, if you like, in returning the verdict, because the
verdicts,     as they are now returned, are simply too brief and
don't disclose in clear terms the full circumstances in how
somebody died, and what measures sire necessary to prevent death
 in the future.

BECK:                         21 years ago, the Brodrick Report looked
 at all aspects of the Coroners Court and made its recommendations
 - advance disclosure, legal aid and wider rights of appeal
 against verdicts were all put forward as ways of making the
 system more acceptable to both sides. They were largely ignored,
 as were the recommendations of a committee in 1986 which looked
 at the   inquest system and        suggested        a way   of   dealing with
 controversial deaths.      Evan Stone, QC was the chairman of that
SCRATON cont:            much of the work of the coroner cam be
done   efficiently   and   effectively   through   the   present
inquisitorial system.    The investigation work is okay, the
inquest work is okay and the outcome is generally satisfactory.
However, in these high profile cases where clearly liability is
a contradictory construct, then it's important that another tier
exists, and I think what we need is a tier which is openly
adversarial, where cross-examination is as thorough as it needs
to be, where rules that we would accept in other courts, more
normal courtroom rules, apply; where families are actually legal
aided so they have a right of representation, and where the
person who is presiding over it has experience of working in
high-profile adversarial circumstances - in other words, I'm
thinking of a judge.


BECK:                     We have been told that the idea of
inquests becoming more like public inquiries, at least for deaths
in contentious circumstances, is now being seriously discussed
by coroners.   The Coroners Society, however, refuses to comment
on it publicly.   It's perhaps no surprise that those who seem
especially interested in the new system are coroners who've had
to conduct inquests after major disasters.     Dr Stefan Popper's
experience at the Hillsborough inquest has convinced him that it
is now time to grasp the nettle of reform.


POPPER:                   I think that there is a dichotomy in
expectation.   It seems to me that the legislature has tended to
limit the powers of coroners whereas the public, certainly at the
moment, is expanding their expectations.     And I think what is
needed is either the coroners should be more given more teeth, so
that they can actually do and say things which carry true weight.
Or, and this may possibly be a better solution, that coroners
inquests should be turned into fact finding exercises, and the
conclusions and verdicts should be deleted altogether from their
power, so that their power is to establish the facts, and for
others, civil or criminal courts, to draw whatever conclusions
need to be drawn from a particular event.   Somebody, and by that
                             - 18 -


POPPER cont:              I mean Parliament, has got to make up
their mind what they want. Do they want inquests to carry on as
they are, or do they want them restricted, or do they want them
expanded? I don't think that carrying on as we are is the best
way forward.   And as I say, the public expectation seems to me
that they want more from Coroners Court, and they want more power
there.   If that's what the public want, in a democracy, then
there's no reason they shouldn't have it .


BECK:                     Inquests were once regarded as a legal
backwater.   But a series of major public disasters and the
controversy surrounding individual cases has changed all that.
The weaknesses    of the system are being highlighted by
dissatisfied families and lawyers who Recognise that deaths in
controversial circumstances can't be examined in the same way as
others.   But as yet, there are few signs that the legislators
have recognised the problems.    It's significant, for example,
that the Royal Commission, which is examining all aspects of the
legal system, is not investigating inquests.   To barrister Ed
Fitzgerald, what is at stake is the credibility of the inquest
system in the eyes of the public.


FITZGERALD:               If we don't reform the system now, there
will be a great injustice to the families of the deceased. They
will continue to be left with a sense of real grievance, that
they haven't had proper inquests, that they haven't been able to
participate in inquests on a basis of equality with those in
authority who may have been responsible for the deaths of their
relatives.  if we don't reform the system, the worst result of
all will be that families will continue to have to live with a
lifetime of bitterness, that the questions that they really
needed answered were not answered at the inquest.

        Dear Sirs,


        PAUL    CARLILB.       IAN     GLOVER.      RICHARD        JONES.         MT CHART.       TTRT.T.vf

        PETER     TOOLE     and       KEVIN    WILLIAMS

        (APPLICATION        UNDER       SECTION     13    OF      THE      CORONERS          ACT      1988)


        Further to my letter of 21 April 1992, the Law Officers have now
        given very careful consideration to the application made by your
        clients for authority under section 13 of the Coroners Act 1988
        to apply to the High Court for an order directing a fresh inquest
        in relation to the above named persons who died in the Hills­
        borough disaster on the 15 April 1989.     The material submitted
        under cover of your letter of 3 June 1992 has also been taken
        into account together with representations received on behalf of
        some of your clients from Members of Parliament with Merseyside
        constituencies and a letter received direct from Mrs Teresa
        Glover.

        As you will know section 13 of the Act applies when an inquest
        has been held and, "by reason of fraud, rejection of evidence,
        irregularity of proceedings, insufficiency of inquiry, the
        discovery of new facts or otherwise, it is necessary or desirable
        in the interests of justice that another inquest should be held."

        The Law Officers have considered the matter very carefully but
        they have come to the conclusion that there is nothing which
        would justify authorising an application to the High Court for
        a new inquest in any of the above cases.

        They have reached this decision on the grounds that the applica­
        tion would have no reasonable prospect of establishing that it
        is necessary or desirable in the interests of justice for a fresh
        inquest to be held.
The Law Officers recognise the importance to the families of the
deceased of having the fullest possible information about the
precise circumstances of the deaths and have taken that carefully
into account when considering the sufficiency of the inquiry made
by the Coroner and his directions to the jury. All these issues
must, however, be considered in the context of the statutory
framework within which Coroners are required to work and the
questions required to be answered on the inquisition.    It is not
appropriate, therefore, that they authorise an application to the
High Court under section 13 unless it could be said, with
reasonable confidence, that further information would be likely
to be elicited which would have a bearing on the issues to be
considered at any such further inquest.
The Law Officers recognise that this decision will be deeply
disappointing to your clients. They are aware of the strength of
the continuing feeling on the part of those whose friends and
relatives died or were -^injured , in the.^tragic eventsLrat
Hillsborough but their task has been to evaluate the application
objectively against the statutory criteria. Their decision does
not indicate any lack of fedl£ng for the families of those who
died at Hillsborough for whan they have the deepest sympathy.,

Yours faithfully,

  t          <5-t-udied the papers that you have submitted to me regarding the
  Jraalc d e a t h f of thlfl young people.      They include the post mortem
  reports on Paul Carlisle, Gary Church, Ian Glover, Richard Jones, Michael
  navid Kellv Peter Tootle, Kevin Daniel Williams and Philip Hammond.
      ,e a l s o studied the relevant extract from the inquest -the overview
f    eDared by Professor Usher, the report prepared by Dr. Burns and the
    ground's on which applications are to be made to set aside the o n g
  inquest.
   T have experience  of a substantial number of deaths from traumatic
                       victims o f the Clapham R a i l distaster and explosion
   a s p h w ia H n o lu d in g
   at the Grand Hotel, Brighton.
   It is clear from post mortem appearances that we are dealing with two
   ^?ff0ron+- natterns of injury, namely a number of victims who showed the
   c l a s s i c  appearances of traumatic asphyxia and other where the classic
   signs of traumatic asphyxia were absent or slight.           The differen     •
   t ^ t h in k      relevant in respect of the precise mechanism by which each
    i n d ^ i d u a l died   It may well be that some confusion has developed over
   the use of the term traumatic asphyxia.
    in the classic sense traumatic asphyxia is taken to imply injuries caused
    by the application of mechanical pressure to the chest and         in some
    i stances, the abdomen, so that death results from asphyxiation.        The
•   mechanism of asphyxiation in the classic case is thought to be twofold.
    First there is a mechanical impedence of the movement of the chest w a n
    a ^ diaphragm, thereby severely restricting inspiratory ^ resP“ a*°2_
    movements.   The second mechanism and one which accounts for t
    striking findings found in cases of traumatic asphyxiqa is compression
    of the chest and abdomen resulting in direct compression over the
    superior vena cava, thereby causing a sudden and dramatic rise in th
    Pressure within the superior vena cava resulting in engorgement of the
    b 1ood vesseisin the head and neck.     It is this displacement of blood
    into the superior vena cava and the failure to drain blood |romthe
    superior vena cava which accounts for the swelling of the f* ^ a l features
    and the gross petechial haemorrhages so regularly seen in the face, neck
    and chest above the level of constriction.
    Where no obstruction to the venous circulation occurs then the usual
    sians of asphyxia are present but not those of the classic traumatic
    asphyxia 1 death. The face may be suffused and cyanosed and there may be
    fine petechial haemorrhages, in some instances scanty or even absent. The
    facial features do not appear strikingly swollen and the coarse petechial
    haemorrhages are not apparent.

 Unfortunately it has become a habit for pathologists to call all such
 deaths traumatic asphyxia and it may well be correct m one sense inas
 much as trauma to the chest has resulted in the mechanical obstruction
 of respiration. In pathological terms there is probably little relevance
 in distinguishing between the two mechanisms as the term merely implies
 that death has resulted from a mechanical obstruction to respiration
 resulting from pressure being applied to the torso.
  I^_;linical terms however there does seem to be a difference in the two
  different types of traumatic asphyxia with a much graver prognosis being
  present in those where there has been evidence of a sudden and acute
  severe rise in the venous pressure in the upper part of the body. In fact
  most of the individuals who suffer from this classic form of traumatic
  asphyxia do not survive if they are severely affected and not rescued
  rapidly.
  Where the individual suffers primarily an obstruction to his movements
  of respiration death will occur as the result of hypoxic damage to the
  brain. This may take a much longer time than in individuals who have
  been crushed so impedence of the venous return to the heart occurred.
  Indeed   some  individuals   will   survive  but   remain  permanently
  neurologically damaged as a result of suffering severe anoxic cerebral
  injury.
   It is probable that a period of at least some 10 minutes or so would be
   necessary before one would be able to state categorically that absent
   ^   >iratory movement would lead to death. Consciousness may be lost quite
   rapidly but where the obstruction has not been complete consciousness may
   take a considerable time to be lost. I have experience of cases where
   individuals have died through anaesthetic accidents whereby no oxygen was
   being supplied to the lungs whilst they were paralysed during surgery.
   In two of the cases in excess of 10 minutes elapsed before the surgeon
   noticed that the heart action was in the terminal stages of failure.

   It is also known that individuals who have suffered severe hypoxic damage
   may not die immediately.     They may be recovered unconscious with an
   active circulation but the circulation rapidly fails despite all attempts
   at resuscitation. This may well represent concomitant damage to the heart
   muscle leading to what is in effect a heart attack (anoxic myocardial
   infarction).    Severe hypoxia of several minutes duration would be
   necessary for this to occur. It is therefore possible that a young man
   who had been asphyxiated by being crushed, would be capable, after being
   removed from danger, of some conscious activity but could still die as
   a result of hypoxia in the ensuing minutes.

 Anoxic brain damage could also be aggravated by the failure to maintain
 a patent airway in individuals who were unconscious but still, capable of
 respiration when retrieved from the crowd.     The failure to place the
 individual in the recovery position, for instance, could lead to
 subsequent respiratory obstruction.
 Experience from a number of instances where individuals have died from
 t^unatic asphyxia has also demonstrated that not all individuals appear
 IPaave been effected at the same time. Some could have been effected by
 movement of the crowd in the minutes after the disaster occurred. Others
 could have had only partial or incomplete respiratory obstruction
 initially and then either suffered complete mechanical obstruction of
 respiration or died as the result of prolonged incomplete respiratory
 obstruction. This could take many minutes to cause death and it is
 entirely possible that death would occur more than 15 minutes after the
 incident began.
  I have not seen the post mortem photographs and therefore am having to
  rely solely on the description provided in the post mortem reports. I
  will deal with each case individually.
  1.      Paul Carlisle - He was examined by Professor Usher who describes
           suffusion of the upper body and petechial haemorrhages on the
           forehead, eyelids and within the conjunctivae.     These would be
           consistent with the classic traumatic asphyxia whereby there has
           been a mechanical obstruction and mechanical interference with the
  £       circulation.
  2.      Richard Jones - He was examined by Professor Usher who again found
           signs which would be consistent with the classic features of
           traumatic asphyxia. The petechial haemorrhages noted in his loins
           are probably the result of pressure causing local obstruction to the
           circulation in that area.
  3.      Ian Glover -    Again examined by Professor Usher. The examination
           revealed changes of asphyxia, ie the cyanosis and visceral
           haemorrhages.   The signs of venous obstruction were relatively
           slight and in the form of small petechial haemorrhages in the upper
           eyelids and conjunctiva of the left eye.        There were scanty
           petechiae also found in the larynx.     In my opinion he has died
           primarily as the result of impedence of respiration and any
           interference with his venous circulation was minimal.

   4.     Peter Tootle   - Was examined by Dr. Slater. Dr. Slater described
           changes in Mr. Tootle which are consistent with a degree of classic
           traumatic asphyxia but I suspect that the main reason for death has
           been compression of the chest resulting in impedence of respiratory

          movement. Without the post mortem photographs I am not clear as to
          why Dr. Slater feels that there has been intensive blunt compression
          of tlie right side of his face.
  5.      Kevin Williams   -   Was examined by Dr. Slater who describes the
  .[s-    external features of classic traumatic asphyxia with cyanosis of the
  A       face extending onto the chest with numerous petechial arid larger
           haemorrhages on the face and neck. He found bilateral'fractures of
           the hyoid bone and of the superior horns of the thyroid cartilage
           on both sides of the larynx^ These appear related to a number of
           linear abrasions over the front of his neck and on the undersurface
           of the chin. There appears to have been local pressure to his neck.
           It was possible that when he was crushed in the crowd, the front of
           his neck was pushed against some rigid 'structure.      It is also
           possible that, for instance, he could have been trodden on during
           the panic subsequent to the incident occurring.
           I do not believe it is possible to say how long consciousness would
           have been retained but he certainly would not have become
           unconscious between 3 and 5 seconds of being crushed. Again I would
           not agree with Dr. Slater in estimating how long the deceased would
           have survived. Although he has suffered injuries to the neck these
           are by no means invariably fatal and can be seen in those surviving,
           strangulation and quite striking signs of classic traumatic asphyxia
           can be seen in individuals who survive crush incidents because they
  0.       are removed from danger in time to prevent death. As I have already
           indicated he could well have survived for a considerable period,
           well beyond 3.15 pm.
            He suffered convulsions as the result of anoxic brain damage.
            Whether Mr. Brooder saw convulsions or twitching is irrelevant.
            A dead body neither convulses or twitches. Dr. Gompert's point that
            bodies may twitch after brain stem death: has taken place is, of
            course, correct and to some degree reflects the dilemma over
            precisely defining death.     One sees it in individuals who are
            maintained on a respirator but whose heart is still functioning.
            One also may see it during the process of dying as the heart is
            stopping and for a very short period after the heart stops. This
            phenomenon only occurs for a very short period after death unless
            muscles are electrically stimulated. Twitching movements, however,
            suggest that one is much more likely to be dealing with a live body
            than with a dead one.
            The evidence of Special Constable Martin is difficult to refute in
            some respects. Whilst it is possible for an individual examining a
            dead body to mistakenly feel an apparent pulse it is uisually
            difficult to be mistaken over whether somebody is making breathing

          movements or not. I am, of course, making the assumption here that
          when the term breathing is used, that we are referring to movements
          of respiration and. not merely sounds.    Sounds frequently emanate
          from the air passages of a recently dead body when it is being
          moved.

 6.     Gary Church - He was examined by Dr. Slater who found changes
 ^       which would be consistent with classic traumatic asphyxia. He had
         a dislocated right sternoclavicular joint. This type of injury is
         most likely to occur as the result of falling. It would require
         very severe crush injuries to dislocate the sternoclavicular joint
         and the post mortem findings do not appear to reflect severe local
         pressure on the chest or shoulder area.     It is possible that he
         received this injury as the result of falling over in an attempt to
         escape and has suffered pain and discomfort consequent upon this
         injury.

 7.      Michael David Kelly - He was examined by Dr. John Clark who found
         non specific signs of asphyxia; the external appearances do not show
         evidence of classic traumatic asphyxia. The petechial haemorrhages
         on his right arm I am sure reflect a obstruction to the circulation
         in the arm caused by local pressure.      The internal examination
         revealed no other explanation for death other than it having
         resulted from anoxia and it is probable here that we are dealing
         with a case where there is no evidence whatsoever of obstruction to
         the large veins in the body but where death has occurred as the
         result of progressive cerebral anoxia resulting from prolonged and
         severe compression of the chest.

            ^ Kelly was treated as described by PC Maughan and apparently
         successfully resuscitated then it is possible that he has died as
         the result of hypoxic damage affecting his heart or as the result
         of some other form of respiratory obstruction. He appears not to
         have been placed in the recovery position and this may well be
         material. There is nothing to indicate that this man was definitely
         dead by 3.15pm;    indeed the evidence available to me suggests
         otherwise.

8.       Philip Hammond - this young boy does not bear the classic signs
         of traumatic asphyxia although there are generalised asphyxial signs
         and evidence of anoxic damage to the brain.         Dr. Slater who
         performed the post mortem found extensive haemorrhage in both lungs
         and a laceration of the right lung associated with a fracture of the
         right ^2nd rib. I think the death of this young man is rather more
         complicated than some of the other cases. There is certainly
         evidence that he has suffered from asphyxia and there is evidence
         in his brain of anoxic damage.      However, the primary pathology

         appears to be in his lungs which were bruised with a laceration of
         the right lung associated with a rib injury. The rib injury and
         bruising of the adjacent intercostal spaces suggests a localised
         pressure or impact in that region of the right chest. It is likely
         to have been due to localised pressure, probably on the young man's
         back, forcing the right side of his chest against an object causing
         the right sided ribs to be forced inwards towards the spine. If
 •       this pressure were maintained then death would undoubtedly occur
         very rapidly but I would have expected to have found some.evidence
         of the more classic changes associated with traumatic asphyxia. If,
         however, the pressure is relieved then death from injuries of this
         type may take considerable time to supervene. Unconsciousness is
         likely to be fairly rapid but death could have taken a substantial
         number of minutes and it would be impossible, from a medical point
         of view, to state that this boy was dead at 3.15 pm.
In conclusion there is clear evidence that some of the victims have
suffered severe traumatic asphyxia in the classic sense in which the term
is employed. Unconsciousness is likely to have occurred quite rapidly,
in probably somewhere between 15 and 45 seconds but death would have been
delayed for a number of minutes. In those who where severely crushed so
the venous drainage from the head was impeded then it is probable that
death would have occurred within 10 minutes of sustained pressure
commencing.    If the pressure was not continuous survival could be for
a longer period.
 M
    the individuals who have scanty signs or no signs of traumatic
asphyxia it is much more difficult to predict the survival time.       To
reduce the survival time to a very short number of minutes would require
continuous sustained severe compression of the chest. Because of the
nature of the incident it is impossible in many instance to know when
mechanical compression of the chest would have commenced. I feel it is
impossible to state purely from the medical point of view that a number
of the young men that I have indicated above could not been alive at 3.15
pm. Those dying as the result of anoxic damage consequent to their chests
being crushed could well have survived for a much longer period only to
die subsequently from the effects of irreversible anoxia.

      evidence of identification was taken.    The autopsy was
      carried out by Dr. Clark.


(2)   On 1st May 1990 the Inquest concerning Michael Kelly was
      reconvened.   Mr. Fraser appeared for the deceased's family.
      I explained the procedure that I was proposing to adopt.     No

      objection was made by Mr. Fraser.


(3)   Dr. John Clark cave evidence and in answer to me stated:-


      "Cause cf death was crush asphyxia. This was based on
      findings of signs of asphyxia in his lace. Eis face was
      rather congested and had a bluish discoloration. These
      changes, I have to say, were fairly mild in comparison to a
      lot of the other people and one of the other features of
      asphyxia is to find little haemorrhages on the skin. These
      were not in fact present".
      " ... In any event there was nothing to indicate he suffered
      for any great length of time. He probably lost
      consciousness within a short period of time, 10 or 15
      seconds or so, and then knew nothing about it after that.
      As I said, there were not any major injuries internally".
      Mr. Fraser had no questions for Dr. Clark.

      Glasgow who had been in Sheffield on the weekend of the
      tragedy.   Towards the end of my questioning he said in an

                personal injury'litigation as well as Inquest
                procedure.

June 1991       Applicant John Glover instructs Solicitor to
                pursue Application for Judicial Review and to
                apply for Legal Aid.     His Solicitor agrees
                and confirms Application for Legal Aid has
                been submitted.     Applicants Sandra Stringer
                and Joan Tootle give similar instructions to
                the same Solicitor.
June 1991       Advice sought from "Inquest" Organisation.

11.7.91         Police Complaints Authority directs that
                Police Disciplinary charges be pursued against
                two Officers.
7.10.91         House of Lords hears appeal on the issue of
                "remoteness" (Alcock and others).
5.11.91         Applicants visit Edward Fitzgerald of Counsel
                for a preliminary assessment.     It is still
                believed that John Glover, Sandra Stringer
                and Joan Tootle are awaiting a decision on
                their Application for Legal Aid.
November 1991   John Glover discovers that an Application
                for Legal Aid was never submitted.
November 1991   My firm agrees to act.
29.11.91        Edward Fitzgerald visits Liverpool and meets
                with the Applicants.     Options discussed and
                it is recognised that the most appropriate
                approach is to submit a Memorial to the
                Attorney General.     Applicants agree to supply
                material regarding each'of the deceased.
December 1991   Applicant Joan Sinclair is delayed in compiling
                her material by the terminal illness of her
                mother.
15.12.91        Applicant Anne Williams meets with PC Bruder
                and informs me of that conversation.     I
               endeavour to contact that officer at his
               place of work.     His shift arrangements make
               a meeting difficult to arrange.
10.1.92        I meet with PC Bruder in company with an
               Inspector.    He declines to make a further
               statement but confirms that’'had"IfOeerf
               called to attend the Inquest he would fiave'
               done so and that if another Inquest were
               held he would attend if called.
13.1.92        Announcement that the anticipated Police...
               disciplinary proceedings will not take place.
               I produce as JJH/1 a copy of the press release
               to that effect issued by the Police'CompTaints
               Authority.
January 1992   Individual statements of Applicants forwarded
               to Counsel.                       .......
30.1.92        House of Lords hears appeal on the issue of
               "Pre Death Trauma" (Hicks and others).
18.2.92        Anne Williams receives two witness statements
               and compares them with Inquest transcripts.
               She then contacts and meets with WPC Martin.

12.3.92        I am advised by Counsel that an Application
               for a Judicial Review    is also appropriate
               although it is nonetheless right first to
               submit the proposed Memorial.     Conference
               date is provisionally set for 8.4.92.
8.4.92         Conference with Counsel and Applicants.
               Draft Memorial is circulated and some

             a.       the background to th« alleged failure to control thosa

             planning         and .preparation         for   the po lice    operation        wh i c h    it

             would be impossible to assess fairly at a disciplinary hearing

      impaired/ and


      f,      it would       be an injustice to     the   superintendent,       who

      conducted hiaseif with dignity at the Inquaat and throughout

      the investigation*, for him to stand alono chax-<?#« with being

      a, cauaa of the tragady which occurred and thus to appear to be
      a    'scapegoat’ for faults vhiah nay well be attributable to

      others.

we have t-«.)cen in t o .acoount th« inturesus and Ceelings of those who

the result of the tragic events and tfte public interest on the one
hand *nd, on the other, justice to the Superintendent and th® sense
of   unfairness        which    would result from   continuing        the    process

                 Dear Sir

                 Re:     Coroners Act 1988 - Paul Carlile And Others
                         Hillsborough Inquest_____________________

                 We write further to our letter of 15th April 1992 which enclosed
                 a Memorial on behalf of the next of kin of six of those who lost
                 their lives in the Hillsborough Disaster of 15th April 1989.

                 There are certain details which we would wish to add to the Memorial
                 for your assistance:

                 1.     Omitted from the bundle was the middle page of the letter sent
                        to the Coroner by John Glover and dated 15th October 1990.
                        We now enclose a copy of that middle page which we have numbered
                        "50A" for inclusion at the appropriate point in Appendix 1.

                 2.     Also omitted was the transcript of the Inquest Hearing relating
                        to Ian Glover on 4th May 1990. We enclose herewith a copy
                        of that transcript.

                 3.     On Page 45 of Appendix 1 it is said incorrectly that "The jury
                        never heard from Joseph Glover himself". His evidence as given
                        to the jury appears at Pages 52 to 66 of Appendix 1. It is
                        however our submission in relation to his evidence that the
                        ruling of the Coroner in relation to the "cut off point" prevented


                                                                              Continued

        him from contributing relevant evidence.

We further enclose herewith letters sent personally by your Memorialists
which are in support of their request that you grant leave under
section 13 of the Coroners Act 1988. Included with these is a
letter from Doctor Steven Crosby who is the General Practitioner
of the Parents of kevin Williams.

Yours faithfully

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN




Dear Sir/Madam

Re:   Mr & Mrs J S Williams

In my opinion a further inquest on my patients son's death would
be beneficial to a more sustained emotional recovery from the
severe bereavement stress that both parents have been coping with
for years. The longer the delay 1 fear the longer it will take
for them to come to terms with Kevin's death.

Recently, more information concerning events at the scene have
improved their state of mind and although attendance at an inquest
would indeed by stressful, I am confident that they are able and
willing to deal with this most pressing and urgent matter.

Yours sincerely




Dr S J Crosb

Mrs S Stringer




Dear Madam

Thank you for your letter which was received on 11 June 1991 asking for
certain material arising from the Hillsborough Investigation.  The position
is that South Yorkshire Police have adopted a policy based on legal advice
that at the present time means that none of this type of material is released.

If there is any change in this policy I will write to you again.

I am very sorry to learn of your sorrow arising from the tragedy and would
extend my deep sympathy at your loss.

Yours f a i t h f u l l y

    Dear Ms Carlile,

    Thank you for your letter which was responded to by the Chief Constable’s
    Staff Officer, on the 13th November 1991.

    As indicated in the Staff Officer's letter we were awaiting legal advice,
    ^ d I have to inform you that that advice directs us not to release any
    information until such time as all discipline matters tave^beenjjinali s e d . ^
    You will no doubt be aware that discipline matters are still p e n d i n g against
    « e officer in South Yorkshire, and until such time as the outcome of that
    matter is determined, I am unfortunately unable to release any material.

    I can once again assure you that the photograph has not been forgotten,
    and I will make every effort to release it as soon as I am in a positio
    to do so.

    Yours sincerely,




    Brian L Mole

      Dear Mrs Stringer

      Thank you for your letter of 17 January 1992 which has been passed for my
      attention.  Please accept my apologies for the delay in replying.

      I trust you will accept that urgent attention is being given to the many
      requests for copy statements and photographs which we have received.  Each
      request is receiving individual consideration and therefore some delay may
      be experienced in our final response to you.

      I "will however write to you again as soon as I                             am in a position to respond
      positively to your request.

      Yours sincerely

          Dear                                   )
          In response to your requests for material gathered in the Hillsborough Disaster
          Enquiry I am now able to provide you with a copy of the photograph you seek.

          Unfortunately the question of release of statements made by various
          individiuals poses additional problems.  I trust that you will appreciate
          that I am not trying to be evasive in this matter, but I feel it only proper
          that I should seek the authority of the makers of statements before releasing
          them to a third person.  I await that authority and should the statement makers
          agree I will provide you with copies without delay.

          May I take this opportunity of thanking you on behalf of the South Yorkshire
          Police for the patience you have shown in awaiting the release of information
          and would apologise for the delay.

         Dear Mrs Stringer,

         Reference is made to your request for copies of statements made during
         the Hillsborough Disaster Enquiry.

         Enclosed herewith are copies of statements where the makers have given
         me written authority to release the documents.

         Unfortunately, I still await a reply in respect of one statement and I
         am sure that you would wish to know that I am making efforts to contact
         the maker to seek his permission to release the statement to you.

         May I take this opportunity of thanking you on behalf of the South
         Yorkshire Police for the patience you have shown in awaiting the release
         of information and would apologise for the delay.

         Yours sincerely,

         Dear Mr Heaven

         I       refer         to   a    letter      received        from     Mrs Stringer,           a      copy   of    which         I have
         attached for your information.

         The material                   Mrs Stringer        has    requested         was    not     introduced           at   the       inquest
         and as such is not in the public domain.

         It is the policy of South Yorkshire Police not to release                                                            post       mortem
         photographs and to date no such material has been released.

         Please be assured that I do not wish to be obstructive and am eager to assist
         in whatever way I possibly can.

                  De ar Sir,

                  Re;      Ian G LOVE R        (deceased)

                  Thank you for your letter of the 4th M a r c h c o n c e r n i n g the above.

                  You w i l l obviously a p p r e c i a t e the disa dv a n t a g e that I a m under in this m a t t e r
                  h a v i n g been app ointed to this juris d i c t i o n only at the end of last year.            I
                  have therefore i nheri ted a large amount of p a p e r w o r k relati ng to the
                  H i l l s b o r o u g h Inquest and I a m not p e r s o n a l l y familia r either w i t h this
                  pa p e r work nor w i t h the m a j o r i t y of the evidence at the Inquest.

                  I a m not quite sure w h a t is m e a n t by your request for "a copy of the West
                  M i d la nds Police Report".   You are aware, I a m sure, that Rule 57 of the
                  Coroners Rules 1984 i n d i cate s that a C o r o n e r shall supply an i n t e r e s t e d party
                  wi.th a copy of a Post M o r t e m Report, or n otes of eviden ce or of any doc ument
                  put in evidence at an Inquest.           On the basis of the inf orm a t i o n that I have I
                  cannot see h o w this s e ctio n w o u l d a pply to a n y t h i n g that cou ld be d e s c r i b e d
                  as a Police Report.

                  This does not n e c e s s a r i l y m e a n that Mr. & Mrs. G l o v e r cannot get to see
                  d o c u m e n t a t i o n outside the scope of Rule 57.    It simply means in m y v i e w that
                  they should apply to the P o l i c e for the release of any relevant d o c u m e n t a t i o n
                  rather than me.

                  I have of course n o t e d y o u r comment, that the family h a v e been a w a i t i n g
                  certain witness statements from the South Y o r k s h i r e Police and I hav e spoken
                  to the Officer d e a l i n g w i t h such requests a s k ing h i m to expedite any papers
                  req uested by Mr. & Mrs.         Glover.

                  If I can              assist Mr. & Mrs. G lover u nder the terms of Rule     57 p l e a s e let   me
                  k n o w and           I will give as m u c h help as I can.

       Dear Mr Glover

        I refer to your letter to the Coroner requesting post mortem photographs.
        The material you request was not introduced at the inquest and as such is
        not in the public domain.

        It is the policy of the South Yorkshire Police not to release post                       mortem
        photographs and to date no such material has been released.

        Please be assured that I do not wish to be obstructive and am eager                   to assist
        in whatever way I possibly can.

        Yours sincerely




        J M^jowe

Mrs. A . E . Williams,




>Dear         M r s .   Williams,                                         ,
Further to my letter of the 4th February I have n o w had the
opportunity of discussing your request with Dr. Popper.

It is apparent that the situation is not as simple as your letter
originally led me to believe.       The statements of Mr. Bruder and
WPC M a ^ I n were not tendered in evidence at the Inquest as such
rat her* it was a oase of the contents of the statements being referred
to w h e n either the Presenting Officer or the doctor were questioned.
I do however accept that short extracts from Mr. Bruder s statement
w er e quoted in this m a n n e r .

 As a matter of general principle I should say that I might not
 accept that Rule 57 of the Coroners R u l e s 19 84 therefore applie
 to these statements.       However, having spoken both wi t h Dr. P°PP®
 and Chief Superintendent Mole (who is now in charge of the paper
 w o r k retained by So ut h Yorkshire Police) we feel that as you p e a r l y
 are still very anxious that an exception can be mad e in this ca         .
.Accordingly I enclose copies of the statements of Mr. ^ d e r and
^WPC Martin.     There is also a ph o t o c o p y of a form compl   Y
 Martin and referred to in her statement.

So far as the photographs are concerned it is not within my ability
to let you have copies and I have referred this to       le         -th C O nies
Superintendent Mole.     He informs me that he will supp y y
of the photographs requested subject only to confirma           than with
copyright of those photographs lies with the police ra          . •
individual news media.     Mr. Mole is in the process o  o g          .
photographs etc. for a large number of relatives an       ao _ 4-c-
w i l l ask you to be patient whilst he deals with all requ

I hope that provision of these documents will ul t i ma t e l y                                                  ^
in coming to terms w i t h the terrible tragedy which has
your life.


Yours sincerely,

    I, SANDRA STRINGER of                                        MAKE OATH
    and say as follows:-


    1.   I am one of the Applicants herein and I make this Affidavit
    having seen the Affidavit of the Respondent Coroner sworn herein
    on 10th September 1993.


    2.   I respectfully refer to page 10 of the transcript of the
! "Business Meeting" held on 30th October 1990, which is exhibited
j
| to the said Coroner's Affidavit.         I note that the Coroner there
s announced a decision not to circulate copies of statements that
i   had been made by prospective witnesses.

i
: 3.     The effect of this was that Counsel who appeared for the
bereaved families only had copies of statements if the witness
concerned had managed to retain a copy at the time the statement
was made.    I understand that when Stephanie Jones, daughter of
my fellow Applicants Leslie and Doreen Jones, made her witness
statement it was insisted that a copy be retained and that this
assisted Counsel when she gave evidence.


4.   By contrast, Counsel appearing for the Police appeared to
have available copies of all witness statements and witnesses
were very frequently cross examined by reference to the statements


5.   It was further my observation that Police Officers due to
give evidence before the Inquest had with them photocopies of thei
own statements which they were free to study at length, to discuss
with colleagues and even to take with them into the witness box.
In contrast, supporters did not have such copies unless they had
retained a copy vyhen they made the statement.          If they did not
have a copy, they only had a brief opportunity to read them in
noisy and crowded conditions for a few minutes before having to
give them back and then give evidence and face cross examination.


6.   It was further my observation that the warning against self­
incrimination was given to the majority of Police Officer witnesse
but was not given to supporters even though they were invariably
cross examined as to their alcohol intake and as to their conduct
while at the ground.


7.   In my view these apparent disparities of treatment may well
have affected the content and quality of the evidence put before
the jury in the Inquest proceedings.

    say as follows:-


| 1.     I am one of the Applicants herein and make this Affidavit
| upon seeing the Affidavit of the Respondent Coroner sworn herein
I on 10th September 1993.

i
i   2.   I note that in the "continuity chart" relating to my son Ian
1 Glover (which begins at Page 101 of Section 8 of the Exhibits)
!                                                        j
    there is reference to a PC 1100Fojut and what     Ipresume is a       ;
! quotation from his witness statement to the effect that Ian     was     j
;                           !

! "vomitingas we carried him".                                            j




    3.   Although I knew at the time of the Inquest that PC Fojut had
    made a statement naming my son, I never saw either the continuity
sheet or his witness statement.      I have never before known that
he referred to Ian as "vomiting" and I was most upset to read it
here for the first time.


4.     I am aware that at the "mini inquest" hearing regarding Ian
doubt was expressed as to whether the Officer had made a correct
identification.     By reason of what my son Joseph told the Police
it was assumed that the Officer was mistaken.      PC Fojut was however
not called to give evidence for his identification to be tested.
Nor have I to date been able to see his witness statement, so I
still do not know what he was saying.

CRUSH INCIDENT AT SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL GROUND - 17 MARCH 1956

I forward to you for your information and retention a copy of
correspondence in respect of a crush incident which occurred at Sheffield
Wesnesday in March 1956 when Sunderland played Birmingham in a cup tie.

It seems that problems on the terraces at Sheffield Wednesday are not new
by any means!

   PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE AT

Dear Mr Smith

First, may I express my sincere sympathy with all those who lost loved ones,
relatives and friends in the tragedy at Sheffield.

We know that what happened at Hillsborough was not associated with the type
of violence seen in recent times.

My own experience at this ground on an occasion thirty-three years ago
might be of some interest and relevance when considering the reforms needed
to protect spectators.

On 17th March 1956 I went with a friend to the Sheffield Wednesday Ground
to see Sunderland v Birmingham in a Cup-tie. We had terrace tickets.

Within seconds of the match commencing the forward crush became so great
that my friend was trapped behind one of the crash barriers.  As he had had
a lung resection operation and I saw the blood drain from his face I feared
for his life. I manage to free his leg which was caught round an upright
and we both managed to get back to the rear of the terrace.  I had observed
number of abdominal injuries, and the situation was frightening. We left
the ground and set off on our return journey.

I was so incensed over this happening, and concerned that the outcome could
have been tragically more serious that I wrote to the Chief Constable of
Sheffield protesting that the numbers allowed onto the terraces must have
exceeded the safety figure laid down by him.

A copy of this reply is enclosed.

The point I wish to make is that the answer is not necessarily to have
seats on the terraces, but simply to strictly control and limit numbers
allowed into the various terrace sections.

If current thinking is included towards having all seats, then by so doing
they will be accepting the idea of less people anyway, and that same number
(or even more) would be no problem if they were allowed to stand.

Yours sincerely

Dear 'Sir

I enclose a copy of a letter 1 have written to Mr John Smith, Chairman
Liverpool Football Club In regard to the tragedy at Hillsborough.
I also enclose a copy of a letter dated 20th March 1956 which 1 received
from the Chief Constable of Sheffield concerning a complaint I had made
regarding serious crushing I had experienced at the Wednesday Ground on
17th March during a Cup-tie (Sunderland v Birmingham).

The fact that this correspondence refers to something that happenned
thirtythree years ago might be of interest to you in your current enquiry.
                                                                               v

                   Y e s ? a mass of supporters.- St., Johns Ambulance volunteers

                   and police near to the gate to P e n three obscured my view

                   of the gate itself so 1 could not say where these 2 men

Q21.   WHAT WAS YOUR INITIAL INTERPRETATION OF THE EVENTS YOU WERE

       WITNESSING?



            At first sight of supporters spilling onto the pitch I

            thought    it was a pitch invasion by Liverpool f a n s .       However,

            I soon realised the seriousness of the situation,,

(323, HAVE YOU AGREED TO DO SO?



          No , not my copyright




(324„ WERE YOU AT THE SEMI FINAL LAST YEAR?




(323. IF YES, HAVE YOU ANY OBSERVATIONS TO MAKE ON THAT GAME,                 IN THE

     LIGHT OF THIS DISASTER?



          The Liver pool fans on that occasion ware evenly distributed

          throughout the standing            paddocks   (pens) at the Leppings Lane

          encl.,       This is unlike this match        (1989) where some

          side paddocks were half full            (i.e. Pen 1 & 2) whilst Pens 3

          & 4 were          packed.
GH6. FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE, HAVE YOU ANY VIEWS ON THE BEHAVIOUR OF

        THE LIVERPOOL/NOTTINGHAM FOREST SUPPORTERS AT THIS M A T C H ,

        <1989), COMPARED WITH SUPPORTERS OF OTHER FOOTBALL CLUBS?



                N o , in my experience -football supporters from most   clubs are

                the same with small vandalistic elements   in most   clubs.




 Q27. HAVE YOU ANYTHING TO OFFER WHICH YOU CONSIDER TO BE VITAL TO

         THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

                    FOOTBALL STADIUM ATTENDANCE

                Co-Ordination of Emergency Services


 The police, fire and ambulance services, should maintain through
 senior nominated officers, regular liaison concerning crowd
 safety at each stadium.
  Prior to the match at the designated stadium, the police should
^teisure that the fire and ambulance services are given full
^ R t a i l s of the event, including its venue, times, estimated
  number of spectators, likely routes of entry and exit, and any
  difficulties envisaged concerning the movement of the crowd.
  These details should be readily available in the Control Rooms of
  each emergency service.
 Contingency plans for the arrival of emergency vehicles at the
 stadium   should be reviewed to include routes of       access,
 rendezvous points and accessibility within the ground itself.
 Police officers posted at entrance to grounds should be briefed
 to these plans, and should be informed when such services are
 called as to where and when required.
            First Aid Medical Facilities and Ambulances

 One trained first aider per 1,000 spectators should be at each
 match, at each stadium.     There should also be at least 1 first
 aid room.    The number of such rooms and equipment should be
 maintained and specified by the local authority,    after taking
 professional medical advice, and should be made a requirement of
 any Safety Certificate.
 At least 1 fully equipped ambulance from the          appropriate
 ambulance authority should be in attendance at all matches with
 an expected crowd of 5,000 or more.   The number of ambulances in
 attendance for matches where larger crowds are expected should be
 specified by the local authority, after consultation with the
 ambulance service.
 An Advisory Group should be set up consisting of appropriate
 members of staff, representatives of the Police, Fire and
 Ambulance Services,    building authority,    football club and
 supporters club.    All matters concerning crowd safety should be
 dealt with and regular visits made to the ground.   The chairman
 should be from the local authority.    All resolutions should be
 recorded and regular written reports should be submitted to the
 local authority for consideration.

 Apart from Celtic and Rangers Football Clubs, the others would
 only meet the number requirements in a situation where they were
 drawn against one of the bigger clubs in the League Cup or
 Scottish Cup.
 Queens Park of course are the exceptions as they host the
 International and, on occasions, the Cup finals where, depending
 on the opposition, a maximum' capacity could be reached.     One
 venue is planned for this year - SCOTLAND V NORWAY in the World
 Cup series on 15 November 1989 and a crowd in excess of 50,000
 spectators are expected.
 In some instances when Rangers and Celtic reserves meet, a crowd
 of 5,000 plus can be reached.    No actual figures are available
 for definite confirmation.

 Throughout the entire league season, Celtic and Rangers are never
 in Glasgow on a Saturday on the same day.    This, however, could
 alter especially in mid week games in any of the Cup contests,
 e.g. Skol Cup and Scottish Cup.    In addition, both teams are in
 the European tournaments and, depending of their success, could
 involve more mid week games.    Depending on the draw in both the
 Skol and Scottish Cup we could again have involvement if the
 Glasgow teams are successful.
  It is suggested that for Celtic and Rangers at home for any venue
  at least two ambulances and possibly three when they clash at
: Ibrox or Parkhead.

                          AMBULANCE SERVICE REQUIREMENTS


The football commitment in the Greater Glasgow operational area
is part of an annual spectator programme and as such creates both
a demand on manpower and equipment.     It is possible depending
upon the various cup ties and reserve matches that at least two
football venues would require an Ambulance Service input at any
one time.     Considering this possible requirement alongside the
other large spectator events being held throughout the next
twelve months, that service may well require assistance from

K e National Training Centre and/or our neighbouring Services for
  bulance Officer and staff resources.      In the light of our
recent experiences at Hampden Park and Parkhead additional
equipment resources are urgently required.

       1 -    .DESIGNATED MAJOR INCIDENT EQUIPMENT VEHICLES AND
              EQUIPMENT TO DEAL WITH A MINIMUM OF (50) FIFTY
              CASUALTIES.

              VEHICLES.

       8 -    UHF HAND PORTABLE RADIOS PREFERABLE WITH CHANNEL 1 ON
              SEPARATE FREQUENCY RANGES.

     Dear Sir
     HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER      - INTERIM REPORT     BY   THE   RIGHT
     HONOURABLE LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR
     Following the publication of the Right Honourable Lord Justice
     Taylor's interim report, I felt the Scottish Ambulance Service of
     Greater Glasgow should assess the current situation with regards
     to ambulance attendance at football venues within the Greater
     Glasgow Area.
     My Officers have visite'd the major football grounds and assessed
     what, in the professional Ambulance Services case, would be an
     appropriate   ambulance provision for t h e . various   estimated
     attendances, and I enclose a copy of our intended guidance note
     for your stadium and our basic recommendations for ambulance
     provision, should they be required by the Licencing Authority.

     Please note, that these costs are provisional and do not reflect
     any future salary increases or inflation.
     I would hope that you would view our recommendations in the light
     of the interim report and if I can be of any further assistance,
     please do not hesitate to contact me at the above address.

1 Yours faithfully




     Chief Ambulance Officer

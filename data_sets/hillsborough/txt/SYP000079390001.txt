had given ms.              The    value    of the    ticket      being £12 . 0 0 and was        for a

seat    in the West S t a n d , G a n gw ay Y ,



We   left for S h e f f i e l d about        1 "1.30am    (1130)    -- quarter     to twelve         (1145).

O n the way to the m at ch we did stop at one of the services                              on the HI,

I think,       simply for the other four                 lads    to go to the toilet,           I

remained with the             car.



As far as          I can remember         there was      no serious      traffic      delay.



We a r r i v e d    in S h e f f i e l d about 5 past two an d because we became                     caught

up in the Notts Forest                traffic,      on the w ay to the ground.                 It took       us

about an other 30 minutes,                to get out of the jam and              parked the          car

a r o u n d the     corner    from a school         in Halifax R d .        There was also a

We w a l k e d down to the ground together,                     a police   presence was         evident,

I cannot       comment       on whet he r    they were d ir ecting         or escorting any

supporters.              However,     because     speaking       for myself,     no    police       dir ec te d

me or escorted an y group that                  I was     in,    in my opinion        police    strength

at this      same m atch the year            before,     was a lot stronger            than this year,

although       last year         I did travel       by train.



Prior     to arriving at           the ground       I did not      see any Liverpool           supporter

d rinking any alcohol,               nor did    I see a ny fighting         or drunkeness,

                   but    I was       u n c o m f o rt ab ly standing    in this mass,        I was e m l y    interested

                   in getting          into the ground so I cannot a c c u r a t e l y ^comment on the

                   numbers       of    police and stewards           on the entrance          to the turnstiles.



                   As    1 was a p p r o a ch in g    the gates at the L ep p i n g s Ln end I saw one                       PC

                   attending          to a gate,      I am not sure whether              he was    trying     to shut        it,

                   or    close    it properly.            After    I had passed these qates,                I saw two^

                   on horseback and             looking       back on the      incident     I realise       they / e r e

                   h a v imj/a great        deal     of trouifle coping with their                s ituation with

                   respect       of the      crowd,     y&s     I got nearer        to the turnstiles,          (I a c t u a l l y

                   went    through the t ur nstile              on the extreme          right,    entrance     "C ').

                   There was a PC                t he ^ b a l c o n y above   the turnstile        of entrance       ’C ’ and

                   1 saw him ass/st about               four     people up out          of the    crowd because         by now,

                   numerous       other      people were having           d iscomfort and trouble             coping with

                   the    crush.          I p ersonally         did not       see any stewards at the a p p r o a c h to

                   the turnstiles.               I w o ul d     like to say that as              I was going through the

                   turnstile,          the ticket      collector was          very nervous and        I had to ask to

                   have my ticket            stub back.            A lt h o u g h the   crowd was     bad,    I d i d n ’t

                   p erso na ll y have any trouble               finding      the   correct      turnstile     to go

                   through,       simply because          the    crowd    pushed me to the          correct     point.

I at no time used the tunnel                      for the standing areas at                 the front       of

the West Stand.               Although        1 w ould have wa lk ed           past     the entrance        to

this     tunnel,     I was     not aware          of any     police     or stewards         on duty at this

point,     a lt h o u g h there was a P o l i c e m a n and a steward at the bottom of

the    entrancce       to G a ng wa y Y and Z.               j




Hav in g    entered the West Staplf, I found my                         seat    had been taken         and was

therefore        compelled to >(ave to sit                       in the gangways.



At no time         in the ground did              I see a n y bo dy drinking,             or any fighting

or drunkeness.



As soon as         I wal ke d down the gangway,                   the match     started,       I was      now on

my own and sat down              in gang wa y Y near              to the balcony o ve rl ooking             the

standing a r e a s .



W hile     I was watching          the match,         I became aware           of    people at     the front

of the stand,          standing          up and    looking down          into the standing are a

below.          I go-fr up and also went              to the front.             I could see        people

climbing / f v e r     the    railings        from Pen 3 into Pen 2, when                   I locked       into

Pen 3 i/e could see            people        shouting j x t       the   police,      who y e r e on the

get out      by c 1 imbing       qua .    but were        pushed batffc by the          police.        I also

saw other        people who/I would               say were        suffering,        being a ss is t e d    over

this     same    fence but a g ai n being             pushed back         by the      police,     by this

time,      I was    shouting at the             police to open the fence and get them out

basically,         but they d i d n ’t seem to be taking any notice                          of anyone,

there was        still    people         climbing     over from Pe n 3 into Pen 2.                     By this

time    I was a s sisting           people     up from Pen 2 into the West S t an d because

they had been          crying       for help.           Pen 3 was a mass            of    people a-nd seemed

to be worse          than Pen 2.            At this        point    I looked      into^P^n 3 a nd there

was    d e f i ni t el y some      people who had now              col laps^cH;          One    in particular

was    lying    face up,        his arms were apart                sprj^d eagle          like,        he was a

y ou ng man a nd he seemed to have a lot ydt hair.                               His skin was             blue

l was    shouting at the             police      ’The re *s dead down there*.                         I then saw a

coloured fellow             check    this     particular man's             pulse.         I also        saw the

body of a young             lad,    he was     face down.            I saw him at first                 standing

but    leaning a gainst a pile of people,                         sort    of slumped,          d e fi ni te ly

unconscious.            He slid down             beneath the         crowd out of sight.                  I think

at this       time    the gates at          the front         of the      pens were        still closed.

Pen 2 s eemed to be emptying                   out a bit more             now.   ^J-he next           thing      I

remember       is seeing        the gate       in the front          fence/of Pen 3 being                 open.

At this       point    I saw another             man,       only his j>ace, side on to the

railings       jammed a gai ns t        it.He was          oby io us ly   in terrible                 pain.          He

was m id dl e a ged man,            possibly      light X rown maybe             even grey hair.                     I
                                                        —     .

was    sure    something was          going to harp pen to him and when                        I looked again,

he had gone.            I d o n ’t know wh^rl hap pe ne d to him.                        A l th ou gh the        pens

were    he av il y    packed       I cannot/say         I saw any surge          of      people which

down and do something,                so    I got   lowereed down from W fe b al co n y into

replied,       'No this       f e l l o w ’s g o n e . ’      I m o ve d ar ou nd on the              pitch and

took over       from a lady who was               in the St Johns Ambulance Serv ic e and

who was very upset.                  She    had been performing              heart massage              on a white

s eemed 3 - 4          minutes and        some man said to this other St John's ma n who

was ass is ti ng me,           ’H ow    l o n g ? ’ and the      reply was       'About    10 m i n u t e s ’ and

he said,        'Leave him h e ’s d e a d ’ .             There was a lad about 25 - 30 years

old s tanding at            the feet      of the dead m an and he said to me                     'Come     on

lad we'll        carry him'.             We    picked him up and we were a p p r o a c h e d             by the

police who          said,    'Put him down,             is he d e a d ? ’ and the        lad who was

h elping me         carry him said            'Yeah about        10 minutes',      but the      police

tried a gain          to give    him heart massage and a                  police woman there          said,

'Leave him with us now'.                       W hen    I went    to anot he r man,        lying on the

pitch there was a lad kneeling                         by him,    I say lad but          I m ean about

20 years        old,    the man on the floor about                  the same age.            There was

other       people about and this               lad said,        although    I ’m not sure        to who m he

d ir ec t ed    it,    'Help me        cover    his face'        or words    to that       effect.         I

can't       remember exac tl y what             happened n e x t , but his face was               covered

with his        shirt.



W hile      I was     on the    pitch or        in the ground           itself   I never     saw a ny thing

I also a ss is te d a lady              in the St Johns Am bu la nc e Service,                 put a young

lad about        16 - 17 years           of age        into the    recovery      position.          This       lady

was    upset and the           lad had d i ff ic ul ty          in breathing,       he    couldn't     catch

his    breath and then a police woman                          came over    to me and said,          'OK

leave       him with us'.



When       people     became aware what            had happened most             policemen     I saw were

helping        in some way or other,               I w ould      like    to say that       it was    the

L iv er po ol    fans who       took     the    initiative        to get the hoardings            to assist

in m oving       the    bodies.          By this        time    I was    in a totally other world,
                                                                                                               PAGE         7
                                                                                                               S2365

              shocked by what             I was seeing,           However    I d i d assist     in carrying

              bodies and           possibly u nconscious           people    to the Forest       end of the

              pitch.         I saw countless          people      f r a n t ic al ly giving m outh to m o ut h and

              heart ma ssage         to anyone who          had the slightest         flicker    of life      left.

              I saw the fans,             police,   firemen and St John's A mb ulance all                   doing what

              they    could       in this    respect.



              I finally          left the ground about            quarter    to five    (1645)    , by the

              Leppings Ln entrance,                 I don't       know why,    I just    left.        On the way

              out    I saw that a barrier             in Pen 3 had c ol lapsed bat            I did not see          that

              0 c cu r .

                                                        P

              1 feel       if,   in the 'Beginninjj^the            police    had used their       initiative

              i nstead of waiting            fp-r orders        from s senior officer,          the   tragedy w o u l d

              not have       been j s a    great and     I feel     that    there    defin it el y was a lack of

              c o mm un ic a> lo n between the officers outside                    the ground and those         inside

              an d   possibly       if the m atch had been delayed 30 minutes.                        The    crowds

              would not have          been    in such a rush to get            in and    possibly this tragedy

              could have         been avoided.         The      lad I referred to as having been               put

     'Tb^2'   into the       recovery       position was wearing            blue    jeans and a black jacket,

j£>4Pj^T"J    possibly      leather,          I ’m a fr a i d   I can't     remember muc h about        the

  Vy\\*\ '    d es cr iptions      of other      people.

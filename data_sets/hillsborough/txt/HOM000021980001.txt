           Mervyn Jonas may now have relacsd to you ths conversation Z had with hist
           on the evening of 8 August, and I thought I would consolidate our
           conversation by writing to you.

           The nature of the Inquiry has plaeed the South Yorkshire Police merely as
           witnesses at the disposal of Lord Justice Taylor, and quite properly we
           have received no communication from the Vest Midlands Police officers
           engaged in gathering evidence which would indicate their views on issues
           as they emerged.

           My Police Authority received a letter of complaint from Mr Trevor Hicks,
                                                             ] a g a in s t th e Deputy
           Chief Constable, Peter Hayes, for the comments he made following Chief
           Superintendent Duckenfield's evidence to the Inquiry and the allegation
           against him of untruthfulness. That is now with the Police Authority who
          ’will decide on whatever course of action they feel appropriate in respect
           of Mr Hayes. On receipt of the correspondence 1 regarded it also as «
           complaint against Mr Duckenfield. 1 caused the complaint to be recorded
           and Mr K P D Cooper, Assistant Chief Constable of Northamptonshire, has
           been appointed to investigate the specific allegation of untruthfulness
           levelled against Mr Duckenfleld.

           On receipt of Lord Justice Taylor’s report I considered that the question
           of criminal liability needed to be addressed and Z have asked the Director
           of Public Prosecutions to give me his advice in this regard, and that ia
           awaited. If he consldera that prima facie there la evidence which
           justifies police enquiries then Z presume that these will be ear ned out
           by members of your Force. This leavea the question of possible discipline
           offences which may lie agalnat one or more members of the South Yorkshire

         In the normal course of events an officer conducting an enquiry would

         understand why I have received no Information from you -,hat would assist
         me in deciding on a proper course of action. Por Instance your officers
         may have taken statements which would in normal circumstances be regarded
         as containing a complaint against police and would merit the appointment
         of an investigating officer.

         The paramount consideration in this regard la, of course, the service of
         Regulation 7 notices on the officers involved at the earliest opportunity.

         It may well be that now the public hearing aspect of the Inquiry is over
             :eel you are now in a position to communicate with me on these
        «   ortant matters. All the evidence which exlats is In your possession
             clearly if further enquiries are required It would be both practical
         and appropriate for your officers to pursue them.

         I should be obliged if you would let        me have your views   on this iasue.

           I enclose a copy of a l e t t e r which I have w ritte n to Mr David Alton MP. It

           decided to lodge a fo rm al co m p lain t w ith you.

           There is nothing in his various l e t t e r s of co m p lain t which calls for a m a n d a to ry
           r e f e r r a l to this A u tho rity and I by no means encou rag e you to r e f e r it to us

^€our    C e c -U ,
Thank you for your recent reply, although I am disappionted at
its contents.  The point of my letter was that the statements
made by members of the South Yorkshire Police were made
anonymously.  Therefore there seems to be no one Officer to lodge
a complaint about .

Also the statements were immediately damaging.  Both I and my
staff then began to hear derogatory comments about the conduct of
Liverpool supporters that were completely at variance with all
the eyewitness accounts that I have heard.

One constituent subsequently wrote to me "...I was both vomited
and urinated upon, not as a result of drunkeness, but by people
in their death throes."

The provenance of those comments should be investigated.  You
suggested that no action should be taken until after the Inquiry.
By the same argument, should not the Officer who made the
offensive comments about Liverpool supporters have kept his
comments to himself until after the Inquiry?

           THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

           Thank you for your: l e t t e r dat ed 8 May.

           The s c h e m e of the Police and Crim inal Evidence Act 1984 is t h a t every
           com pla int must be made in the fir st insta nce to the chief o ffice r of police for
           t h e a r e a in w h ic h t h e i n c i d e n t g iv i n g r is e to t h e c o m p l a i n t a r o s e .

           T h e r e a f t e r if th e com p laint falls into one or oth er of: c e r t a i n c a t e g o rie s of
           serious consequence,! the chief o ffic e r must fo rth w it h r e fe r the com plaint to
           this Auth orit y for us to consider w h eth er we should supervise th e in v e s t i g a t i o n
           of it.

           If th e com pla int does not fall into one of the s t a t u t o r y c a t e g o r ie s of serious
           co m pla int, it will be in vestig ated under the supervision of the chief o ffice r
           unless he o r ; we think t h a t in the public in t e r e s t we ought to supervise it.

           Whether the in vestig atio n is supervised by this Auth orit y or not, the re p o rt of
           th e investig at io n will in the end be s u b m it te d to us for us to decide w h e th e r in
           our opinion any crim in al or disciplinary proceedings ought to be considered
           against any offic er.

           It follows th a t if you wish to make a fo rm al com pla int of misc onduct against a
           police offic e r, you must first lodge it with the chief offic e r of the fo rc e
           concerned, who in this insta nce will be:-

would be b e t t e r by far to a w ait the findings of Lord J u s t i c e Taylor's inquiry

It may appear from thfe findings of the inquiry t h a t th e re was no ju sti fic ation

     T ha n k you for your letter of 2nd May,        My complaint was made as a

     that these comments were made when two Inquiries had already been
     e s ta bli shed, rendering their c omments sub-judice.

    T he ir      remarks  were  prejudiced, contrary  to good  police practice,
    i ns e n s i t ive to relatives and damaging to my city.  I therefore trust
    you wi ll feel able to carry out an inv estigation as to how this could
    have come about.

I am writing to request that you institute an immediate enquiry
into the propriety of the remarks passed yesterday by Police
Officers of the South Yorkshire Police Force about the conduct of
fans at the FA Cup Semi-Final at Hillsborough on Saturday last.

Given that the Home Secretary had announced the judicial enquiry
into the disaster the day before, and the solicitor for 30 of the
victims’ families had begun proceedings against the Chief
Constable and his Force these remarks should never have been
made.

By what right did Police Officers make statements calculated to
be prejudicial to the reputation of Liverpool football club and
its supporters, and which seem to be part of a smokescreen of
propaganda aimed at diverting attention from the truth.

Lord Denning once said that "be they ever so mighty they are not
mightier than the law". I trust that you will use your good
offices to examine how such statements came to be, and on whose
authority they were issued. Perhaps you would let me know what
guidlines exist.

What guidelines exist for the publication of statements once a
judicial enquiry has been announced.  I am copying this letter to
the Rt Hon Douglas Hurd MP .

                           /fts




             Thank you for your l e t t e r of 24 April enclosing docum ents which I re tu rn
             h erew ith , having ta k e n copies for our files.

             As to                          fir s t m a t t e r of co m p lain t, I understand from his passing
             r e f e r e n c e to it t h a t he has some grie v an ce ab o u t m isconduct by th e M erseyside
             police in connection with a t r a f f i c a c c id e n t.             If so, he m ust first lodge his
             com p laint w ith th e C hief O ffic e r of th e Merseyside police whose address is PO
             Box 59, Liverpool L69 1JD.

             If his com plaint falls into one or o th e r of c e r ta in s ta tu to r y categ o rie s, it will
             be th e duty of th e ch ief o ffic e r fo rth w ith to rep o rt th e com plaint to this
             A u thority for co n sid e ra tio n of w h e th e r we ought to supervise investigation of
             th e com plaint. W hether we supervise it or not, the rep o rt of th e investigation
             will in any ev en t be sen t to this A utho rity for consideration of its su fficiency
             and of any disciplinary consequences which ought to follow.

             As to th e second p arag ra p h of your le tte r , I m ust say a t once th a t th e r e is not
             th e sligh test ground for suggesting t h a t an enquiry conducted under th e
             a u th o rity of Lord J u s tic e Taylor will be o th e r than of th e most rigorous and
             independent c h a r a c te r .

             I n o te th a t           has no co m p lain t of m isconduct by a police o ffice r personal
             to himself but r a t h e r o ffers c ritic ism both of th e police and of th e Club
             m a n ag em e n t in th e controlling of th e crowds a t Hillsborough. It occurs to me
             t h a t he might think t h a t he would serve th e public in te re s t b e t te r by o ffering
             him self as a w itness to Lord J u s tic e Taylor's enquiry, ra th e r than by invoking
             th e com plaints pro ced u re which is principally concerned with police discipline.

             I will be glad to h ear from you with                           s a g re e m e n t to this course.

       ^t>    C ecil*
There are two issues in            letter which I would be grateful if
you would examine.   The first is the most unfortunate incident in his
road,  involving   a traffic  accident  and about which I have had
correspondence with Merseyside Police, which has not been resolved to
his satisfaction.

He has also raised with me the issue of the conduct of the police at
Hillsborough and I would be grateful if you would agree to look at this
independently of the Taylor and Geoffrey Dear enquiries as you will be
regarded as independent of Government and Constabulary, both of whom
are clearly involved in having taken crucial decisions, which led to
the horrific events at Sheffield.

              D ear

              Thank you for your l e t t e r of 19 April about the disastrous ev en t a t Hills­
              borough. There are as you rightly point o ut very many f a c e ts to t h a t te rrib le
              incident and many words have been w r itte n and spoken about it which may turn
              o ut to have been quite unfounded and m istaken. To know the tru th , we m ust I
              think a w a it the o u tc o m e of Lord J u s tic e Taylor's enquiry.

              You a re e n title d under th e Police and C rim inal Evidence A ct, 1984 to lodge a
              form al co m p lain t alleging m isconduct by a police officer or officers in the
              course of th e incident a t Hillsborough, if you are so minded. To do so you
              m ust f ir s t reco rd your co m p lain t with th e Chief O fficer of the South Yorkshire
              police, whose address is;-

                                                      Snig Hill
                                                      SHEFFIELD
                                                      S3 8LY

              H owever, you may like to consider w h eth er justice and th e public in te r e s t
              m ight not be equally or b e t t e r served by your offering yourself as a w itness to
              Lord J u s tic e Taylor's enquiry, since you seem to have had a good view of th e

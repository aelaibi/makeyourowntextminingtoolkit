              On Saturday        15th April         1989    (150489),       I was     engaged on duties               in

               c o n n e ct io n w ith the    s u p e rv is io n of traffic          routes        in c onnection with

               the FA Cup Semi          Final      between Liverpool           and N o t t i n g h a m Forest at

              i-jills bo r o ug h , She f f i e 3.d .

               I a t t e n d e d a briefing      of all       Offic e r s con c e r n e d w hich          was held     at

              Wo o d h a 11 Police P ost at 0830              hours.

               I then    c o mmenced rny duties            of superv i s i n g     the    traffic         routes     to the

              N o rt h of H i 11s b o r o u g h , these      being     the Ml m o t o r w a y , the A 6 16(T ) the

              A 61 and the A 6 2 9 .         The Football         traffic      using      these         routes   consisted

              almost     e n t i r e l y of vehicl es       containing Liver po o 1 s u p p o r t e r s .

               I made    regular      visits     to O f f icers who were             placed at strateg ic              points
                                                                                                           PAGE           2
                                                                                                           S2436

on these        routes.

I n oted       that     vehicles        carrying        suppo r t e r s    began to arrive         in the area

at a bout       1000 hours an d built                  up gradually.

A bo u t    1100 h o u r s , I noted            that    vehicles were           travelling along         the

A 6 1 6 ( T ) from      the d i r e c t i o n    of M an c h e s t e r    and on reaching        the

round a b o u t at the           j u nc ti on w i t h the A61            were   having    difficulty       in

finding        the    correct      route along           the A61         towards Sheffield.

I went       to the traffi c garage at C l a y w h e e l s                  Lane and obtai n e d some

'Football         traffic'        d i r e c t i o n signs w h i c h       I placed at the        roundabout          on

the A61        and    this a l l e v i a t e d    the    problem.

About       ,1300 hours a further                problem began            to deve l o p at this        same

location.            T ra f f i c a pp r o a c h i n g along     the A616(T5         became    heavy and a

queue       began to form,           approximately            two hund r e d yards         long,    back      from

the     roundabout.

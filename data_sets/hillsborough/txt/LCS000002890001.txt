SUBJECT: 12th. September, 1989




i.      Int.roduct.iop
11       I have previously reported discussions about transferring
         the Help-Line to the voluntary sector.      A copy of my
       ” original paper is appended.
1.2     The Trustees of the Disaster Fund have agreed to make funds
        available for the Helpline as follows:-

                                                   £
        1/10/89 to 31/3/90: Volunteer Expenses:        20f-001D
                            Telephone:                  7,000_
                            Admin:                      6,000

        1/4/90 to 31/3/91:   Volunteer Expenses:       40,000
                             Telephone:                15,000^
                             Admin:                    12,000

 1 3    The original proposal was that we would act as a charitable
        conduit for these funds to pass them on to the South Sefton
        Health Authority in support of the Walton Hospital Relatives
        Support Group.
 1.4    It is now proposed that we actually take on the management
        of the Helpline, using the funds from the Trustees o
        appoint a Co-ordinator, and providing an organisational
        framework for the service.
 1.5     I am only prepared to respond to such a proposal if three
         conditions can be met.
         1.5.1.    Cast-iron assurances can be given as detailed at 2
                    below.
         1 5 2.    It is clearly understood that our involvement is
                    temporary, with an independent charity established
                    as soon as possible to whom this work can be
                    devolved.
         1.5.3.    Some mechanism can be found by which the Council
                    can be re-imbursed for the cost of my time
                    involved in this exercise.

Organisation:
4.1   We need to prepare a trust deed for an independent
      Helpline and submit it as soon as possible to the
      Commission.  Mersey RHA have prepared one for me to
      check.
4.2   We need to pull together a committee to oversee this
      work.   Suggested membership would be myself, '
                                 (Diocesan Board of Social
      Responsibility )     ,   -- ^ 1— ^ (Catholic Social
      Services) Carol Wilkinson (Assist ant Director,
      Liverpool Social Services) and someone from the
      Relatives Support Group.                   is already
      involved with the Group ana wouxa mane a useful
      addition to the Committee, providing a link with the
      Executive Committee.     This group would eventually
      become the Trustees of Helpline.

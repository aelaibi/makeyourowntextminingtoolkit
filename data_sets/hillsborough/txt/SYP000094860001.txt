Dear Peter

HILLSBOROUGH DOCUMENTATION

Thank you for your fax of 16.46, on 16 March 1999. I think both drafts are admirably brief and to the
point. As Ms ADLINGTON is kind enough to give us until 22 March 1999 to reply, I think we should
reply first thing on 22 March. That will give us time to reflect on whether we wish to amend our
response. No doubt Ms Adlington will fire off a reposte immediately she gets your letter.

Yours sincerely




Ian Daines
Assistant Chief Constable

     Dear Ian

     Hillsborough Stadium Disaster 1989
     Documentation Issues/Judicial Reviews

     Here aie drafts o f responses to the two letters from the HFSG.

     I look forward to hearing from you with any comments.

     One point which I should have made when we spoke relates to the costs o f these proceedings.

     When estimating the costs T did make the point that 1 was budgeting for a two day hearing and if it
     does now transpire that we are involved for five days then there will be a very substantial hike in the
     figures. If I had to allow for an additional three days o f Leading and Junior Counsel, as well as
     solicitors attendance, then allowing for a demand also for higher Brief fees (ie, the sum which
     Counsel charge for taking the case) 1 would expect to add £! 5,000 00 to pievious figures.

     Yours sincerely

                      Dear Miss Adlington

                      Adlington -v- Murray & Duckenfield
                      Documentation     _______ _


                      Further to my fax o f 15 March 1999 the complete hard copy o f youT letter arrived on 16
                      March 1999,


                      Firstly, 1 reiterate that if the Court orders the production of any documentation The Chief
                      Constable will comply with the Court Order


                      Secondly, I have some trouble in reconciling the balance o f your letter with the position
                      previously reached in relation to documentation. To reiterate


                      1,          Whilst the DPP was considering whether to intervene in the prosecutions the policy o f
                                      The Chief Constable in accordance with guidance from the CPS was not to release any
                                      documentation to any party.


                      1           Before the DPP decision was announced on 18 December 1998 you had applied to the
                                      Court for a Witness Summons directed to ACC lan Daines to produce a large number
                                      o f documents as evidence at the committal hearing.


                      3.          It was I think originally suggested that production should be ordered at some time
                                      Other than the hearing but this contention was not pursued




                                                                                                         4   7 00 1   F‘ft G E . 0 0

                  4_       In spite o f The Chief Constable’s indication that he would consider the position in
                               relation to the release o f documents once the DPP’s decision was to hand you
                               proceeded with your Application on 21 December 1998 - the first working day after
                               the DPP decision - and both you and ACC Ian Daines were represented by Counsel.


                  5.       I was not present at the hearing but as I understand it your Counsel spoke for quite
                               some time and it may well be that during his address the Stipendiary Magistrate made
                               remarks about what documentation might or might not be produced,


                  6.       However, when Counsel for Mr Daines spoke she put forward the argument that much
    ^                      if not all o f the materia! which you were seeking would not amount to admissible
                               evidence in the hands o f Mr Dames,


                  7.       Subsequently the hearing was adjourned. At this stage I am not entirely clear whether
                               this was for want o f time or to give you the opportunity o f considering the argument
                               put forward but at all events no attempt has ever been made to resume the hearing.


                  8.       Subsequently The Chief Constable offered to provide access to documentation and
                               exhibits on terms which there is no need for me to reiterate here


                  Your letter appears to ignore the history as set out above. To summarise-


                  1.       The Chief Constable will produce to the Court any document which he is ordered to
                               produce.


                  2.      ■ The offer to provide copy documentation etc as set out in my letter o f 30 December
                               1998 remains open.


                  3.       If’despite the above you believe that there is anything to be gained by proceeding
                               a Witness Summons then you should re-instate the Application previously issued wiuc/;
                               currently stands adjourned.




                                                                                           I! 1 1   £84   7001   P A G E . 004

                        Thank you for your fax o f 15 March 1999


                        At present I do not have any documentation in relation to the above Application although I
                        understand that it has been lodged and that consideration will be given to it either before or
                        after next week’s hearing.


                        I would not expect The Chief Constable to have an interest in the Application relating to the
                        DPP.

                 The hearing due to start on Monday will now include not only applications from the officers to join
                 in and support our JR o f the SYPA but also their applications (I am not yet sure whether for leave
                 only or substantive) to JR the DPP decision not to intervene in the prosecutions, The time for the
                 hearing has been extended to five days. At present I am assuming that our part will be dealt with first
                 and that previous arrangements should stand. I will let you know if that changes.

                 In the meantime 1 attach two iiirther letters from HFSG. One deals with further evidence relating to
                 the Judicial Review and the other harks back to the issue o f documents. I would like to discuss the
                 response to both letters if you can spare the time. I will be out o f the office tomorrow

                 Yours sincerely.

   Dear Mr Metcalf

   A d lm e to n v M u r r a y : A d h n fto n v D iic k e n fte ld
   M lm se o fctem im M L o n

   I refer to previous correspondence in the above matter. Please confirm by 22nd March that
   the Chief Constable will produce to us, alternatively to the Leeds District Magistrates’ Court,
   on a voluntary basis the following documents and tilings:

   1.        The originals o f ail statements o f witnesses upon whom w e have indicated we intend to
             rely in committal proceedings or whose statements will form a supplementary bundle.
             (Please see Schedule 1), N o doubt you will have been informed that at the hearing in
             Leeds on 21st December, the Stipendiary stated that it would be sensible for SYP to
             produce the originals o f statements at this stage He stressed that the committal
             proceedings should be orderly, Further, it may be the case that the Defence will agree
             Some statements thereby obviating the need to call live evidence. Obviously, we will
             need the originals o f any such statements.

   2.        The originals o f the documents and exhibits listed in Schedule 2, Please note that
             these were refcnred to in Schedule D o f the draft application for a Witness summons
             Again, on 21st December, the Stipendiary commented that there must be many
             documents in Schedule D that come within the definition o f “material and relevant57for
             the purposes o f section 97 o f Magistrates3 Courts Act 1980. You will see that these
             documents and things are all o f primary and obvious relevance to the issues in the case.


             You have been provided with copies o f the Informations and submissions presented to
             the Leeds court m July 1998 and w e do not believe it is necessary to explain item by
             item why each o f those sterns is relevant. You have also have seen out detailed

                submissions about the cases against both defendants in the file o f material produced in
                the course o f the Binding dispute, about which we have already written to you today
                twice. However, you will appreciate that plans, photographs, charts, video recordings
                and tape recordings are all material evidence in criminal proceedings if they are
                relevant to the issues. It will obviously be necessary for the court to see the layout of
                the ground as it was at the time in detail- Item 189 is relevant to the question o f how
                many supporters were still to be admitted when the perns became crowded. Standing
                Instructions, operational orders and briefing notes as specified are all relevant to the
                knowledge o f the defendants o f facts central to the charges. The radio tapes items
                211-220 are likely to contain very important evidence as to what was said about the
                circumstances in which gate C was opened.

            The originals o f no tes/documents referred to in officers7 statements and
            correspondence, (Schedule 3) The notes and reports referred to in this schedule are all
            likely to contain contemporaneous and highly materia? accounts o f the disaster. They
            will also contain assertions made by Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray about what. Mr
            Duckenfield did and said between 2,30 and 5pm in connection with the circumstances
            in which gate C became open, and about the disaster generally They will also contain
            assertions o f material evidential value from other officers present at the disaster and/or
            the briefings. All these assertions are likely to be admissible and material evidence
            under section 24 o f the Criminal Justice Act 1988, or in the case o f the defendants,
            evidence o f admission by either defendant. These notes will be admissible in           ce
            even if the witnesses who make them are not called, subject to a discretion to . • < e
            possessed by the judge at trial.

            The originals o f the exhibits o f PC Trevor Bichard called TR I-4 and footage from the
            clubs’s cameras positioned in the area o f gate €„ together with originals o f
            photographs referred to in Detective Sergeant Carr’s report dated 25* April 1989

            Please note that if you fail to respond satisfactorily by 22 W‘ March I will treat this as a
            refusal under Section 97 Magistrates Court Act 1980, and take my own course about
            applying for witness summonses. You will remember that when we previously
            corresponded about "voluntary disclosure**, you sought to impose highly expensive
            and onerous conditions on us, in contrast to the open and willing co-operation v ■■
            received from the CPS Bearing in mind the history o f altered and concealed
            statements in this ease, you will see that we do not feel able, as a general rule to invite
            the court to accept the integrity o f copies, where the originals are available
            Furtheirnore, although the best evidence rule barely survives in the law o f evidence, all
            courts prefer to act on originals rather than copies, where possible

    Yours faithfully

           This statement (consisting o f 2 page(s) each signed by me) is true to the best o f my knowledge and b elief and 1
           make it knowing that, if it is tendered in evidence, I shall be liable to prosecution if I have wilfully stated anything
           which I know to be false or do not believe to be true.

            Signature ......................................................................................................   Date:


           I am Ian Daines, Assistant Chief Constable, South Yorkshire Police. Amongst my many other

           duties is a responsibility to assist the Chief Constable in the handling of matters arising out of the

           Hillsborough Stadium Disaster of 15 April 1989. I transferred from Northumbria Police to South

           Yorkshire Police on promotion to the rank of Assistant Chief Constable in July 1996. I had had no

           previous dealing with Hillsborough Stadium Disaster issues and took on this responsibility in 1997.



           The Chief Constable has an archive of material relating to the disaster which is kept at Heeley

           Police Station, Windsor Road, Sheffield. The archive is kept in a room which measures

           approximately 17 feet square. It is stocked from floor to ceiling with Hillsborough Stadium Disaster

           material. This material includes maps, sketches, photographs, questionnaires, statements, video

           tapes, transcripts of Lord Justice Taylor's Public Enquiry and of the 1991 Inquest, copies of the

           Taylor Report and many other documents concerned with the disaster and its aftermath. These

           documents have arrived in the archive from a number of different sources. Some are generated

           by South Yorkshire Police staff, some were generated by the 1991 Inquest (and are held on behalf

           of the Coroner). Some were generated by the West Midlands Police who assisted Lord Justice

           Taylor in his Judicial Enquiry and later prepared papers for the Director of Public Prosecutions.

           The archive contains perhaps as many as one million pieces of paper.



           The HOLMES computer is used as an index to some of the material which is held in the archive. I

           cannot prove the authenticity of any document in the archive in the sense that I cannot say that the

           document is an accurate record of what it purports to record nor that it was made by the person

           who is purported to have made it.

      I have received a summons from the Leeds Magistrates Court, dated 26 April 1999, which was

      issued in connection with the prosecution by Ann Addlington of David Godfrey Duckenfield and

      Bernard Dean Murray. The summons requires me to produce a large number of documents to the

      court on the 24 May 1999. I have caused staff to look most carefully for the documents described

      in the summons. In some cases they have found only copies, I will now go through the schedules

      of documents and each item individually. The summons requires me to produce documents as

      listed in Schedules 1 to 4. There is no Schedule 1 so I shall progress immediately to Schedule 2.



      I am required to produce a document described as “Plan by witness Holdsworth”, number 36, I

      have located a photocopy of a plan of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Hiiisborough Ground. It

      bears the name Roger Holdsworth and a signature which could be that of Mr Holdsworth



      I am required to produce a series of plans “prepared by Brades for the Judicial Enquiry", document

   numbers 91, 92, 93, 94 and 95. I produce plans which purport to be prepared by Ralph Brade and

   Associates, Consulting Engineers. The plans are in the form of transparencies as used by

   draughtsmen and engineers but they bear no signatures. I also produce paper copies of these

   transparencies.



      I am required to produce documents “Prepared by the West Midlands Police for the Judicial

      Enquiry”, these are document numbers 96, 97, 99, 100, 101, 103 and 106.

      Document 96 appears to me to be a photocopy, it is not dated but has printed on it the words

      “Surveyed 27/4/89" and purports to be singed by D R Goodhail.

      Document number 97 also appears to be a photocopy, it shows no date and contains the words

      “Surveyed 26/4/89”, it purports to be singed by D R Goodhall.

      Document number 99 is not signed but contains the following printed information "D.L.R. 5.1.90.”

      Document number 100 is not dated but contains the information “Surveyed 25/4/89”, it purports to

      be signed by D R Goodhall.

      Document number 101 purports to be signed by D R Goodhall and contains the information

      “Surveyed 21/4/89"

      Each of my references to survey dates is text printed on the documents and is not hand written.

      Each of the documents contains no date to indicate when the author signed it.

      Document number 103 purports to be singed by D R Goodhall but with no date of signing. There

      is printed text that it was “Surveyed 21/4/89 - 25/4/89".

      Document number 106 is not signed or dated by hand. On it is printed “D.L.R. 5.1.90.”



      I am required to produce a “Plan of the Hillsborough Stadium prepared by Brades for the Judicial

      Enquiry”, document 107. The document is a piece of paper, A3 size, which shows the Sheffield

      Wednesday Football Club Hillsborough Ground. It is not signed or dated and itself contains no

      information as to its author. Written in pencil in the top right-hand comer is “D2532”. On the

      HOLMES computer index D2532 refers to a plan of the Hillsborough Stadium.



      I am required to produce the “BBC plan showing position of cameras and cameramen", document

      108. I have located a document which purports to contain that information, it appears to be a

      photocopy. It is not signed or dated and contains no information regarding its author. At the top of

      the page it is possible to decipher that it appears to be a fax from the BBC, timed at 1539 hours on

      17 April 1989.



      I am required to produce a number of albums of photographs, document numbers 149, 150, 151,

      In this context I should explain that the albums contain no signatures to prove their authenticity or

      the author of the photographs. I have attached to each album of photographs a “Schedule

      Description”, prepared by West Midlands Police officers, each describes what is shown in the

      photographs as perceived by the West Midlands Police officers compiling the schedule description

   i am required to produce "Briefing notes of Superintendent Murray re. Football Association Cup

   Semi Final 15 April 1989”, document number 199. I have located a photocopy which is a typed

   document headed “Briefing Sheet - FA Cup Semi Final - 15/4/1989", it is preceded by a hand

   written memo which is signed in the name B D Murray. The text is followed by some pages of

   hand written notes. Attached to these documents is a photocopy of the HOLMES computer print

   out which shows that the HOLMES entry was made on 20 April 1989 and was printed out on

   21 April 1989.



   t am required to produce “a plan and chart", document number 203. I have located two documents

   which appear to be those required. I think both are copies and neither is signed nor dated and

   contains no information regarding the author.



   I am required to produce “Superintendent Murray’s hand written log of events 15 April 1989”,

   document number 207. I have located a photocopy headed “DPP DOC 207”. The document is in

   three pages with no indication of the author. The first page purports to record matters at 0800 and

   the log ends at 1421.



   I am required to produce document numbers 211, 212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 21 9, 220. I

   have retrieved the documents described each of which is headed DPP DOC and followed by each

   of the numbers 211 to 220. The documents are all typed with no handwriting on them.



    I am required to produce one item in Schedule 3. This is described as “Document identified in

    Inspector Harry White’s report” (R215A), dated 6/5/89, note from Inspector Sewell written in red ink

   on the operational briefing notes”. I have located the report dated 6 May 1989 by Inspector White,

   which states that he is in possession of his briefing notes and that they are endorsed by Inspector

    Sewell in red ink. There is no record that Inspector White’s briefing notes were e v e r brought into

   the archive of material. I cannot locate them.

      I am required to produce documents under Schedule 4. I am required to produce the "Original of

      exhibits of PC Trevor Bichard called TB1-4". I have located four video tapes each of which is

      labelled. The first is labelled TB1 and with no other handwriting. The second is labelled TB2 and

      is in a box on which there is some writing. The third is labelled TB3 with no other writing The

      fourth is labelled TB4 with no other writing. I am required to produce “Footage from the clubs

      cameras positioned in the area of Gate C". This appears to refer to a video tape labelled RJH2,

      Gate C, Leppings Lane, A to G turnstile. Neither the tape nor box in which it is contained are

      signed or dated.



      I am required to produce "The originals of photographs referred to in Detective Sergeant Carr’s

      report dated 25 April 1989”. The file list identifies each album of photographs referred to in the

      report. The first column is the album identification, the second column is the Schedule of this

      summons under which it is produced and the third column is the document number of those

      produced under Schedule two. The fourth column is the number of photographs in each of the

      albums produced in the schedule. Two of the photograph albums produced under this schedule

      are labelled “UST”, this stands for Underwater Search Team and these photographs purport to

      have been taken by Constable Garner.

Dear Alan

Witness Summons Documentation

At the hearing last Monday Alan Jones QC agreed to provide us with copies o f the report o f
Malcolm Edmonson that they were working from (schedule 3 item 2) and also the briefing notes for
Superintendent Greenwood (schedule 3 item 3.5)

 Copies o f these items have been provided and I enclose them herewith.

 So far as Malcolm Edmondson is concerned my understanding is that we are required to produce the
 extract which is referred to in his second statement referenced as R139A. In fact I think it might be
 sensible to have at Court the foil transcripts in the 3 black folders but these need not be covered in
 the statement as my understanding o f the Summons is that it deals only with the extract referred to
 above.

 So far as Roger Greenwood is concerned the document produced again appears to be effectively a
 statement dated 20 April 1999 giving his recollections o f what was in his briefing notes. It does not
 appear to be the notes themselves. This appears to be identical to what is in the archive although my
 recollection is that our copy was a Homes printout rather than a typed up statement. If that is
 correct then there is nothing to be produced under this heading although again it might be a good
 idea to have our copy o f the statement at Court.

message put cn by F Division earlier that week.        FI were informed the

incident became EL 2 on the extended incident.

By 1300 hours there was a lot of congestion on the roads and the motorway

but by 1415 hours this was cleared and all motorway routes had very little

football traffic.     I remanber everyone canxnenting that things were going

well and that traffic seesned to have arrived much earlier that last year.

Most of the routes to the ground were clear by 2.30 pm there was certainly

no hold up for Liverpool supporters the only hold ups had been through
                  O
Attercliffe and City where the Notts Forest supporters had cctne.   I renanber

Superintendent Brougham caning over the radio about 2.40 pn saying that all

the routes to the ground were clear and motorcyclist wanting to go in for

meal early.   They were told to stay out mainly because it was said that

meals would not be ready.     In any case they carried on checking their cwn

 sections until about 2.55 pm.     As far as I am concerned there were no

unusual problems with traffic it went very well.    The motorcyclists and all

 officers engaged in .getting people to the ground did a first class job.

 There was never any suggestion that fans were held up because of problems cn

 the roads.

 All the time we had been monitoring Hillsborough Ground Control cn channel

 25 via a repeater set in the Incident Rocm.     I recognised Police Sergeant

         as the main operator at the ground and an occasions Superintendent
                                      -    2   -                         q >
Murray used the radio.     Up to 2.15 pn the reception was good and there were

no unusual problems.      Then for the next 20-25 minutes the radio was very

poor it broke up and. there was a loud whistle.             It was obvious they were

having problems with the radio in fact I remember saying they were having'

problems over Force Control radio and we asked if they needed oannunications

people to help.     Ground control said they were present and trying to fix it.

After that time it was much improved back to the good reception we had heard

earlier that day. This would be about 2.40 pm and after that the reception
          *
was clear., I heard Superintendent Marshall saying to match control that he

had a large crowd outside the Leppings Lane end of the ground.             I think he

asked for more horses but I’m not sure whether match control got in touch

with any.      I do not know that they asked us via Force Control for a vehicle

with a PA system to go to Leppings Lane because there was a large crcwd

pushing and they feared someone would be hurt.             We did send a car but when

he got there he radioed back that there was a car with a PA already there.

It was more and more apparent listening to the match control radio that the

crowd a Leppings Lane were causing extreme problems for the officers.                 I
                o
remanber them asking Inspector Sev*ell to send more men and I ronember

sanecne asking for the kick off to be delayed.              I den't knew who that was

but the reply from match control was that there was no chance as one of the

i-ppiiik   was already out.   It must have been about 2.50 pm by this time.

 Superintendent Marshall then asked for the gates to be opened as he feared

 for the safety of all the people at Leppings Lane.            He said they were being

 crushed and he thought a wall was going to go.                  Superintendent Murray

 himself     replied to this and    said       there was   a   need to check tickets.

 Superintendent Marshall then repeated his plea and I cculd hear the crowd in

 the background who were obviously very noisy and unruly.               I think other

 persons asked far the gate opening but I can't say who.            I was convinced

 what I heard that people would be hurt so I askad my staff to ccntact mate!

 control and ask them if they needed any ambulances.             They said not at tha

 /
stage but we were to keep monitoring the radio.   Hiis was about 3.00 pm at

the time and I heard Police Sergeant Goddard in ground control say 'open the

gate we do not want anyone killed'.   X am sure these were more or less his

exact words.   This was done and after a minute Superintendent Marshall told

Match Control that the situation outside had eased ana that the gate was

closed.

I could then hear the officers at the ground saying persons were injured and

I told Police Constable Rook in the Operations Roam to ring the ambulance

service and warn them of possible major casualties.   Within a minute we were

requested to get a fleet of ambulances and vte did via the ambulance service

vdio were still on the telephone to Police Constable Rook.   I then activated

the Major Incident plan and we started to activate the casualty bureau etc.

                                     B r i e f i n g Notes          DPP DOC 200
On Friday the 14th April after the main briefing to Inspectors and above held at

Hillsborough I then briefed Inspectors and above whe were to be under my command at

 the semi-final match,


I told them that in particular from experience I could forsee two problems arising.

One was the question of supporters from the Leppings Lane terrace being hauled up by
                  f-
fellow supporters into the West Stand at half time thus creating over capacity in

the West Stand.   The second problem I related was based on experience of the semi­

final match between the same teams last year in that it was quite forseeable that

there would be a large element of Liverpool supporters who by whatsoever means would

be purchasing tickets for the Spion Kop.      This problem had been evident last year

and that cordoning Police Officers had cane under threat to personal safety.            It was

agreed with the Inspectors concerned that we would go to the Spion Kop after my

briefing and examine the area and how it could best be protected, and reserved for

Liverpool supporters.


I specifically spoke in clear terms about behaviour of Liverpool supporters based on

my previous experience.   I told Officers that in m y view generally--'speaking if

things were going well for Liverpool supporters crowd management should be

reasonably well achieved, however should things in any way not go well them then

they had proved extrsnely difficult to contain and moods would easily change.            I

related an incident to them which I had witnessed occurring at a Sheffield Wednesday

- Liverpool match during the period of the Coal Industry dispute.          It was at that

time as I recall that the then kop was over capacity with Sheffield Wednesday

supporters and out of necessity sane were transferred to a pen on the Leppings Lane

terracing (the Liverpool supporters occupying the West End of the ground including

the terracing).   A pen was left empty between Liverpool supporters and those

Sheffield Wednesday supporters that had been transferred and a line of Officers was

put in the vacant pen between the supporters.          On transferring the Sheffield

Wednesday supporters the Liverpool supporters went wild attempting to scale the

fencing in an attempt to get to the Sheffield Wednesday supporters.          Itwas necessary
                                                                1                      1277
                                        - 2 -                    D o c u m e jitN o . 2 q q    CONT’ O




for some Officers to draw truncheons to contain the    Liverpool supporters.


I reminded Officers of the need for extreme care in    searching supporters and to bear

in mind the dangers of weapons such as Stanley knives, knives     Or sharp bladed

articles which may be retained in a persons pocket.     Officers were also told of the

dangers of weakening a police line by taking away supporters either under arrest or

for the purpose of ejecting them thus reducing the police cover and thereby

potentially putting their colleagues at greater risk to their personal safety.
           .   '   O   '   -   .

Above all I told the Officers that i n m y view a successful operation hinged directly

on the alertness of Constables and that if they were to be seen as not being awake

to potential problems then supporters would readily take advantage of the situation.

On conclusion of the briefing I then went to the Spion Kop with Inspectors to

discuss specific plans in relation to the segregation of Liverpool supporters (of

whom it may be expected that there would be more than last year) from Nottingham

Forest supporters on what was an area with a capacity for containing 21,000 people.


I also reminded Officers that some Liverpool supporters had climbed over the

Leppings Lane perimeter fence at the end of last years semi final game and that

manpower had been arranged to prevent a repetition (I also discussed separately with

Inspector Darling the normal plan to funnel players and officials into the player's

tunnel at the end of the game).


After the main briefing on Saturday morning I personally briefed the Serials having

duties on the Spion Kop in terms of the plans for the segregation of the Liverpool

supporters and also outlined to them those points that I had discussed on the Friday

as to behaviour of Liverpool supporters, searching, alertness and the undesirability

for arrest/ejection which would weaken a police cordon and thus put their colleagues

at risk.                                               __________________________

Chief Inspector B e a l , Chief Inspector Creaser and Inspector Calvert, all of whom

have had extensive experience of policing the Hillsborough stadium, were not present

at my briefing on Friday but on Saturday I discussed with them the particular

problems, as outlined previously, I had foreseen as would affect their areas of

responsibility.


At the conclusion of m y briefings I confirmed that everyone was familiar with their

allocated duties.   *

 Dear Ian

 Hillsborough Stadium Disaster 1989
 Judicial Review___________________

 Further to our telephone conversation yesterday I enclose a copy o f Louise Varty’s Advice.

 You will see that she identifies a number o f deficiencies in the conduct o f the proceedings but
 concludes (at paragraph 13) that the High Court would be reluctant to interfere with the exercise o f
 the Magistrates’ discretion.

 She goes on to consider the tactical aspects of the matter but obviously this consideration is
 coloured by the view which she has formed o f the law

 It is one thing to take a case to Judicial review when vital interests are at stake and the unanimous
 advice from your lawyers is that you have a good case It is quite another in circumstances in such
 as these where the legal position is by no means certain and it is difficult to argue that the vital
 interests o f the force are at stake.

 I have in any event taken it from our discussion yesterday that you do not wish to pursue any further
 challenge to the Witness Summons but if you form any different view on reading the opinion or wish
 to discuss matters further please let me know.

 As to the costs o f dealing with the Witness Summons I do not really want to put you in a position
 where you are apparently defying the Court by refusing to appear unless conduct money is tendered.
 On the other hand I do perceive an injustice in the South Yorkshire Police being put to the expense

                                                                           chi.057-0009.let. daines. 1805.pcm. doc
                  ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD & MURRAY



                                    ADVICE



1.        On 10th May 1999 at a hearing at Leeds Magistrates Court before the
Stipendary Magistrate, Mr Cadbury, a witness summons was issued against Ian
Daines, Assistant Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police, to produce a
variety of documents with regard to the private prosecution of Duckenfield
and Murray.


2.    Earlier on 26th April 1999 the Magistrate had issued a witness summons
in respect of a narrower category of documents which essentially comprised
maps, photographs, recordings and the Defendants’ briefing notes.        The
Magistrate explained on 10th May 1999 that he had issued the summons on
26th April despite there being an adjourned application for a witness summons
in respect of documents including those the subject of the April witness
summons because there could really be no argument but that the documents in
question
       *
         should be produced.
      ♦



3.    The documents which form the subject matter of the witness summons
issued on 10th May 1999 fall into 4 broad categories :


(a)   standing orders ;
(b)   briefing notes made by senior officers which came into existence prior
to the game ;
(c)   logs and recordings ;
(d)   notes made in respect of the Chief Constable’s briefings following the
disaster.


4.    I am asked to consider (a) whether the summonses issued by the
Magistrate are legally defective and (b) whether tactically there would be
merit in seeking a review of the decisions made by the Magistrate.


5.    The application on 10th May 1999 proceeded on the basis that section 97
of the Magistrates’ Court Act 1980 governed the application and not section
97A. Indeed, with this in mind the Magistrate had arranged for committal
proceedings to be opened on 24th May for the purposes of dealing with
documentation and then to be adjourned to start on 5th July.


6.    Before a Court can require a witness to produce a document or item
pursuant to section 97 of the Magistrates Court Act 1988 he must be satisfied
that it is “likely to be material evidence” in the case. It is clear from a long
line of authorities including Reg v Greenwich Juvenile Court ex p Greenwich
LBC [1977] 76 LGR 99, R v Reading Justices ex parte Berkshire CC [1996] 1
Cr App R 239, R v Derby Magistrates’ Court ex p B [1996] 1 AC 487 and
H(L) [1997] 1 Cr App R 176 that this means that the document sought must be
relevant to the issues in the case and there must be a real possibility that the
document will be admissible in evidence.


7.    Essentially, the Prosecution relied upon section 24 of the Criminal
Justice Act 1988 as the means by which they would seek to render admissible
in evidence the documents in question. They endeavoured to establish the
relevance of the documents either on the basis that it was clear from the
document itself that it would be relevant ( in the case of standing orders and
the like ) or by reference to other documents which referred to the documents
sought and indicated the nature of their contents.


8.    The approach of the Magistrate can be summarised as follows :


(a)   Standing orders were likely to be admissible pursuant to section 24 of
the Criminal Justice Act 1988 and were likely to be relevant with regard to the
respective Defendants’ states of mind at the material time.


(b)   Briefing notes made after the event were likely to be admissible
pursuant to section 24 of the CJA 1988 and relevant because they would
contain recollections of events.


(c)       Items which recorded events at the time, such as the Racal tapes, would
be admissible in their own right as recording events as they unfolded.


(d)       Documents outlining communication arrangements would be admissible
pursuant to section 24 of the CJA 1988.


Further, it appears that with regard to the summons issued on 26th April
1999, the Magistrate considered that plans, photographs, recordings and the
Defendants’ briefing notes for 15th April 1989 were obviously relevant and
admissible.


9.        The Magistrate’s approach to the application was “broad brush”. He
paid little heed to our submissions on a number of detailed points. These
included the following :


(a)       To what specific issue in the case is the document relevant ? Most of
the Prosecutions submissions as to relevance were woolly.
      ♦




(b)       All computer generated documents could only be admissible if they
complied with section 69 of PACE.


(c)       Section 24 could not be used to render admissible that which would not
be admissible if the evidence were given directly by the witness. So second
and third-hand hearsay could not be rendered admissible by this means.


(d)       To the extent that the post-match briefing notes contained admissions on
the part of the Defendants they would be unlikely to be admissible. Firstly,
the Prosecution were unable to identify specific admissions. Secondly, the
author of the notes could not be identified. Thirdly, section 24 could not be
used to render admissible an admission which would not be admissible under
section 76 of PACE (see section 24(3).


10.       The Magistrate took the view that to the extent to which the Court had a
discretion to exclude evidence, or there was an obligation to comply with
specific requirements such as section 69 of PACE, or that editing out of
inadmissible material was concerned, those matters could be dealt with at the
committal proceedings themselves after the documents had been produced and
when the Defendants could make submissions as to admissibility. He plainly
considered that as the test for admissibility concerned “a real possibility” that
the documents would be admissible, the Prosecution did not have to jump
every hoop as to admissibility at this stage.


11.       The Defendants did not attend the hearing. I submitted that in the event
that there was doubt as to the admissibility of documents, they should be
allowed the opportunity to attend to make submissions.           The Prosecution
asserted that the Defendants were on notice of the hearing, had been provided
with a Schedule of the documents sought, and had declined to attend. The
Magistrate appeared to endorse what was being said about the Defendants
being on notice of the hearing. In any event, he clearly considered that there
was no necessity to hear from them.
      *




12.       I have dealt with a number of applications of this sort.           More
commonly, they involve applications made against local authorities for social
services files. In practice there are limits to the extent to which the third party
against whom the summons may be issued can credibly argue hard the
admissibility of documents given that the third party is not a party to the
proceedings.


13.       In general terms, I think that the approach adopted by the Magistrate as
to disclosure can be justified. He excluded from the ambit of the summons
those documents which the Prosecution knew little about and could not show to
be directly relevant (Schedule 2 195 and Schedule 3.1).          I do have some
concerns that his approach to the other documents was less than rigorous in
properly considering whether the documents would ever become admissible in
evidence.   However, as the test is whether there is a “real possibility” as
distinct from a “real probability” that the documents will be admissible, I
suspect that the High Court would be reluctant to interfere with his decision.


14.   Section 24 of the CJA 1988 together with the potential admissibility of
admissions does give the Prosecution a platform for asserting admissibility.
Further, they could just about demonstrate relevance by reference to other
documents in their possession.       To this extent the application could be
distinguished from the authorities I have mentioned above.


15.   In general terms, much of the documentation sought by the Prosecution
is not prejudicial to the Defendants. The volume of documentation sought is
much reduced from the scope of the original application and the extent of
documentation sought by way of the the two witness summonses is now rather
more manageable.


16.   Unfortunately, it would appear that the post-match briefing notes are
potentially prejudicial to the Defendants. I am afraid there is little that we can
do about this. I doubt that an attempt to review the Magistrate’s decision to
issue *a summons in respect of these documents would succeed for the reasons I
have outlined above.       If an attempt were made to try to review the
Magistrate’s decision which were to fail, no doubt HFSG would make
particular capital from the Force’s efforts not to produce the documents and
the lengths to which the Force was prepared to go to to try to withhold them.
This would only serve so as to draw attention to the documents in question and
be used to fuel HFSG’s conspiracy theories.


17.   Thus far the Force has acted in a wholly responsible manner with
regard to these documents.      Initially HFSG’s request for documents was
unduly wide. Further, despite our requests, they have chosen not to bother to
seek properly to justify why they want or need documents until they get to
Court. We have put before the Court our concerns about the Prosecution’s
applications for documents and the Magistrate has taken a decision having
heard our concerns. In my view this is as much as the Force can reasonably
be required to do. The Defendants appear to have taken a decision not to
attend the hearing on 10th May. They have not sought to make submissions as
to admissibility. There is a limit to the extent to which we can fight their
battles for them and further as to the extent to which it is in their interests or
ours to be seen to be doing so. Given that orders have been made to produce
documents, there can be no come back on the Force with regard to their
disclosure.


18.   While the tactics of seeking a review of the Magistrate’s decision are
very much a matter for the Force, there are obvious potential pitfalls in
seeking a review which would have less than good prospects of success. We
know just how HFSG would portray the motives of the Force. As a matter of
tactics, unless the Magistrate pretty obviously got it wrong, there is much to be
said for just complying with the order.        In circumstances in which the
Magistrate’s decision can be queried, but it is unlikely that it would be
overturned, there are very good reasons for just living with it.


19.   I turn to some of the residual matters.      As my instructing solicitor
pointed out on Monday, the Magistrate appears to have made arrangements for
the committal proceedings so as to get round the effect of section 97. Section
97 is drafted such that documents can only be ordered to be produced at the
committal hearing itself. The Magistrate’s arrangements for a staggered start
to the hearing have the effect of circumventing this. It could be argued that
this gives the lie to the Prosecution’s application for documents and indicates
that they have been fishing rather than seeking documents admissible in
themselves to assist in proving their case. However, I am not confident that
this argument would find favour on a review application of the Magistrate’s
decision. This method of listing is often used where a witness summons is
issued to produce documents in the Crown Court and in the High Court. It is
recognised that it has obvious practical benefits whenever documents are to be
produced to avoid the wasted costs of adjourned proceedings.           While an
argument could be advanced on a judicial review application about the
Magistrate’s decision to stagger the hearing, it would not transform our
prospects of success.


20.   I have very real concerns about what the Magistrate did on 26th April.
Whatever the strength of the Prosecution’s application in respect of the
documents in question, there was an adjourned application outstanding.
Technically, I think that that decision is reviewable, but I doubt that the effect
of taking the matter to the High Court would result in any different eventual
outcome.


21.   Finally, I am asked to consider the question of witness expenses. By
virtue of section 97(5)(c) a witness summons cannot be enforced unless “a
reasonable sum has been paid or tendered ... for costs and expenses”.
Interestingly, there is no specific provision requiring the payment or tender of
costs or expenses before the summons is issued or served. This stands in
contrast to the Civil Procedure Rules 34.7 which specifically require that sums
should be offered or paid at the time of service of the summons. The White
Book commentary on the CPR at 34.7.1 gives an account of the old provisions
and a commentary on the new. By virtue of the Practice Direction which
       \


supplements CPR Part 34 3.3, the sums to be paid to a witness served with a
witness summons in respect of loss of earnings are to be based on the sums
payable to witnesses attending the Crown Court. Interestingly, pursuant to
regulation 15 of the Costs in Criminal Cases (General) Regulations 1986
(which apply to both Crown and Magistrates’ Courts), the allowances paid to
witnesses expressly excludes members of the police force. No doubt this is on
the basis that it is part of their duties to attend Court to give evidence.


22.   I rather suspect that by reference to the Costs in Criminal Cases
(General) Regulations, the Prosecution could properly argue that it would be
inappropriate to pay costs and expenses in respect of a witness summons issued
against a police officer.
23.   It is certainly far from clear cut that we can require the payment of
costs and expenses.     Indeed, in the light of the Costs in Criminal Cases
(General) Regulations I suspect that we would not get them. As a result of the
way in which section 97 of the Magistrates Court Act 1980 is framed, the
question of payment of costs and expenses would have to be argued in the
context of enforcement of the summons rather than of issue or service, and
there are obvious reasons why this is unattractive as a prospect. On balance I
do not think that it would be worth taking the point.


24.   I hope that I have considered all matters of concern, please do not
hesitate to telephone me if I have not.

  which I know ,m he false or do not helieve to be true.

 I am Ian Daines, Assistant Chief Constable, South Yorkshire Police. Amongst my many other

 duties is a responsibility to assist the Chief Constable in the handling of matters arising out of the

 Hillsborough Stadium Disaster of 15 April 1989. I transferred from Northumbria Police to South

 Yorkshire Police on promotion to the rank of Assistant Chief Constable in July 1996. I had had no

 previous dealing with Hillsborough Stadium Disaster issues and took on this responsibility in 1997.



 The Chief Constable has an archive of material relating to the disaster which is kept at Heeley

 Police Station, Windsor Road, Sheffield. The archive is kept in a room which measures

 approximately 17 feet square. It is stocked from floor to ceiling with Hillsborough Stadium Disaster

 material. This material includes maps, sketches, photographs, questionnaires, statements, video

 tapes, transcripts of Lord Justice Taylor’s Public Enquiry and of the 1991 Inquest, copies of the

 Taylor Report and many other documents concerned with the disaster and its aftermath. These

 documents have arrived in the archive from a number of different sources. Some are generated

 by South Yorkshire Police staff, some were generated by the 1991 Inquest (and are held on behalf

 of the Coroner). Some were generated by the West Midlands Police, who assisted Lord Justice

 Taylor in his Judicial Enquiry, and later prepared papers for the Director of Public Prosecutions.

 The archive contains perhaps as many as one million pieces of paper. The HOLMES computer is

 used as an index to some of the material which is held in the archive.



  I cannot prove the authenticity of any document in the archive in the sense that I cannot say that

 the document is an accurate record of what it purports to record nor that it was made by the

  person who is purported to have made it.

  The archive is an historical record of a tragedy. I am required to produce to the court a large

  number of documents and I do so. I would ask that these documents are returned to me at the

  conclusion of these proceedings so that I can preserve the integrity of the archive. Also I would

  ask that these documents are used only for the purpose of these proceedings as they relate to a

  traumatic event in the lives of many people.



  I have received a summons from the Leeds Magistrates Court, dated 26 April 1999, which was

  issued in connection with the prosecution by Ann Addlington of David Godfrey Duckenfield and

  Bernard Dean Murray. The summons requires me to produce a large number of documents to the

  court on the 24 May 1999. I have caused staff to look most carefully for the documents described

  in the summons. In some cases they have found only copies. I will now go through the schedules

  of documents and each item individually. The summons requires me to produce documents as

  listed in Schedules 1 to 4. There is no Schedule 1 so I shall progress immediately to Schedule 2.



  I am required to produce a document described as “Plan by witness Holdsworth”, number 36, I

  have located a photocopy of a plan of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Hillsborough Ground. It

  bears the name Roger Holdsworth and a signature which could be that of Mr Holdsworth.



  I am required to produce a series of plans “prepared by Brades for the Judicial Enquiry”, document

  numbers 91, 92, 93, 94 and 95. I produce plans which purport to be prepared by Ralph Brade and

  Associates, Consulting Engineers. The plans are in the form of transparencies as used by

  draughtsmen and engineers but they bear no signatures. I also produce paper copies of these

  transparencies.



  I am required to produce documents “Prepared by the West Midlands Police for the Judicial

  Enquiry”, these are document numbers 96, 97, 99, 100, 101, 103 and 106.

  Document 96 appears to me to be a photocopy, it is not dated but has printed on it the words

  “Surveyed 27/4/89” and purports to be singed by D R Goodhall.

  Document number 97 also appears to be a photocopy, it shows no date and contains the words

  “Surveyed 26/4/89”, it purports to be singed by D R Goodhall.

  Document number 99 is not signed but contains the following printed information “D.L.R. 5.1.90.”

  Document number 100 is not dated but contains the information “Surveyed 25/4/89”, it purports to

  be signed by D R Goodhall.

  Document number 101 purports to be signed by D R Goodhall and contains the information

  “Surveyed 21/4/89”.

  Each of my references to survey dates is text printed on the documents and is not hand written.

  Each of the documents contains no date to indicate when the author signed it.

  Document number 103 purports to be singed by D R Goodhall but with no date of signing. There

  is printed text that it was “Surveyed 21/4/89 - 25/4/89”.

  Document number 106 is not signed or dated by hand. On it is printed “D.L.R. 5.1.90.”



  I am required to produce a “Plan of the Hillsborough Stadium prepared by Brades for the Judicial

  Enquiry”, document 107. The document is a piece of paper, A3 size, which shows the Sheffield

  Wednesday Football Club Hillsborough Ground. It is not signed or dated and itself contains no

  information as to its author. Written in pencil in the top right-hand corner is “D2532”. On the

  HOLMES computer index D2532 refers to a plan of the Hillsborough Stadium.



  I am required to produce the “BBC plan showing position of cameras and cameramen”, document

  108. I have located a document which purports to contain that information, it appears to be a

  photocopy. It is not signed or dated and contains no information regarding its author. At the top of

  the page it is possible to decipher that it appears to be a fax from the BBC, timed at 1 5 3 9 hours on

  17 April 1 989 .

  I am required to produce “Briefing notes of Superintendent Murray re. Football Association Cup

  Semi Final 15 April 1989”, document number 199. I have located a photocopy which is a typed

  document headed “Briefing Sheet - FA Cup Semi Final - 15/4/1989”, it is preceded by a hand

  written memo which is signed in the name B D Murray. The text is followed by some pages of

  hand written notes. Attached to these documents is a photocopy of the HOLMES computer print

  out which shows that the HOLMES entry was made on 20 April 1989 and was printed out on

  21 April 1989.



  I am required to produce “a plan and chart”, document number 203. I have located two documents

  which appear to be those required. I think both are copies and neither is signed nor dated and         &

  contains no information regarding the author.



  I am required to produce “Superintendent Murray’s hand written log of events 15 April 1989”,

  document number 207. I cannot locate the original and I produce a copy of “DDP DOC 207” from ^

  the file sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions. The document is in three pages with no

  indication of the author. The first page purports to record matters at 0800 and the log ends at

  1421.



  I am required to produce document numbers 211, 212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219, 220. I              ,

  have retrieved the documents described each of which is headed DPP DOC and followed by each

  of the numbers 211 to 220. The documents are all typed with no handwriting on them.



  Document numbers 211 - 220 are typed transcripts of parts of the Operations Room master audio

  tape, which I am required to produce a      s   >0 under the summons issued on 10 May 1999

  (Schedule 3, item 5). I am in possession of three folders of typed material which appear to be

  transcripts of various telephone and audio channels of the master tape. The transcripts purport to

  be drawn from the afternoon of 15 April 1989. There is no indication of who prepared the

  transcripts.

  I am required to produce one item in Schedule 3. This is described as “Document identified in

  Inspector Harry White’s report” (R215A), dated 6/5/89, note from Inspector Sewell written in red ink

  on the operational briefing notes”. I have located a report dated 6 May 1989 by Inspector White,

  which states that he is in possession of his briefing notes and that they are endorsed by Inspector

  Sewell in red ink. There is no record that Inspector White’s briefing notes were ever brought into

  the archive of material. I cannot locate them.

  I am required to produce documents under Schedule 4. I am required to produce the “Original of

  exhibits of PC Trevor Bichard called TB1-4”. I have located four video tapes each of which is

  labelled. The first is labelled TB1 and with no other handwriting. The second is labelled TB2 and

  is in a box on which there is some writing. The third is labelled TB3 with no other writing. The

  fourth is labelled TB4 with no other writing. I am required to produce “Footage from the clubs

  cameras positioned in the area of Gate C”. This appears to refer to a video tape labelled RJH2,

  Gate C, Leppings Lane, A to G turnstile. Neither the tape nor box in which it is contained are

  signed or dated.



  I am required to produce “The originals of photographs referred to in Detective Sergeant Carr’s

  report dated 25 April 1989”. I have tabulated the albums below. The first column is the album

  identification, the second column is the Schedule of this summons under which it is produced and

  the third column is the document number of those already produced under Schedule two. The

  fourth column is the number of photographs in each of the albums produced in the schedule. Two

  of the photograph albums produced under this schedule are labelled “UST”, this stands for

  Underwater Search Team and these photographs purport to have been taken by Constable

  Garner.

  I have received a further summons dated 10 May 1999 also returnable at Leeds Magistrates Court

  on 24 May 1999, which requires me to produce further documents and exhibits described in

  Schedules 2 and 3. Schedule 2 requires me to produce No 192 “South Yorkshire Police Standing

  Instructions for the Policing of Football Matches” and I produce a photocopy of a document of that

  name, dated August 1985.. No 192a requires me to produce Appendix L to the above document

  and I produce a photocopy of this appendix. No 192b requires the production of a report from        ^

  Assistant Chief Constable W Jackson headed “Safety of Sports Grounds SYP Standing

  document, sent to the Sheffield Office of the West Midlands Police Enquiry Team.



  At No. 200 I am required to produce the “Briefing Notes of Superintendent Greenwood re. FA Cup ^

  Semi Final 15 April 1989”. No such notes exist. However, I do produce an original typed signed

  paper prepared by Superintendent Greenwood, dated 20.4.89 giving his recollection of his briefing.

  In Schedule 3, I am required under item 2, to produce a (tape) “extract identified in C I Malcolm

  Edmundson’s Report (R139), dated 29/4/89”. I have read his report and can find no reference to a

  tape extract.



  Item 3 to Schedule 3 relates to documents identified in an internal South Yorkshire Police Report

  compiled by DS Carr. Item 3.1 requires production of the Ground Control Log. The only such

  document identified is the one already produced in accordance with Schedule 2, item 207, of the

  summons issued on 26 April 1999. Item 3.2 requires production of the Command and Control Log

  and I produce a photocopy of a computer print out of that log.

  CCB 17 April 1989 and CCB 19 April 1989 from the Chief Constable’s Briefing with Operational          -

  Staff. I produce copies of notes of De-brief Meetings from the above dates, the Chief Constable

  being present at the first two, but not at the third. There are no signatures on these notes and no

  identified author.



  Items 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6 require me to produce the briefing notes of

  Chief Superintendent Duckenfield, Superintendent Greenwood and Superintendent Marshall. I

  have previously been required to produce these via the summons of 26 April 1999, Schedule 2

  No.s 197 and 198 and Schedule 2, No.s 200 and 201 of this summons and have done so.



  At item 4 of this schedule I am required to produce a compilation video, ref. MRE1. I produce the

  master tape of this video compiled by the West Midlands Police and in U-Matic format, which will

  require a U-Matic player for it to be viewed. Nothing with this video identifies the person who

  compiled it.

            Dear Ian

            Hillsborough Stadium Disaster 1989
            W itness Summons

            I enclose a further letter from Ann Addlington and draft reply.

            1 appreciate that you have authorised me to allow the costs point to lapse but this most recent letter
            indicates the possibility that we may be receiving a series o f such letters and possibly having a series
            o f Hearings over the admissibility or otherwise of the items sought .

            As to the balance of the letter it seems that having got their Summons HSFG are now forgetting ail
            previous correspondence and assuming that we will simply provide any documentation requested on
            demand.

            In relation to the computer generated documentation I really very much doubt whether anybody
            could sign the certificate requested. Indeed I have to confess I am not entirely sure whether there
            was a completely self-contained computer system held by South Yorkshire Police at that time or
            whether this was part o f an overall system under the control o f the Home Office. Even if the former
            is the case some o f the documents will have beer, generated by the West IVfidlands Police presumably
            using their own computer equipment.

                Dear Mr Metcalf

               Adlingtan v Duckenjield and Murray
                Witness Summons

                2.      Thank you for your letter o f 18th May 19991 do hope that you will be able to give us
                        proper information about the equipment needed to play the tapes at court on Monday
                        On the matter o f Mr Dailies’ costs, w e shall o f c-oursa pay such costs as are determined
                        by the court to be payable under section 97.

                2.     We wrote to you last summer asking for addresses o f a number o f police officers who
                      m w e might wish to interview or call as witnesses. The matter was left in abeyance
                        pending the outcome o f the CPS review o f the case. We attach now an amended list
                        o f officers whose addresses w e seek. We should be grateftil to receive this
                        information, which must be easily accessible to the Chief Constable, as soon as
                        possible.
                                                                   *

                3       As a result o f our continuing investigations into the case we request that you please
                        supply the statements R516A and B, the second and third statements o f retired Police
                        Sergeant Higgins. These should have formed part o f the statements which were placed
                        m the House o f Commons library at the request o f the Home Secretary but these two
                        were not there. They should therefore have been d isclo se already. Please confirm
                        that you -will supply these without the formality o f a witness summons.

               4,       We also wish to see transcripts o f interviews conducted by the West Midlands police
                        with Policc Constables Smith and Illingworth. We know o f the existence o f these
                        statements from a transcript o f interview between the West Midlands police and
                        Superintendent Marshall. We attach a copy o f the relevant page o f that interview.
                        The contents o f these written interviews will obviously fell within section 24 o f the
                        Criminal Justice Act 1982.

            5         W e also need to have copies o f the original statement made by Bernard Murray, which
                      w e have in a computerised form, unsigned, dated 3* May 1989 with the reference
                      R232. The statement w e have was obviously prepared by m operator o f the word
                      processing system from a handwritten or typed original. The undated statement o f Mr
                      Duckenfield (R230) is signed by him. W e *31 need to produce the original o f that
                      document to the court. Please confirm to us that there will no difficulty in supplying it
                      for the committal proceedings.

            5.        Mr Dames may think it would be sensible to bring the documents mentioned in
                      paragraphs 3,4 and 5 above on Monday where if necessary, w e can serve &-witness
                      summons upon him, in order to save the cost and inconvenience o f a separate hearing,

            7.        On the lO* May M ss Varty argued on behalf o f the Chief Constable that at number o f
                      computer generated documents that w e were seeking would only be admissible in
                      evidence i f section 69 o f die Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 was compiled
                      with- This is obviously a technical and formal matter„ since no-one has ever suggested
                      in previous enquiries dhat the Holmes computer system was defective. Accordingly,
                      w c shall seek to deal with this matter by a certificate drafted in accordance with
                      Schedule 3 paragraph t o f the 19S4 A c t After w e have decided what documents will
                      be presented to the court w e shall draft a certificate and ask the appropriate person to
                      $ign it.

            S.        Please indicate who oceupied “a responsible position in relation to the operation o f the
                      computer in 1989", who should sign the certificate as required by paragraph 8(d). The
                      more inconvenient way o f complying with section 6$ is to call a witness live to give
                      the necessary evidence. I f w e had to take such a course, it seems to us that DS Carr
                      would be the appropriate person to summon to court. Wc should be grateful in due

                             ADDLINGTON AT HFSG.




     Dear Miss AddlingLon

     Hillsborough : Witness Summons

     Thank you for fax o f 19thMay.


                                                                                        ?
     You will now have received my fax relating to the tape playing equipment.           -




     In relation to costs I shall be gratcftil if you will confirm that you personally as the Prosecutor will

     be responsible for paying such costs, if any, as are found to be reasonable within the meaning of

     Section 97 in respect o f Mr Daines complying with the Witness Summons. Obviously, as with any

     Solicitor, I would expect you to ensure that funds are available to you to meet such costs but it

     seems to me that as you are the Prosecutor only you can give the necessary' undertaking.




     In relation to point 2 o f your likter key qlients are prepared to write to the Officers named (at their

     last known address in the case of those who have retired) asking if they consent to have their

     addresses disclosed.      If consent is received they will be disclosed.




     In relation to points 3,4 and 5 I note that these relate to Witness Statements or transcripts o f

     interview rather than documents o f the type which we have been concerned with in the present

     Witness Summons. I was not present on 21s' December but my understanding is that the

     Magistrate accepted our Counsel1s point that somebody’s statement could not be a document

     which could be produced by another person under Section 24, If that point is to be revisited then

     it will no doubt need to be argued.

         As to points 7 and S my Clients state that they are not in a position to identify a person who could

         provide the certificate to which you refer It might be that you would be better to approach the

         Home Office for assistance on this front.

Dear Sir/Madam

Statement of Evidence Regarding Documents to be Produced at Court

I am required by the Leeds Magistrates Court to produce various documents to the Court at
10.00 am, Monday 24 May 1999. I shall attend Court and produce all of those documents
which I have been able to locate. I have prepared the attached witness statement which
explains those documents of which I have found originals, those of which I have found
copies and those which I have been unable to find.

This afternoon the South Yorkshire Police Authority is meeting to consider paying the legal
expenses of Messrs Duckenfield and Murray. They and their solicitors will be at the meeting,
as will as Ms Adlington, the prosecutor. At that meeting I shall hand to the prosecutor and
defendants a copy of my statement with this covering letter.

These arrangements have been made pursuant to the discussion between Peter Metcalfe,
my solicitor and the Clerk to the Court.

Yours faithfully

 Dear Sir

                                 Adlington v Duckenfield and Murray

 As you are the custodian o f all original statements relating to the Hillsborough Disaster, it has
 not been possible for me to ascertain which statements comply with the requirements o f
 section 102 Magistrates’ Court Act 1980. Copy statements in my possession are, in the main,
 computer generated. You have previously refused witnesses access to their original
 statements quoting CPS guidance. It is understood that these will be produced to the court if
 ordered, and if available.

 At this stage it is imperative that I at least have copies o f the original signed statements so that
 I can fulfil my duty to the court and the defence. In the circumstances I should be grateful if
 you would provide me with copy signed statements o f those persons listed in the attached
 schedule.


 Yours faithfully

Dear Ms Adlington

Hillsborough Stadium Disaster 1989 - Request for Information

I refer to your letter dated 4 June 1999, which I have considered on my return from leave
today. I have a number of Hillsborough related enquiries to deal with so please bear with me
if I do not cover all of the issues. I am replying by fax as quickly as I can but by the time you
receive this I shall be out of the office until the morning of Thursday 24 June 1999.

You ask for original statements of 24 people in a schedule which begins with
Roger Holdsworth and ends with Bernard Dean Murray. I have taken legal advice on your
request and I am prepared to consent to it if you will provide me with an assurance that this
is your only request for signed statements. You will recall that previously you had asked for
many copy statements but we could not come to an agreement about that. If your request is
limited to these 24 statements then I can release them without charge or further conditions. I
would also be obliged if you can assure me that the statements are for use in connection
with the committal proceedings and will be copied to both defendants.

I refer now to your letter dated 11 June 1999, in which you ask me to provide you with the
dates and places of death of Mr Lang and Mr Creaser so that you can obtain copy death
certificates. I have not yet enquired whether we hold that information either in paper form or
on computer record, obviously such information can be regarded as sensitive and I would be
obliged if you could assist me by telling me why you wish to obtain a copy death certificate. I
presume it is in some way connected to the committal proceedings but I would welcome a
clear explanation.

Yours sincerely

  I refer to your letter o f 21st June in response to mine o f 4th June. As stated in my letter o f 4th
  June, it is imperative that I have at least copies o f the original signed statements so that I can
  fulfil my duty to the Court and to the defence. Computer generated copy statements o f all 24
  witnesses have been served on all parties. I will o f course serve all parties with any copies
  which you now provide.

   I confirm that at the moment I do not envisage that w e will need any more statements for
   committal proceedings. That situation may o f course change after committal.

   In relation to the Mr Lang and Mr Creaser, I need to obtain copy death certificates for the
   committal proceedings. Their statements have been served as part o f the committal bundle
   and formal proof o f death will be necessary to render them admissible. I am sure that your
   Pensions department will have the dates and places o f death.


   Yours sincerely




   Ann Adlington

Dear Ms Adlington

Adlington V Duckenfield and Murray

I refer to your fax of 23 June 1999. I will ask Mr Hepworth to provide you with copies of the
original signed statements to which you refer. I have spoken to him and he tells me that
there are some difficulties. For example there are statements by more than one person in
one of the names to which you refer. I will ask Mr Hepworth to contact you direct about
these matters and to forward the statements to you. I note your assurance that you do not
envisage the need to ask for any more statements for the committal proceedings.

Mr Lang died on 5 September 1990, at Barnsley.                  Mr Creaser died on 3 June 1996, at
Barnsley

My solicitor, Peter Metcalfe, has forwarded to me your letter to him of 4 June 1999. Your
letter to Mr Metcalfe included a copy of your letter to Mr Croston, Crown Prosecution Service.
At paragraph 56, of your letter to Mr Croston you say that you have sent a copy of your letter
to the Police Complaints Authority and to the former Coroner. Your letter quotes widely from
the Chief Constable’s briefing notes. I produced that document to the court at Leeds as
required by a witness summons. You have now furnished it to other people including the
former Coroner who is no longer a public servant. I do not think you should have done that
without the permission of the court. I do not propose to make an issue of this case but if
there are further such cases I will be obliged to take the matter further.

Yours sincerely                                                                                               /*9 • ? ^

            Dear Ian

            Hillsborough Stadium Disaster 19S9:Dociimentation

            Thank you for sending on copies o f the letters from Richard Manning and the HFSG. I have also to
            consider the earlier letter (27/S) from Richard Manning to you which arrived during my absence on
            holiday. As to this I can only say that, I agree fully with your reply o f 4 June which you kindly copied
            to me

            There is also yet, a further letter from the HSFG o f which 1 enclose a copy, omitting the enclosures
            except for the copy letter to George Croston

             I'aking these items in turn:-

                       1■       HSFG request for copies of signed Statements

            Original CPS guidance was that statements should not be copied to HFSG without a determined
            attempt to obtain the consent o f the maker. However, by their letter o f 3 L 12 98 the CPS altered that
            guidance. They said in that letter that because o f the public importance of the case and the need for
            justice to be seen to be done copies o f Statements should be disclosed to HFSG without the consent
            of the maker

            By that time you had already effectively agreed to do this and indeed to go further,, in the sense of
            agreeing to provide also copy documents, when we made the offer, by letter o f 30,12 98, to provide

                                                                                                                Ian Daines Esq
                                                                                                      Assistant Chief Constable
                                                                                                        South Yorkshire Police

                    copies o f items on the basis o f the conditions set out i.e. (principally) payment, explanation of
                    relevance and copying to the Defence.

                    Of course that offer was never taken up and is described in the HFSG letter o f 3/6 to George
                    Croston (copied herewith) as extortionate

                    The question therefore is whether simply to stick to the terms put forward in out letter o f 30.12.98
                    or whether to take the view that the limited number o f Statements now requested specifically for
                    service on the Defence are in a special category and can be provided without payment or reference
                    to relevance. Essentially this is a matter for you but I am anxious that you should not appear to be
                    cutting across CPS guidance and if we actually have signed Statements from those named then I
                    would be inclined to provide copies o f these making clear that they are being provided as an
                    exception. However 1 would have thought you would require at the very least an undertaking that
                    these will be copied to both Defendants and perhaps also confirmation that this is the only request


    • , .
                    for Statements which will be made in relation to the committal,
                                 .
                    I await your instructions on this point

                        2.   Request from Walker Morris

                    Like you I am puzzled by the request relating to documents supplied to the Magistrates Court We
                    were expressly told by the Magistrate that copies o f the documents would be made available to all
                    parties if requested and I do not understand why this is needed However you have dealt with this

                    As to their further request there will undoubtedly be copies o f the two transcripts in the archive and
                    although these will be quite bulky { I guess perhaps 5,000 pages for both transcripts together) it
                    might not be too difficult or expensive to have them copied. Certainly they are documents which are
U                  in the public domain because the transcripts were freely made available to the Press as well as the
            v      parties at the time and I have no doubt that HFSG have their own set given that they were
'wS'&A             represented. As tar as cost is concerned the expense of obtaining transcripts from whatever source is
      t^-r         going to fall on the South Yorkshire Police Authority in any event although obviously you will wish
                    to consider whether it will fall on the correct budget if you provide copies direct

                    I he essential point, is that in my view there is no objection in principle to providing these copies as
Asa             , 1 requested. They are certainly not in the same category as other documents and Statements in the
                    archive to which there, has never been general public access

                    3, The Letter of 4 June from HFSG with attached letter to CPS

                    This is unexpected only in the precise focus. We were aware that the CC briefing notes were
\A w                to contain material which would aggravate the HFSG but they appear have focused particularly on
    ^\ I            the suggestion that the notes reveal “knowledge” by Senior Officers of the blocking off o f the centre
 W W <              tunnel at previous semi-finals, i have not attempted to analyse whether these conclusions really can
     ^              be drawn from the briefing notes; I suspect that selective quoti ng would support all sorts o f different
                    arguments but without going into detail it does not seem to me that this letter really calls for any

             arguments but without going into detail it does not seem to me that this letter really calls for any
             response, save perhaps to point out that they appear to have made an illegal use o f documents
             provided to them for the purpose o f dealing with the committal and to question why they have not
             seen fit to copy their correspondence at this stage to the Stipendiary Magistrate and, more
             importantly, to the two Defendants.

             I recommend that I should respond accordingly.

             In normal circumstances 1 would telephone you to discuss the foregoing but as you are on leave I am
             not sure when you will see this letter. I will therefore await contact from you before taking any
             further action

£        Your Ref PCM SB.CHI.57-9

         4 June 1999


         Dear Mr Metcalf

         I enclose a copy o f a. letter and annexes which I have sent to Mr Croston at the CPS I refer
         yon particularly to paragraph 56. The contents o f the letter affect you and the .Assistant Chief
         Constable, and bear upon custody o f the archive. I invite you to make any observations about
         t he contents o f the letter to Mr Croston and copy them to me. Mr Daines’ comments in
         relation to the matters raised at paragraphs 44 and 45 would be helpful.

         The substance of the Representations o f2 4 “l August and 24,h September is contained in the
         material we sent, you between December and February last and which was relevant to the
         funding issue and the discretion o f the Police Authority. It is therefore unnecessary for us to
         enclose them unless you request a copy. I assume you do not wish to see the selection o f the
         edited and unedited statements because, o f course, you are familiar with them.

         Yours sincerely




         Ann Adliiv'ton

          Dear Mr Croston,

          AdUington v D nckenfield and M urray

          1          Thank you for your letter o f 27,h May 1999. I appreciate your offer o f assistance
                     There are indeed a number o f requests that the prosecution wishes to make o f the
                     Crown Prosecution- Service as we approach the two weeks o f committal and abuse o f
                     process hearings starting on 5th July,

                     The prosecution invites the CPS'.

                               (i)       to provide us with a copy o f the advice given by leading counsel in
                                          1990 on which the Director o f Public Prosecutions acted in decidi ng
                                          not to institute criminal proceedings;
                               (ii)      to provide us with a copy o f the final West Midlands Police Report;
                               (iii)     to make a statement setting out what material it had received and
                                         considered relating to the practice of closing the tunnel under the West
                                          Stand at the Hillsborough stadium, leading to the Leppings Lane
                                          terraces;
                               (iv)      to give guidance under section 3 (2) o f the Prosecution o f Offences Act
                                          1985 to the Chief Constable o f the South Yorkshire police force, that
                                         he should make the whole o f the Hillsborough archive available to the
                                         prosecution

Fresh evidence

3      The first three o f these requests are directly relevant to the issue o f abuse o f process
       which the defence will raise before the magistrate. The fourth is primarily relevant to
       the presentation o f the case generally I raise these issues in the light o f the enclosed
       material that the Assistant Chief Constable o f the South Yorkshire produced to the
       Leeds District Magistrates Court on 24* May. There are three sets o f typed notes,
       dated 16th 17th and 19th April 1989, marked Annex A, B and C, respectively, recording
       the content o f meetings held by the Chief Constable, Mr Peter Wright with senior
       officers o f his force. These notes contain important evidence, the contents of which
       we believe were not disclosed to any o f the previous inquiries.

4      We became aware that meetings had been held on those dates from the statement o f
       DS Carr o f 25th April 1989, (Annex D)which was one o f the South Yorkshire police
       statements placed in the House o f Commons library in April 1998 at the insistence of
       the Home Secretary after the “Scrutiny” o f Lord Justice Stuart-Smith. At a hearing
       before Mr Cadbury at Leeds on 10th May this year the South Yorkshire police,
       represented by counsel and solicitor, objected to the production o f the notes, and
       indeed to all the material w e listed in an application for a witness summons, on the
       ground that it did not fall within section 97 o f the Magistrates Courts Act 1980.

5      The magistrate disagreed. He accepted the argument o f the prosecution that the
       records o f these meetings were likely to be material within the requirement o f section
       97, because statements in those meetings were likely to be admissible in their own
       right., as direct evidence, under section 24 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988;
       alternatively as admissions made by the defendants. As directed by the magistrate,
       these records and other material were produced at court by Mr Daines, Assistant Chief
       Constable, on 24th May

Foresefiahdity an d the previous practice o f closing the tunnel

6      The notes o f the meetings demonstrate that the senior officers o f the South Yorkshire
       police were well aware o f the practice o f closing the tunnel when pens 3 and 4 were
       hill See the remarks o f the Chief Constable at page 3 o f Annex B:

       “Top o f the tunnel solid with horses - procedure that happened last year.”,

To which the Chief Constable responded;

       “The fact that encourages me is that we have a team o f officers who have seen
       and done it all before.”

Murray was present at this meeting. For example, at page 6, Chief Superintendent
Mole said, about 1989;

       “What did we do about the tunnel and people seeing it and going for it?

       Murray - “Total lack o f information apart from Marshall’s information,”




Mr Duckenfield then suggested that the tunnel was shut off as a matter o f practice
when the tunnel becomes full:

       “The Order has officers listed, and once that central tunnel becomes full the
       officers control that and it is shut, off and people directed to the wings.”

The Chief Constable observed;

       “Whilst the north stand problem was recognised, the problem associated with
       gate. C and the opening o f gate C and the control of movement o f people once
       they were going through gate C, there was no action taken on that You were
       well aware that there were contingencies to deal with the filled stand, ie the
       shutting o f the tunnel.”

On 19th April, page L it is noted that there was nothing in the operational order or
briefings about closing the tunnel but:

       “Officers remembered (particularly Chief Inspector Creaser) that in previous
       years the above has been done by the use o f horses and static police lines
       (referred to as Supt Freeman’s policy).”

No-one present at. these meetings expressed any ignorance o f this policy and practice.

         The Taylor In q u iry's approach to the 1988 issue

         11    At Lord Taylor’s Inquiry, a different account was presented by the South Yorkshire
               police For example. Superintendent. Marshall, who is shown as present at the 16* and
                17th April briefings in annexes A and B, was asked about the matter by Mr Woodward
               QC, representing the South Yorkshire police, on 3 1st May 1989, transcript pages 45F-
               46E Mr Marshall had o f course been inside the ground as a Superintendent in 1988

                        “There has been some suggestion that there was at a period during the 1988
                        event a blocking off o f the tunnel to go to the terrace. Do you follow? A Yes

                        Do you know anything about that having been done? A N o . . . I was not
                        aware that it was done.

                        Q If it was done? A I was not even aware o f the necessity for it to be done,

                        Q Lf there had been a situation that had given rise to someone deciding to block
                        off the tunnel involving the use o f Police manpower whilst you were there,
                        would you have expected to have heard about it? A Yes

                        Q. Was there a chain o f communication that would have enabled you ultimately
                        to have been told about it after the game? A. Yes”

         12    Paragraph 171 o f the Taylor Interim Report records evidence that at league games a
               policy was followed o f filling pens one by one, but;

                        “At cup semi-finals, a different approach was adopted. All the pens were
                        opened from the start and the policy was “to let the fans find their own lever5.
                        This phrase was repeated over and over again by police officers at the Inquiry.”

         13     Paragraph 181 records that when the central pens became full in 1988, entry to the
                tunnel was blocked off by police shortly before kick-off. However, paragraphs 230-
                231, contain Lord Taylor’s central findings;

                        “230. Since pens 3 and 4 were full by 2.50 pm, the tunnel should have been
                        closed off whether gate C was to be opened or not. The exercise was a simple
                        one and had been earned out in 1988. All that was necessary was for a few
                        officers to act as a cordon at the entrance to the tunnel and divert fans
                        elsewhere Unfortunately, the 1988 closure seems to have been unknown to
                        the senior officers on duty at the time. It did not figure on the debriefing notes
                        Therefore, it had no influence on the planning for 1989.

                       231.    Planning apart, however, it should have been clear in the control room
                       where there was a view o f the pens and o f the crowd at the turnstiles that the
                       tunnel had to be closed. If orders had been given to that effect when gate C
                       was opened, the fans could have been directed to the empty areas o f the wings
                       and this disaster could still have been avoided Failure to give that order was a
                       blunder o f the first magnitude.”

14     Lord Taylor’s findings accurately record the evidence. The policy to block off the
       tunnel, spoken about by Supt Nesbitt, Supt Duckenfield, the Chief Constable, and
       known as “Supt Freeman policy”, is fundamentally different to a policy o f “find their
       own level.” That phrase does not appear in the briefing notes o f 16th, 17th and 19th
       April.

15     However, the question whether senior officers knew that the central pens had been
       closed off by police officers in 1988 was not, apparently, a major concern at the
       Taylor Inquiry, for the reason given in paragraph 231. The Taylor Inquiry continued,
       at paragraph 232, to describe the failure to close off the tunnel (whatever the officers’
       knowledge o f 1988) as “a blunder o f the first magnitude”.

The Interim Report o f the West M idlands Police and the 1988 issue

16     This question did, however, become important later. As you know, w e found a copy
       o f the Interim Report o f the West Midlands Police in the Public Record Office last
       October. Section 17, part (v), deals with the 1988 issue. It says;

              “Firstly a number o f supporters who attended the same game in 1988 stated the
              tunnel access was at one point subject o f a blockade by police Officers. If this
              happened it is not documented and was not a decision made by the Senior
              Officers present at the 1988 game. Enquiries have found just one retired
              officer who recalls this happening. He, it must be said, is vague in his
              recollection but the probability is that some officers acting on their own
              initiative turning [s/c] supporters away having recognised that part o f the
              terrace was full        Without doubt the fact that access to the tunnel was not
              controlled aggravated the overcrowding in pens 3 and 4 and is a significant
              factor in the deaths o f the 95 people.”

The 1990 accounts o f M urray and M arshall as to the 1988 issue

17     The interview with Murray o f 25th June 1990, conducted by the West Midlands Police,
       a copy o f which has been supplied by you to us, demonstrates the increased
       importance o f this issue in the minds o f those conducting the investigation At page
       22, Murray answers a question about the closure o f the tunnel in 1988 (“by one form
       or another”) by saying he had no knowledge:

              “I’ve never know [src] the tunnel be closed under any circumstances       it’s
              never come to my attention, the, that the tunnel’s been closed, at any of the
              matches I went to, particularly the 1988 (000088) semi-final/ ’

18     Similar questions, with similar answers, were put to Superintendent Marshall. (Neither
       Duckenfield nor Greenwood answered questions, but Greenwood put in Ms own
       statement, which did not deal with this issue.)
19    The answers given by Murray and Marshall are, o f course, quite inconsistent with the
      accounts given in the briefing notes o f 16th, 17th and 19th April 1989.

The CPS and the 1988 issue

20    In his interview with Lord Justice Stuart-Smith o f 2BdDecember 1997, Detective
       Superintendent Fosterof the West Midlands Police indicated that the questions put in
       June 1990 to Murray, Marshall etc were put after a consultation with leading counsel.
      (Mr Foster referred to “Mr Williams”, now Lord Williams o f Mostyn QC). It is
      therefore reasonably clear that leading counsel must have advised that the 1988 issue
      was important, perhaps critical, to his advice. Furthermore, a forma] witness statement
       (Annex E) dated 30* June 1990 was taken from PC Lang about the closing o f the
      gates in 1988, presumably by the West Midland Police, which would also have resulted
      from a query by counsel or the CPS.

The South Yorkshire police presentation o f the 1988 issue

21    The South Yorkshire police had themselves drawn a similar favourable conclusion as
      they prepared for civil proceedings, and had no doubt communicated it to the West
      Midlands police, I enclose as Annex F a statement by Chief Inspector Bettison (then o f
      the South Yorkshire police, now Chief Constable o f the Merseyside police), dated 12th
      July 1990, in which he too remarks,

              “The fullest information on the closure o f the central tunnel at the 1988 semi­
              final was obtained and forwarded. It was an informal initiative at junior level
              not reported to command level. It was performed exclusively by police.”

22    Mr Bettison has admitted in public since his appointment at Liverpool last October that
      he was part o f a small group o f South Yorkshire officers who were investigating the
      disaster in the Spring o f 1989. You will note from the attached statements Annex G
      that Mr Bettison has initialled the statement o f an officer who gave a short statement at
      the end o f April 1989 contradicting the assertion that horses had been used to shut off
      the tunnel, and attached his own written comments. No evidence is available that
      contradicted the other assertions made in the briefing notes The conflicting evidence
      about control by hor ses was not brought to the attention o f the CPS, nor, we believe,
      any o f the other inquiries Mr Bettison’s conclusion o f July 1990 cannot be reconciled
      with the briefing notes o f April 1989

25    It may be assumed that the South Yorkshire Police drew this matter to the atten:
       West Midlands Police, who shared the same Holmes computer system on which
       Bettison’s statement o f July 1990 was stored. The West Midlands Interim report
       indicated that, unusually, South Yorkshire police collected and supplied evidence to
       the West Midlands on some aspects o f the criminal enquiry to influence the
       investigating force's recommendations. (See last paragraph o f the Interim Report,
       page 20.)
   Mr Metcalf o f Hammond Suddards, solicitors to the South Yorkshire police, told Lord
   Justice Stuart-Smith on 11th November 1997 (Annex H) th at;

          “The only record o f the request [asking for officers5 impressions and
          comments] will be in Chief Inspector Bettison’s notes o f the meeting o f 17th
          April which I have not seen.”

   Counsel appearing for the Chief Constable at recent hearings in Leeds in relation to
   witnesses summonses offered the magistrate the explanation that Mr Metcalf was
   wrong in saying that Bettison attended the 17th April meeting. However, he was
   evidently involved in 1989 and the summer o f 1990 and came up with ajn explanation in
   July 1990, identical to that offered to the CPS by West Midlands police in the Interim
   Report, which cannot sit with the material in the fresh evidence.

  It is, I believe, obvious that the final report o f the West Midlands police will have
  emphasised and strengthened the comment '.n the Interim Report o f October 1989,
  cited above, in the light o f the evidence o f Murray and Marshall, and the statement o f
  Bettison, and will have presented to leading counsel a fairly clear evidential conclusion
  that senior officers like Murray were not aware o f the closing o f the tunnel at the 19S8
  final, or any other big game

Coroner cmd the 1988 issue

  The Coroner’s Inquest also attached significance to the 1988 issue. The Coroner had
  the final West Midlands police report. He informed Lord Justice Stuart-Smith that
  when selecting potential witnesses, he used the DPP index as his screen. The Coroner
  directed the jury at Day 75 that the senior Commanders had not been aware o f
  diversions from the tunnel by police officers in 1988, (Divider H o f the documents
  accompanying the HFSG submission to the CPS o f 24th September 1998 sets this out.)

  Mr Murray's answers to the Coroner’s questions demonstrate the evidential
  significance o f the briefing notes. He said he knew nothing o f the closing off o f the
  tunnel in 1988 until after the disaster;

          “It came to my attention someone said the tunnel was closed in 1988. I
          disputed that but if people say it was closed, it was closed !5

  Mr King, for some o f the Liverpool families, asked, on the basis o f evidence from
  supporters;.

          “Were you not aware o f the system operated by the Police in the past, that is,
          before 1989, if they so chose, o f diverting fans from, shall we say , the centre
          pens to the side pens on the terrace.

          A What system was that, sir?”
       o i u dyod            Fad t, mu                                                       Kb '3 i   BDi   irm   err




         30     Mr Murray repeated this answer twice. (Day 67, p 55F-G ) No-one outside the South
                Yorkshire police knew that a system had been described in front o f Mr Munay on 17th
                April, that he did not dispute it, and that not one officer o f the large number present
                had disputed the description o f a system.


         The significance o f the briefings notes in relation to the edited statements

         31     Our formal Representations o f 24th August and 24th September 1998 described at
                length the process adopted by the South Yorkshire police in the early weeks after the
                disaster o f excising factual material from statements o f junior officers. In particular,
                references to the 1988 closure o f the tunnel and the practice by which the Control
                Room monitored the terraces and the closure o f the tunnel was dealt with in one or
                more o f the early statements o f Inspector White, PC Woodcock, PC Lang, and PS
                Crawford. All o f the references to 1988 were then expunged.

         32     Furthermore, none o f the statements o f the senior officers, dated for the most part in
                 early May 1989 (copies o f which were placed at the insistence o f the Home Secretary
                 in the House o f Commons library in April 1998) dealt with the subject o f 1988 at all.

         33     We know that only the edited versions o f statements were sent to the DPP and the
                Coroner. This much is clear from the Master Witness List o f April 1990, and has been
                in any event admitted by Detective Superintendent Foster in a letter to the Home
                Office in the course o f the “Scrutiny”, that the edited, not the unedited, statements
                were to be used as the basis for submission to the DPP and Coroner.

         34     The comments in the briefing notes about 1988 and the established practice
                demonstrate that the most senior officer s o f the South Yorkshire police realised the
                relevance o f those matters to the inquiry. They make it impossible to argue that the
                deletions o f assertions about 1988 and the closing o f the tunnel were matters which
                could be deleted from statements as being comment, opinion, or repetition.

         The wider .'significance o f the fresh evidence

         35     These notes disclose that the senjor officers o f the South Yorkshire police were
                meeting to formulate an agreed approach as to the facts o f the disaster, before any of
                them made a witness statement, and, it appears, before they made detailed notes.
                AnnexA shows that various matters were “A greed1. For example, there were short
                very short contributions from three officers, one o f whom. Superintendent Marshall
                (who had, it appears, contrary to the general practice, made some kind o f note),
                imputed “drinking outside off-licences” to the Liverpool fans.

         36     The Chief Constable then put the following proposition to the 28 persons present,
                including 24 officers o f the rank o f Inspector or senior:

                         “So there is no evidence whatsoever of the delay in transit o f the fans. Then
                        fans arrived at the ground vicinity early enough to go in the ground but instead
                        went drinking. THIS WAS AGREED. ”

            3 7    Various other propositions were agreed, no questions critical o f police were posed,
                   and the meeting concluded with a speech by the Chief Constable in which the tactical
                   presentation o f the facts was considered

            38     The second and third meetings took place after the announcement o f the institution of
                   Lord Taylor's inquiry, after the West Midlands police had been appointed by the Chief
                   Constable to conduct an independent inquiry, and to investigate for Lord Taylor. The
                   third took place the day after the inquest bad been opened on 1S'11April, at which Mr
                   Mervyn Jones o f the West Midlands police had appeared as Coroner’s officer. Annexes
                   B and C show some discussion about safety, bat principally a similar tactical approach
                   to the investigation o f the disaster as had characterised the first meeting.

            39     The basic and obvious approach to any police investigation is to obtain statements or
                   notes from witnesses as soon as possible, so as to ensure that a witness puts dowu his
                   own honest account while it is fresh in his mind, and so that no-one can suggest that
                   his account has been influenced by the opinions, recollections and observations of
                   others. A normal, proper and honest investigation would have involved the writing o f
                   formal witness statements within a day o f the disaster Critical questions should have
                   been posed and answered in writing as to why. for example, Duckenfield had falsely
                   told so many people, including Assistant Chief Constable Jackson, that the fans had
                   broken down the gates,

            40     The briefing notes show that the South Yorkshire police did not do any of this. They
                   show that the most, important aim in the minds o f those responsible for policing the
                   event was to achieve a consensus on critical issues, with which later statements and
                   evidence would be consistent. The prosecution are in no doubt that the CPS was not
                   shown these briefing notes, nor any pocket book notes. They disclose a disgraceful
                   approach to the investigation o f a disaster which was without precedent in British
                   sport, and which demanded honesty, integrity and utter candour.

            (he. relevance o f the advice and police report

            41     The contents o f the police report and counsel 7s opinions are obviously relevant to
                   issues before the magistrates’ court, namely, whether it is an abuse o f process to
                   prosecute when (a) the CPS decided not to prosecute in 1990, (b) the Coroner’s
                   verdicts (founded on evidence referred to in the report) were accidental death, and (c)
                   Lord Justice Stuart-Smith ruled that no fresh investigation was warranted. We have
                   material already which implies that those inquiries were misled. No-one has
                   contradicted the inferences which we argued in September 1998 ought to be drawn
                   from the material available. We have presented the material to the South Yorkshire
                   police themselves in connection with the issue o f funding the defence, and have
                   received no denials or contradictions o f those facts and assertions.

          42      Nor have we been supplied with any explanation why South Yorkshire police should
                  have the police report and advice of counsel Assistant Chief Constable Dames made a
                  “witness statement" on 19th May 1999 (Annex 1), The second paragraph o f the first
                  page shows that the papers were “generated” by West Midlands, who prepared papers
                  for Lord Taylor, and for the CPS, Mr Dailies is holding papers “on behalf o f the
                  Coroner11, The Coroner has indicated that apart from the limited category of
                  documents he is obliged to disclose under the Coroners’ Rules, he considers that the
                  law prohibits him from disclosing documents to the prosecution. Why then do the
                  police hold them9

          43      Mr Daines contends at page 2 that “The archive is a historical record o f the
                  tragedy     I would ask that these documents are returned to me at the conclusion of
                  these proceedings so that I can preserve the integrity o f the archive ”

          44      We (enow o f no possible legal basis for the “archive” to be held by South Yorkshire
                  police, but this is the first time we have been told that this is a “historical record”. The
                  phrase suggests that the archive is to be made available to writers in the future, but
                  presumably, only after an undetermined number o f years. It is not reasonable for a
                  decision as to the release o f such information to be left in the hands o f the police force
                  which has admitted negligence, which has argued that the defendants costs should be
                  paid in full out o f its police fund, and which has argued that the documents sought by
                  the prosecution ought not to be produced to the court,

         45       It is absurd to argue that a historian should be able to see the material in the future, but
                  that the prosecution cannot have access to it now.

         46       Mr Daines has argued that the facts o f the case justify the funding o f the defence by bis
                  Police Authority. That authority has agreed to fund it on the basis that it accepts Mr
                  Daines1 verdict that the officers acted “in good faith”. The prosecution itself involves
                  allegations o f negligence against the South Yorkshire force. In these circumstances it is
                  offensive and unjust that the South Yorkshire police should hold the papers which
                  were prepared by others who reported to Lord Taylor, the CPS, the Police Complaints
                  Authority, and the Coroner The material in their possession that has been disclosed in
                  the last year has come to our attention only through the intervention o f the Home
                  Secretary, allowing us to see the edited statements o f the officers, and to discover the
                  existence o f the meetings o f S YP which took place in the days following the disaster.

         47       Most offensively o f all, the solicitor to the South Yorkshire police, Peter Metcalf o f
                  Hammond Suddards, who was directly involved in the editing process in 1990, has
                  demanded that before any “voluntary disclosure” is made by way o f the supply o f copy
                  documents, we identify to him the suggested relevance o f each document, and that we
                  agree to pay the extortionate figure o f £30 per hour for the work o f an officer (a) to
                  locate the documents, (b) to copy and provide them to prosecution, and (c) to copy
                  and provide them to both solicitors for the defence, each o f whom is funded in any
                  event by the South Yorkshire Police Authority. This extraordinary condition amounts
                  to a requirement that we subsidise the costs incurred by the South Yorkshire Police
                  Authority in paying for the defence.

          Legal professional privilege

           48      There is no legal impediment to your disclosing the report and the advice o f counsel.
                   The police can claim no privilege in the advice, because the CPS asked for it It is
                   highly doubtful whether your relationship with the counsel can be described as one
                   between lawyer and client, so that privilege can be invoked..

          49       If, alternatively, privilege does exist, it was surely waived when the advice was
                    disclosed successively to the West Midlands and South Yorkshire forces and to Lord
                    Justice Stuait-Smith, The report o f the “Scmtiny”refers to some limited parts o f the
                    advice but not others. The limited part o f the report quoted bv Lord Justice Stuart-
                    Smith will be used against us. We, and the court, will need to see the rest o f it.

          50       If it is contended that privilege has not been waived by these previous disclosures, the
                   CPS can waive it now. In the circumstances, the CPS has a most powerful duty to
                   ensure that the court hearing the abuse o f process application is not misled by general
                   assertions about the thoroughness o f the West Midlands investigation, the experience
                   o f two leading counsel, the suggestion that the CPS saw all the evidence, and other
                   assertions o f the kind advanced by the defence hitherto to you or the South Yorkshire
                   Police Authority.

          51        If there are any parts o f the report or advice which contai n confidential comments
                    upon persons who are not concerned in this prosecution, or other' unusually sensitive
                    material, it would o f course be open to you to redact or obscure such material in the
                    familiar modem way

          Confidentiality

          52       It cannot possibly be argued that considerations o f confidentiality justify withholding
                    the final police report, when the Interim Report has been lodged in the Public Record
                    Office. If you disagree, we invite you to explain what interests require to be protected
                    by continued secrecy, and why irrelevant sensitive material, if any such appears, cannot
                    be redacted. These documents are not privileged.

          53       We invite your attention to the following cases, which demonstrate the limits o f the
                   doctrine o f privilege, and the restrictions upon the effectiveness o f claims o f
                   confidentiality in relation to reports o f police investigators;

          The attitude o f the Director o f Public Prosecutions to Disclosure

          54       The Director has publicly affirmed twice in recent weeks the great importance to the
                   administration o f justice o f proper disclosure o f all relevant material to the defence. It
                   cannot be right, or consistent with this policy o f openness, that disclosure o f matters
                   relevant to important issues o f abuse o f process, which fall to be decided by the
                   magistrate, can be withheld from the prosecution.

                    55            We invite you to disclose the police report and advice to us well in advance o f the
                                  committal, and I respectfully suggest by 25th June so that we can deal with its
                                  significance by advance written submissions to the court and defence. We also invite I
                                  you to provide us with a statement by the same date setting out what, the CPS knew '/            M
                                  about the practice o f closing the tunnel and confirming that in 1990, the DPP'and
                                  Counsel were provided with the edited version^of police officers’ statements.^ ;

                    56        In view o f the importance o f these matters, we shall send a copy o f this letter and its
                               enclosures to Mr Metcalf, the Police Complaints Authority and the former Coroner,
                               and ask them toWake comments to you, and to draw any facts they consider relevant
                               to your attention. If matters within their own knowledge show that we are wrong in
                              any o f the inferences we have made from the facts as known to us, they can tell you.
                              We shall also draw the attention o f this letter and your reply to the attention of the
                              magistrate, Mr Cadbury, when we contend that the prosecution should proceed.

                   Guidance to the police

                   57         Section 3 (2) (c) o f the Prosecution o f Offences Act 19S5 imposes the duty on the
                              Director “to give, to such extent     He considers appropriate, advice to police forces
                              on all matters relating to criming offences”, This duly d* - r-nt arise only when a
                              force requests advice. Mr Justice Moore-Hick saicfi so sp.-. ifi:ally in the G oodritjge

                              as Well as section 3 (2) o f the 1985 Act.
                                                                   .                                   i


                    58        In the light o f thd history o f the case, our previous representations,' and the new
                              material, we contend tnat it is overwhelmingly in the interests o f justice that the
                              Director advises the Chief Constable o f South Yorkshire Police that the archive as a
                              whole should be handed over xo the CPS, or to some other p irty nominated by you
                               after consultation with us. If you advised merely that the papers should be retained by
                               the police, but that we should have access to them, past experience shows that endless
                               petty obstructions would be placed resentfully in our way when w e planned to travel to
                               Sheffield to inspect and take copies.

                    59        We will complete our preparation o f the committal papers this week, and are anxious
                              to continue our investigations o f the evidence as soon as possible thereafter. We may
                              be placed under time pressure by the Crown Court if the matter is committed, and we
                              shall o f course have obligations of disclosure to the defendants. Accordingly, it is
                              important that we gain access as soon as possible to the archive. I look forward your
                              reply.


                    Yours sincerely.

Dear Ms Adlington

Adlington v Duckenfield and Murray

I refer to your fax of 23 June 1999. I will ask Mr Hepworth to provide you with copies of the
original signed statements to which you refer. I have spoken to him and he tells me that
there are some difficulties. For example there are statements by more than one person in
one of the names to which you refer. I will ask Mr Hepworth to contact you direct about
these matters and to forward the statements to you. I note your assurance that you do not
envisage the need to ask for any more statements for the committal proceedings.

Mr Lang died on 5 September 1990, at Barnsley.                  Mr Creaser died on 3 June 1996, at
Barnsley

My solicitor, Peter Metcalfe, has forwarded to me your letter to him of 4 June 1999. Your
letter to Mr Metcalfe included a copy of your letter to Mr Croston, Crown Prosecution Service.
At paragraph 56, of your letter to Mr Croston you say that you have sent a copy of your letter
to the Police Complaints Authority and to the former Coroner. Your letter quotes widely from
the Chief Constable’s briefing notes. I produced that document to the court at Leeds as
required by a witness summons. You have now furnished it to other people including the
former Coroner who is no longer a public servant. I do not think you should have done that
without the permission of the court. I do not propose to make an issue of this case but if
there are further such cases I will be obliged to take the matter further.

Yours sincerely

        Dear Sir

                                        Adlmgton v Ducksofield a*KL.Mi*rray

        As you are the custodian o f all original statements relating to the Hillsborough Disaster, it has
        not been possible for me to ascertain which statements comply with the requirements o f
        section 102 Magistrates’ Court Act 19S0. Copy statements in my possession are7 in the main,
        computer generated. You have previously refused witnesses access to their original
        statements quoting CPS guidance. It is understood that these will be produced to the court if
        ordered, and if available.

        At this stage it is imperative that I at least have copies o f the original signed statements so that
        I can fulfil my duty to the court and the defence. In the circumstances I should be grateful if
        you would provide me with copy signed statements o f those persons listed in the attached
        schedule.


        Yours faithfully




        Ann /vaungton

I,        RQpER        HOULDSWORTH         of

Sheffield WILL STATE



I       am 4 2 years old and up to the week commencing 10th April                               I

was        employed          as     Technical     Director    by      M.W.       (Technology)

Limited           of       Sheffield.       I had been employed in that               capacity

for        some        2    years until I resigned my position.                  I    hold     an

H.U.C.           qualification            as an Electronics Engineer.                Prior     to

working           with       M.W.     (Technology)     Limited        I    had    previously

worked           for       more     than 10 years abroad,        in       the    electronics

field.



When I returned from working abroad, in 1986,                             I was approached

by      the then Company Secretary of Sheffield Wednesday Football

Club,           Dick       Chester,       who asked me to assist in             relation       to

certain           problems          the    Club   were having      with      their         closed

circuit           television          systems     (CCTV).    I understand            the     CCTV

system           then installed had been put in place by Philips Alarms

in      about          1984 but that Company had subsequently gone out                         of

business.



I      did look at the system at Mr. Chester's request and as then

designed and installed it was not working properly.
Shortly           afterwards          I   joined M.W.        (Technology;       Limited        and

whilst            :heir       employee     I    completed m y       ex amination         of    the

existing              system and re-designed it to improve                 the system          and

also        rhs        computer system related to it.                  I also     re-designed

the     CCT V          system       which had been installed by             the     Club       for

Police           use - this being a separate system from that                         op erated

by the Club for its own purposes.



The Club System

This        consi ste d of a numbe r of static T.V.                    cameras situated at

strategic               points       around    the     ground.    As     aresult     of       my

examining              the     system I arranged for some additional                     cameras

to     be        installed to enhance it,              particularly when           the     Spion

Kop part of the ground was                     re-opened in 1986.



Being        a    static system the cameras                  are in a fixed position           and

focus            on       a    particular      fixed     area.      They   were      in       fact

positioned at                 strategic    points       to          view    the     turnstile

entrances,                and there -was also a camera cov er in g the               players'

entrance.               Within the CCTV room,            situated in the south             stand

near        the       players'      entrance,     there is a bank          of     20 moni to rs

plus        a monitor for the computer system.                     This    computer system

records           the        number of spectators            who come through the tur n ­

stiles            for        each   separate      area        of the ground.       Of          the

20 monitors             with in the control          room,    19 disp la y the scene               as

depicted              in the Club's       static system.         The remaining           mon i tor

is connected to the Police CCTV system.
Each        of        the monitors connected to the Clu b system                          is in          turn

:cnnect,ed                to        a VCR s o      that we have the facility             10   cape        the

film        shown              on     those      monitors,    on a       video     tape.           Of     the

19 static                 cameras however             1 was not in co mm iss io n at the time

because           a wall had been constructed after the camera had been

installed,                  which          obs tructed      that    camera's       view           of      the

relevant              turnstiles.                The turnstiles      in qu es tio n were                those

numbered              ? - 16           which       will    be referred to         later           in    this

S tatement.



The Police system

This         consisted                of     5     fully   functional          remote     con trolled

cameras           - i.e.            those cameras could pan tilt                through 2 60°,           and

zoom        on        a     16/160         lens.     They are controlled          from        a    Police

control           box          which        is fixed in position at              the     south          west

corner           of        the       ground,       adjacent to the we s ter n           end       of     the

south            stand.               The     cameras      for     the    Police        system           are

positioned as follows:-



        1        on        the       upper south west corner              of     the     west

        stand;



        2        are        pos itioned on the top of the south                        stand,

        1 at              about its centre point and the ot he r to                       the

        eastern end of the stand at the top;



        1 at the top                   (rear)      of the roof of the Spion Kop;
        1     at the south vest corner of the ground,                     mounted

        dh     i'.igh      near      the score board and close            to      the

        Police control box.



Within       the Police control box there are 7 T.V. monitors.                               5 of

them        are dedicated,           1 to each of the CCTV cameras.                   The other

2     are     con ne cte d to special             time lapse Video      Recorders,             and

vou     can     switch from camera to camera by means of                          a     passive

switch        w ithi n the control            room so that the O f f icer in             Charge

can     record        the        scene     being displayed on any         1       of     the     S

cameras.            The     remaining         2   monitors are used       so       that        the

Officer        can        check whi ch of the 5 cameras are being                      recorded

at     anv     given time.           P.C.    Trevor Bishop was      the    Of fi ce r        who

worked        the    CCTV system for the Police but it was                        not     usual

for     him to be alone in the control room - there might perhaps

be     3 or 4 other Officers                in there with him at any given                   time

for     their own reasons                - e.g.   to watch a section of the               crowd

from an elevated position.



Within        the Police control box there is also a telephone                               land

line     which        is     part of Sheffield Wednesday             F . C . ’s        internal

telephone           system,        and     the Police have      their     own          separate

telephone       land lines installed also.



The events of Saturday,                    15th April,   1989

Altho ug h      I     had prev iou sly resigned my posi ti on as                  Technical

Director        of        M.W.    (Technology)      Limited I was    asked by           Graha m

Mackrell        to        att en d    at     the ground on that day        in         case     my
assistance was required.                       We knew that the F .A. Cup semi-final

between        Liverpool              F.C.     and     Nottingham Forest       F.C.        was     a

sell-out           all ticket match and I arrived at the ground                            fairly

early         on     the Saturday morning tc check that everything                               was

in     order.        I was in fact asked to rectify a fault on 1 of the

Police        CCTV        cameras, the one at the south west                   corner           near

the     score board.                 I checked it, found it was not               functioning

properly           and        I    made the necessary adjustments to                 the        iris

controls           within the camera and thereafter checked that it was

working        OK.            Late     in the morning I then went            to      the        CCTV

control        room where P.C. Harold Guest was also in                           attendance,

as     usual.            In       addition         there was present    Doug        Lock,        the

Security           Officer for Sheffield Wednesday F.C. and

of     M.W.        (Technology).              P.C. Guest, as a matter          of     routine,

would     have        ensured early in the morning that cassette                               tapes

were     inserted             in     the      19 VCRs - 1 of course         would         not     be

recording           a picture because the camera was out of action                               but

P.C.     Guest        would          nevertheless routinely load all                 19.         The

authorised           crowd         capacity         figures for each section              of     the

ground        was     part of the data stored in the computer,                        and        the

display            monitor           for     the    computer   would    show        how         many

spectators           came          through each of the turnstiles in                 operation

as     the day went on.                    The system was so designed that when the

turnstiles           for a particular area had admitted 90% capacity to

that     area, the total for that section would flash on the T.V.

screen        and if, for example, one part of the ground was                                  being

filled        up     quickly           and there was capacity          in    another            part

(subject           to segregation of supporters) that would enable                               the
Police         to     be       aware     that      they     should     direct       remaining

supporters           to    a     different set of turnstiles.               Each         of     the

turnstiles           was       also fitted with an infra-red ray sensor,                         so

that     if     spectators             tried to cliirb over the           turnstiles            but

within        the     turnstile enclosure,                that would also be         recorded

on      the         screen,          under    a    separate     heading.        I        produce

[Exhibit 1]           a copy of the print-out from the computer monitor

for      the        game        in    question.       Numbers     climbing       over           the

turnstiles          within the enclosure would be shown on the                            column

headed        "Check       Total".           The   first      heading    "Gate"          is     the

turnstile        number         through which the fans entered,                  the          "Gate

Total"        shows       the    number who entered through each                    of        those

turnstiles and there will be sub-totals for each section.



I     was present in the CCTV control room from about 11.30                                   a.m.

that     morning          when the turnstiles were opened and                    spectators

were     entering the ground.                 The Spion Kop and the south                 stand

had     been designated for Nottingham Forest supporters, and the

north     stand        and      west stand (including Leppings                  Lane)         were

reserved        for       Liverpool supporters.              The authorised         capacity

for the various sections of the ground was as follows



                      Spion Kop                              21,000

                      South Stand covered                     5,524

                      South Stand uncovered                   3,310

                      West Stand                              4,465

                      Leppings Lane                           10,100

                      North Stand                              9,702
By about 2.45 p.m. the Kop and the south stand areas were full

of     Nottingham          Forest supporters but the north stand and              the

west      stand areas were only about 2/3 full at that time and it

was     noticeable           from the static camera covering the       Leppings

Lane     turnstiles that there was a build-up of fans outside the

turnstiles           in that area.      I produce [Exhibit 2] a plan of the

ground       showing the Leppings Lane entrance to the west                and the

turnstiles           (7 in    number)    which   admit   spectators        to     the

terraced        area of the west stand are designated A/G.             It        will
                                                                       t
be     seen that to the south of those turnstiles runs a concrete

path     which leads around eventually to the south stand.                       That

path     is bounded on the one side (the south) by the river                      Don

and     on the north side by a high brick wall.             Situated in that

wall     just        immediately     beyond the turnstiles - i.e.          to     the

east     of them - was an exit gate designated Gate C which is                      a

double       gate     of     the   concertina metal type    which     was        kept

closed.         One     of    the static cameras of the CCTV        system        was

situated        on    a post just east of that gate, the camera                 being

positioned so as to show the area of the turnstiles A/G.



It     was   through the monitor showing the scene depicted                by that

camera       that it was possible to see the build-up of supporters

outside       the turnstiles.         The Police had erected some barriers

across       the      pathway a short distance east of Gate C          so        that

spectators           could not walk along that pathway to get access to

the south stand.             The build-up of Liverpool supporters outside

the     Leppings Lane entrance was such that some had been forced
beyond        the entrance to the turnstiles outside Gate C and some

of those supporters were visible within the field of vision of

the static camera.



The     position          was such that I recall commenting,      at     perhaps

2.50        p.m.,    "For God's sake why don't they delay the kick-off"

and     I     made    that comment in the presence of      Doug        Lock    and

P.C. Guest.           We     were all, as I recall, in general      agreement

that     it would be sensible to postpone the kick-off to                 enable

people       to get into the ground, although I do not recall                 that

anyone       in     the     CCTV control room attempted   to     contact       the

Police       by radio or telephone to suggest that.            The Police       of

course were monitoring the situation themselves from their own

CCTV     system, and in particular using the camera on the                   south

west     corner       of the west stand roof.      We could of course          see

that     that camera was trained on the Leppings Lane              turnstiles

because       we were able to monitor the Police pictures on one of

the     monitors          within   our control room, although we       did     not

have the facility to record that picture.



There       came     a time when Gate C appeared to be opened,           and     a

number       of spectators rushed through into the "reservoir" area

between       the     turnstiles and the rear of the west        stand.         An

examination          of     the video recording appears to indicate           that

this        occurred        when the Police opened the gate in an        effort

to     eject one of the spectators that way, and a number of                   the

fans     pressed through from the outside.           It would appear          that
several        hundred        got     through before the       gates        were        again

closed.



Subsequently           the     static        caiuera picked up the      fact       that         a

number     of     fans        climbed up over the          structure        housing       the

turnstiles,           and     jumped down into the reservoir area                  inside.

That     is,     it     seems,        further indication       of    the      pressures

building        up outside the turnstiles although a steady flow                           of

spectators        was coming through those turnstiles at all                        times,

in the normal way.



I     recall     that       after      the first influx      of     several        hundred

spectators        through Gate C Doug Lock left the CCTV room to                           go

outside         presumably            to    report   the   matter      to    the         Club

Secretary,        Graham Mackrell,            and/or to check the position                for

himself on the ground.



Some     time    later,       I am unsure of the exact time,                I heard over

the     Police     radio        (we        had one in the CCTV      room)      a    Senior

Police     Officer          make a request       that a gate be opened             at     the

Leppings        Lane        entrance.        Police control asked which gate               he

wished     opened           and he repeated his request 2 or 3 times.                      On

about     the     fourth occasion he said "Someone is going                        to     die

here.     Open        the gate" and Police control replied "If                     someone

is going to die open the gate, open the gate".
As      appears          from the video tape recording the scene the                     gate

was     then        opened apparently by a uniformed P.C., and                  a    huge

number of fans flooded into the area.



At     that        point in time I realised,         from the    numbers        already

displayed           on the monitor as having entered from the                  Leppings

Lane turnstiles, that a dangerous situation was being created.

I left the room and went down the players' tunnel to the pitch

and     just        as    I     did so the Referee stopped the       match          as     I

recall.            I looked over to the west stand area and I saw                    fans

climbing           over the fence and my first thought at that time was

that     it was a pitch invasion,             and the match had been            stopped

for     that reason.             The perimeter fencing at that point is high

and     not        easy    to climb over.        I sat down in the       stand       area

behind        the     dug-out, and watched the situation for               a     little

time     -     perhaps 2 or 3 minutes before I realised what                     really

was      occurring.               One   of the    Sheffield     Wednesday        ground

staff        came down the tunnel holding 2 stretchers and I grabbed

one     from him and ran across with it to help ferry the injured

people        to    the       gymnasium area where the first-aid           room          was

situated.            It    was    in fact only after I had ferried 3                or     4

injured        people         in that way that I then realised           that       there

were     many people who had died as a result, and the gym was in

fact designated as a temporary mortuary.



After        helping       on    the    pitch as much as      possible     at       about

4.15/4.30           p.m. I went back to the CCTV room where

and     P.C. Guest were present, and I had a cup of coffee and                             a
                                             -   11     -




cigarette.            Subsequently I took print-outs of the                      attendance

 from the computer monitor, and ejected the tapes from the VCRs

leaving them in the machines in the ejected position so that I

could      later        know       exactly   which           tape    related     to         which

monitor/area.



I     normally        take     3   print-outs from            the     computer        for    the

attendance        figures,         2 of which go to the               Secretary,       Graham

■Mackrell-,      and        the third will normally to the                   Ticket    Office

staff.         However        on this occasion, since it was an                   F.A.       Cup

semi-final,           all    ticket,     I   did        at    first     give     the     third

print-out        to         P.C.Guest at his request,               since he    said        his

Superior         Officers            might   want           it. Later    however       Graham

Mackrell         said that          he wanted to keep all 3              in     his    secure

possession and I therefore retrieved it from P.C. Guest.



At about 6.15/6.30 p.m. Graham Mackrell asked me to ensure the

video     room was properly secured.                                     and P.C.        Guest

had     left    the ground at that time.                    I went to the CCTV           room,

locked     the cupboard doors where the VCRs were and then locked

the     room and activated the alarm system for the room.                              I kept

the     key in my possession overnight.                      On locking the        cupboard

doors     where       the     VCRs     were I      do       not     recall     specifically

checking that all the tapes were still in the machine but I do

recall     that       as I finally left the ground at about 7.30                            p.m.

that     night,       with my fiancee who works as a Receptionist                            the

Club,     I asked the Security Guard at the players' entrance                                 to




                                                                                                    Ii
ensure     that    no-one        entered   the CCTV   room   overnight.      He

promised to do so.



I    returned to the ground at 9 a.m. on the Sunday morning                 and

checked     the    room     where it was still locked        and   tha    alarm

operative.        However when I opened up the room and checked the

VCRs     I found that 2 tapes were missing.           One of those was the

tape relating to the camera which looks over Gates 9 - 1 6 ,               and

the other was from the VCR which had not been activated at the

time.      I have no idea who removed the tapes - I mentioned               it

to     the Security Officer, Doug Lock, and he was surprised               and

had no knowledge of it.



I have read this Statement and it is correct to the best of my

knowledge and belief.

                       HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY




                 WITNESS STATEMENT OF GLEN KIRTON




I GLEN KIRTON of the Football Association,    16 Lancaster Gate
London W2 WILL SAY as follows


I am employed by The Football Association and my title is
"Head of External Affairs".     I carry responsibility for The
Football Association's Commercial and Public Relations
activities.    I have been employed by The Football
Association for seventeen and a half years.     In my first two
years, I was Competitions Secretary.     I have attended one or
more F.A. Cup semi-finals in all but one of my years as an
F.A. employee.


1.   I travelled to Hillsborough on the morning of the match
with my son,                    and arrived at the ground at
10.35.a.m.


2.   I immediately made contact with Graham Mackrell the
Club's Chief Executive and handed to him, on behalf of the
Competitions Department, the few tickets that remained in
our possession.    We then went for a quick walk round the
V.I.P. accommodation and the dressing room area so that I
could familiarise myself once more with the layout of the
ground.   We had a brief look at the pitch at this stage.


3.   At 12 noon I went with           to the official lunch
which started late at around 12.45 p.m. and I left the lunch
at around 2.10 p.m. I put           Ln the guest lounge and
went with Arthur McMullen the F.A.'s Vice Chairman to see
Ray Lewis in the referees room. We stayed there for no more
than five minutes wishing the officials the best of luck on
behalf of The Football Association.       Arthur McMullen then
returned, I believe to the Board Room, and I stayed in the
dressing room area.


4.   At around 2.40.p.m. I was on the perimeter track by the
player's tunnel with Graham Mackrell looking round the
ground.    It was clearly nowhere near full at this stage.
Graham told me that there were 20,000 still outside. Calling
to mind the 1987 semi-finals at Villa Park and Hillsborough
when the kick-off of both had been delayed at the request of
the Police, I asked Graham whether, on this occasion the
Police wanted a delay.    His answer was that they did not,
because putting back the kick-off produced all sorts of
organisational problems at the end of the game.       I would
stress that at this stage I was completely unaware of any
danger to spectators and, to the best of my knowledge,
Graham Mackrell had also not been informed of any such
danger.    At around this time I returned to the Guest Room
and took          to his seat in the Director's Box, returning
immediately to the tunnel area.       I remained there until
kick-off time, principally because there was a great amount
of press interest in Brian Clough who had been banned from
sitting on the bench for the rest of the season but was
allowed for this match to sit in the seats immediately
behind the substitute bench.    I was in this area at the time
the players came onto the field, I believe the Liverpool
team first, followed around thirty seconds later by the
Nottingham Forest team.    Shortly before the kick-off, Brian
Clough came out and went immediately to his seat.       At this
stage, with the match about to kick-off I returned to my
seat in the Director's Box.




                               -2 -
5.      Shortly after the start of the game I was aware of
movement amongst the spectators at the Leppings Lane end and
my immediate thought was that there was some form of
hooligan disturbance, as the Police appeared to be
att€^pting to contain a movement of supporters.         I was aware
at the same time that Liverpool were attacking the
Nottingham Forest goal and that an incident had taken place
in the Nottingham Forest goalmouth.             told me that
Peter Beardsley had hit the bar from a corner.      Nottingham
Forest then took the play down into the Liverpool half and I
was aware that the disturbance behind the goal at the
Leppings Lane end was becoming more serious with people
coming over the fence onto the perimeter and much Police
activity. I did see people being pulled up into the stand
above.     I saw one police officer wrestling with someone
trying to get over the fence.      A Police Officer ran onto the
pitch and waved to Ray Lewis to stop the game.      I
immediately went from the Director's Box to the pitch by the
player's tunnel and found Graham Kelly already there.        A lot
of people began to mill about the area.      There were Police
Officers, some supporters, photographers, St. John Ambulance
personnel and the officials of both clubs.     Almost
immediately Ray Lewis brought the teams off the pitch.         I
asked him how much of the match had gone by.      He told me
approximately six minutes.    At this stage one youth ran from
the Liverpool end of the ground and stood in front of the
Forest supporters on the Kop making obscene gestures to
them.    This evoked an angry response and, when the youth was
chased and brought to the ground by a Police Officer a huge
roar of approval went up from the Forest supporters.


6.      I found a Police Sergeant who was clearly under some
pressure, and asked him to put us in touch immediately with
the Police Officer in charge of the event for the purpose of
information.    At this stage John Smith, the Chairman of
Liverpool, began to make demands himself for The Football



                                - 3 -
Association to call the match off.     I explained to him that
we had requested advice from the Police as to whether or not
the match should be abandoned or suspended for a period.       It
was at about 3.15 p.m. that it became apparent to us for the
first tiTie that there might well be fatalities.    Graham
Kelly and I then went immediately with Graham Mackrell to
the Police Control Room and spoke to the Officer in charge,
Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield. Chief Superintendent
Duckenfield told us that a gate had been forced and there
had been an in-rush of Liverpool supporters that had caused
casualties.     He pointed to one of the TV Monitors to show
the gate.     He was not clear at that stage as to how many
dead and injured there were.     He stated that in his view the
match must be abandoned, but that he did not want such an
announcement made for the moment as he had "a lot of angry
people" and he feared disturbances if such an announcement
was made.     He also wished to have time for the emergency
vehicles to clear away the casualties from the area.     We
asked that we be informed immediately an announcement could
be made and left the Control Room as it was extremely
cramped. I should remark that it was clear to me from the
scenes in front of me that many people were dead and injured
and whatever action was being taken to help these people was
haphazard.     By this I mean that there apppeared to be no
central organisation or control in directing the people on
the pitch. I should also add that Graham Kelly, who was
recognised by the Liverpool supporters in the Leppings Lane
end was loudly abused by these supporters who clearly felt
that the incident was in some way the responsibility of The
Football Association.     Throughout the day, many Liverpool
supporters who passed within my hearing made the comment
that they blamed The Football Association's ticket
allocation.


7.   On leaving the Control Room, Graham Kelly called a
meeting of all interested parties including representatives
of the clubs, the referee and the Police Commander.     The
Police Commander explained at this time that he had withheld
the decision about an abandonment as he felt that it might
be necessary for security reasons to have the match
continued.     I spent much of the time between the end of this
meeting and 4.00 p.m. fending off newsmen who were looking
for comment.     I promised them that there would be a full
statement by The Football Association as soon as the
immediate needs of the situation had been dealt with.


8.   At 4.00.p.m., approximately, I was informed that
Nottingham Forest were becoming restless and threatening to
leave the Stadium.    Graham Kelly went immediately to the
dressing room to sort out the situation and I went to the
Control Room to ascertain at what stage the final decision
was likely to be made.    While I was in the Control Room
waiting to speak to the Commander, a uniformed person whom I
took to be a Fire Officer came in and asked for the
ambulance liaison man.    The Police Commander stated that he
had asked for one but had not been provided with one.       While
I was waiting, the decision was made that the match could
now be abandoned.    I left the Control Box to convey this
information to various interested parties, but before I
could get back to the Board Room area an announcement was
made over the tannoy.    As I recall the substance of this
announcement was that the match had been abandoned;
spectators were asked to stay where they were for a few
minutes and remain calm to allow the emergency services to
clear the casualties; and persons should hold their ticket
stubs pending an announcement of a possible replay.     The
announcement was greeted with a round of applause from the
supporters above and around me in the Main Stand.     I do not
know what the reaction of the supporters on the terraces was
as I could not see from the position I was in.
9.    Once all of the relevant persons had been informed of
the abandonment I began to organise the passing of the
necessary information on to the media.        Graham Kelly
conducted interviews with t.v., radio and the written press.
At around this stage, I met Rogan Taylor, Chairman of the
F.S.A.   in the dressing room area.     He complained to me in
strong terms about the actions of the police.        In
particular, he repeated what I had overhead stated by
several supporters during the afternoon, which was that the
gates had not been forced but had been opened at the
direction of the police and that supporters had been
admitted to the ground without tickets being checked.


10.   I then gave my attention to attempting to reach people
outside the ground by telephone to inform them of what had
happened as we knew it and the action that was being taken.
Richard Faulkner the Vice Chairman at the Football Trust
assisted me with some telephone numbers in attempting to
reach Colin Moynihan.     I also spoke to                    , an
employee of the F.A. who was on Saturday phone duty for The
Football Association and who was being swamped by calls that
he was unable to give any meaningful answers to.          Among the
calls he had received was one from Ken Merrett the Secretary
of Manchester United concerning the possible replay on
Wednesday.    It was decided by Graham Kelly that the match
could not take place and I asked            to pass this message
on to Ken Merrett.     I also asked him to phone my wife
             o let her know that both           and I were safe.


11.   The attention of the press was now turned to the Police
who, according to the press, had made no statement on the
situation. At first a rumour spread that the Police
Commander was to give a conference in the old gymnasium at
the club at 6.00 p.m.     This was refuted by a Police Press
Officer who knew nothing about any such plans.        At about
6.00 p.m. a high ranking Police Officer announced that there

would be a Press Conference given by South Yorkshire Police
at the Central Police Station in town at 6.45 p.m.       It was
agreed that Graham Kelly would remain at the ground and that
I should attend the Press Conference.       It was also decided
and announced at some stage during the proceedings that The
Football Association would be making no decisions on the
possible replay of the game in the next forty-eight hours,
but that a press conference would be held at Lancaster Gate
at 3.00 p.m. the following day.       While driving to the Police
Station, I attempted to phone                    the F.A.'s
caretaker to ask him to open the office for this conference.
There was no answer from The Football Association.
Immediately afterwards,                nanaged to contact me on
my mobile phone and we agreed that she would attempt to
contact                ind that she would arrange for the
office to be opened at 9.00 a.m. on Sunday morning.


12.   I attended the press conference which was given by the
Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, Mr. Peter Wright.         He
was half an hour late arriving and was clearly very
ill-informed about what had happened.       He announced that
ninety-three were dead, two hundred injured of which
eighty-three had been detained.       He said he could not say
what was the cause of these deaths.       He said there had been
pressure on the outside turnstiles by 3 - 4,000 people
arriving no earlier than five minute before the kick-off. He
was not aware of any non-ticket holders trying to get in.
He said that there was room in the stand.       He then responded
to some very aggressive questioning.       He said that a gate
had been opened with Police permission,      in fact at Police
direction, he knew who had opened the gate but he was not
able to divulge the name.   He said the gate had been opened
because of the danger to life outside the ground.       In
response to a question as to how many officers were on duty
he said eight hundred, of which fifteen were mounted
officers outside the ground.    He went on to refer to another



                                -7-
gate which he said had been shut to avoid crushing and that
this gate had been forced open. After fifteen minutes or so
he said he could answer no further questions and attempts to
elicit any more answers from the Police were resisted
angrily ^y one of Mr. Wright's colleagues. At 7.45. p.m., I
returned to Hillsborough with                      of The
Football League who had also been at the press conference
and briefed Graham Kelly on what had been said.         I left
Hillsborough at 8.00 p.m. and collected my son who had been
taken to the home of Graham Mackrell by Graham Mackrell's
girlfriend.


13.     I drove back to London and arrived home at midnight.


14.     I should add that I have been interviewed on 9th May
1989 in the      presence of the FA's solicitor by Superintendent
Fancott and      Chief Superintendent Baker, of the West    Midlands
Police Force who are gathering evidence for the judicial
inquiry. I was asked questions which are contained in a
questionnaire for selected persons and I should now deal
with those matters not covered so far that are raised in the
questionnaire.


        i)   I did attend the same fixture last year,


       ii)   I   drove to the ground.


      iii)   I did not witness any disorder or consumption
             of alcohol in the streets around the ground.


       iv)   I did not witness any crowd build-up or crushing
             at the Leppings Lane entrance. I did not see any
             of the other entrances. I did not witness any
             unauthorised entry into any part of the ground.




                                  -8 -
        I did not witness alcohol being brought into
        the ground or being consumed inside the ground and
        did not witness any situation which I thought at
        the time was disorderly except that I did see one
        supporter who ran onto the pitch and made obscene
        gestures at the Nottingham Forest fans which took
        up the attention of two to three police officers.


  vi)   I did have a good view of the West Stand and
        clearly sa.w the standing area.       I did not see any
        incident in that area which I believe could have
        contributed to the disaster.


 vii)   I did not see anything which I believe was
        directly concerned with the breaking of a barrier
        in Pen 3.


viii)   I took up my match viewing position just before
        kick-off.


  ix)   I did not see any unusual crowd surge
        either in Pen 3 or Pen 4.


   x)   I did not witness the death of any
        person. I did not assist any of the deceased or
        injured.


  xi)   The only act I witnessed by supporters
        which obstructed either police, stewards or
        medical persons was the chap I have mentioned who
        ran onto the pitch.


 xii)   I was not personally subjected to any
        threats or violence.        I did not witness anything
        that I considered to be a criminal act by any
        person.



                              -9-
 xiii)      I have never been present or had any
            experience of any other football tragedy.


  xiv)      Nothing was brought to my attention which
            was significantly different from last year's match
            which would in my view be a contributory factor to
            the disaster.


    xv)     I have one comment to make as to the way
            the disaster was controlled following the
            recognition of the incident.   In my view it was a
            long time between the incident and when the final
            decision was taken by the police to abandon the
            match.   The Public was not kept fully informed as
            to what was happening.

9.00      Or duty Barnsley

10.00     Parade Hillsborough Serial 14 i/c PS 13^1 Crawford

11.00     To Phase 1 Duty Leppings Lane Turnstiles A - G

          in company with other officers instructed to search

          incoming fans re offences.

During this time there was a steady influx of fans, slowly at first and

as 2.30 approached, looking through the turnstiles I could see a build

up of people on the outside.     These persons all appeared to have arrived

at the same t i m e .

As the crowd outside built up and the turnstiles were getting busy I had

occasion to eject four people for climbing over the revolving barrier,

having no tickets.      These were ejected via Gate C as to take them to the

Police Room would have resulted in a shortage of manpower at the

turnstiles.    I could only see one serial in the area covering A - G and

Gate C.    As the crowd outside got bigger a number of fans were coming

through the turnstiles and making complaints about the crowd outside.

All the fans who entered appeared very agitated and some very frightened

by what was happening outside.         Women and children appeared to be

suffering the most and were in various states of shock.         I received a

substantial amount of abuse from some fans at this time, demanding we

sort out the crush outside.      Some fans were in possession of tickets
purchased from Notts and when they were unable to gain entry into the

turnstiles they were having     to turn around thereby blocking the

turnstiles even more.      During   this time I could see outside and could

see people being pushed towards the turnstiles and some getting stuck on

the revolving barrier which because of the amount of people couldn't be

generated properly.     At this point Gate C was opened, I did not see by

who but in company with PS Crawford I shut the left side of the gate and

locked it but not before quite a number of fans had run in.       The gate

was shut before the majority realised it was a way in.

I then returned to the turnstiles and could see people climbing the

walls and fences from the outside, youths were also climbing on to the

turnstile roof from the inside and were throwing tickets down to those

waiting outside.    I suggest these were the   youths who had entered Gate C

when it was briefly opened.

I could also see fans entering the turnstiles without tickets and

passing back £ notes of various denominations to the stewards.        These I

saw were ejected.     I have no knowledge of any successfully paying to get

in.

By this time I was again near to Gate C and looking outside through the

turnstiles, it was obvious that there was no control over the mass of

people I could see.

A man and young woman entered through Turnstile A and this woman was in

a state of shock and received first aid, allegedly as a result of being

crushed against the wall outside.

I was assisting them near to the wall between Gate C and Turnstile A
when the gate was opened fully again.        I   could see a mass of people

outside who all surged forward towards this gate.          The majority I would

describe as young men and youths be ;ween 17 - 25 years.         I braced myself

against the wall to prevent the young woman getting carried along by the

crowd who by this time were rushing, heading through the gate in what

seemed like a never ending torrent of people.         This mass of people had

one aim and that was to enter the ground.         They were unstoppable and

certainly undirectable.       In my opinion should a PC or PC's have

attempted to direct these fans they would have been swept along with

them.   It was obvious the situation was out of control both outside and

inside the ground.

After a time the gates were closed and the area between the turnstiles

and the terraces emptied quickly.       I did not see where those fans went.

I then resumed my duties at the turnstiles.         I did not hear the match

kick-off because of the sheer volume of noise around my location.

A short time later I heard a shout that there was a pitch invasion and

as a result of this, in company with other officers ran around to the

rear of the South Stand, through the stand and over the wall on to the

circular track.     I could see people climbing over the fences between the

track and the terrace and also people being lifted from the terrace up

to the seating area a b o v e .   As I got nearer to the fence I could see the

reason for this and that was the excessively large number of people in

the central pen.     I do not recall how many other officers were present

at this time but I could see a number on the fence attempting to pull

people over on to the track.        This was hampered by the forward facing
spikes at the top of the fence.       I could see people massed against the

fence with their bodies and some faces with a crush of people at the

rear of them, this was approximately         or 30 deep in the centre and

they were obviously unable to move or break but just appeared to be

watching us with terrified looks on their faces.

I could see individuals were obviously dead and dying with their

colouration and looks.

There did not appear to be too many casualties at first glance but I

could then see a lot of       those people were laying at the bottom of the

wall under the   fence, I     can only describe it as a large mound of people,

most were obviously dead.

I approached a gate to the rear of the goal and saw two officers on the

fence to the left of the gate trying to reach a young boy who was at the

front, he was alive but obviously shocked.       I entered the gate by

climbing around it using the fence and standing on the fence swung

through to the interior of the terrace.       I was then able to get an arm

around this boy and lift him enough for the officers reaching over to

pull him up.

By this time the crush seemed to be easing slightly from the rear.        The

only way to assist the injured due to the entanglement of limbs was to

get to the rear of them and start from the back towards the fence, in

order to do this I was obliged to crawl over some bodies.

I could then see that     a   crash barrier had given way just above the area

containing the   people who had fallen over and down towards the wall.

A path was then cleared from the gate towards the tunnel at the rear.
This enabled bodies to be passed along this path and out of the gate to

waiting officers.   There was no room inside the terrace to attempt first

aid.

I could see that some of the trapped people were obviously alive and as

a result these were given priority when released.

The noise was very loud during all this with some fans still shouting

and chanting.   A number of fans assisted us removing people from the

terrace and on to the pitch.   Without these I have no doubt that more

would have died as in the most they assisted speedily.

Some fans, mainly young men, were obviously drunk,    they had all the

signs, and smelled of intoxicants.    These fans were not assisting but

were abusing and pushing myself and others.     I was threatened on a

number of occasions by these men, and although not directly assaulted

was poked or pushed repeatedly, with comments like "you bastards, it's

all your fault".

I have no recollection of the number of people I removed but they were

pulled from the pile and carried to the gate.     I only recollect one

young girl about 17/20 years with black hair wearing what appeared to be

a brown leather jacket, she was immediately to the right of the gate

when looking up towards the stands.    When the last body was cleared I

returned to the pitch area and joined other officers giving first aid to

those still on the pitch.

As a result of climbing through the gate I trapped the sole of my left

boot and suffered a minor ankle strain which has now cleared up.

From what I could see throughout the incident the problem seemed to stem

from the large number of people attending outside the ground at the same

time.

WILLIAM CAMERON CRAWFORD




POLICE SERGEANT 13^1




BARNSLEY DIVISIONAL HEADQUARTERS




At   9*00   am    on    Saturday   15   April   1989,   I reported     at   Barnsley    Divisional

Headquarters          together with a number of Police Constables            also from the same

rota.    Our scale of duty was weekly leave but we had volunteered to work the

match.

I was in charge of serial 14 which was made up from the following officers

                 PS 13^1 Crawford

             PC        136 Smallman

             PC 1278 Lang

             PC 1002 Wild

                 PC 2819 McManus

             PC 2887 Grant

                 PC 1777 Branston

                 PC 2806 Butler

                 PC    975 Washington

                 PC 3232 Burton

                 PC 3347 Thomas

Police Constable          1278 Lang and Police Constable 33^7 Thomas replaced Police

Constable                      and Police Constable                  itfho were   sick and annual

leave respectively.

We   left    Barnsley        Divisional    Headquarters     at   9-15       am    and   arrived   at

Hillsborough Football Ground at approximately 9*40 am.
At 10.00 am this date,                I attended the main briefing in the North Stand with

my     serial    where     we       were    briefed       by   Chief     Superintendent        Duckenfield          and

Inspector       Sewell.         I    also     met    Inspector         White,    'F'    Division,     who     was    in

command of serials 13 and 14 at the Leppings Lane end.

After    a refreshments             break,    I reported          to Leppings Lane         end with my        serial

at 11.00 am where we were briefed again by Inspector White who also covered

the emergency procedure.                   In the event of an emergency, Police Constable 975

Washington was to be deployed in the central tunnel.

Our    terms    of reference          was     the searching of fans              coming through turnstiles

A-G at the rear of the West Stand, Leppings Lane end inside the ground,                                             for

alcohol, weapons, etc.

We were in position at 11.15 am.

Several fans had started drifting into the ground by this time and I noticed

that there was about six fans                      in the centre North pen.

From    then on until           approximately 2.00             pm, there        was a gradual       increase        of

fans coming into           the ground.             The majority were good              humoured   and friendly.

There was no problems at this                      stage, but I did notice a number               of supporters

outside    the    turnstiles          attempting to enter              the ground without         a ticket.              I

saw money       offered     to several            turnstile       operators when I was present.                 When

that     happened,       the     fans       did     an    about    turn    and    mingled      with     the    other

supporters who were queueing in an orderly manner outside.                                     A few supporters

without tickets jumped the turnstiles and were ejected.

Approximately         at    2.00       pm,     I     deployed       Police      Constable      3232     Burton       to

supervise       the   programme            sellers       behind   us    because    of    the   hassel    from       the

supporters.       Police Constable 1002 Wild was deployed at the snack bar at the

rear of the West Stand also to supervise a number of fans.
Between 2.00 - 2.30                        pm,       it was         obvious      there was a fairly large number of

fans outside               the      turnstiles without tickets.                              During this time I was paying

particular             attention              to     the         turnstiles,          when        it    became        apparent         that    a

number       of    operators               were       taking        payment.           I     therefore          flitted between A-G

turnstiles,            witn a view to catching them out.                                       There were no real                 problems

at this t i m e .

About     2.30             pm       there        was         a    large        number        of     fans       coming        through         the

turnstiles, many of whom had                                     been drinking but were not drunk.

Several      cans          of       beer       and     lager        had    been       'binned' in the             litter      basket          on

entry.       The mood of the majority of fans had changed and they were becoming

more aggressive.                    The smell of drink was becoiuxng more apparent.

At    this        time,         I       noticed          radio       reception          was        'poor'       and    virtually            non­

existent.              I    was         not     in       a        position       to receive any             messages          because         of

interference on the radio and also crowd noise,                                                   which by this time had been

increased tremendously.

Our   serial        Inspector,                 Inspector White,                 was    not        present       from 2.30         pm    and I

did not see him until about 3.30 pm.

I was unable to estimate the number of fans on entering the ground who came

to me and said,                  "Someone is going to get killed out there".                                           A lot more were

abusive      and threatening.                         The mood worsened between 2.30                             - 2.45 pm.             There

appeared          to       be       a    number          of       fans    having       difficulty           getting          through         the

turnstiles             because            of       the           sheer    weight of          the supporters.                  I     did      not

consider          the       seven          turnstiles              adequate       for        the       volume    and     I    did      notice

turnstile          'G' , which                 was       the      one     closest       to    Gate       'C' , had       difficulty           in

operating.                 On    closer            examination,            I    saw     that       it    was     a double         turnstile

which     was          separated              by     a       dividing       wooden         partition.             Bolted       on      to     the
partition was          large wooden blocks directly facing the turnstiles to prevent

illegal entry.             The sheer weight on this partition had distorted it and the

blocks had jammed against                    the turnstiles making them inoperative.                               A number

of fans had climbed over or under the turnstiles at the point.

There    also       appeared       to   be     some       difficulty          with     turnstile      'A'.         A    Police

Officer       who    was    on     duty      outside        turnstile          'G'    was    in    danger     of       getting

crushed and I pulled him over the turnstile into the ground.

I was    subjected to threats                  and obscenities             from a number of Liverpool                        fans

who    were    shouting,         "Get     fucking          out    there       and    get    something        done       before

someone gets killed".               Their mood was aggressive and it was obvious they had

been drinking.

A   large     number    of approximately twenty                        fans had climbed over              the perimeter

wall    onto    the    turnstile          roof.           Several       were    caught       and    ejected.            Whilst

ejecting one of these fans I saw a fattish Liverpool supporter hand a bundle

of ticket stubs to one of the fans on the turnstile roof, who in turn threw

them down to the crowd at the other side of the perimeter wall.

About 2.45 pm,         Gate      'C' opened and about fifty fans burst through the gate.

I ran to the gate with Police Constable                                1278 Lang and managed to secure the

gate, together with the stewards.

Despite       losing       radio    contact,          I    was    aware        that    the     situation        was      being

monitored by the CCTV camera positioned in the South side of the West Stand.

The    noise    was     tremendous,            the    mood        of    the    fans     near       kick   off      time       was

getting worse          as they came            through the             turnstiles,         many of whom would have

been    ejected        normally         for    their        attitude          caused       through    drink,           but    the

situation at this stage was not practicable.

Suddenly,       Gate       'C'   appeared       to        burst    open       again,    approximately           2.50         pm   -

2.55    pm,    a large       number       of   fans ran           through into          the centre        tunnel        of the




                                                                                                                                      \
                                                                                                                                      I*'
Leppings Lane end.

It    was    noticeable          at    this     time    that   the   situation     had    quietened    down

considerably.

Shortly      after 3.00 pm,             there was a radio/tannoy message             that all officers

were required on the perimeter track.

I took my serial onto the perimeter track via the rear of the Police Control

into the South Stand and over the wall.                         I instructed them to stay together

as a serial because of the number of Police Officers who were on the field

at that time and I went straight to perimeter fence at pen 3*                               I saw a large

bunch of people piled on top of each other against the wall and up against

the security          fencing.           The    number    3 gate was partially open and had            been

wedged      by    a   number     of      bodies.         It was apparent    that    the    situation    was

serious at this stage and speed was essential.                           I was unable to get through

the   gate       because    of    the        bodies,    therefore,   I   climbed    onto    the   security

fencing and pulled several fans from the mass and over the fencing, together

with my serial.            The majority of these appeared in s.'ock but were conscious.

I    then    went     to   the        gate    with     Chief   Superintendent      Nesbit    where, with

difficulty, managed to pull a number of bodies away from the gate until it

could be opened fully.

We organised a chain of                  officers and dragged a great number of bodies from

this area.         Where there          was a sign of life by checking the cartoid artery, I

attempted resuscitation and cardiac massage.

My serial was engaged in resuscitation and care of the bodies on the field.

I organised a number of Liverpool fans as stretcher bearers and they removed

the bodies to the gymnasium.

A number of officers on my serial,                       ie, Police Constable 2887 Grant, Police

Constable 2819 McManus,                 Police Constable        1278 Lang,    all were instructed to
remain with the bodies.

During    the whole         incident    on the field I was not subjected to threats or

abuse,    but    I    did    see   a number    of   flare-ups    mainly   by    fans who had been

drinking and were wandering about aimlessly.                     This was understandable under

the circumstances.            I did see a number of coins being thrown onto the field.

A   lot    of    Police        Officers,      St    John's    Ambulancemen,     were    engaged    in

resuscitation.         Many were shouting for oxygen, which was not forthcoming.

Initially, my feelings were of frustration because I was unable                          to get to

the people because of the security fencing.                    Perhaps if I could have, we may

have   been     able    to    save   a lot more      lives.      The   actual   gates   were   wholly

inadequate simply because              there was not enough and the ones which are there

are too small.

When the ground was eventually emptied,                     I escorted the Liverpool fans with

my serial out the Leppings Lane end to the main roundabout on Penistone Road

before    returning         to the gymnasium,       where    three officers on my serial were

involved in the sudden death reports.

At 7-20    pm,       I returned to Claywheels Lane where some of the serial had a

meal   as we waited transportation to Barnsley.                    Police Constable 2887 Grant

was the only officer still engaged at that time with his 'body'.

At 8.00 pm I retired from duty.

Understandably,         a number of my serial were upset by the situation but all

credit to them they did not show their emotion during the incident and all

performed creditably.

               NOTTINGHAM FOREST - v - LIVERPOOL F.A. CUP SEMI FINAL

               SATURDAY , 9th April,1988.




               On Saturday,the 9th April,1988, I was detailed to perform duties in respect
   of the F.A.Cup Semi-Final between Nottingham Forest and Liverpool at Hillsborough
   Football Ground, Sheffield.
               I was part of the Police contingent from the Barnsley   lE&tfx Sub   Division which
  consisted of two serials those being Serials 11 and 13• There was an Inspector in charge
^ _ o f Sach serial ours being Inspector Hooley. My serial was made up of the Following;

  PS 1341   Crawford

  PC 2083   Packer
  PC 1002   Wild

  PC 1278   Lang

  PC I
              The serial was paraded at 084-5 that date and conveyed to Hillsborough by Force
  Coach arriving at 0930. At 1000 I was briefed in the North Stand before taking up actual
  duties at the rear of the West Stand. I had deployed the officers in pairs. PC s
                         were depl^ed at the bottom of the stairs leading to the seated area
   in the West stand directly opposite Turnstiles 1-16?. P C ’s 1278 Lang and               were
  deployed,at the entrance to the West stand and nearest the Centse tunnel opposite
   turnstiles A-G; The remainder of the serial were on general public order patrol in the
  bar concourse in the West    Stand   and also the area behind the Leppings ^ane end inside the
  ground.
            The general behaviour and attitude of the fans on this date was very good with
   the majority in the ground well before kick off time at 1500. I do recall some of the
   fans had been drinking and were in a good humour.This was not a problem.
              The only problem we did encounter was the number of Liverpool fans with tickets
   for the terracing who attempted to get into the seated area of the west Stand by using
   tickets passed down to them by the fans in the Stand. We had anticipated this and the
   d>our officers assisting the stewards at both entrances tore the corner of the tickets
   on entrance to the West Stand so that they would know if the tickets had been passed
   on to the Leppings Lane terraces. This did not cause any problem and the fans accepted

 their plan had been ’rumbled'.
       At 1^.50 hours we had an instruction believed verbal, that no more fans were to
be allowed in the central pens therefore the wooden gate at the rear of the tunnel was
closed denying access. This was done by PC 1278 Lang.
       The game took place without incident and there was no arrsts by my serial.
       On conclusion of the game my serial supervised the fans leaving the grounjj and
 eventually we were deployed to remain at the junction with Catchbar Lane. The fans had been
orderly and good humoured throughout the afternnoon not one member of my serial had cause
  to intervene, either before,during or after the match.

Chief Inspector




Communications & Computer Papartment, Headquarters




I am a Chief Inspector in the South Yorkshire Police at present attached to

the Communications and Computer Development Department, Police Headquarters,

Snig Hill, Sheffield.

I have been a Police Officer for twenty years and have considerable

experience of Policing football matches.    I have performed the duty at the

following five Football League grounds in South Yorkshire:

Sheffield Wednesday (Hillsborough)

Sheffield United (Bramall Lane)

Rotherham United (Millmoor)

Barnsley (Oakwell)

Doncaster Rovers (Belle Vue)

The bulk of this experience has been at Hillsborough, where I have worked at

numerous football matches.     These have included Football League# and F.A. Cup

Semi-Finals.

Hillsborough is situated within the ’F ’ (Sheffield North) Division of the

South Yorkshire Police.

The first time I performed duty at Hillsborough for an F.A. Cup Semi-Final

was as a uniform patrol Sergeant in 1977-

In 1981 I was posted to ’F ’ Division (Sheffield North) as a uniform patrol

Inspector and I remained within the Division until the end of 1987, during

that time I frequently performed football duties at Hillsborough.
                                        - 2 -




I have been on duty at the Leppings Lane end of Hillsborough Stadium for the

F.A. Cup Semi-Final matches held in the last three years.

I have pe. ^ormed duty at most places           the ground, although the majority

of my experience has been at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.

Shortly after Hillsborough was selected as the venue for the Semi-Final

between Liverpool F.C. and Nottingham Forest F.C. I was contacted by

telephone by Chief Superintendent Mole, the then Divisional Commander of 1F ’

Division, who confirmed my availability and requested that I work at the

match.   He stated that it would be his intention for me to work at the

Leppings Lane end of the ground.   Eight days prior to the Semi-Final taking

place I received an Operation Order.    A comprehensive, yellow bound document

which contained details of how the event would be organised.      Over the next

few days I made a detailed study of this document and, in particular, the

areas of the ground where I would be supervising officers.

On Saturday, 15 April 1989, I reported for duty at the ground at

approximately 9-30 a.m.   I was in possession of my Operation Order at this

time.

My areas of responsibility were for that part of the ground which was to be

occupied, in the main, by Liverpool supporters and for the outside of the

ground at the Leppings Lane end.

The following Inspectors were allocated to my command with areas of

responsibility as indicated below:-

Inspector Woodward                 North Stand (upper and lowerlevel).

Inspector Bullas                   West Stand

Inspector White                    Leppings Lane    Terrace andrear   enclosure

Inspectors Sykes andPurdy          Leppings Lane     turnstiles

Inspectors Delaney and             Reserves

 Beresford
I have previously personally performed duty at all the above locations at the

rank of Inspector.     I have previously worked at football matches with all the

above officer? with the exceptions of Inspector Purdy.

The pre-match police briefing was given in the North Stand (Kop end) and

commenced at approximately 10.00 a.m.     It was a comprehensive briefing and

there was input from Chief Superintendent Duckenfield, Inspector Sewell and

Detective Sergeant Charlesworth.

Immediately following the briefing, I sought out all the above named

Inspectors and I persoanlly handed to them written (photocopy) details of

criminal intelligence which had been collated concerning people likely to

attend the match from both Liverpool and Nottingham.     I spoke to each of the

Inspectors and mentioned points which I considered to be of particular

importance as far as their own area of responsibility was concerned.        I knew

that Inspectors Sykes and White both had vast experience of policing at

Hillsborough and intimate knowledge of the duties they had been

allocated.

Following the briefing until approximately 2.00 p.m. no matters of particular

note took place.     I spent this time 'walking the ground' speaking to

Inspectors, serial Sergeants and Constables.

Additionally, I spoke to many of the Sheffield Wednesday F.C. stewards who I

know (by sight but not name).     I noticed that these men appeared to be

working at locations where I had previously seen them operate.     During the

course of the morning I saw, and heard part of a briefing given by Inspector

White to these stewards.     This briefing took place in the West Stand.

It was my information that the first turnstiles would be opened at 12 noon.

In fact a small number were opened prior to this and a few spectators entered

at the Leppings Lane end of the ground and went into the Leppings Lane

terraces in the centre pens.
As people started to enter the stadium I could see the usual mixture of

supporters.     They were in good spirits and obviously looking forward to what

had been forecast as an interesting game between the two teams.

Shortly after 2.15 p.m. I visited Leppings Lane where I spoke to Inspector

Sykes.     There was a contingent of Liverpool supporters standing in Leppings

Lane on the opposite side of the road to the stadium.     We discussed the merit

of encouraging these people across the road to queue for entry to the

stadium.     Many of these were openly drinking from cans of beer and lager;

they were not at this time causing any trouble.     After dicussion we agreed

that such a course of action was not necessary as there was a reasonable

quantity of supporters already forming queues outside the turnstiles.

Furthermore, it was considered that to move these people at this stage may

inflame the crowd.

As time progressed towards the scheduled kick off time it became

apparent that a large number of Liverpool supporters were still outside the

ground in Leppings Lane and in the queues to the turnstiles.     I noticed at

this time that the proportion of supporters who had obviously been drinking

increased.    They were, however, at this time only a minority and were not

causing any disruption.     Many of the fans who arrived were unsure of the

geographical layout of the turnstiles which gave admittance to the North

Stand, the Leppings Lane terraces and elevated section and the West Stand.

The signs above the turnstiles were not clear and many fans were confused, a

specific example of this was the alphabetic character displayed above the

turnstile and the alphabetic character shown on the ticket as the gangway to

be used for access to the West Stand were in apparent conflict.     It was

necessary for Police Officers to give constant assistance in this

respect.
At approximately 2.30 p.m. I could see that difficulties were being

experienced in the build up to the turnstiles which were allocated to the

North Stand, the West Stand and the Lappings Lane turnstiles - all these

three locations are fed from Leppings Lane.      From this point until after

3.00 p.m. I continued to monitor and supervise the Leppings Lane end of the

ground on the outside.

I was with Inspector Sykes when he caused the flow of traffic to stop in

Leppings Lane in order to facilitate more opportunity for the ever increasing

pedestrian traffic to make progress.

I have considerable experience of policing this particular area and I could

see that the build up of supporters     was later than usually the case and    there

appeared to be larger numbers.    The   operation was frustrated more   so by the

presence of a considerable number of fans who had arrived in the vicinity of

the ground, but were not in possession of tickets entitling them entry to

what was an 'all ticket' match.   Furthermore, many Liverpool fans arrived at

the Leppings Lane end of the ground in possession of tickets which entitled

them admission to the Spion kop and     attempted to seek approval to   enter at

the Leppings Lane end with friends who had legitimate tickets for that

area.

The situation outside the turnstiles, particularly those leading to the

Leppings Lane terraces, was such that by approximately 2.40 p.m. a situation

had arisen whereby there was a large crowd of supporters who were all pushing

towards the turnstiles, but the turnstiles could not accept them quickly

enough to permit entry to the ground.     The mood of this crowd was changing

from a good natured crowd to a frustrated crowd who could perhaps see that

they had little chance of gaining access prior to the start of the match.

The proportion of spectators who had been drinking inceased as time

progressed but they were outnumbered by people who did not exhibit any signs
of drink.   Within this   crowd there were at least two or three Police horses

who were attempting to stop the pushing.     It has always been my experience

that hor"es are able to control such a situation, but it was obvious in this

instance that this was    not the case.

A Police Constable was    allocated to theoutside of each of the turnstiles for

the Leppings Lane terraces.    These officers were given the task of preventing

supporters entering the ground in possession of weapons, banners, alcohol

etc.   This searching action did not impede the rate of flow of spectators

through the turnstiles.    Because of the intense pressure from the surging

crowd, it was necessary to withdraw those officers from that position; a

decision taken by Inspector Purdy, which I fully supported.

With a view to reducing the area covered by the Police horses, I instructed

officers to close the gates which are situated away from the turnstiles next

to the river - I did this because fans were using this gate to get around the

horses.

The crush within the crowd was such that people were suffering and there was

the possibility of severe injuries taking place.     I saw two or three bodies

of young persons passed over the heads of members of the crowd, these people

either had, or were close to fainting.

At approximately 2.45 p.m. I rejoined Inspector Sykes in Leppings Lane and we

adopted a strategy of forming a line of Police horses at the rear of the

crowd with a view to preventing the queues at the turnstiles becoming larger.

This took some time to arrange.     There were gaps between one Police horse and

the next one and I attempted to arrange for a Police Officer to 'plug' each

gap.   Many supporters approached this line and forced their way through,

despite firm advice not to do so.     I even saw a supporter crawl under the

belly of a horse in order to breach the line.
I could see that some people were climbing over the top of the turnstiles in

order to gain admittance to the stadium and at one point I recall seeing

Inspector Beniett ('F' Division) on top of the wall above the turnstiles

serving the Leppings Lane terraces.

Some minutes later I attempted to contact Police Control by radio but could

not do so; there appeared to be a fault with my particular radio (a Pye PFX

personal hand held radio) in that it was receiving but I could not transmit.

I approached Police Constable Buxton who was at this time in a Police

Landrover.   This vehicle was parked in Leppings Lane and the officer was

giving instructions to the supporters by means of a public address system.

He was urging the spectators not to push forward.    I requested Police

Constable Buxton to suggest to the Control Room that consideration be given

to delaying the kick-off time of the match (his radio, a Motorola HT600E hand

held radio, appeared to be functioning well).

At approximately this time I was able to see that the large 'concertina'

gates, known as 'A', *B ' and 'C', had been opened and that a large proportion

of the crowd surged forward through these gates.    These gates were only

opened for a short period of time and I could see officers/stewards at the

rear of the gates apparently struggling to close them, which they were

subsequently able to do.   It is my impression that gate 'C ' remained open for

a longer period than the others.     As a result of this action the pressure on

the turnstiles reduced although supporters were still arriving at the ground.

This action clearly had the result of easing the tension outside the

turnstiles although the crowd there were still pushing forward.

A short time later, I would estimate just after 3-00 p.m., there was a

request for all officers to attend inside the ground to deal with an apparent

invasion of the surface playing area.     I did not hear the specific radio

transmission but I did hear officers around me saying words to the effect of

    'all officers inside - pitch invasion'.

    I immediately attended inside the ground and went to the rear of the goal at

    the Leppings T ane end of the stadium.    I could see that people were trapped

    and that the gates from the centre pens were open and people were coming

    through them.   There was considerable confusion.    Some supporters were

    climbing over the fences, they were assisted to do so by the Police Officers

    and by other supporters.    I assisted in the general activity of lifting

    injured and apparently dead people from the Leppings Lane terraces onto the

    playing area.   I was present at this location prior to a 'private' ambulance

    arriving.   I gave instructions to some officers in an attempt to co-ordinate

    what was happening.   I can recall^ in particular, instructing Police

    Constable Goodwill ('F ' Division) to act as the Communications Officer for

    Superintendent Greenwood.

    A short time later I attended at the gymnasium situated inside the stadium.

    I was there concerned in the organisation of a temporary mortuary.      My

    primary tasks were ensuring that each victim brought inside was examined by a

    doctor to confirm death, and to allocate an individual Police Officer to each

    victim to deal with the formalities which would follow.

    I later acted as a logistical officer and was engaged in the liaison between

    the Police, Social Workers, relatives and identification     teams.   I continued

    with this work until retiring from duty at 5-00 a.m. the following morning.

        I am Trevor Higgins, 44 years

        Rotherham.




        Until July 1988 I was a Police Sergeant in the South Yorkshire Police

         stationed at Wombwell, of Barnsley Division.




        On Saturday 9 April 1988, I was detailed to supervise a serial of constables

         performing duty at Hillsborough Football Stadium.                                                                                                                   The two football teams

         taking part were Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.




         The serial was delegated duty at the rear of the West Stand and iu particular

         to control fans entering pens 3 and 4, that is the centre pens of the stand.




         During the game and because of the amount of fans within pens 3 and 4, I

         receiv                                                                                       :e the gates to the entrance and thereafter direct

        fans to the two outer pens of the stand.                I cannot recall where the

        instruction came from.           Under normal circumstances instruction came from a

        Serial Inspector or via radio from control.                 I cannot say from which the

        instruction came.

        Hillsborough, it is difficult to relate detail regarding this particular

Approximately         2.40    pm.        Young     Police    Constable              with    'stupid and legless'

drunk wandering about               in concourse          at rear A-G               turnstiles.          Did not know

where   to go.         Took        him    to Police       Room.       Had       to    support       drunk   all     way.

(Police Constable 1719 or 1715 or similar).

2.45 pmChecked         watch       leaving      police      room,    radio                   message,      "Get     some

more    horses          up    here"       (or    similar). Auto            -    assumed Leppings           Lane     end.

Unknown     officer      said,       "Sounds      like    its     getting           busy     at   your    end Harry".

Returned to Leppings Lane end via route under North Stand.                                            Getting busy.

Concourse    rear       11-16.           Climbing over wall           above          gate    'B'.       Joined Police

Constables       at     'B'    gate       entice     down.          fans       distrustful.              Waving    their

tickets.      Inspector John Bennett had climbed                               onto turnstile roof to deal.
Aware      of the      crush outside         11-16 turnstiles.           Coining through very slowly.

Stepped        away    from turnstiles          to watch Inspector Bennett                but    two or    three

times      I     was     pulled      by     Liverpool people       whohad    got        inside    who    were

complaining about the crush outside.                      "You should be out there.                 People are

gonna get killed".

Through the gate in the wall between the two concourses at the rear of two

sets of turnstiles.                 I became aware of a movement of people.                      From previous

experience I knew it was too much for turnstile flow and there were too many

for waiting friends responding to a kick off or                            crowd    cheer or similar.            I

stepped        through       into    the    concourse behind A-G.           (Not        sure whether pulled

again by fans).

Twice called on radio using allocated call sign 'India 7 1.

I seemed to recall that all the turnstiles had stopped.                                 Men were screaming

trapped        in them.        Gate       'C' was open and people were coming through.                         The

terror      in     the       turnstiles       communicated        itself    to     me     and    brought       the

seriousness of the situation to mind.

I went out through gate 'C'.

I remember        standing alongside            Inspectors Graham Delaney and Bob Purdy and

Sergeant John Morgan pulling people out of the crush on turnstiles A-G.                                          I

feared some would be killed.                   Some were reluctant to come.                I think they had

got   so    close      to    the    turnstiles     they   had     the    single    intention       of passing

through.         I shouted at some, and as many as possible I pulled under the iron

bar that is a continuation of the wall housing gate                                'C'.     The crush quite

suddenly         eased.        I     saw    gate   'B’had    been       opened.          The    queues    became

controllable           and    containable      again.       The   two    turnstiles       nearest       gate    'C'

appeared to function again.                   Sergeant Barry Sorsby on his police horse came

up to railing and using the horse as a barrier we were able to filter out of
this agitated crowd fans who produced tickets.                    I told the stewards on gate

'C' to take the stubs.

By now I have no idea of time or what is happening outside.

By word    o f   mouth information passed,          "Insic^ - Pitch invasion".            Went to the

pitch via rear of police control box and down the first steps in the South

Stand.     I saw no players or officials on the pitch.

The invasion appeared to have spread as far as the penalty spot.                             I got on

to the pitch and had got near to the goal post when I noticed those on the

pitch were not running towards opponents end or away from Police Officers.

Some were holding themselves, others lying down.                   I looked towards the fence

holding    back     fans    in    the    Leppings   Lane   terraces.     Police     Officers     were

standing on the          fence    and leaning over.        Through     the gaps     in the    legs I

could see the faces of fans pressed against the fence.                       I realised they were

stood up dead.           The gate to this pen was opened.              I think it was number 3

gate.

Automatically (or it seemed) Police Officers formed a double line up to the

gate and formed a chain gang to pass out casualties.                     When there was no one

at your end of the line to pass on the casualty, you carried it on to the

pitch.      Police Constable            2417 Pete Rotchel      and I carried       the    unconscious

body of a 14 years old boy, dressed in a blue tee-shirt and blue jeans, on

to the    pitch.         I felt his      heart   beat   but his breathing was            so extremely

shallow that I thought he was dead.                 We prepared to do mouth-to-mouth when I

realised     he    was     in    fact   breathing   himself.      We   did   not    interrupt    this

natural breathing and monitored his condition very closely, keeping him warm

and protected.           I remember as I was kneeling over him that I was kicked in

the back.        I seemed surrounded by the click-whizz, click-whizz of cameramen.
People    came with a board and this boy was                    carried away.        More     came with

another board to carry away the young woman being attended to next to us.                                I

remember intervening as they were going to place her on the board nails up.

I turned and         saw behind me a fireman anply               cardiac massage      to a male         in

early    thirties.          He   then   gave oral     resuscitation        and I knelt        beside   the

casualty to do cardiac massage.                As   the fireman     sat back he signalled me not

to continue.         We checked for vital life signs,               there were none.           I covered

the casualty's face with the front of his sweater.

I heard someone say, "They're charging".                  I looked towards the Spion Kop and

saw people      on    the    field moving       towards   it.       They   were   not running.         It

looked as though a confrontation was imminent.                       I went beyond the half way

line and made uniformed officers form up in a line.                        There was a line across

the width of the pitch.                 This   halted the progress         of the Liverpool        fans.

Some of them were crying.               Some were frustrated.          Some were angry.           It did

not help to hear the             mass of Notts fans behindchanting              and goading.       They

seemed unaware of the            tragedy.

4.20 pm          This was the first lull in the sequence                     ofevents sinceI left

the police room.          I looked at my watch, it was 4.20 pm.                 I became aware that

my radio was still working.               There were public address announcements and the

ground slowly emptied.

5.00 pm          Given hot drinks.             Mustered serials        in North Stand and spoke

to officers distressed by experiences.

About    5.30   pm    I     went   to   gymnasium     which   was    being    used   as   a    temporary

mortuary and I assisted in the collation of details of the dead.

11.00 pm         Went off duty from the gymnasium.

Continuation of statement of ..........................................'■ .........................................................................................................
 On Saturday, 15 April 1989, I was on duty for the Semi Final between Liverpool
 and Nottingham Forest, and contnenced my duties at 10.00 a.m. that date.
 At about 12.45 p.m. after the turnstiles were open I switched all video
  recorders on to record all the fans as uxey were entering the ground via.
  the turnstiles.
 During the afternoon leading up to kick-cpff time at .about 2.15. p.m. I noticed
  that the crowd appeared to be slow in arriving at the turnstilesv                                                                                             I am. not
 sure of the size of thecrowd but believe it to be between 25.,000 and30,000.
 At 2.40 p.m. that same date I checked with the camera which covers the
 Penistone Road area and noticed that there were very few people in the streets,
 and on checking the computer it was showing 19,000 plus, and when eacharea
 of the ground gets near to capacity the totals start to pulsate, the total
 capacity for that area of the ground being^ 21,0.00, which, told, me that nearly
 all the Nottingham suppprters were in the ground and it.was. near to full..
 capacity.
 I then switched to the camera that was covering the .Leppings Lane end of the
 ground and noticed that there was a large gathering of fans in that area.
 I could see that the fans were spread from. the. .turnstile.entrance right .back
 into Leppings Lane, fully blocking the road.                                                                 I would estimate that there
 would be between 3,000 and 5,000 fans.                                                         I made a check of the computer and
 saw that the figures for the West Stand were pulsating and showing near to
 capacity, and the Leppings Lane figures were showing in excess of 7,000,....
 vrtiich would be near to capacity and the computer would beat a point ready,

 the ground to break their fall as they landed.
 On the South Stand of this area I saw a mounted policeman being pushed on
 his horse down towards a large double door which leads into the rear of the
 West Stanci.
 During all this I could hear several officers including Superintendent
 MARSHALL requesting further assistance in that area, for the double dciors
 to be opened in order to let fans into the ground to save a major incident
 outside, also for the match to be delayed for a further 15 minutes.
 At this point I noticed that the large door situated on the South side of
 Leppings Lane open, and there was a surge of about 1,000 fans run into the
 ground.        Within a minute of this happening I noticed that the large ctoprs
 of the North side of Leppings Lane open and again about 1,000 fans run into
 the ground.           I could tell from the noises on the radios from the officers in
 that area that the Liverpool fans were very boisterous and excited, and
 appeared to be heavily intoxicated with drink.
 I then turned to the camera that was inside the ground and covered the area
 of the West Stand and it was obvious that the situation was getting out of
 hand and people were being pushed up against the fencing on the perimeter of
 the ground.
 I could see that all available officers were being sent to this area of the
 ground to assist with the injured and dying.
 By this tixne injured persons were being brought to the Players' Entrance area
 of the ground and I assisted in treating people in that area and arranging
 for ambulances to be directed in that area to ferry the injured to hospital.
 I can say that during the time prior to the major incident the. Police
 personal radios were working very well, but during the day there appeared to
 be some distortion, and some messages could not be read clearly.
 I would only like to add that in my opinion that the main cause of this major
 incident was caused by the Liverpool fans arriving at the match too late and
 being under the influence of drink and.trying to enter the ground without,
 tickets.         It was obvious that looking at the crowd qutside the ground prior
 to kick off there were several thousands that were attempting to enter with­
 out tickets at all cost to the safety of otherLiverpool supporters inside
 the ground.
 During the incident I was trying to concentrate on messages being received.

Police Constable 1421



I am a Police Officer in the South Yorkshire Police at present stationed

at Deepcar.

During the last four years I have worked all football matches at

Hillsborough Football Ground.

My duties consist of working in the video room in company with Chief

Security Officer, Mr Lock.

Under the ground regulations in respect of the amount allowed in each

section of ground, it is my duty to check with the computer, the number of

persons who have entered and then the number of persons outside the ground

about to enter, to make sure that no more persons are allowed into that

area than the regulations set.     If there are to inform control to arrange

for turnstiles to be closed and for the persons outside the ground to be

moved to an area where there is sufficient room to accommodate them.

This is very important at a no ticket match where the numbers attending

are not known in advance.
                             Mr.
On a ticket match this rol£ becomes a watching brief with the main

concerns being persons turning up at the match without tickets.

The video room is situated near to the players entrance on the South

Stand.   My duties are to liaise with the club and the Police.    Any

problems which may arise on behalf of the club are passed over to Mr Lock

.amf and involving the Police are forwarded by radio or telephone through

to the control room.

In this room there are twenty T.V. monitors which are covered by cameras

which are strategically placed around the ground to cover all 95

turnstiles.    There is also a T.V. monitor which can be operated by a

switch which will operate and show any view by the cameras from the main
                                   -   2   -




Police control point situated between the West and South Stands.         There is

also a computer which shows all 95 turnstiles and can tell at any time

during a match how many persons have passed through each turnstile at any

given point.

Each section of the ground is shown in separate columns, each column shows

a number of turnstiles for that area and how many persons have passed

through each turnstile and at the bottom of each column the total is shown

for that area of the ground.

There are six areas of the ground recorded on the computer and at the end

there is a total shown for the full attendance in the ground.      The

computer scans all turnstiles and is updated every two and a half seconds.

On Saturday 15 April 1989, I was on duty for the semi-final between

Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, and commenced my duties at 10am on that

date.      At about 12.45pm after the turnstiles were open I switched all

video recorders on to record all the fans as they were entering the ground

via the turnstiles.

During the afternoon leading up to the kick off time at about 2.15pm I

noticed that the crowd appeared to be slow in arriving at the turnstiles.

I am not sure of the size of the crowd but believe it to be 25,000 and

30, 000.

At 2.40pm that same date, I checked with the camera which covers the

Penistone Road area and noticed that there were very few people in tlje.
                                                    w      1O’t-y hCc-fO„
streets and on checking the computer it was showing 19,000 p l u s W h e n

each area of the ground gets near to capacity the totals start to pulsate,

the total capacity for that area of the ground being 21,000, which told me

that nearly all the Nottingham supporters were in the ground and it was

near to full capacity.

I then switched to the camera that was covering the Leppings Lane end of

the ground and noticed that there was a large gathering of fans in that
area.     I could see that the fans were spread from the turnstile entrance

right back into Leppings Lane, fully blocking the road.     I would estimate

that there would be between 3,000 and 5,000 fans.     I made a check of the

computer end saw that the figures for the West Stand were pulsating and

showing near to capacity and the Leppings Lane figures were showing

approximately 7,000 which would be near to capacity and the computer would

be at a point to start pulsating,    The figures on the computer start to

pulsate when the capacities get to within 15% of the total.

As I looked at the scene I could see the crowd getting larger and many at

the back of the crowd were surging forward pushing violently towards the

turnstiles.    From that point I could also see Police Officers trying to

get the crowd into some sort of order but they were being pushed to one

side out of the way.    I saw several missiles being thrown towards the

Police.    A large contingent of the fans were climbing the walls over the

top of the turnstiles, and they were landing on the asbestos roofs on the

inside of the ground and jumping on to people who were on the inside of

the ground to break their fall as they landed.

On the South Stand of this area I saw a mounted Policeman being pushed on

his horse down towards a large double door which leads into the rear of

the West Stand.

During all this I could hear several officers including Superintendent

Marshall, requesting further assistance in that area, for the double doors

to be opened in order to let fans into the ground to save a major incident

outside, also for the match to be delayed for a further 15 minutes.

At this point I noticed that a large door situated on the South Side of

Leppings Lane was open, and there was a surge of about 1,000 fans run into

the ground.     I could tell from the noises on the radios from the officers

in that area that the Liverpool fans were very boisterous and excited and

appeared to be heavily intoxicated with drink.

I then turned to the camera that was inside the ground and covered the

area of the West Stand and it was obvious that the situation was getting

out of hand and people were being pushed up against the fencing on the

perimeter of the ground.

At tefe-ie point 1 tried to use my personal radio in order to contact Police
              ■f
Control that further Police assistance was required urgently at the

Leppings Lane end of the ground, but each time 1 tried to use the radio I

was blocking others already using the radio, so I did not try further to

use it.

1 then tried to use the internal telephone system to contact Police

Control but again each time 1 tried the line was engaged and could not get

through.    At this point Mr Lock then left the video room in order to

organise some safety measures with the security personel.

Also present during this time in the video room was a Mr Roger Holdsworth,

he is the person    who installed      all the videos   and computersystem.

As he could also    see what was taking place he also left the room inorder

to assist in any    way he could.

I could see that    all available      officers were being    sent   tothis areaof

the ground to assist with the injured and dying.

By this time injured persons were being brought to the players entrance of

the ground and I assisted in treating people in that area and arranging

for ambulances to be directed in that area to ferry the injured to

hospital.

1 can say that during the time prior to the major incident the Police

personal radios were working v e r y well but during the day there appeared

to be some distortion and some messages could not be read clearly.

I would like to add that in my opinion, the main cause of this major

incident was caused by the Liverpool fans arriving at the match too late

and being under the influence of drink and trying to enter the ground
without tickets.     It was obvious that looking at the crowd outside the

ground prior to kick-off there were several thousands that were attempting

to enter without tickets at all cost to the safety of other Liverpool

supporters inside the ground.

During the incident I was trying to concentrate on messages being received

on the Police radio network but did not listen to what was being

transmitted on the back to back radio system owned by the club,as I knew

Mr Lock would deal with any situation that had developed.

After the incident I made a note of all the people that hadentered the

ground as shown on the computer and they are as follows :-

Spion Kop                            19,906

North Stand                          8,109

South Stand Covered                  4,7^0

South Stand Uncovered                3,255

Leppings Lane                        7,038

West Stand                            5,618

                   TOTAL            48,666

These numbers would not give a true reading of the exact amount of persons

entering the ground due to the gates being opened and several hundreds

entering the ground without tickets and trying to gain access, by any

means.




                                                                        7st a m /.
HAROLD GUEST, Police Constable .1421, South Yorkshire Police.



I am a Police Officer in the South Yorkshire Police at present

stationed at Deepcar.



During the last four years I have worked all football matches at

Hillsborough Football Ground.



My duties consist of working in the video roan in company with the

Chief Security Officer, Mr. LOCK.



The video roan is situated near to the Players' Entrance on the

South Stand of the ground.



In this room there are 20 T.V. monitors which are covered by

cameras which are strategically placed around the ground to cover

all 95 turnstiles.   There is also a T.V. monitor which can be

operated by a switch which will operate and show any view by the

cameras from the main Police control point situated between the

West and South Stands.   There is also a computer which shows all

95 turnstiles and can tell at anytime during a match how many

persons have passed through     each turnstile at any given point.

Each section of the ground for example the Spion Kop it will give

a figure showing the exact number of people in that area of the

ground.   These figures for that section of the ground are then

added up to give a grand total at the end.     The computer scans all

the turnstiles and takes approximately 2^ seconds.



On Saturday, 15 April 1989, I was on duty for the Semi Final between

Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, and comnenced my duties at 10.00 a.m.
that date.    At about 12.45 p.m. after the turnstiles were open

I switched all video recorders on to record all the fans as they

were entering the ground via the turnstiles.



During the afternoon leading up to kick-off time at about 2.15 p.m.

I noticed that the crowd appeared to be slow in arriving at the

turnstiles.     I am not sure of the size of the crowd but believe it

to be between 25,000 and 30,000.



At 2.40 p.m. that same date I checked with the camera which covers

the Penistone Road area and noticed that there were very few people

in the streets, and on checking the computer it was showing 19,000

plus, and when each area of the ground gets near to capacity the

totals start to pulsate, the total capacity for that area of the

ground being 21,000, which told me that nearly all the Nottingham

supporters were in the ground and it was near to full capacity.



I then switched to the camera that was covering the Leppings Lane

end of the ground and noticed that there was a large gathering of

fans in that area.    I could see that the fans were spread from the

turnstile entrance right back into Leppings Lane, fully blocking

the road.     I would estimate that there would be between 3,000 and

5,000 fans.     I made a check of the computer and saw that the

figures for the West Stand were pulsating and showing near to

capacity, and the Leppings Lane figures were showing in excess of

7,000, which would be near to capacity and the computer would be at

point ready to start pulsating.     The figures on the computer start

to pulsate when the capacities get to within 15% of the total.

It was obvious that looking at the crowd from outside trying to get
in that there would not be sufficient roan for all to be

accommodated. As I looked at the scene I could see the crowd

getting larger and many at the back of the crowd were surging

forward pushing violently towards the turnstiles.    Fran that point

I could also see Police Officers trying to get the crowd into sane

sort of order but they were being pushed to one side out of the

way.   I saw several missiles being thrown towards the Police.     A

large contingent of the fans were climbing onto the backs of others

and climbing the walls over the top of the turnstiles;    they were

landing onto the asbestos roofs on the inside of the ground and

jumping onto people who were on the inside of the ground to break

their fall as they landed.



On the South Stand of this area I saw a mounted policeman being

pushed on his horse down towards a large double door which leads

into the rear of the West Stand.



During all this I could hear several officers including Superinten­

dent Marshall requesting further assistance in that area, for the double

doors to be opened in order to let fans into the ground to save a

major incident outside, also for the match to be delayed for a

further 15 minutes.



At this point I noticed that the large door situated on the South

side of Leppings Lane open, and there was a surge of about 1,000

fans run into the ground.    Within a minute of this happening I

noticed that the large doors of the North side of Leppings Lane

open and again about 1,000 fans run into the ground.     I could tell

fran the noises on the radios fran the officers in that area that the
Liverpool fans were very boisterous and excited, and appeared

to be heavily intoxicated with drink.



I then turned to the camera that was inside the ground and covered

the area of the West Stand and it was obvious that the situation

was getting out of iiand and people were being pushed up against the

fencing on the perimeter of the ground.



I could see that all available officers were being sent to this area

of the ground to assist with the injured and dying.



By this time injured persons were being brought to the Players'

Entrance area of the ground and I assisted in treating people in

that area and arranging for ambulances to be directed in that area

to ferry the injured to hospital.



I can say that during the time prior to the major incident the

Police personal radios were working very well, but during the day

there appeared to be some distortion, and some messages could not

be read cleanly.



I would only like to add that in my opinion that the main cause of

this major incident was caused by the Liverpool fans arriving at

the match too late and being under the influence of drink and trying

to enter the ground without tickets.    It was obvious that looking

at the crowd outside the ground prior to kick off there were several

thousands that were attempting to enter without tickets at all cost

to the safety of other Liverpool supporters inside the ground.

At   10 am Wednesday,          29 March      1989,    I had a meeting with Superintendent

Murray, Chief Inspector Beal and Inspector Sewell in my office to discuss

the operational order and our arrangements for the day and to ensure these

were progressing satisfactorily.



At    2.30     pm    on   10    April       1989     I   had    a    meeting       with     the    Sector




                                                                                        T
Superintendents,      representatives   from    'D'   Division,    Road    Traffic       and

British Transport Police to discuss our arrangements.



At 2 pm Wednesday,      12 April 1989, I held a press conference at Hammerton

Road Police Station and met with media representatives.



At 10 am Friday,      14 April 1989, I held a pre match briefing in the North

Stand at the Hillsborough Football Stadium for officers of Inspector and

above.    See Appendix ’A ’.



The purpose of this was to give a full briefing to supervisory officers and

then for them to have the opportunity to examine their respective areas of

responsibility and familiarise themselves with the ground.



I conducted    the main briefing with Superintendent         Murray,      and then      the

respective area Superintendents held their own briefings, in and around the

ground,   dealing more specificially with their needs, and requirements of

their areas of responsibility.



At 10 am Saturday,      15 April 1989, I briefed the officers on duty for the

semi final tie in the North Stand of the Hillsborough Football Stadium.

See Appendix ’B ’.



It was a shortened version of the previous day’s briefing.                Superintendent

Murray,   Detective    Sergeant   Charlesworth and Inspector Sewell               also dealt

with matters    such as Emergency Evacuation Procedure,           Crime    Intelligence,

and Administration.




                                        - 2 -


                                                                            "7"
On   completion   of the   briefing   I spoke with officers   in the ground     and

toured the area.



I re-entered the ground about 1.15 pm and in due course made my way to the

Police Control Box about 1.50 pm and liaiseu with Superintendent Murray.



We left a short time later to see the referee and linesmen to advise them

of our emergency procedures.



They were on the pitch and eventually they left and we followed them to the

official's room.



On leaving there about 2 pm we returned to the Police Control Box and met

with Mr. Jackson, Assistant Chief Constable (Operations).



In the Control Box were the regular operators - PS Goddard, PC Ryan and PC

Bichard.



I had a general discussion with Mr. Jackson about the operation, which was

progressing satisfactorily at this stage.       He left a little while later.



About 2.30 pm, when examining the ground situation, I noted that the Spion

Kop was almost full with the Nottingham Forest fans, and that was the

general view in respect of their other areas of the ground.



A number of Liverpool supporters had obtained tickets for the Spion Kop and

were accommodated in the North East part of this section of the ground.

They were   segregated from the Nottingham Forest       supporters by a line of




                                        - 3 -
police officers.




The North Stand for Liverpool supporters was possibly half full at this

time,   the West Stand was filling,       but there was    space at the front and

sides   of the Leppings Lane Terrace.       i asked for    a tannoy message       to be

relayed for fans to move forward and spread along the terrace.



I can recall about this time Superintendent Marshall asked for Leppings

Lane to be closed and saw on the CCTV monitor the crowd situation and a

SYPTE   double decker bus passing.



I was   aware of a crowd build up buttraffic was still able         to flow       and I

questioned in my mind the need for the closure.



At   this   time there must have   been   some difficulty     in closing    the    road

because I remember more than one     request for this     to be done as    though the

first had not been implemented.



I was aware from the CCTV monitor of the increasing number of supporters in

Leppings Lane and in those waiting to enter the ground.           Whilst examining

the situation outside I visually made an assessment from the Control Box of

the way in which the ground was filling and askedSuperintendent            Murray for

his assessment of the situation,     bearing in mind      the crowd outside and the

space inside at this time.



This was about 2.30 pm and he said that with half an hour to kick off we

should get them all in on time.
About    this    time    I      asked   Superintendent        Murray    to    clarify       with me   the

circumstances under which we would consider delaying the kick off.



We had      previously agreed that if there was an identifiable problem, e.g. a

serious incident,          accident on the motorway or fog on the Pennines which

would prevent large numbers of fans arriving on time we should consider a

delay    as    opposed     to     those   who    had   been    brought       to    the   area within    a

reasonable time but had chosen not to enter the ground as soon as possible.



I took the view that at this time, with all the                           information available,

there were no grounds to delay the kick off.



Between 2.30 pm and 2.40 pm the crowd continued to increase and I monitored

the Liverpool fans on the Spion Kop and actions being taken by officers

there.



I examined the situation at the Leppings Lane End of the ground from the

CCTV monitor and saw the increasing crowd situation.



I was aware that action was being taken to increase the number of officers

at   this     location     as    horses   and    reserve      serials    were       being directed     to

assist by Control Room personnel.



In addition, a tannoy message was being relayed to the crowd outside at the

Leppings      Lane   end     to    ease   back    and   not     to   push         forward   against   the

turnstiles.



                                                  - 5
About   2.40    pm     the   radio    developed      a   fault     and     there     were     obvious

communication difficulties.



A request was made for a Communications Officer to attend and repair the

fault and he arrived almost immediately.



He restored communications and we were able to contact officers once more.



The crowd was continuing to increase at the Leppings Lane end turnstiles,

and Superintendent Marshall asked for PC Buxton to attend with the Land

Rover which is equipped with a public address facility.



In addition,     at 2.44 pm, I requested a traffic mobile to assist and for

continued     tannoy messages to the crowds outside                 to relieve       the pressure

upon the turnstiles.



The   crowd had by now        increased considerably         and     fans were beginning to

climb over the walls into the ground.



The   crowd   situation was     changing      rapidly,     it had        increased    in numbers,

Superintendent       Marshall   had   asked    for    a vehicle      with    a P.A.         facility,

tannoy messages were being relayed to ease pressure, Mounted officers were

having difficulty and extra resources had been sent to assist.



I looked at the situation on the Leppings Lane terrace and saw there was

room for supporters, and        considered because of the            deteriorating situation

whether or not to delay         the kick off to ease the              difficulties. I looked



                                              - 6 -
through the Control Box window to my right and saw a half circle of press

photographers on the pitch at the players'            tunnel, obviously waiting for

the teams to appear, and at that point, whilst considering the position,

the first team ran out onto the pitch.



I considered this option had been removed.



I looked at the CCTV camera trained on the service road at the Leppings

Lane end showing Gate C, and a Mounted officer was in some difficulty as

his horse was being jostled by the crowd.



It was about this time,          14.47 pm,    that the first message      came over the

radio from Superintendent Marshall with a request to open the gates.



I again looked at the CCTV monitor showing Gate C and my immediate reaction

was not to do this.       We had supporters outside the ground who may not have

tickets, some may be drunk or worse for drink, they were not co-operating

with the police nor responding to our requests.                  To open the gates      and

allow them into the ground would defeat our objective that no one would get

in without a ticket, who was drunk or may be carrying weapons.



The   crowd   situation    was    extremely    difficult   and    this   was   an   unusual

request, and whilst I was considering the position, assessing the space in

the ground and looking at the CCTV monitor, I saw Gate C burst open and

supporters enter the concourse area at the rear of the Leppings Lane stand

and terrace.



I remember thinking,      'the gate's open anyway': I had not given permission
but at that point a Mounted Officer retrieved the situation and closed the

gate.



A further message came over the radio from Superintendent Marshall to open

the gates and he used words to the effect that if the gates were not opened

someone was going to be killed.



This was an urgent message which conveyed to me by the tone of his voice

that this was a serious situation and was a demand rather than a request.



The   previous   thoughts    crossed    my    mind   once   again   about    monitoring      and

control of supporters entering the ground.



It was a serious step to take.           I looked at the CCTV monitor - there was

crushing   outside,   supporters       were    climbing     over    the    turnstile      walls,

officers were under pressure.



On the inside of the ground there was space in the terrace, there was space

on the inside of the turnstiles          in the concourse,          and room to ease the

situation.



If the gates were opened there may be crushing and injury on the inside but

the message I was receiving from the outside was that unless I opened the

gates and eased the pressure people would be seriously injured or killed.



Superintendent    Marshall    is a very       experienced     police      officer   and    if he

wanted the gates opened, which is not normally a consideration,                        then the

situation must be very serious indeed.



                                             -84
Whilst     I    am   considering   the   position   and   considering   the   options

Superintendent Murray said to m e ,



"Mr. Duckenfield, are you going to open tne gates"?



I remember standing there and saying my thoughts aloud           so that others,   if

they heard it, would realise it was a considered decision.          I said,



"If there's likely to be serious injury or death I've no option but to open

the gates - open the gates".



Superintendent Murray passed this message.



About this time I heard another radio message from someone who said words

to the effect,



"It does not matter whether you open the gates or not, this gate's going in

anyway".



I was advised this was 'A' Gate.



I took this to mean that crowd pressure on a particular gate was suchthat

it was in danger of collapsing and people being injured.



My immediate reaction to that was that if a gate collapsed due to crowd

pressure those immediately in front of the gate would fall and no doubt be

injured.       In addition, those falling may be trampled upon.______________ /
The     gate     to     the     North    Stand   was     opened      and   I    immediately     issued

instructions for extra resources to be deployed into that area to provide

cover on the landings and prevent a pitch invasion from non ticket holders.



I also asked for manpower for the perimeter track to monitor the position.



I watched       the Leppings Lane           terrace     intently for any developments            as a

result of the gates opening.



In taking stock of the situation I looked at the West Stand and it appeared

full.    The centre two pens of the terrace appeared to be almost full, but

there was still some room at the front of the two wing pens.



I saw a PC opening either gates 3 or 4 from the Leppings Lane terrace onto

the perimeter track and a handful of people were coming out on to the track

and walking towards gate 1.                They seemed to be calm and appeared to stand

aimlessly on the track without any direction.                        The policewoman standing at

Gate    1,     who    was     only   a   few yards     away,   was    totally    unaware   of   their

presence.       There was room at the front of this pen and there was a need to

open this gate and allow these people into this part of the ground.                             Chief

Inspector McRobbie who was in the Control Room in civilian clothing went

down on to the              track to assist her and draw her attention to what was

happening.



There was an increasing number of people coming onto the track from Gates 3

and 4 area.           No radio traffic was being received and I was still unable to

assess the situation but considered there may have been a pitch invasion or
                                                  'N._______ ,



                                                 - 10 -

                                                                                      V
that people were being taken out for re-location in the two wing pens.




I asked for Superintendent Greenwood to go to Leppings Lane end and find

out   what   was   happening.     I     saw    him    coming   from    the   players'    tunnel,

walking along the perimeter track towards                the Police Control Box and the

incident behind theLeppings Lane end goal.               An increasing number       of people

were now being       helped on    to the      track through     the    gates and    some were

climbing over the perimeter fencing on to the track.



The supporters      from this location were now spilling on to the track and

were standing on the grass behind the touch line.                     I was not aware of any

radio messages       but then    saw Superintendent        Greenwood     standing       head and

shoulders above      the people at the back of the goal, presumably standing on

an advertising hoarding and waving his arms.



He was waving his arms and crossing them as he did so, which indicated to

me he wanted the game to be stopped.                 I agreed the game should be stopped

and I sent Superintendent Murray from the Control Room on to the track to

stop the game.      I then saw Superintendent Greenwood running onto the pitch

to stop the game.      Superintendent Murray then returned to the Control Room.



I saw officers trying to indicate to fans in the rear of the pens to move

back.



People were      spilling onto    the    pitch and were        moving further across and

towards the centre line.          I was still unaware of any radio traffic and

exactly   what     the problem was,      but    some people were        now sitting on       the

pitch.
The Assistant Chief Constable           (Operations) Mr.         Jackson joined me      in the

Control Box and asked for an appraisal of the situation.                     I was unable to

give an accurate account of what the situation was other than a possible

pitch invasion which had resulted in us stopping the game.



The Assistant Chief Constable          (Operations) went to the pitch and a short

while later returned.



Superintendent Murray was asked to return to the pitch and try and get it

cleared    so   that   from    the   Control    Box   we    could   assess   the    situation,

especially as now people appeared to be on the pitch who were injured.



An ambulance was requested but I was unaware of any radio message asking

for this and was still relying on my visual assessment of the situation.



It was difficult       to assess     as the     crowd was     flowing onto the pitch in

increasing numbers, police officers were present, and there was a movement

of supporters towards the centre line.



I   was   concerned    about   the   crowd     situation:    a   difficult       situation   was

developing and we could not control the pitch.                It was necessary to form a

cordon to continue segregation and further assistance was requested to help

with the increasing injuries I could see in front of me from the Control

Box.



I called for 'Operation Support'.              In turn I was aware of a request for a

fleet of ambulances, and             as a result of that message I became aware of



                                             - 12 -

                                                                             T
the gravity of the situation.




I then began to give instructions to the Control Room staff in conjunction

with Mr. Jackson for the implementation of the Major Disaster Plan.



I asked for the Casualty Bureau to be set up,             to warn hospitals of the

large number of injuries, any doctors in the ground to Leppings Lane goal

for   deployment,   off   duty   police   officers   to   be   called   to   duty   and

rendezvous at Hammerton Road Police Station.



Mr. Jackson supplemented my requests, asking Superintendent Torr to attend

in respect of the Casualty Bureau; Detective Chief Superintendent Addis to

attend to co-ordinate the investigation side of the enquiry.            I asked for a

Counselling Service and Victims Support Staff.



I was aware of a request for wire cutters and following on from that the

attendance of the Fire Service.




Whilst all this was taking place I asked PC Ryan to continue broadcasting

for calm among the supporters and for them to clear the pitch so we could

determine what people were injured and where because the fans were milling

around and obstructing the view.



Advertising hoardings were by now being broken up for use as stretchers and

injured people were being removed across the pitch towards the exit by the

police room.
Fans    were    distressed    and   a   single       ambulance        was    in   position   behind     the

Leppings Lane goal.




The Fire Service cleared a gangway near the Police Control Box in front of

the    South Stand    to remove      casualties       from      the    ground by a more       expedient

route.




Superintendent Murray returned            to the Police Control                   Box and told me      that

there were many injuries and possibly some fatalities.




I was    later    requested   to    attend     the   Board Room with Mr.              Jackson,    the ACC

(Operations),      and left Superintendent Murray in charge of the operation in

Police Control.




We attended the Board Room within the Directors Lounge at the football club

and saw officials of both clubs and the F.A.




I was    asked    for an assessment of the situation and I told                         them there had

been a serious incident and a large number of casualties.




I was    told    by one   gentleman     that    he    had     seen     two   dead    supporters   on    the

pitch.




I related       the situation as I saw it at that time,                      and that in my view the

game would have to be postponed but that I did not want this communicating

to the crowd.




The reasons       for this were      that they may            create    an additional public order




                                                -    14   -
problem - at this stage I did not have the manpower to deal with this - and

it     was    essential           that     all    the    casualties            and     dead were      removed      from   the

area before any announcements were made.




It    was     agreed        the     game    would       be    postponed          out    that    no    one   in   the   crowd

would be told until I gave permission.                                      Mr. Jackson reinforced this, and we

very quickly left.




I returned to the Police Control Box with ACC (Operations) and continued to

monitor        the situation.              The rescue was progressing,                         we now had        fatalities

and a temporary mortuary had been arranged in the gymnasium.




I was approached in the Police Control Box by Mr. Clough and Mr. Dalgleish.




They asked for an assessment                        of the situation and whether or not the game

was    postponed.             I told       them     it was my intention                  to postpone        the game      but

asked them not to tell anyone                       and gave my reasons for this.




Mr.    Clough        left     but    I asked        Mr.      Dalgleish          to make    an announcement             to the

Liverpool fans for calm and to bear with us for the time being.




It is my view that this was beneficial to the operation.




The rescue operation progressed and eventually,                                        about 4 pm that afternoon,

there        was    only      one    casualty       awaiting            transportation          to    hospital     and    the

point had arrived where the crowd could be told of the situation.




I     asked        for   an    assurance          that       all    trains       and     buses       were   available      to




                                                              -    15   -
transport         the supporters away from the ground,                    all available officers were

patrolling the streets and that we were ready for the crowd dispersal.




The     final      ambulance     left     the    ground       and    an    announcement        was    made    by

Superintendent          Murray   to    the    crowd    that    the   match      had     been   postponed     and

they were asked to leave.




The crowd applauded the decision and left without any major difficulty.




After    the ground and the surrounding area had cleared Chief Superintendent

Mole arrived and took over responsibility for the ground.




I left the Police Control Box with Mr. Jackson and walked across                                     the pitch

to    the    Police     Room.     We    met     with    Mr.    Barron,      a    Director      of    Sheffield

Wednesday Football Club,              and passed comment about the disaster                       - he was in

tears but praised the police operation.




I left the         football ground for Force Headquarters                       about    5-15 pm,     together

with        the    Assistant      Chief       Constable         (Operations)            Mr.    Jackson       and

Superintendent Marshall.




On    arrival      at   Force    Headquarters,         about    5-^5      pm>    I met     with     the   Deputy

Chief Constable, Mr. Hayes, and in due course the Chief Constable.




About 9 pm that evening I left Force Headquarters for Niagara Police Sports

Ground       to meet    the Minister         for Sport who was            due to arrive by helicopter

to meet with the Chief Constable.
He arrived about          10.20 pm and I escorted him               to the football ground where

he met with Mr. Wright,          the Chief Constable.




I was present whilst he toured the ground and met                     with the press.




When   he     concluded    his   visit   to    the   football stadium,     I   escorted him     to

Force Headquarters to see Mr. Hayes, the Deputy Chief Constable.




I returned      to   the   Police   Sports     & Social      Club   at   Niagara and    counselled

officers      who   had   been   involved     in   the   events   that afternoon who had just

retired from duty.




I eventually returned to Hammerton Road Police Station and went off duty at

1. 30 a m .
Statement of        BERNARD DEAN MURRAY

Age                  47 years

Occupation          Police Superintendent

Address             South Yorkshire Police, Hammerton Road
                    Police Station, Sheffield



I am a Superintendent of the South Yorkshire Police, stationed

at Hammerton Road Police Station and sub-divisional commander

of the FI sub-division, which includes Sheffield Wednesday

Football ground at Hillsborough.      I was posted to this sub­

division on 14 March 1988.      Since then I have regularly

carried out duties in connection with football matches at

Hillsborough, including the 1988 FA Cup semi-final between

Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.      On all these occasions I

have worked from the environment of the ground control room.

I have 23 years police experience and have worked regularly

at football matches as a constable at Huddersfield Town, as

a sergeant at Barnsley and as a Chief Inspector at Barnsley.

I have worked occasionally as a sergeant at Hillsborough,

Rotherham and Doncaster.



On or about 20 March 1989, I was informed by Chief

Superintendent Mole that     the 1989 FA Cup semi-final between

Liverpool and Nottingham     Forest   would be played at

Hillsborough on either the 15 or 16 April 1989.      I was later

informed that this match would be played on Saturday 15

April 1989, with the traditional 3 pm kick-off. At 3 pm that

day, I met with Chief Superintendent Mole and Inspector

Sewell and as this was a     repeat    of the same fixture the

previous year, which had     passed   without serious incident, we

             base the order on the previous year's event.
The order was to be prepared by Chief Inspector Beal and

Inspector Sewell.   I was asked by Chief Superintendent Mole

to aim for a manpower reduction on 1988, of 10% in the

interest of most effective and efficient utilisation of

resources as it was to my knowledge that the previous year,

some officers had been under employed.   I communicated    this

to the planning team, with the suggestion that this could be

achieved in the main, by reducing the public order serials

from one sergeant and 10 constables to one sergeant and

eight constables.   As a result of the previous year's

experience there were a number of areas where I considered

arrangements could be improved.   Some were to be included in

the operational order and others by contingency or

instruction.   The following were to be included in the

order; reinforcement of 'flash-point1 at Leppings Lane

roundabout at junction with Penistone Road with 4 serials, 4

horses, 4 dogs and 2 vans; reinforcement of the track to

prevent a pitch invasion as occurred the previous year by

introducing a further 4 serials at the end of the game; west

stand serial to be particular vigilant in preventing

climbing into that stand from the terraces below; any

Liverpool supporters on the Kop to be contained in the

segregated area on the Kop especially identified and

cordonned for this purpose; buses to be parked immediately

outside the ground at Leppings Lane end and Penistone Road

end to hold 5 serials each during the match of officers who

were previously on stand-by at Claywheels Lane and too

far away to be deployed quickly; three prisoner vans to be

available to respond to requests for transport for prisoners

         outside the ground and avoid having to utilise
mobile serials for this purpose; all officers to be provided

with at least one hot meal; call-signs for Chief Inspectors

and above to be by way of their names to avoid confusion.

By instruction; one officer Lo be identified to deal with

any VIP's to avoid others being taken away from recognised

roles; the CCTV link utilised the previous year from Wadsley

Bridge station to be cancelled as this took up considerable

radio space when being set up and the monitor took up

valuable space in the control room; a communications officer

to be available at the ground to deal with any communication

problems.        By negotiation; buses for transport of Kop and

south stand supporters to be positioned nearer to city to

assist Segregation.        By arrangement with the club; signs to

the ground to be provided and erected by the AA.        By

contingency; any excesses of private vehicles for Liverpool

supporters to be directed to the Wisewood/Winn Gardens area;

if large numbers of supporters without tickets, mobile

serials to attempt to locate and remove to, Nottingham

Forest supporters to Hillsborough Park, Liverpool supporters

to Cole Road.



At 10 am on 22 March 1989 I attended a meeting at Hammerton

Road Police Station, chaired by Chief Superintendent Mole

and which was attended by all interested parties, who had

been invited.        I recall that at the meeting it was mentioned

that Liverpool were unhappy with the allocation of tickets

and being given the Leppings Lan^ end and north stand.

There was a strong representation from officials of British

            Iter these arrangements as well in order that

            ti   Forest fans could use Wadsley Bridge railway
station as early indications were that many more Nottingham

fans would be travelling by special train, than Liverpool.

As a result of this, I later discussed with Chief

Superintendent Mole, whether we could re-appraise the

allocation of the ground.     We discussed and agreed that in

view of it meaning all supporters would have to cross and

that as it was an exact replica of the previous year's

fixture and fairly fresh in travelling supporters' minds and

they would no doubt park and resort to the same areas as

last year, that the probability of public order situations

arising in many areas would be too high and it was not

possible to re-arrange accommodation in the ground.



On 29 March 1989 with Chief Inspector Beal and Inspector

Sewell, I attended a meeting with Chief Superintendent Ducken-

field, when we discussed the draft operational order and

current state of planning and decided to go ahead with the

order with some minor amendments.



At 12.30 pm on 5 April 1989, I visited Sheffield Wednesday

football ground with Inspector Sewell and saw the Force

catering officer, regarding the siting of a mobile canteen

and prison buses.



At 2.30 pm on 10 April 1989,    I attended a meeting at

Hammerton Road Police Station, chaired by Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield and attended by the Sector

Superintendents and officers from 'D' Division, Operations

and Traffic and British Transport Police and discussed

         nts for the event.
At 2 pm on 12 April 1989, I was present when Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield gave a press conference in the

conference room at Hammerton Road Police Station.



At 10.30 am on 13 April 1989 with Inspector Sewell,    I

attended Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and met with the

club Secretary, Mr Graham Mackerell and discussed

arrangements for the event.   At the conclusion of this

meeting with Inspector Sewell, I made a full inspection of

the ground.



At 9.15 am on Friday 14 April 1989, I travelled to

Hillsborough and at 10 am officers of the rank of Inspector

and above, were briefed by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield.

I then gave a full briefing from my briefing notes, followed

by a briefing by Inspector Sewell.     The sector

Superintendents then took officers under their command to

different parts of the ground to brief them on their

specific responsibilities.    The briefing by Mr Duckenfield,

myself and Inspector Sewell, lasted for approximately 45

minutes.   On return to Hammerton Road Police Station, I

discussed with Chief Superintendent Duckenfield, cutting

down my input on briefing, as we could not hold officers'

attention for so long.   I would merely confine my briefing

to the important aspects and let sector Superintendents and

Inspectors, cover all other aspects.     This was agreed.



On Saturday 15 April 1989 at 0800 hours,    I commenced duty at

uaTnmorfa w poad Police Station and carried out general office
duties.     Checked the incident that had been created on

Command and Control and found that it had been closed.

Incident re-opened with instructions that all matters in

relation to the s e m i - f i n d should be entered on it.   The

only other information available at this time, was that

there was a large amount of rubble in Parkside Road area

from excavations and this was to be cleared before 10 am.



At 0915 hours I went to Hillsborough, arriving at about 0930

hours.



At 0945 hours I was checking that everything OK for briefing

and arranging at request of one of thesector Superintendents

for copies of the public house check-list to be obtained for

distribution to all serial sergeants and Inspectors on duty

outside the ground.



At 1000 hours the briefing of all officers commenced on

time.     Chief Superintendent Duckenfield opening brief,

followed by    myself as per my briefing notes.      Followed by

Detective Sergeant Charlesworth on Crime Intelligence,

followed by Inspector Sewell on administrative matters in

relation to issue of radios and meals.       This briefing took

approximately 20 minutes.     After the briefing I spoke to the

mobile camera crew and informed them that they had a 'roving

commission' before the match.      During the match they were to

take up a position in front of the north stand, close to the

Kop end and maintain a low profile, only filming any

incidents that were of note and where video evidence would
At about 1035 hours, I took up position in ground control.

Police Sergeant Goddard, Police Constable Ryan and Police

Constable Bichard already on duty in control room.           Informed

them i_nat Police Sergeant Goddard would be responsible for

radio reception and transmission,          Police Constable Ryan for

the public address system and the telephones and Police

Constable Bichard for the CCTV operation and operation of

the VHF pack-set to Force Operations Room, channel 1.

Besides being responsible for overall command of the control

room, I would attempt to keep my own personal log of events.

(A log had never been kept in previous years, due to the

limited space in the control room and there being

insufficient room for a log writer.           My experience from the

previous semi-final was that at de-brief it was difficult to

remember all events of significance and this log would serve

as a memory-jogger).          At this time, a civilian member of the

communications department was in the control room.           I

informed him that he was welcome to stay for the time being

in case we had any communication problems, but that he would

have to leave and base himself in the gymnasium once the

Chief Superintendent took up his positions in control, due

to limited space.          At this time serials were taking their

meals in the north stand and had been instructed to be

briefed and on their points by 11.15 am.



By 1230 hours reports had been received of supporters

drinking at the following pubs; rive Arches, Devonshire,

Freemasons and The Royal and at the Horse and Jockey.            The

m nh1 1p   nm '-t-g   we re asked to monitor the situation and also in
the Nottingham Forest sector additional radios had been

requested in order that officers, who would not normally be

issued with radios, could be left in the proximity of these

pubs and have additional communication.



At 1300 hours, reports had been received of urinators in the

Wadsley Lane area, shoplifters on the Halifax Road side of

the ground and the usual nuisance calls that are associated

with this type of event.



By 1340 hours there had been problems at the Victoria and

Royal, public houses and the Royal had, in fact, closed.



At about 1350 hours I was joined in the control room by

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield.   I informed him that there

were no real problems apparent, apart from the usual, with

this type of event.   We then went together onto the Track,

with the intention of seeing the referee.     I identified the

referee who was on the pitch, talking with other people and

we waited about 5 minutes for   him to leave the field and

then followed him to the referee's room.     With the lines­

men, he was informed that in general, the field of play was

his responsibility, but we reserved the right at any time to

come onto the field if circumstances merited this.     He was

informed of the emergency evacuation procedure and the coded

message and also informed of the procedure for stopping the

match by way of the south stand lines-man.     He was informed

that there would be a further brief after the event.



            5 hours I returned to the control room and saw
                                                                   9

that ACC (Ops) Mr Jackson, was in attendance.     Mr

Duckenfield appraised him of the current situation.



At about 1415 hours, looking aiound the stadium,       I noticed

that the Kop was filling up nicely.    It was difficult to

assess the south stand,   but this also appeared to be

filling.    My impression was that the north stand was

probably not a quarter full and the same with the west stand

and the Leppings Lane terraces.



At 1417 hours a message was received from Superintendent

Marshall, asking for Leppings Lane to be closed to traffic.

From the CCTV pictures there did not seem to be a particular

problem,   but the serial identified at the roundabout end of

Leppings   Lane (S30) was contacted and asked to close that

end.   We were unable to contact the serial at the Catchbar

Lane end (S26) and either Superintendent Marshall or

Inspector Sykes were told this and requested to deploy an

officer to close this end.



At about 1422 hours a message was received from

Superintendent Marshall that Leppings Lane had not yet been

closed and traffic was still coming through.    Further

messages were sent asking for the road to be closed.

Superintendent Marshall then asked for Mr                 of

Sheffield Transport to be informed in order that he could

make arrangements for bus routes to be altered to cater for

the closure.   This was arranged.


           130 hours the north stand appeared to be about half
full.    The west stand was filling, as were the centre pens

and the north west terrace.    There were large clear sections

in the pen, under the control box and the pen on the north

side of the double railings.    There was a large crowd

outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles, but I was convinced

that the turnstiles could cope with these numbers and

remarked to Chief Superintendent Duckenfield, that there was

a good crowd outside, but we still had half an hour to kick

off and we would get them in by three o'clock.    About this

time, Chief Superintendent Duckenfield asked me to remind

him of what we had decided about delaying the kick-off.     I

informed him that we had agreed that if there was an

identifiable problem, such as a serious accident on the

motorway, or bad weather over the Pennines, which prevented

people arriving on time, that we would delay - but if it was

merely that people had arrived in time, but decided to go

elsewhere, rather than the ground and arrived at the last

minute, then we would not normally delay it.



By 1435 hours the control room was busy.    A number of

reports had been received, including a possible public order

problem in the Middlewood Road area with youths

congregating.    A number of arrests or ejections had occured

at the   'spur' on the Kop, which had been isolated for

Liverpool supporters, who found their way onto the Kop.     A

report had been received of a 'tout' selling Kop tickets at

the Leppings Lane end of the ground, to Liverpool

supporters.     This was circulated by radio and he was

arrested.     Superintendent Greenwood was asked to consider a
contingency for other Liverpool supporters on the Kop, in

view of this, as the Kop was becoming full.     A unit at

Rawson Spring Road was requesting the present position with

regard to a Draegar to carry out a breath test.      The crowd

around the turnstiles in Leppings Lane appeared to be about

the same as 5 minutes earlier.



At about 1440 hours a request was received from the mounted

Inspector (Mil), for any spare mounted officers to be sent

to the Leppings Lane end to assist.     Police Sergeant Goddard

asked Police Sergeant Sorsby (Mounted) to deploy all

available mounted officers to the Leppings Lane end.      There

were two reserve serials (S20 and S21).     S21 had earlier

been despatched to Penistone Road end to assist with

turnstile searches.    As a precaution and as   'back-up' S20

was deployed from the gymnasium to the Leppings Lane end of

the ground, to assist.    Messages were being received from

the Leppings Lane eni to use the tannoy system to ask

people outside the turnstiles to stop pushing as people were

going to be injured.     Police Constable Ryan immediately

started to pass these messages over the public address

system.    I instructed him to keep talking and passing on the

message.



At about 1442 hours, someone was trying to pass a message to

control, which v/as unreadable and Police Sergeant Goddard

replied that the message was unreadable.     A further message

was then received that our transmissions were breaking up

badly and very difficult to understand.     Police Constable

Ryan was requested to raise the communication officer from
the gymnasium.      Before he could make the call the

communications officer appeared in the control room and said

that he had realised we were having radio problems and an

officer had brought him to the control room.     He described

the fault as the 'Norman Collier' type fault of messages

breaking up.     The base stations are situated under the

control room desk and he set to work on them.     We were

operating from a 'tulip' type microphone and I gained the

impression that he disconnected this microphone and

substituted a telephone hand-set type microphone for it.



Radio messages were coming in and the telephone microphone

was handed to Police Sergeant Goddard.     He passed out a

radio message and the reply was grossly distorted and

unreadable.    Police Sergeant Goddard tried a second time and

the result was the same.    He put the handset on the desk and

looked exasperated.    I said to the communications officer.

"We must have communcations - at least give us talk-through

and we will use a personal radio."     Radio messages were

still being received and Superintendent Marshall was

calling.   I had my own personal radio and tried to

acknowledge Superintendent Marshall on two or three

occasions, but he was not receiving.     Superintendent

Marshall was still requesting that tannoy messages be passed

about pushing and crushing in Leppings Lane and asked for

the assistance of the PA Landrover in the possession of

Police Constable Buxton.     Police Sergeant Goddard tried to

contact Police Constable Buxton and Police Constable Bichard

was asking Operations Room to send a traffic car with PA
to assist.    The radio suddenly started to function properly,

although this was on talk-through by way of a hand-held

personal radio.



By about 1445 hours I could see from the CCTV that the crowd

outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles was now compacting and

there appeared to be a crush.     A radio request was received

from Superintendent Marshall to open the gates at the

Leppings Lane end to allow the crowd in.      I estimated the

crowd outside the turnstiles to be about two to two and a

half thousand.     He was asked to standby.   Looking at the

CCTV I could see that the mounted officers were being

jostled and appeared to be working singly and were totally

surrounded by people.     Within a very short space of time,

the crowd outside Leppings Lane seemed to have changed from

a large crowd of people to a compacted mass.      Superintendent

Marshall passed another radio message, asking for the gates

at Leppings Lane end to be opened saying that if we didn't

open them, people would be crushed.     At this time,   I could

see that people were climbing over the turnstiles and there

seemed to be very little movement through the A to G

turnstiles.    Inspector Bennett came over the air, asking for

assistance to Leppings Lane.     Police Constable Ryan informed

me that Inspector Sewell had 8 or 10 serials from 'D' Division

at the gymnasium.     I immediately asked him to despatch 5

sergeants and 5 0 men to the Leppings Lane end and keep the

rest on standby.     I was attempting at this stage, to raise Mr.
Locke on the steward's radio to inform him that there were

problems at the Leppings Lane end turnstiles, but received

no reply.



At about 1447 hours a further request was received from

Superintendent Marshall, to open the gates and this was

followed by Police Constable Bichard, telling me that the

'gate's gone' or    'gate's burst'.        I looked at the CCTV and

saw that    'C' gate was open and all who were immediately

outside this gate - about one           hundred - gained access.     A

mounted officer recovered the           situation and the gate was

closed.     This was followed by a        further message from

Superintendent     Marshall, asking for the gates to be opened,

followed almost immediately by a futher message saying,

"Open the gates, open the gates."           I turned to Chief

Superintendent     Duckenfield, who was standing on       the raised

area and said,     "Mr Duckenfield, are we going to open those

gates?"     He replied,    "Open the gates."      Police Sergeant

Goddard then sent out a message to serials at Leppings Lane

end to open the gates.



At about 1449 hours on the CCTV I saw 'C' gate opened.               I

was unable to see    'A'     or   'B'   gates. I saw a mounted

officer controlling the flow through           'C' gate, but he was

either pushed aside or withdrew and a heavy flow then went

into the area behind the west stand.



At about 1450 hours , an urgent request was then received from

a unit behind    'A' gate, which is the exit gate for the north
                                                              15

stand (S20 Police Sergeant Higgins?)    for that gate to be

opened, followed immediately by a request from the same

officer,   "The gate is going to go if we don't open it and

people will be killed."   Chief Superintendent Duckenfield

immediately authorised the gate to be opened and Police

Sergeant Goddard sent out the radio message to that effect.



At about 1452 hours the west stand appeared full.     The

centre two pens of the terrace appeared to be almost full,

but there was still some room at the front of the two wing

pens and in the northern corner of the north west standing

ar e a .



At about 1458 hours I became aware of something happening

behind the west stand goal.   I was unable to see what it was

but the police constable was opening either gates 3 or 4 or

both and a handful of people were coming out onto the track

and walking calmly and slowly towards gate 1.    They then

appeared to stand rather aimlessly on the track and the

police woman standing at gate 1, who was only a few yards

away, was totally unaware of their presence.    There was room

at the front of this pen and it seemed obvious to open this

gate and allow these people in.    Chief Inspector McRobbie

was present in the control room in civilian clothing and

went down onto the track to assist her and draw her

attention to what was happening.



\t about 1459 hours I became aware of people climbing from

the west terrace into the west stand.     (this had been a

Feature of the previous semi-final when large numbers had
climbed from the terrace into the stand, but mainly at half-

time ) .



By about 1500 hours more people were now being helped from

the gates at 3 and 4, onto the track.    No radio traffic was

being received and I was still unaware of the problem, but

considered that there may be some pushing and crushing near

to the wall and that people in that location were being

taken out for re-location in the two wing pens.



At about 1501 hours, the Chief Superintendent asked for

Superintendent Greenwood to go to Leppings Lane end and find

out what was happening.   More people were now being helped

onto the track through the gates and some were climbing over

the perimeter fencing onto the track.



By about 1503 hours more and more people were now

spilling onto the track and were standing on the grass behind

the touchline.   Some were coming over the fence.    People

were still climbing from the terrace, into the stand.

Superintendent Greenwood arrived at the back of the g o a l .   I

could not hear any radio messages, but saw Superintendent

Greenwood, standing head and shoulders above the people at

the back of the goal, gesticulating, by waving his arms.

The message that he was gesticulating, clearly conferred to

me that he wanted the game to be stopped and more and more

people were now spilling onto the grass and over the

touch-line onto the field of play.    I heard Police Sergeant

Goddard say,   "Stop the game, stop the game."   I looked
                                                               17

towards the tunnel and saw no movement.    I hastily grabbed

my hat and coat and Chief Superintendent Duckenfield said,

"Yes, stop it."    I went down from the control room onto the

track and approached the linesman.    He was running down

towards the Leppings Lane end, and as he approached me I

took hold of his arm and said,   "Stop the game."    He ran

straight past and obviously had not heard me and was intent

on his duties.    As I turned to follow him, I saw

Superintendent Greenwood running onto the pitch and stopping

the game.   I then returned immediately to the control room.



On returning to the control room, at about 1505 hours I

could see that more and more people were spilling onto the

pitch and were now scattering over the field, towards the

edge of the penalty area.    I was unaware of any radio

messages being received and of what the problem was, but

some people were sitting on the field.



At about 1506 hours, Police Constable Ryan was passing

messages over the public address system and people on the

field of play were just milling around.    Some were lying

down and it was becoming apparent that there were some

injuries.   Superintendent Duckenfield asked me to go down

onto the field and try and clear people from the goal area

towards the wings.    As I left the control room, I was aware

of Police Constable Bichard requesting an ambulance to stand

by.



On arrival on the field, at about 1507 hours,   I saw that

people appeared shocked and dazed - some were lying on the
ground and were obviously injured.        As I approached the goal

I could not see the gates onto the track as these were

surrounded by police officers, but I could see that people

were apparently jammed hard against the wire fence and their

faces were starting      to discolour.   I was aware that we had a

serious problem and      that many people may be injured.   I was

not in possession of a radio and realised that one or two

ambulances would be insufficient.        I approached two police

constables, neither of whom had radios and then saw a

sergeant and took his radio from him.       I could now see that

some officers were giving mouth to mouth resuscitation to

people lying on the grass and that officers and spectators

were trying to get people over the fence but with little

success.     There was   no apparent movement at the rear of     the

two centre pens and      these people in this area seemed to     be

merely standing and      looking out onto the field.



At about 1508 hours      I called control and was acknowledged.

I asked for a 'fleet of ambulances' as many people appeared

to be injured.     I requested continuous tannoy messages to

the Leppings Lane end to ask people to move back.        I may

also have requested cutting equipment for the fences.          With

other officers,    I attempted to clear other people from the

field, who appeared to be just standing around and getting

in the way of injured people.       Some of these people were in

an agitated state.



At 1510 hours there was still no apparent movement at the

back of the centre pens and people were still spilling onto

the pitch.     I made a further radio request for tannoy
messages for people at Leppings Lane terraces to move back.

There was still no movement and I could see that many police

officers were engaged in the rescue operation along the fence



At about 1514 hours, I made my way to the rear of Leppings

Lane terraces and into the central tunnel.     The tunnel was

almost clear, with about 50 persons in it.     I saw an Inspecto

and with him and other officers, moved people out of the

tunnel and on to the concourse at the rear of the stand.



At about 1522 hours I made my way back to the pitch.

Spectators were encroaching up to the half-way line, some

in angry and threatening mood, saying it was a 'shitty ground

and gesticulating with their arms towards Forest supporters.

A man attempted to climb on top of the goalposts at the

Leppings Lane end, but before he could stand on top of the

posts he was pulled down by police officers.    This invoked

adverse reaction from the crowd.    This man was very drunk

but I instructed officers not to arrest him and he was

allowed to go. I saw that serials were deployed along the

track at the north stand and to a lesser degree along the

Kop, but not along the south stand. I took one serial from

the north stand (Police Sergeant Dyson) and asked them to

re-deploy on the south stand side, near to the half-way

line to prevent supporters encroaching over the half-way

line and causing problems which would hinder the rescue

operation.     A full scale rescue operation was being

carried out.     Advertising hoardings were being used to carry

injured people away and police officers were still giving
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to some injured people.      People

were being carried towards the gymnasium exit and some

towards the players1 tunnel by Liverpool supporters and

police officers.



At about 1525 hours, I was contacted by a senior fire

service officer and asked if I could maintain a clear

gangway in the south stand for the removal of casualties.

This was arranged with two or three police officers and the

help of members of the public in that area, who offered

assistance.



At about 15 30 I spoke to Superintendent Chapman on the

pitch, who said he would look after the Kop end and the

officers deployed there and then spoke to Inspector Wallace,

who said he would look after the north stand and officers

deployed in that area.



At about 1535 hours, I returned to ground control and

appraised the Chief Superintendent of the situation as best

I could.   I told him that there were many injuries and

possibly some fatalities.    At this time there was an

ambulance on the perimeter track and there were still

hundreds of people on the Leppings Lane half of the field.

I saw that some police officers were beginning to deploy

towards the halfway line.    A number of ambulances had taken

up position in the road from the south stand towards

Leppings Lane.     Police control contained the Chief

Superintendent and ACC (Operations).     The Chief

Superintendent left control followed by ACC to visit
Directors and appraise them of the situation.    The control

room was arranging for off-duty police constables to attend

at Hammerton Road Police Station and Casualty Bureau staff

at the ground to attend Bccleafleld.    Assistance was offered

to me by officers of Humberside mounted department, who had

been at the Barnsley football match and I accepted this and

asked them to attend the ground.



At about 1545 hours I spoke with a senior fire officer, who

requested that all ambulances from the south stand/Leppings

Lane side, be transferred to the Penistone Road end - this

was arranged.   About this time, a cordon was being arranged

across the pitch at the halfway line.



A short time later, ground control was visited by Mr Brian

Clough and Mr Kenny Dalgliesh.   Chief Superintendent

Duckenfield spoke to them and advised them that the game

would be abandoned and they may tell the players but he did

not wish to tell the supporters at this stage, as if they

left the ground, they would seriously hamper the rescue

operation by blocking the lines of communication between the

ground and the hospitals.   Both agreed to this course of

action and Mr Dalgliesh spoke to the Liverpool fans by the

public address system and asked them to keep calm and this

was well-received.


                  Nesbit
Chief Superintendent^requested that dog handlers be deployed

and this was arranged and they were asked to go to the

Penistone Road end of the ground for deployment.
About 1610 hours a message was received from ACC

(Operations) Mr Jackson that people in the stadium could be

told that the es/'ent was to be abandoned.    Messages were

passed to Operations Room and Hammerton Road for routes to

be monitored, and arrangements had been made for the early

dispersal of the coaches, public transport and special

trains.     A1 officers were instructed by radio to exercise

sympathy and understanding with people leaving the stadium.



I passed a full public address message informing the whole

stadium that the event had been abandoned and requested that

they retained their tickets and informed them that there had

been a serious incident with many casualties and requested

that people remain in their places for a short while, until

we were sure that all the injured had been carried to

hospital.    This message was repeated twice.



This was well-received and it was not until about ten

minutes later that people started to leave the stadium.        The

stadium slowly empited.    About 1630 hours the Chief

Constable contacted ground control and       was appraised of the

situation by ACC (Operations) Mr Jackson.



Ground Control was visited at different times to my

knowledge by Mr Mackrell, the Club Secretary, the Deputy

Chief Constable of Merseyside,    Senior Fire Officers, the

Production Manager of the BBC team, who offered to put out

the Casualty Enquiry Bureau number.



As the crowd dispersed, reports of fighting were received at
                                                                 23

several locations, including Wadsley Lane, Parkside Road and

'Bassetts' public house on Cowper Avenue and Penistone Road

and mobile serials were dispatched to deal with each

problem.



Liaison was maintained with the Coroner and the Coroner's

Officer.    Initially, authority was given to call out the

firm of Kenyons to deal with the deceased, but this was

later amended to indicate that no bodies should be moved

until they had been photographed and identified at the ground

and then this was to be carried out by the ambulance

service.    All messages were relayed to the gymnasium.



The two centre pens of the Leppings Lane terraces were

searched by a team of Criminal Investigation Department

officers under the control of Detective Sergeant Lindley.

The terraces were later searched on a second occasion by

officers of       'D' Division support group whom I had deployed to

contain this area.       After the second search the area was

'taped o f f '.



About 6.30 pm units were deployed to assist in the area of

the Northern General Hospital after reports had been

received that large numbers of Liverpool supporters were

gathering and problems were feared.        At about 8 pm officers

on reserve duty at Hammerton Road were detailed to contain

the gymnasium after reports that members of the press were

causing problems and trying to gain access to this area.



About 9 pm I took up duties in the temporary mortuary,
                                                             24

counselling officers and liaising with welfare and clerical

workers.



About 10.40 pm I visited Niagara Sports club, where I had

been informed a large number of officers had been taken

suffering from shock, associated with the incident and

assisted in a counselling role.



About 11.30 pm I returned to Hammerton Road Police Station

to check that arrangements had been made for visits by VIP's

who were schedueled to visit later that day and continued

to counsel officers   on duty at that station.



At 0100 hours I retired from duty.

ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD & MURRAY

I refer to your letter of 4 June 1999 to Assistant Chief Constable Ian Daines and subsequent
correspondence regarding the provision of copies of the original statements of 24 named
individuals in the schedule to that letter.

Please find enclosed copies of the various statements made by 23 of the 24 persons named.
Number 19, Peter Carr, did not make any statement, nor officer’s report regarding the disaster.
The two reports he did produce were internal for the use of South Yorkshire Police.

You should also be aware that the statement of number 13, Glen Kirton, whilst typed, produced in
the same format as for other members of the FA and appearing to be an original is unsigned.

ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD & MURRAY

I refer to your letter of 4 June 1999 to Assistant Chief Constable Ian Daines and subsequent
correspondence regarding the provision of copies of the original statements of 24 named
individuals in the schedule to that letter.

Please find enclosed copies of the various statements made by 23 of the 24 persons named.
Number 19, Peter Carr, did not make any statement, nor officer’s report regarding the disaster.
The two reports he did produce were internal for the use of South Yorkshire Police.

You should also be aware that the statement of number 13, Glen Kierton, whilst typed, produced in
the same format as for other members of the FA and appearing to be an original is unsigned.

I have also copied the original statement of Susan Elizabeth Davies requested in your letter dated
24 June 1999 and this is numbered 25 on the attached schedule.

Please note that I have NOT copied any of these statements to either defendant.

              Dear Ms Adlington

             AdJington v Duckenfleld and Murray

             I refer to your fax of 23 June 1999. I will ask Mr Hepworth to provide you with copies of the
             original signed statements to which you refer. I have spoken to him and he tells me that
             there are some difficulties. For example there are statements by more than one person in
             one of the names to which you refer. I will ask Mr Hepworth to contact you direct about
             these matters and to forward the statements to you. I note your assurance that you do not
             envisage the need to ask for any more statements for the committal proceedings.

              Mr Lang died on 5 September 1990, at Barnsley.                      Mr Creaser died on 3 June 1996, at
              Barnsley

             My solicitor, Peter Metcalfe, has forwarded to me your letter to him of 4 June 1999. Your
             letter to Mr Metcalfe included a copy of your letter to Mr Croston, Crown Prosecution Service.
             At paragraph 56, of your letter to Mr Croston you say that you have sent a copy of your letter
             to the Police Complaints Authority and to the former Coroner. Your letter quotes widely from
             the Chief Constable's briefing notes. I produced that document to the court at Leeds as
             required by a witness summons. You have now furnished it to other people including the
             former Coroner who is no longer a public servant I do not think you should have done that
             without the permission of the court. I do not propose to make an issue of this case but If
             there are further such cases I will be obliged to take the matter further.

              Yours sincerely

                                            Adlington v Duckenfield and Murray

            As you are the custodian o f all original statements relating to the Hillsborough Disaster, it has
            not been possible for me to ascertain which statements comply with the requirements o f
            section 102 Magistrates’ Court Act 1980. Copy statements in my possession are, in the main,
            computer generated. You have previously refused witnesses access to their original
            statements quoting CPS guidance. It is understood that these will be produced to the court if
            ordered, and if available.

            At this stage it is imperative that I at least have copies o f the original signed statements so that
            I can fulfil my duty to the court and the defence. In the circumstances I should be grateful if
            you would provide me with copy signed statements of those persons listed in the attached
            schedule.


              Yours faithfully

               Dear Peter

               Hillsborough Stadium Disaster 1989

               I attach a fax from Ms Ann Adlington. It was sent at 14.38 hours, Friday 2 July 1999. I saw it
               when I returned to the office on Monday 5 July 1999.

               She says she has received 24 out of 25 statements, as requested. She then says that she
               has not received 4 statements. ) will ask Mr Hepworth (Hillsborough archivist) to explain this
               to me when he is next at work.

                In connection with Ms Adlington's penultimate paragraph, I would be obliged to receive your
                advice. She asks that I produce all original statements to the Leeds Magistrate on
                6 July 1999. This is a new proposal and I would be obliged to receive your advice on
                whether I should (or must) comply with this request.

                Yours sincerely

                  Dear Peter

                  Hillsborough Stadium Disaster 1980

                 I attach a fax from Ms Ann Adlington, It was sent at 14.38 hours, Friday 2 July 1999. I saw it
                 when I returned to the office on Monday 5 July 1999.

                  She says she has received 24 out of 25 statements, as requested. She then says that she
                  has not received 4 statements. I will ask Mr Hepworth (Hillsborough archivist) to explain this
                  to me when he is next at work.

                  In connection with Ms Adlington's penultimate paragraph, I would be obliged to receive your
                  advice. She asks that I produce all original statements to the Leeds Magistrate on
                  6 July 1999. This is a new proposal and I would be obliged to receive your advice on
                  whether I should (or must) comply with this request.

                  Yours sincerely

                      Dear Ian

                      HiHsborogflh Stadium Disaster 1989

                      Thank you for your fax o f today. Further to our telephone conversation my views are as follows:-

                                      1.       You have no legal obligation to produce original Statements to the Court.

                                     2. On the other hand if the presence of original Statements at Court is a formal requirement
                                        to allow the proceedings to continue then it might be regarded as o b s t r u c t iv e not to
                                        produce them

                                     3.        In particular if the committal proceedings are then adjourned or even abandoned it may
                                               well be suggested that this is all down to the South Yorkshire Police failing to carry out
                                               what would be a normal function o f a Police force in relation to prosecution.

                      My inclination therefore is to produce the Statements but before doing so 1 think rhat further
                      information is needed and I would suggest a reply to Ms Adlington along the following lines:-

                                     a) Pointing out that the request is something o f a supnse as it has not previously been
                                        suggested that the original Statements are needed and further pointing out that the
                                        request did not come to your attention uniil today.

                                     b)        Asking her to explain precisely why original Statements are now needed when it
                                               previously seemed that copies would suffice.

    Dear Peter

    Hillsborough Stadium Disaster 1989

    I attach a fax from Ms Ann Adlington. It was sent at 14.38 hours, Friday 2 July 1999. I saw it
    when I returned to the office on Monday 5 July 1999.

    She says she has received 24 out of 25 statements, as requested. She then says that she
    has not received 4 statements. I will ask Mr Hepworth (Hillsborough archivist) to explain this
    to me when he is next at work.

    In connection with Ms Adlington’s penultimate paragraph, I would be obliged to receive your
    advice. She asks that I produce all original statements to the Leeds Magistrate on
    6 July 1999. This is a new proposal and ! would be obliged to receive your advice on
    whether I should (or must) comply with this request.

    Yours sincerely

Dear Ms Adlington

I refer to your fax of the afternoon of Friday 2 July 1999, I read this when I returned to the
office on Monday 5 July 1999. I have asked for legal advice from my solicitor but I have not
yet received that in writing.

I am fully committed on Tuesday 6 July 1999 and cannot, at such short notice, respond to
your request that I attend court with the statements to which you refer. When I receive legal
advice I will look afresh at the position.

You must appreciate that I have many other                          duties    besides      dealing      with   the
Hillsborough Stadium Disaster on 15 April 1989.

Yours sincerely

 Dear Ian

 HiHsboroueh Stadium Disaster 1989

 Thank you for your fax of today. Further to our telephone conversation my views are as follows:

              1.     You have no legal obligation to produce original Statements to the Court.

             2.      On the other hand if the presence of original Statements at Court is a formal requirement
                     to allow the proceedings to continue then it might be regarded as obstructive not to
                     produce them.

              3.     In particular if the committal proceedings are then adjourned or even abandoned it may
                     well be suggested that this is all down to the South Yorkshire Police failing to carry out
                     what would be a normal function of a Police force in relation to prosecution.

 My inclination therefore is to produce the Statements but before doing so I think that further
 information is needed and I would suggest a reply to Ms Adlington along the following lines:-

              a) Pointing out that the request is something of a suprise as it has not previously been
                 suggested that the original Statements are needed and further pointing out that the
                 request did not come to your attention until today.

              b) Asking her to explain precisely why original Statements are now needed when it
                 previously seemed that copies would suffice.

Dear Ms Adlington

I refer to my fax of the afternoon of 5 July 1999. I have now received legal advice from my
solicitor, Peter Metcalfe. His advice is that I have no legal obligation to produce original
statements to the court. However, if their production is necessary to allow the proceedings
to continue efficiently then I would not wish to be obstructive by not producing them. I must
say that your request came as something of a surprise as you had not previously suggested
that the original statements would be needed. I must also say that your request cam e to my
attention on the morning of Monday 5 July 1999, by which time the committal proceedings
had already begun, having been scheduled some months ago.

I would ask you to explain why original statements are now needed when previously copies
were sufficient. I would also ask you to explain what you mean by producing the statements
at court. Are you suggesting that I should be there in person? Are you suggesting that the
statements should be handed to a named member of court staff? Are you suggesting that
the statements be handed to you? If you are suggesting that the statements be handed to
you, I would require your undertaking, as a solicitor, that the statements be kept in safe
custody and returned immediately after the hearing unless, of course, the court orders that
they remain at the court.

Subject to a satisfactory response to the above I will be able to allow the original statements
to be produced.

In recent days I have received a number of faxes from you, the content of some overlaps
with the content of others. I have tried my best to respond to each either directly or by
asking Mr Hepworth to supply you with information. I do have many other duties, besides
dealing with the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster, and it would help me to reply to you properly
if you could furnish me with a consolidated schedule of outstanding requests that are
relevant to the committal.

Yours sincerely

Dear Ms Adlington

Thank you for your fax of 12.22 hours, 13 July 1999.

You are asking for copies of the original statements of Lang, Crawford, Creaser, White and
Steve Curry. You are also asking for Detective Sergeant Carr’s report.

I cannot comply with your request that the documents be at Leeds Magistrates Court at
2.00 pm, Thursday 15 July 1999, that is only two days notice. Mr Hepworth and I have other
commitments.    The magistrate will rule on whether the case should proceed.              If the
magistrate allows the case to proceed, I will make arrangements for the statements to be
forwarded to you subject to the condition in paragraph 2, last two lines of my fax of 6 July.

On 2 July 1999, you asked for a copy of the statement of James Lawton. You undertook to
forward Mr Lawton's authority for its release. I have just received his authority and I will ask
Mr Hepworth to forward the statement to you.

Yours sincerely

   Assistant Chief Constable
   South Yorkshire Police
   Snig Hill
   Sheffield S3 8LY

   Dear Mr Daines

   Adlington v Duckenfield andMurray

   I thank you for today’s fax referring to your fax o f 6* July. Unfortunately, I was unable to
   respond to your earlier fox as I was away from the office for the whole oflast week.

   In response to my request for original statements please find enclosed copy letter from Mr
   Metcalfe dated 6* January 1999 m which he confirms that South Yorkshire Police would
   produce original documentation if ordered by a Court of competent jurisdiction. Although
   such an order has not been made I confirm that production of the originals is necessary to
   allow the proceedings to continue efficiently

   For a statement to be tendered in evidence at committal proceedings as opposed to calling a
   witness to give live evidence, an original statement must tendered which complies with Section
   102 Magistrates* Court Act 1980. I have been requesting the Defence for some time to
   indicate which witness statements could be read out In the absence of any written indication
   by the Defence, the Magistrate, on 26* April and 10® May, dedined to order the production of
   original statements on the grounds that where a witness gives live evidence, his previous
   written statement is superseded by his deposition at committal.

   I wrote to you on 4* June explaining that at that stage I needed to ascertain which of our
   witness statements complied with the requirements of Section 102

   You responded by forwarding copies of the original statements of 24 of the 25 witnesses. I
   subsequently wrote on 2nd July requesting that you produce all original statements to the Court
   including those of Lang, Crawford, Creaser and White referred to in that letter, copies of
   which you had previously omitted to send. I further asked that you produce the original
   statement of Steve Curry.

            As to the timing of production I should be grateful if you would have them available for
            production to the Court on Thursday 15* July at 2pm At 11 am on that day the Stipendiary
            will make a ruling on “abuse of process”. Obviously; we will not know until then whether
            committal proceedings wifi in fact continue I am sorry that I cannot give you a more definite
            indication. As you will appreciate, such matters are beyond my control.

            Please note that we also require you to produce the original of DS Carr’s report as this will be
            put in evidence under scction 24 Criminal Justice Act 1988.

            Finally, 1 still await copy statement of Mr Lawton requested on 2”*July.

            I ann conscious that you do have other duties besides dealing with the Hillsborough Stadium
            Disaster. Jf Mr Hepworth has any queries relating to the above, he may speak to me directly.

               Private Prosecutions - Release of Documentation

               Thank you for your fax timed at 11:47 on 5 January i 999

               I must say at the outset that your request for a response by 5:00 pm yesterday was unrealistic Both
               I and, more particularly, the Assistant Chief Constable have other responsibilities besides dealing
               with your correspondence. It seems to me that your request for an urgent response has been
               dictated by your linking the issue o f disclosure of documents from the Hillsborough archive with the
               hearing dealing with your Application for a Witness Summons

                   Wc have already made it clear that we do not regard the two issues as connected and the
                   Application for the Witness Summons will be resisted if persisted with

                   I f you are linking the two issues then it was clearly not sensible for your Leading Counsel to urge the
                   Stipendiary Magistrate to re-list the matter for hearing so quickly, but that is a problem entirely o f
                   your own making.

                   Turning to the substance o f your fetter I note that you still do not actually indicate whether or not
                   you will be taking up the disclosure offer which was made a week ago.

                   To deal with the different points which you do raise:-'

                   I.              Subject to the previously mentioned points made at ] (priority) and 2.3 (materiality) o f my
                                   letter o f 30 December 1998, we have no objection to you personally, as a qualified practising
                                   solicitor, examining documentation rather than taking copies I f you wish lawyers other than

                          yourself to be involved you must state who they are and confirm their legally qualified status.
                          I f the Defence wish to inspect documentation they will have to ask

                          What must be clearly understood is that there are cost implications in providing the
                          documentation for inspection and the sarnie charge as previously mentioned will apply in
                          respect o f the sorting o f documents to and from the archive, the provision o f inspection
                          facilities and the presence o f the documents' officer to deal with any queries.

                   2.     Turning to the question o f production o f original documentation the first point to be made is
                          that if a Court o f competent jurisdiction orders the production o f any documentation then
                          such an Order will o f course be complied with

                          Subject to that 1 should say that the original CPS guidance was that it would be
                          inappropriate for original statements to be-removed from the main Hillsborough archive
                          Their suggestion was that if copy statements had been provided then it should be a simple
                          matter for new originals to be prepared by the prosecution and used in Court proceedings.

                          As to other evidence I have not inspected the archive but 1 believe that a very large number
                          o f the items in it will themselves be copies rather than original items. Where however an item
                          is clearly identified as original and is required for production at Court then subject to the
                          Court agreeing to accept custody of that item 1 would not anticipate this presenting any
                          problem.

Dear Ms Adlington

On 6 July 1999, I sent a fax to you (copy attached). I asked you to help me by providing a
consolidated list of your outstanding requests.     To date I have not received a reply.
Mr Hepworth works part time as the Hillsborough Disaster archivist. He is due at work today
and usually works only one day a week. If I am to assist you it would help me if you would
reply to my previous fax.

Yours sincerely

D ear Ms Adlington

I refer to my fax of the afternoon of 5 July 1999. I have now received legal advice from my
solicitor, Peter Metcalfe. His advice is that I have no legal obligation to produce original
statements to the court. However, if their production is necessary to allow the proceedings
to continue efficiently then I would not wish to be obstructive by not producing them. I must
say that your request came as something of a surprise as you had not previously suggested
that the original statements would be needed. I must also say that your request came to my
attention on the morning of Monday 5 July 1999, by which time the committal proceedings
had already begun, having been scheduled some months ago.

I would ask you to explain why original statements are now needed when previously copies
were sufficient. I would also ask you to explain what you mean by producing the statements
at court. Are you suggesting that I should be there in person? Are you suggesting that the
statements should be handed to a named member of court staff? Are you suggesting that
the statements be handed to you? If you are suggesting that the statements be handed to
you, I would require your undertaking, as a solicitor, that the statements be kept in safe
custody and returned immediately after the hearing unless, of course, the court orders that
they remain at the court.

Subject to a satisfactory response to the above I will be able to allow the original statements
to be produced.

In recent days I have received a number of faxes from you, the content of some overlaps
with the content of others. I have tried my best to respond to each either directly or by
asking Mr Hepworth to supply you with information. I do have many other duties, besides
dealing with the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster, and it would help me to reply to you properly
if you could furnish me with a consolidated schedule of outstanding requests that are
relevant to the committal.

Yours sincerely

39 YEARS




CHIEF INSPECTOR




SOOTH YORKSHIRE POLICE,               SNIG HILL,    SHEFFIELD.   S3 8LR




I am a Chief Inspector in the South Yorkshire Police at prosent attached

to the Conununi cat ions and Computer development Department,              Police

Headquarters,        Snig- Hill,      Sheffield.




I have been a Police Officer for twenty years and have considerable

experience of policing football matches.                   I have performed duty at the

following five football               league grounds in South Yorkshire:




Shef f ield Wednesday          (Hi 11 sboroug'h )

Sheff ield United              (Rra rm. 11 Lane)

Rotherham United               (Mi 11 moor)

Barnsley                        Oak we 11 >
                                                                  2



The bulk of this experience has been at Hillsborough,       where I have

worked at numerous football matches,       These have included Football

League and FA Cup matches including FA Cup Semi-finals.




Hillsborough is situated within the 'F'       (Sheffield North) Division of

the South Yorkshire Police.




The first time I performed duty at Hillsborough for an FA Cup semi-final

was as a uniform patrol sergeant in 1977,




In 1981 I was posted to ' F ’   Division   (Sheffield North) as a uniform

patrol    Inspector and I remained within the Division until the end of

1987;    during that time I frequently performed football duties at

Hillsborough.




I have been on duty at the Leppings Lane end of Hillsborough Stadium for

the FA Cup Semi-final Hatches held in the last three years.




I have performed duty at most places within the ground although the

majority of my experience has been at the Leppings Lane end of the

ground.




Shortly after Hillsborough was selected as the venue for the Semi-final

between Liverpool PC     and Nottingham Forest FC I was contacted by

telephone by     Chief Superintendent Mole,    the then Divisional Commander

of 'F' Division,    who conf irmed my aval 1ibl ;ity and requested that I work
                                                                          3


at   the match.    He stated that it would be his intention for rae to work

at   the Leppings Lane end of the ground.




Eight days pi for to the Seiai-final taking place J received an Operation.

Order.     A comprehensive,      yellow bound,    document which contained details

of   how       the event would be organised.          Over the next few days Imade a

detailed study of this document and,            in particular,   the areas of the

ground where I would be supervising officers.




On Saturday 15th April 1989 I reported for duty at the ground at.

approximately 9.30am.         I was in possession of my Operation Order at this

time.




My areas of responsibility were for that part of the ground which was to

be occupied,      in the main,   by Liverpool     supporters and for the outside of

the ground at the Lappings lane end.




The following Inspectors were allocated to jay command with areas of

responsibility as indicated below:




1nspector    Woodward                Worth Stand    (upper & lower level)

Inspector    Bui las                 Vest Stand

Inspector    White                   Leppings Lane Terrace & Rear Enclosure

Inspectors Sykes)                    Leppings Lane Turnstiles

             Purely)

Inspectors Delaney        )      -   Reserves

              Berresford >
                                                               4



I have previously personally      performed duty at all    the above locations

at the rank of Inspector,      I have previously     worked at Football matches

with all the above officers with the exception of Inspector Purdy.




The pre-match police briefing was given in the North Stand         (Cop end) and

commenced at approximately 10. Oant,     It was a comprehensive briefing and

there was input from Chief Superintendent Duckenfield,        Inspector Sewell

and Detective Sergeant Charleswarth.




Immediately following the briefing I sought out all the above named

Inspectors and I personally handed      to them written   (photocopy)   details

of criminal, intelligence which had been collated concerning people

likely to attend   the match from both Liverpool     and Nottingham.




I spoke to each of the    inspectors a n d   mentioned points which I

consider ed to be of par ticular i mportance as far as their own area of

responsibility was concerned.      I knew that    inspectors Sykes and White

both had vast experion.ee of policing at Hillsborough and intimate

know]edge of the duties they had been allocated.




Following the briefing unti l approximately 2.0pm no matters of

particular note took place,      I spent this time 'walking the ground*

speaking to Inspectors,    serial sergeants and constables.




Additionally I spoke   to many of the Sheffield Wednesday FC stewards who

I know (by sight but not name),      I noticed that these men appeared to be

working at locations where I had previously seen them operate .          During
                                                                  5



the course of the morning I saw,     and heard part of, a briefing given by

Inspector White to these stewards.      This briefing took place in the Vest

Stand.




It was my information that the first      turnstiles would be opened at 12

noon.    In fact a smal]   number were opened prior   to this and a   few

spectators entered at the Lappings Lane end of the ground and went into

the Leppings Lane Terraces in the centre pens.




At approximately 12 noon I visited the Police Control Room and there

spoke to Superintendent Murray.      I asked him if   he had any preference

as to the manner in which the spectators should       be allowed to fill the

Leppings Lane Terraces.      I was informed that the filling of the fenced

pens would be allowed to take place in a natural      fashion and that no

control would be exercised by the police on the supporters regarding

which particular pen would be be filled.     This instruction was exactly

in-line with the instruction given the previous year when Liverpool

supporters had occupied the same parts of the stadium.       I only raised

this question because I was aware that on previous occasions different

methods had been used to accommodate spectators.




As people started to enter the stadium I could see the usual mixture of

supporters.   They were iri good spirits and obviously looking forward to

what had been forecast as a n interesting game between the two teams.




Shortly after 2.15pm I visited Leppings Lane where I spoke to Inspector

Sykes.   There was a contingent of Liverpool supporters standing in
Leppings Lane on the opposite aide of the road to the stadium,      We

discussed the raeri t of encouraging these people across the road to queue

for entry to the stadium.     Marty of these were openly drinking from cans

of beer and lager;   they were not at this time causing any trouble.

After discussion we agreed that such a course of action was not

necessary as there was a reasonable quantity of supporters already

forming queues outside the turnstiles.     Furthermore it was considered

that to move these people at this stage m a y inflame the crowd.




As time progressed towards the scheduled kick-off time it became

apparent that a large number of Liverpool supporters were still outside

the ground in Leppings Lane and in the queues to the turnstiles.         I

noticed at this time that the proportion of supporters who had obviously

been drinking increased.    They were however at this time only a minority

and were not causing any disruption.      Many of the fans who arrived were

unsure of the geographical layout of the turnstiles which gave

admittance to the Forth Stand,   the Leppings Lane Terraces and Elevated

Section and the West Stand.    The signs above the turnstiles were not

clear and many fans were confused;    a specific example of this was the

alphabetic character displayed above the turnstile and the alphabetic

character shown on the ticket as the gangway to be used for access to

the Vest Stand were in apparent cant 11ct.    It was necessary for Police

Officers to give constant assistance in this respect.




At approximately 2.30pm I could see that difficulties were being

experienced in the build up to the tiu nstiies which were allocated to
                                                                7




the Worth Stand,    the Vest Stand and the helpings Lane Terraces            -   all

these three locations are fed from Leppings Lane.      From this point until

after 3.0pm I continued to monitor and supervise the Leppings Lane end

of the ground on the outside.




I was with Inspector Sykes when he caused the flow of traffic to stop in

Leppings Lane in order to facilitate more opportunity for the ever-

increasing pedestrian traffic to make progress.




I have considerable experience of policing this particular area and I

could see that the build-up of supporters was later than usually the

case and there appeared to be larger numbers.     The operation was

frustrated more so by the presence of a considerable number of fans who

had arrived in the vicinity of the ground but were not in possession of

tickets entitling    them entry to what was an ‘all   ticket'       match.

Furthermore many Liverpool   fans arrived at the Leppings Lane end of the

ground in possession of tickets which entitled them admission to the

Spion Cop and attempted to seek approval   to enter at the Leppings lane

end with friends who had legitimate tickets for that area.




The situation outside the turnstiles,   particularly those leading to the

Leppings Lane Terraces,   was such that by approximately 2.40pm a

situation had arisen whereby there was a large crowd of supporters who

were all pushing towards the turnstiles but the turnstiles could not

accept them quickly enough to permit entry to the ground.            The mood of

this crowd was changing from a good natured crowd to a frustrated crowd

who could perhaps see that they had little chance ox gaining access
                                                                   3



prior to the start, of the match.          The proportion of spectators who had

been drinking increased as time progressed but they were outnumbered by

people who did not exhibit, any signs of drink,




Within this crowd there     were at least      two or three police horses who

were attempting to stop the pushing.           It has always been my experience

that horses are able to control such a situation but it was             obvious in

this instance that this     was not the case.




A police constable was allocated to the outside of              each of the

turnstiles for the Leppings Lane terraces.           These officers were given

the task of preventing supporters entering the ground in possession of

weapons,   banners,   alcohol etc.       This searching action did not impede the

rate of flow of spectators      through the turnstiles.           Because of the

intense pressure from the surging crowd it was necessary to withdraw

those officers from that position;         a decision taken by Inspector Purdy

which I fully supported.




With a view to reducing the area covered by the police horses I

instructed officers to close the gates which are situated away from the

turnstiles next to the river         -    I did this because fans were using this

gate to get around the horses.




The crush within the crowd was such that people were suffering and there

was the possibility of severe        injuries taking place,       1 saw two or three

bodies of young persons passed over the heads of members of the crowd,

these people either had,     or were close to,      fainting.
                                                                         S)


At approximately 2.45pm I re-joined              Inspector Sykes in. Leppings Lane

and we adopted a strategy of forming a line of police horses at the rear

of the crowd with a view to preventing the queues at the turnstiles

becoming larger.       This took some    ..iae    1,0   arrange.   There were gaps

between one police horse and the next one and I attempted to arrange for

a police officer to 'plug' each gap.              Many supporters approached this

line and forced their way through despite firm advice not to do so.                  I

even saw a supporter crawl under the belly of a horse in order to breach

the line.




I could see that same people were climbing over                the top of the

turnstiles in order to gain admittance to the stadium and at one point I

recall seeing Inspector      Bennett    CP'   Division) on top of the wall above

the turnstiles serving the Leppings Lane Terraces.




Some minutes later I attempted to contact Police Control by radio but

could not do so;      there appeared to be a fault with my particular radio

(a Pye PFX personal band-held radio)             in that it was receiving but I

could not transmit.       I approached Police Constable Buxton who was at

this time in a Police Landrover.         This vehicle was parked in Leppings

Lane and the officer was giving instructions to the supporters by means

of a public address system.        He was urging the spectators not to push

forward.     I requested Police Constable Buxton to suggest to the Control

Room that consideration be given to delaying the kick-off time of the

match   (his radio,    a Motorola HT600E hand-held radio appeared to be

functioning well).        This suggestion was apparently not acted upon.
                                                                  10



At approximately this time I was able to see that the large 'concertina'

gates,   known as A, B, and C had been opened and that a large proportion

of the crowd surged forward through these gates.        These gates were only

opened for a snort period of time and I could see officers/stewards at

the rear of the gates apparently struggling to close them,       which they

were subsequently able to do.    It is my impression that Gate C remained

open for a longer priod than the others.    As a result of this action the

pressure on the turnstiles reduced although supporters were still

arriving at the ground.    This action clearly had the result of easing

the tension outside the turnstiles although the crowd there were still

pushing forward.




A short time later,   I would estimate just after 3.0pm,     there was a

request for all officers to attend inside the ground to deal with an .

apparent invasion of the surface playing area.      I did not hear the

specific radio transmission but I did hear officers around me saying

words to the effect of ‘all officers i aside - pitch invasion'.




I immediatley attended inside the ground and went to the rear of the

goal at the Leppings Lane end of the stadium.      I could see that people

were trapped and that the gates from the centre pens were open and

people were coming through them.    There was considerable confusion.

Some supporters were climbing over the fences,    they were assisted to do

so by police officers and by other supporters,          I assisted in the

general activity of lifting injured and apparently dead people from the

Leppings Lane Terraces onto the playing area.      I was present at this

location prior to a 'private'   ambulance arr    ing,     I gave instructions
                                                             11



to some officers in an attempt to co-ordinate what was happening.       I can

recall in particular     instructing police Constable Goodwill    CF'

Division) to act as the Communications Officer for Superintendent

Greenwood v.-ho   was obviously having difficulty dealing with his radio

and assisting in the operation.




A short time later I attended at the gymnasium situated inside the

stadium.    I was there concerned in the organisation of a temporary

mortuary.   My primary tasks were ensuring that each victim brought

inside was examined by a doctor to confirm death and to allocate an

individual police officer   to each victim   to deal with the formalities

which would follow.




I later acted as a logistical officer and was engaged in the liaison

between the police,
            *.     ’ social workers,   relatives and identification teams.

I continued with this work until retiring from duty at 5.0am the

foIlowing morni n g .

Dear Ms Adlington

I refer to the fax, timed 17.37 on 15 July 1999, by Kathy Durham. Ms Durham that it is
imperative that I forward Mr Lawton’s statement before he gives evidence on 19 July 1999. I
must point out that Mr Lawton’s authorisation for the release of his statement came only a
few days ago.

I must again point out to you that I do have other duties and find it really difficult to respond to
your requests which come with such urgency and at such short notice. You are well aware
that Mr Hepworth (Hillsborough Disaster Archivist) works part time and it is my
understanding that he will not be in the office until Tuesday of next week. I will ask him to
look for Mr Lawton’s statement as soon as he comes to work and to fax it to you with
reasonable haste.

Yours sincerely




Assistant Chief Constable

         Dear Sir

         Adlington v Duckenfiekt and Murray

             Ann Arlington has requested that I contact you, as she is presently away from the office
             attending Leeds Magistrates’ court.

             In view o f the Stipendiary Magistrate's ruling today at Leeds Magistrates’ Court, it is
             imperative that we receive by fax a copy o f James Lawton’s statement requested on 2 July, It
             is our intention to call him as a witness on Monday 19 July in the Committal proceedings. I
             understand that Mr Hepworth is not going to be in the offioe until next week, and trust that
             this will not delay an immediate response.


             Yours faithfully

   Dear Mr Daines

   Adlington v Duckenfield and Murray
   Statement by James Lawton

   Your letter was fexed to Ann Adlington today at Leeds Magistrates’ Court where Alun Jones
   QC brought it, and the relevant correspondence, to the attention o f the Stipendiary Magistrate.
   There has been a strong indication by the Stipendiary Magistrate that this statement must be
   faxed no later than Monday morning. The Defence have also indicated their support for this
   statement to be faxed.

   Obviously the witness needs to refresh his memory and the Defence needs a copy in advance
   for the purposes o f cross-examination. Can you, therefore, fax Mr Lawton’s statement to this
   office immediately.

                                                                            'lo

                     Dear Ms Adlington

                    f refer to the fax, timed 17.37 on 15 July 1999, by Kathy Durham. Ms Durham that it is
                    imperative that I forward Mr Lawton's statement before he gives evidence on 19 July 1999. I
                    must point out that Mr Lawton’s authorisation for the release of his statement came only a
                    few days ago.

                     I must again point out to you that I do have other duties and find it really difficult to respond to
                     your requests which come with such urgency and at such short notice. You are well aware
                     that Mr Hepworth (Hillsborough Disaster Archivist) works part time and it is my
                     understanding that he will not be in the office until Tuesday of next week. I will ask him to
                     look for Mr Lawton’s statement as soon as he comes to work and to fax it to you with
                     reasonable haste.

    Dear Ms Adlington

    Thank you for your fax of 12.22 hours, 13 July 1999.

    You are asking for copies of the original statements of Lang, Crawford, Creaser, White and
    Steve Curry. You are also asking for Detective Sergeant Carr’s report.

    I cannot comply with your request that the documents be at Leeds Magistrates Court at
    2.00 pm, Thursday 15 July 1999, that is only two days notice. Mr Hepworth and I have other
    commitments. The magistrate will rule on whether the case should proceed.                 If the
    magistrate allows the case to proceed, I will make arrangements for the statements to be
    forwarded to you subject to the condition in paragraph 2, last two lines of my fax of 6 July.

    On 2 July 1999, you asked for a copy of the statement of James Lawton. You undertook to
    forward Mr Lawton's authority for its release. I have just received his authority and I will ask
    Mr Hepworth to forward the statement to you.

    Yours sincerely




                                                                     .

      Dear M r Daines


      AcUington v Diickenfie/J and Murray

      I have just spoken by telephone to James Lawton, Chief Sports Writer, Sunday Express. He
      has authorised me to request a copy o f the statement he made on or about 15"' M ay 1989
      relating to the disaster. Unfortunately, he is unable to provide me with a written authority to
      release his statement today, as he is reporting from Wimbledon. He will however forward
      such authority next week.


      In these unusual circumstances 1 should be grateful if you would accept my word for this and
      supply a copy o f his statement at this stage. (By fax if possible). 1 undertake to forward M r
      Lawton’ s authority to you as soon as it is received.

      I am writing under separate cover acknowledging receipt o f copy statements forwarded by M r
      Hepworth on 28"’ June.



      Yours faithfully

Dear Ms Adlington

ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD

I refer to your letter dated 2 July 1999 addressed to Assistant Chief Constable Ian Daines,
acknowledging receipt of the copies of 44 original statements made by some 24 witnesses in
respect of the Hillsborough Disaster, which I had forwarded to you on 28 June last. You also
asked Mr Daines to note that I had not supplied copy original statements from four former South
Yorkshire police officers and he in turn has asked me to search the HOLMES database and the
Hillsborough Archive to ascertain if I can locate these statements. This I have now done and I will
deal with each named individual in turn.

Anthony Gordon LANG (deceased) statem ent dated 30 June 1990. A search of the West
Midlands Police HOLMES database does not reveal the existence of a statement by LANG
bearing this date. A manual search of the Archive has also failed to reveal any further statements
other than the undated statement bearing the reference numbers R333 and S1074 and the
statement dated 1 June 1989 bearing the reference numbers R333A and S1074A, copies of which
I have forwarded to you. I do note however that at paragraph 20 of your letter dated 3 June 1999
to Mr George Croston of the CPS Casework Directorate you make specific reference to the
statement of PC LANG dated 30 June 1999 and I presume you have a copy of it. If there is any
reference number written on that copy and you could communicate it to me it may help me locate
the original. (Unfortunately I have not seen Appendix E to your letter).

W illiam Cameron CRAW FORD unam ended statem ent dated 28 April 1989. A search of the
Hillsborough Archive revealed a hand-written statement by Sergeant CRAWFORD, dated
28 April 1989, which had been given the same reference number, R170 as the typed statement, a
copy of which I forwarded to you earlier.

Robert W allace CREASER (deceased) unamended statem ent dated 3 May 1989. I am unable
to find any original statement made by Chief Inspector CREASER that bears the date 3 May 1989.
I have however found an original typed undated statement signed by that officer that I believe may
be the one to which you are referring. Once again this statement has been given the same
reference number R252 as the typed, signed statement which I copied to you earlier. I will explain
the significance of the dates on the HOLMES statement printouts later in this letter.




                                                 The person dealing with this correspondence is:
                                                 Mr A M Hepworth
                                                 (0114)296 3084

19 July 1999

Ms A Adlington




Harry W HITE unamended statem ent dated 2 May 1989. I am unable to find any original
statement made by Inspector W HITE that bears the date 2 May 1989, but in searching the archive
I have found an original, hand-written undated statement, which I believe may be the original of the
one to which you are referring. This statement again bears the same reference number R215,
(although it is not really visible on the photocopy) as the typed signed statement I forwarded to you
earlier.

I enclose for your information copies of the statements of Sergeant CRAWFORD, Chief Inspector
CREASER and Inspector W HITE to which I have referred above. I apologise for not finding these
statements during my first search of the archive, but by way of explanation I would point out that
when statements are first registered on HOLMES they are given a numerical reference number. A
second statement by the same individual gets the same numerical reference with the letter A
added. A third statement has the letter B added to the reference and so on. To identify
statements and locate them in the archive I firstly interrogate the HOLMES database by name to
identify the reference numbers of the statements made by an individual. I did not expect two
statements to bear the same number.

Moving now to the dates on the HOLMES statement printouts. The very first line on the printout
shows the date on which the printout was obtained. The date on the first page of a HOLMES
statement printout below name, age, address, occupation and telephone number of the person
making it is a blank to be filled in by the indexer first registering the statement on the HOLMES
system and normally the indexer would type in the date the statement was made, but if the box is
left blank the HOLMES system has a default date that automatically goes into that box, this being
the date the transaction is being carried out. To change it or delete it that date has to be
overtyped. I therefore believe that the dates on the copies of the statements of Robert CREASER
and Harry W HITE that are in your possession are the transaction dates for their entry on the
HOMES system not the original dates of the statements.

I hope you find the above information useful.

Yours sincerely




A M Hepworth
Hillsborough Archivist

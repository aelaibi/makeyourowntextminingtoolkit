The     three      of us had several           conversations about      going    to a Liverpool

game at Anfield when the Semi-Final                    draw took      place we decide d to

a tt e nd this game         between Liverpool        and N o tt i n g h a m Forest at

H il lsborough,          Sheffield.


                                                 I\**L Mo ^ (CtxJ
N one    of the three oj^us            had tickets and       it was decided that we would

go to the garne/md try to obtain tickets at the ground.



At 5. 10arn (0510)          on S a t ur d ay   15th April    1989    (150489)    David and     Ian

came to my home address                in Ians    car and we j ou rneyed up the Ml

motorway        towards Sheffield.



We stopped on one of the M o t o rw a y services                to obtain       petrol,

newspapers          etc.



Due     to the time of arrival             in S h ef fi el d which was about 9.1 5 a m       (0915)

the same date we did not meet with any                      crowds   or football     traffic.



I have     been shown a diagram of H i l l s b or o ug h and            referring    to that     I

can say that we            parked the      car about    fifteen minutes walk awa y from

the ground along Fen is to ne Road N orth towards S he f fi e ld C ity Centre.

The     location was        near to a 8 &• G ; D.I.Y store.



The     three      of us wa lk ed down P en istone Road N or th towards             the ground,

The     streets were v i rt ua ll y devoid of           pedestrians        or vehicles.



W i t h i n a few minutes         of the ground on Fen-rC^Pne Road North,                 we were

a p pr o ac h ed    by a white male who          offere^ijs    tickets      ln the standing      area

of the Lepping Lane area of the                       u n d , the Liverpool      and for £35

each,              and          were    prepared     to pay this     but    I d ec lined his    offer
                                                                                           PAGE
                                                                                           SI 950

and we wa lk ed on I cannot            describe    this    oerson but      I know he had a
                  /
Liverpoolcent.


M
W'iit'hfiin
         i  fifty yards we were again a pp ro a ch e d            by a man asking      if we

w an t ed   tickets      for the game



He offe re d tickets         for the S p ion^nop        (Nottingham Forest area)         for £20

each and f or Leppinqs L a ne 5ftd (Liverpool                   F .C . ) for £25 each.



The    tickets we re f o ^ t h e      standing areas.



At first we           purchased tickets    for    the S pi on Kop but on being told by

this rnan that for £5 extra we              could go      into the Liverpool         a rea we

e xc hanged    the tickets and         paid the extra £5.



This man       pulled a wad of tickets from his                 pocket w hich numbered at

least thirty and they were              for the L iv erpool        end.    I know that    he also

had Notts Forest           tickets    because we earlier          had   purchased three.



All    three   of us then went         into a cafe on a traffic            light    c ontrolled

crossroads       near     to the Leppings Lane end of the ground.



We    then walked aro u nd the ground to kill                  a little time and were

a p p r o a c h e d by numerous   people    selling      tickets.



The    three   of us went      to the t u r n s t iles mar ke d         to (Kat about    11 .30am

(1130).        The same date where         our   tickets         re checked an

c ounterfoils          handed back to us         All    three    of us were

present ai       th         .rnstiles at that          time.     I saw n / o n e   drinking     or
                                                                                                 PAGE

in possession of alcohol              outside     the ground.



I did not see many           police    officers     or club stewards         either     no doubt

due to the time.



This was my first           visit to H i l l s b o ro u gh and    I did not     really know

where    to go in the ground.              I could not see any dir ec ti on signs,                 but

thro ug h the tunnel         d ir ectly    in front of the turnstiles             I could see        the

pitch and that this           tunnel      was   directly behind the goals.              I prefer

being     behind the goals and therefore we went                   through t h ^ T u r T n e :



I. was   not aware     or    could    I see any signs       directing      fans elsewehere

than     the tunnel.



No    police   officers      or   stewards w e r / r y resent     near   to the tunnel.



On passing      through the        tus^fiel all    three   of us went      to the     left of the

metal     fence at the end of the tunnel              4nto Pjr'n 4.       Due to the time           no

crowds were      present      in the tunnel.



On going       into Pen 4 at about          11.35jjrfri (1135)    the same date       I w ould say

only twelve other spectators ware                  in that Pen.



All    three   of us b asically sat ar ou nd on the terraces and were                       trying

to find the       position we would finally take                 up to watch the        game



The L e p pings Lane        standing area was        beginning      to^^ill     so at g. IS pm

(1415)     the same    date we       took up our     positi on s> fo r    the match,.



I w ou ld say that we were about                twelve feet      down the terrace        from the
                                                                                                    PAGE      3

tunnel       and about    four    to five feet      from the fence            dividing Pens 3 and

4.



Fr o m this time what          I w ould describe as         normal      crowd surges occurred

due    to pushing w hi ch        caused the    crowd to move down towards                     the    pitch

five    or six feet.          You would    then be able          to walk back to your

previous       position.


                                                                                                W G f l
I was aware all          ar ou nd me of a stj^fiq fsmell of what                  I             say was

beer and also,          the smell    of j*fTat I call       ’b l o w ’ w hi ch        I b e l i e v e to be

cannabi s .



I only saw a few          people who      I w ou ld describe as being                  drunk.       1 did

not    see anyone       on the terraces       drinking      or    carrying alcohol.


                                           S & 15
At about 2 . 45pffi/< 1445>        the same date a tremendous                surg^forward             took
                  /                                                                     ---------
place whi ch/pushed us forward.               At this       time all ^ C h r e e        of us were

standing ^Cogether.



Unlike       the other    surges    on us the      pressure       from behind did not ease

off and was       becoming more        intense.



I can give       no real      e x pl an at io n as to the    cause     of this          surge.


                                                                                s//
On the       commencement      of the surge     forward      I was      p iiy jf& d    by my hips on

a crowd       control    barrier    for about      three minutes^.           At first. 1 was

ex pe riencing        diffi cu lt y breathing      but was       not   in any pain.



       and             were   in front    of the barrier and they told me to try to

get away       from it.       However,    before    I had    chance       I was        pushed away from
                                                                                                        PAGE       6

the barrier and ail                three of us were          carried down th e , ter race and

sl ig ht ly     left.



The     scene was just a sea of                  people    being      c ru shed/ groans,     screams and

shouts        for    help.



S o me h ow             became      trapped a cross         his    low^r      stomach against       the

hori^ontial           bar of a barrier and was obv i a / i s ly in trouble.
                                                                      /

Ian and myself           somehow were            in front    of'/ the barrier.           I was    facing     the

pitch and           I could hear                 asking me/ for help but               I could not       turn

to help him because                of the      terrific     crush,



        somehow became            detac he d from us               could see him about            six    feet

away     but    lots of other         spectators were             betw ee n us



I managed           to turn ar ou nd to help                      who was      being    bent double       over

the barrier.            His   feet were          off   the ground and his head and shoulders

were     down towards         the ground          in front of him.             I mana ge d to get his

head     up and he held onto my shoulders                     to keep upright a lt ho u gh              I could

not get him off the barrier                      because of the           crush behind.


                                           /
To                  .left a lso trapped on the             barrier was a white male,               25 yrs

wit h    light       coloured straight            shoulder    length h a i r .         His eyes were

closed and           I slapped him on the face telling                       him to wake    up.     This man

o pened his          eyes; but he was          not     loking at me but more            through me.        he

appeared        to be    in very serious               difficulties.




I turned my a ttentions               to               and then saw to his             right a white man
                              l

This man had his               back agai ns t     the b a r r i e r.      His   face was white.          He

had vomit            trickling       ut of the    right side of his m o u t h .           His    head was

back      looking skywards,             with his eyes open,               I believe this man was

dead.          He was m otionless            and silent.



L ot s    of    people       nearby were shouting             for help and saying         "Someones         dead

here" and similar messages.



The      pressure       of the       crush must have          eased s li ghtly because          I m an a g e d

to    pull               frorn off      t b / barrier u nd er n ea t h        it.   In doing     so my arm

became         trapped betweep/the             barrier and the           crowd behind,



I was      stuck       like this       for a couple of minu te s              1 began to panic and was

fearing         for my       life.



Eventually            I freed my arm and the             crush defin it el y eased off slightly.



During         the    crush    I   do not think        the    police     realised how serius          the

sit ua t i o n was as they were trying                   to tell       the    crowd to get      back which

was      impossible.


                                                                    1£AAa £
On    realising what was               happening Y       saw up lie an^y supporters who wer

a l r e a d y on the         pitch    pulling other          spectator's      out of Pens 3 and 4



T hr o u g h o u t    this    incident       I never    saw a p .y of the       players   on the      pitch

due to my height w hi ch                is



People were            going       down the terrace          over   the head of spectators            onto

ihe crush eased of            'o a point where       it was a normal          football       crowd.

By this    time our       position was about        ten to fifteen feet from the                 pitch

fence    but would say the          left hand goal       post as      I was   looking at the

pitch was       directly    in front of me.



This was where       I saw the man        I think was      dead,



I saw a cordon of          police   officers a c r o ^r the half way            line who      I think

Cfpuld have     been more     u se fu l ly emj^royed helping          the   injured.



People were       being    car r i e^-away on a dv er t is e me n t    hoardings and

stretchers.



At about 4 . 1 0 pm (1610)       all    three    of us   left the terrace         via the

tunnel.              had    lost his     shoes    in the   crush.



Ian stayed with                 who was awaiting an a mb ulance               inside   the

turnstiles and       I left the ground to telephone my wife



At    no time    during    the whole     incident did I witness             crowd disorder        or

any other       criminal    a c t i vi t y nor did I witness       anyone drinking alcohol



I returned       towards    the ground meeting           Ian on the way.         Togeth er we got

                  have    never   been   involved         in such a tragic      incident    in my   life the

               cene was      terrifying.



             I do not       think anyone      individual             can be blamed for what occurred.



             I do       not think   the Liverpool             enj^fTf the ground was      large enough to

             cater       for the suppo rters a y              wi th that   in mi nd the match should have

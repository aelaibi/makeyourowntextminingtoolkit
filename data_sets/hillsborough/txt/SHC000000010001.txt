    establish a breast screening service for wom en 50 - 64 by April 1990. The
    CHC set up a public meeting to firstly give facts and information to women,
    and secondly to hear their view s on what they wanted. The meeting was
    poorly attended but it was clear there was some anxiety over the process and:
    value of the proposed service.

The last year has seen im m ense changes within the CHC. Fond farewells
were firstly given w h en Harry Trent retired after 15 years dedicated service
and then later to Brian Burton who resigned after being promoted to
Secretary of Salisbury CHC. These departures gave the CHC the opportunity
to reorganise it’s staffing structure to meet the growing and developing work
load.

                   THIRTY-FIRST DAY'S PROCEEDINGS

                    THURSDAY, 29th JUNE,       1989

                         (MORNING   SESSION)


             INSPECTOR STEVEN ROBERT SEWELL           Called

                      Examined by MR. PHILLIPS:

Q.   Mr. Sewell? - A. Yes.

Q.   Inspector Steven Robert Sewell? - A. That is correct, sir.

Q. You have been the Liaison Inspector from Hammerton Road
   with Sheffield Wednesday since what date?- A. Since
   October, 1987, sir.

Q. And you took over then from Mr. Calvert? - A. That is
   correct, yes, sir.

Q. Although there was probably a time when you both involved
   at the same time together? - A. That is correct, sir.
   For three months from January to March, 1988, I was Acting
   Chief Inspector and Inspector Calvert continued with the
   football job but I was working closely with him.

Q. By March of 1988 you were fully into position, as it were?
   - A. That is correct, yes.

Q. And did you therefore in that capacity have to do the
   drawing up of the operational orders for the 1989 semi­
   final and for the 1988 one? - A.Yes, that is correct, sir.

Q.   And I think you were under,   as it were, the supervision
     of Mr. Mole and Mr.  Murray .... - A. That is correct, sir.

Q ..... in doing     that job? - A. That is right.

Q.   The words used were yours? - A. Yes, they were done in
     conjunction with Chief Inspector Beal.

Q. Can I take you to a point, please,before the 1988 match?
   Would you look, please, at the core bundle at page 434A?
   - A. Yes, sir.

Q.   This is a minute ofthe Safety   of Sports Grounds Advisory
     Group which was in fact produced after the main bundle
     was produced* - A. Yes, sir.

Q. And among those present there appears to be an Inspector Soul.
   I take it that is you? - A. That would be me, yes, sir.

Q. Yes.    That minute concerns a number of places.            It is the

                                                           S.^SEWELL

          first item of course that we are concerned with. - A.
          Yes, sir.

       Q.And there is a reference to the building surveyor's memo­
          randum of the 2nd of February, 1988. - A. Yes, sir.

       Q. We see that on   the previous page, page 434.  Did you
          have a copy of   that memorandum before the meeting
          started? -A. I   went with Superintendent Stewart.   He
          would have had   a copy.  I do not think I did, sir.

       Q. Would you have seen it though at the meeting itself?
          - A. Yes, I was aware of it, yes, sir.

       Q. And you will see that the memorandum is concerned with
          stewarding on the Kop? -A. That is correct, sir.

       Q. And complaints about the crowd occupying radial gangways?
          - A. Yes, sir.

       Q. And there was a complaint that stewarding must be of a
          quality and of such numbers to maintain gangways free
          from congestion? -A. That is correct, sir.

       Q. Did you regard this memorandum as being solely relevant
          to the Kop? -A. Yes, sir.

       Q. Not at all relevant to Leppings Lane terraces? - A. That
          is correct, yes, sir.

       Q. And again there was a reference to the turnstile capacity
          on the Penistone Road end? - A. Yes, sir.

       Q.There is the comment many of the spectators were still
          entering the ground up to 15 minutes after kick-off?
          - A. Yes, sir.  I think certainly with home supporters
          at League games it is fairly well-known the home supporters
          do come in the last few minutes.

       Q. So that was areference then specifically to the Penistone
          Road end and to the Kop again? - A. That is correct, yes,
          sir.

       Q. It then goes on to say the combination of late arrival
          and ineffective stewarding could lead to dangerous
          occurrences? - A. Yes, sir.

       Q. Did you know what that referred to? What sort of occurrences?
          - A. Well, just problems with people coming late and having
          difficulty in getting into the ground.   However, they were
          only the home supporters that go on to the Kop, they all
          know where they are going to and they try to be encouraged
          to come early but they do tend to come  at the;list minute.
          There are now stewards on the Kop that  do assist people
                          3


                                                 S. SEWELL

   on the gangways keeping them clear.

Q. Well now, when we look at the minute of the meeting itself
   on 434A there is the comment the pattern has developed of
   people arriving 15 minutes before the start of the game?
   - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Were you then referring solely again to the Kop? - A. Yes,
   we were, sir, because on normal League games the away
   supporters do not usually arrive late.

Q. And you say the trend may be due to the banning of alcohol
   at sports grounds? - A. I think that could be correct,
   sir, yes.

Q.That is your view, is it, that the banning of alcohol has
   led to people staying in the public houses longer than
   they might otherwise have done before going to the ground?
   -A. That was something put forward by Mr. Stewart but I
   would totally agree that it does create a problem, sir.

Q. By early 1988 then had this trend become fairly pronounced
   as far as you were concerned? -A. It is with home supporters,
   sir, but there again there is really no problem of them
   getting into the ground if they come a little bit late.
   They all know where they are going to.  It is mainly on
   the Kop.  I do think that this was referring to an evening
   match as well, if I recollect, and probably problems with
   traffic, people having to travel home from work, and it is
   a little bit of a rush for them to get to an evening match.
   I do think that that did refer to an evening match.

Q. It seems to be talking about a trend, something that was
   happening regularly from time to time? -A. Yes.  It is not
   a problem with the home supporters though, sir.

Q. Do you not think the same thing could apply to either away
   supporters or to both sets of supporters in a semi-final?
   - A. It is a possibility, sir.  However, the away supporters
   normally come, the majority come, on coaches and tuaine
   which are due to arrive fairly early at the ground, sir.

Q. Had you any experience of people coming late to the ground
   at the Leppings Lane end before the 1989 semi-final? - A.
   No, sir, there were no problems at the 1988 semi-final.

Q. No. I appreciate that.  But at any stage during the 1988
   or the 1989 season? - A. There had been no intelligence
   whatsoever to suggest that anybody was going to come
   late to the semi-final in 1989.  There was no information
   from the Football Liaison Officer at Headquarters and the
   Divisional Intelligence Officer, Detective Sergeant
   Charlesworth, gave us no information at &11 regarding any
   suggestions that any Liverpool or Nottingham supporters

                                                               S. SEWELL

              were going to come late and Sergeant Charlesworth had been
              in^touch with all the clubs involved and in fact produced
              quite a lengthy document on the intelligence and there was
              absolutely no intelligence came to him which was passed to
              us,and I have spoken to him since, about anybody suggested
              coming late.

           Q. And you had had no experience    of that either during   the
              -A. That is correct, sir.

           Q. Yes, thank you.  Now again, before the 1988 semi-final,
              one matter that was mentioned   in evidence some considerable?
              time ago, did you have a meeting with     theAmbulance Service
              before the 1988 semi-final? -A. Yes, I believe they came
              to one of the meetings at Hammerton Road.

           Q. What was the purpose of this meeting so far as they were
              concerned? -A. I do not thinkcthere was any real need for
              them to come but they did - it was to do with the Police
              organisation and I do believe that somebody from the
              Ambulance Service, probably Station Officer Easton, who
              has been the normal contact that I have had with the
              Ambulance Service did come.

           Q. Was that at your invitation? -A. More than likely but I
              just could not really confirm that.

           Q. The same thing did not occur this year, did it, in 1989?
              -A.That is correct.  When we had the initial meeting, I
              believe which was the 22nd of March, various people came
              to do with the Police operation and there was nobody from
              the Ambulance requested to come or in fact the Fire
              Brigade, but I spoke to the Chief Inspector from operations
              and requested him to send letters to the Ambulance and Fire
              Brigade informing them of the event which was done.

           Q. You did not see any need then to discuss any arrangements
              with the Ambulance Service before the 1989 match? -A.
              They were not invited to the meeting, sir.

SDB1                                                              S. R. SEWELL

       Q.    Did you see any need? A. I was aware that they would be
             c oming to the match and I had contact with them later on,
             sir .

       Q.   But you saw no need in the p r e pa r at o ry stages? A. Not in
             the actual planning of the police oper at io n, no.

       Q.    Can you turn on now, please, to page 449 in the core bundle.
             We see here a c o m m u n i c a t i o n from the club to, amon gs t other
             people, you. A. That is correct, yes.

       Q.    This is where you were sent a copy of the m at ch day i n s t r u c t ­
             ions, w hich I think we will find at 451. A. That is correct.

       Q.    Was this sent for your app ro v al ? A. That is right, sir.
             I dis cu ss ed it with S u p e r i n t e n d e n t M u rr a y and on page
             454 you will see that it is i ns er te d "and the gates


  •          opened.     That is in Mr. M u rr a y ' s own h an dw ri t in g .
             result of that I spoke with Mrs. S haron Lane at 1.30 on the
             9th June asking her to a dvise it and that is my w ri ti ng on
             the b ottom there.
                                                                                    As a




       Q.   In that document it is quite clear, is it not,                          there is
             no r e f e re nc e to any s te w a r d i n g on the L e p p i ng s     Lane end?
             A. That is correct.

       Q.   What was your v i e w of that p ar ti c ul a r problem; w hose job
             was it to pack the crowd and so on on the L ep p in g s Lane
             t e rraces? A. It is my view that it is the club's r e s p o n s ­
             i bility for the actual packi ng of people on there but
             there are no stewards a l l oc at e d to that terrace.      I was aware
             that when I took over the job that there were no stewa rd s
             to do it.

       Q.   Had the view that had p r e vi ou s ly been e x p r es s ed by the
             police in 1981 about stewards duties been a b r o ga t ed as
             far as you are aware? We see that on page 144, I think,
             of the bundle.      This is a m e m o r a n d u m from Chief S u p e r ­
             i nte nd en t Herald to S u p e r i n t e n d e n t S mith and Insp ec to r
             Calvert. A. Yes, sir.

       Q.   W h ic h in the m id dl e paragraph, as you will see, "Stress to
             the s tewards the a dm i s s i o n of s p ec t a t o r s on the bigger games
             on the t e r ra ci ng is pri ma r il y their f un c ti o n and not a police
             one". A. Yes, I see that.

       Q.   That was a view plainly e x p r es s ed           in August,      1981,    was   it
             not? A. That is correct.

       Q.   Had that view been a br o g a t e d by the time you took office,
             as far as you knew? A. Yes, sir.         I did not come to H a m m e r t o n
             Road until 1987.

       Q.   I know. A. And as far as I was aware on small                         league games
             if we k new there was an amoun t of s u pp o r t e r s               that were
                                              6




SDB2                                                              S, R. SEWELL

             probably less than a thou sa nd the away s up po r te r s were
             probably put in the two centre pens.    On the large games
             they were allowed to fill the pens on their own.

       Q.   But you see that       that m e m o r a n d u m   refers   to the big games.
            A . Yes.

       Q.   P re su m a b l y the games where it is e x pe c t e d       that the t e rr ac es
            at the Leppings Lane end will be full. A.                    Correct, sir.

       Q.   It refers to the police view at that time that it is the
            s tewards job to pack those supporters. A. Yes, sir.      I still
            think that it is to the stewards or to the club.        Howe ve r
            there were new stewards there so the p olice would m o ni to r
            the filling of the t errace s from the c o nt r ol room and from
            off ic e rs on the track.

       Q.   But you n e v e r t h e l e s s app ro v ed a d oc u me n t w hich did not lay
            any duties upon the s tewa rd s at all so far as the terr ac es
            were concerned. A. The senior o ff i ce r s a pp r ov e d that, yes.
            That is c o r r e c t .

       Q.   You, as liason officer, would have to study                    it closely?
            A. Yes, that is correct.

       Q.   Were you c o n sc io us of the fact that there was this a p pa re nt
            o m m is si on in the m atch day duties when you were going t hrouh
            it and a p p r ov in g it? A. No, Sir.

       Q.   Are you saying that you did not n o ti c e that o m mi ss io n?
            A. I was aware that it said that there were no stew ar ds
            on the terraces but that seems to have been in the past and
            that was the position.

       Q.          LORD JU ST IC E TAYLOR: The police could have done one of
            two things about there being no s t e w a rd s there, could they
            not.     They could either have said: "Why are there no s t ew ar ds
            there, let us have s teward s there, that is where they are
            s u ppos ed to be". A. Yes, Sir.

       Q.   Or they could accept the fact that t here were not going to
             be stewards there.    It looks as t h ou g h it was the latter
             that was accepted. A. Yes, Sir.

       Q.          MR. PHILLIPS: Can I now take you, please.           A little
            later on in 1988.          You were, of course, c on ce r ne d with the
            m a tc h in April, 1988, and I think that you told us you
            drew up the o p e r a t i o n a l order. A. Yes.

       Q.   And we have that as one of the d o c u m e n t s that has been
             disclosed.  I am going to ask you a bout that order in a
             little while when I come on to the 1989 order. A. Yes.

       Q.   Can we keep it fairly chr o no l og i ca l , if we can, by going
             to document 477, w hich is a m ee t in g that took place on

            the 9th August,      1988, at which you attended, along with
            Mr. Murray, Mr.      Marshall, and Chief Insp ec to r Beale?
            A. Yes.

       Q.   You also had there r e pr e se n t a t i v e s of the a m b u l an c e service
            and r e p r e s e n ta ti ve s of the fire service? A. Yes, sir.

       Q.   This was a p re-seas on meeting,         was it not?     A. That   is
            right, sir.

       Q.   Were you were concerned with r e nd ez vo us points for both
            the e mergency services in the event of any need for them?
            A. That is right, sir, I think that Mr. M ur ra y as well
            wanted to make contact with the people from the a m bu la nc e
            and the fire service.

       Q.   Did you come to, as you und er s to o d it, a clear a greement
            amongst the three services as a result of this meeting,
            as to what was to happen? A. Yes, Sir.

       Q.   Did you clearly unde rs ta nd where the a mb ul a nc e people were
            to go and the fire people were to go? A. Yes.          The a m bu la nc e
            people, if they were going to put their major incident
            into action would send their a m b u la n ce to H er ries Road
            bus garage to rendezvous. The fire brig ad e were unable to
            say where they would rendezvous.        They w anted specific
            i nf or ma ti on to which part of the ground any p ro bl em was
            and they would send the fire engines direc tl y there.

       Q.   In other  words when the fire brigade were called in they
            had to be told the particu la r part of the ground to go
            to? A. That is correct, yes, sir, the best possible
            information.

       Q.   That was something within the k n o w l e d g e of S up e ri n te n de n t
            Murray, was it? A. That was stressed by the a m bu la nc e
            officer, yes, and I see Mr. M urray has w ri tt en on the bottom
            of the report.

       Q.       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: By  the fire brigade?               A. Yes,    I
            beg your pardon.  By the fire officer.

       Q.       MR. PHILLIPS: We have a note from Mr.              Murr ay at the       end
            of the document. A. That is right.

       Q.   "The m eeting was called to e st a bl i sh poss ib le rendezvous
            point for emergency services foll ow in g a major incident.
            A m b ul an ce service Herries Road, fire serv ic e will atend
            by P e n i s to ne Ro ad or Lepp in gs Lane, as direc te d by the
            police". A. That is right.            That then went on to Mr.
            M ole and he has endorsed it at the bottom, sir.

       Q.   Yes.  Can we just m ention the a m b u la n ce       service.   They were
            going to r ondezvous at the H er ries Road           bus garage.     Were
            they going to have a particu la r part of            the ground to go to
            from that rendezvous point? A. If there              were any a m bu la nc e

            c a su al ti es which needed c l ea ri ng   they w ould   be taken   to
            the gymnasium.

       Q.   Was it in fact agreed that they w ould have an entry via
            one gate near the g y m n as i um and an exit via a second
            gate? A. I cannot h onestl y reme mb er the entry by the
            g y m na si um gate and the exit at gate 'o'.  I knew that
            they were going to come to gate 'o'.

       Q.   Was it agreed that they should        have a clear run through
            to get their ambu la nc e s in and    out? A. Yes, o bviously
            through gate 'o' but I cannot recall them saying come in
            through the g ym n a s i u m gate. T here are prob le ms coming
            in at that gate.       There are v eh ic le s parked there by the
            club and the disabled people that come to the m atch have
            aut ho ri ty by the club to park in that car park.        You can
            still get round but it would be d if fi cu lt becuae it goes
            under the North Stand and round a hut w hi ch is the g r o u n d ­
            sman, and it cer ta in ly is d if fi cu lt to get with a vehicle
            round there al th ou gh not impossible.        It is easier to get
            in from gate 'o'.

       Q.   It is easy if the area is kept clear,            is it not? A. That
            is correct.

       Q.   Did you think that was importan t from your point of view?
            A. That is right.  You can get thro ug h the g y m n a si u m gate
            but it is difficult, through the g y m n a s i u m gate, but you
            can get in through gate 'o' w it ho ut any problem.

                                                    S.R. SEWELL

     Q. Then there is a reference made concerning tabards and other
        matters which I don't think we need to go into. - A. That is
        right. I did then show a film which showed problems and the
        Leeds-Coventry match, I believe, in 1985, problems at the
        Heysell Stadium, the Bradford fire, and it goes through
        those showing the duties of the stewards and the Police with
        the evacuation, and this is a Metropolitan Police training
        film.

     Q. At the very end of this note we see in capital letters: "PLAN
        FOR DISASTER". - A. That is the title of the film, sir.

     Q. I see. Was there any commentary by you relating that to
        Sheffield Wednesday's ground? - A. About the film, sir?

     Q. Yes. - A. I said, "This is what has happened at these grounds
        here. Be very much aware. If we get a problem here this is
        what we have to do", and I emphasised that. They seemed
        quite interested in watching this film which went on for
        about 25 minutes.

     Q. Can we come now to 1989, and come to the first events we have
        heard referred to which is the match on 14th January between
        Liverpool and Sheffield Wednesday. You organised that, did
        you? -A. Yes, sir.

     Q. And of course, it seems included in the Tango unit’s duties
        the very points that had been raised in August? - A. That is
        right, yes, sir.

     Q. And it was some time in March, I think, when you had to get
        your operational order put together for the 1989 match? - A.
        Yes, sir.
     Q. You had available, you told us already, intelligence from Mr.
        Charlesworth and various other sources as well as the 1988
        order? - A. Yes, sir.

     Q. Had you visited the club in the run up to the preparation of
        this order? - A. Yes, sir. There was frequent contact with
        them.
     Q. I think you went with Superintendent Murray in the few days
        before the match? - A. Yes, sir.

     Q. Was Mr. Mackrell there? - A. Yes, sir.
     Q. And did you inspect the ground? - A. We did, yes, sir.

     Q. Were you satisfied with what you saw? - A. Yes, sir.

     Q. Were you troubled with the entry arrangements at the Leppings
        Lane terraces? - A. No, sir.

     Q. Were you concerned at the absence of signs directing people
        where to go? - A. At the time the signs seemed adequate.

                                                    S.R. SEWELL

Q. Did you give any thought to any possible problems of access to
   the terraces from those turnstiles? - A. No, sir. There had
   been no problem the previous year with thelargematch,   and we
   did not envisage any problem this year.

Q. I understand that, Mr. Sewell. You did not in fact look at
   the situation at all critically at the Leppings Lane end? - A.
   no, sir.

Q. You accept, do you, as I think Mr. Mackrell accepted
   yesterday, that the signs are very misleading? - A. In
   hindsight, yes, sir.

Q. But none of that occurred to you at the time? - A. No, sir.
   If it had I should have mentioned it to the club.

Q. When you drew up the 1989 match order what was your object,
   your intention? - A. To improve on the previous year which
   already had been a successful operation.

Q. In your statement you set out a number ofways in which you
   made alterations which are not in fact relevant to this
   Inquiry, I think, because they concern other parts of the
   ground and other serials. I don't want to go into every
   detail, but I do want, if you will, to take up with you one or
   two matters. Would you look, please, at Tab 14 in the South
   Yorkshire Police bundle, which gives us the 1989 match
   order, and look at Serial 1, which is sub-sector 1? - A.
   Yes, sir.

Q. Do you also have a copy of the 1988 match order there? -A.
   Yes, sir.

        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        We don't have that in the bundle.

        MR. PHILLIPS:   It is not in the bundle, sir, no, but it
   has been handed in separately some considerable time ago:

Q. Unfortunately, the pages are not numbered. If we look to
   Serial 1 sub-sector 1, do you see there that at the end of the
   larger paragraph: "NO-ONE IS TO BE ALLOWED ACCESS TO THE
   TERRACES WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF A SENIOR OFFICER EXCEPT TO
   RECEIVE MEDICAL ATTENTION". - A. Yes, sir.

Q. That is in fact emphasised very much more strongly in the 1989
   order? - A. Yes, sir.
Q. Why did you do that? - A. In actual fact it was Chief
   Inspector Beale’s idea to do it, but the reason behind it is
   that sometimes if some fans have got in the wrong end of the
   ground or some arrests have been made, Officers have taken
   fans out of the perimeter gates and round the edge of the
   track, and also taken prisoners round the edge of the track.
   This can create problems by the opposing fans jeering and
   possibly lead to some crowd problems. So this really is
   intended that no prisoners or people should be transferred
   round the track, and they would be taken out from the back of
                            15


                                               S.R. SEWELL

   the terraces and taken round to the correct end. That is what
   that is really indicating. I am fairly certain Mr. Murray
   would have made some reference to that in his briefings, that
   nobody would be taken out of the perimeter gates to another
   section. That is really what that is to indicate.

Q. It is not intended to prevent the gates being opened in the
   event of overcrowding in the terraces? - A. No, sir. If there
   is a problem of overcrowding it is common sense to the Police
   Officers who are on there, and the majority of the Officers on
   Serial 1 on the 1989 order are Community Constables who work
   the same positions throughout the whole of the seaspn, sir.

Q. I am coming to that in a minute. There seems to be some
   conflict in the individual Officers' eyes anyway between what
   they understand their instructions to be with regard to the
   gates and what their common sense required them to do on the
   day? - A. It is the same Sergeant that works with them
   throughout the whole season, Sergeant Chapman. Also,
   Inspector Darling that was on there, the majority of this last
   season has worked with that serial. I would be fairly certain
   they should know the details, sir.

Q. There is no provision, is there, for this serial to pay any
   attention to the question of crowd numbers in the terrace? -
   A. It does not say it in the order, but not each individual
   Officer gets a copy of the serial order. It is only for the
   Sergeant and the Inspector. I don't think everything can be
   put down actually in the operational order, sir.

Q. But this is a fairly important thing, is not it, Inspector, if
   you have got a situation where you are expecting the
   supporters themselves to sort themselves out into a
   comfortable position? - A. Yes, but also it is expected if the
   Officers on the track see any problems when monitoring the_
   crowd they would relate straight to control.

Q. Without any specific instruction to that effect? - A. Yes,
   sir. They are regular Officers that work this with the
   exception of the odd few.
Q. We have already looked at the Tango provision. You say in
   your statement that the object was to get the same people
   doing the same job as the previous year. Is that right? -
   A. Where possible, yes, sir.

Q. That is why I must take up with you, that has been said by
   other Officers as well, and I have prepared a little schedule
   - I don't think you have got it in front of you? - A. Yes, I
   have, sir.
Q. Can I just explain it. This is just an analysis of the two
   orders, and I hope to save time rather than go through each
   individual one, we see that    Serial 1 this year only 11 out
   of the 20 Officers - I am talking about Constables now - were
   there in 1988? - A. That is right, sir. There were changes
   with the Community Constables, and some of the other Community
                            16


                                                S.R. SEWELL

   Constables were on....

        MR. PHILLIPS:   This is just a note I made, sir, to save
   going through all the details.  (Document produced):

Q. Eleven out of the 20 Constables in Serial 1? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. That means that very nearly half of them won't have had
   experience of a Semi-Final on that serial? - A. That is
   correct of a Semi-Final, sir, but a lot of the others do work
   on the League matches and work on the track.

Q. But on a League match things are very different, because you
   don't get a capacity crowd at the Leppings Lane end? - A . Yes,
   sir, but we have had several large matches, Manchester United,
   Derby, Liverpool. We have had plenty of large matches this
   last season.

Q. I have also analysed the numbers of Serials 13-19 which are
   all concerned with the Leppings Lane end, are not they? - A.
   Yes, sir.

Q. Not one of the Officers who was working on those serials
   this year was working in the 1988 Semi-Final? - A. Yes, sir.
   Perhaps I can explain. Sergeant Crawford last year was on the
   West Stand, which was upstairs. He works from Barnsley. He
   was on the terraces this year just underneath. Sergeant
   Higgins who was here in 1988 has now left. Then the other
   four serials, 15, 16 and 17 - the ones that are outside the
   turnstiles - last year they were C Division Officers that are
   Officers from Rotherham. Inspector Sykes, who was on their
   last year, said that he was not particularly happy with how
   the Officers from there had performed their duties last year,
   and so he wished his own Officers, which are from Ecclesfield.
   So I purposely put on Sergeants Whitlam, Morgan and Proctor
   that are with Ecclesfield Officers who throughout this season,
   the majority of them have worked on the turnstiles outside
   Leppings Lane, and are fully aware of it. In fact, Sergeant
   Proctor is the area Sergeant at Ecclesfield, and his serial
   work almost without exception on the terraces. Sergeant Payne
   is from Hackenthorpe, and he regularly with his men works at
   the ground.

Q. Perhaps I ought to explain the   schedule a bit more because it
   is not necessarily immediately   apparent. We see the number of
   Constables in the first column   who did the same duty in the
   two years, and it comes out at   none at the Leppings Lane end.
   - A. Yes.
Q. The serial number and broadly where that serial was stationed.
   - A. Yes, sir.

Q. The Sergeant is given in the 1988 version there. Those with
   the asterisk against them mean that they were in fact working
   at this ground at this match but in a different position in
   1989. - A. That is right, but I think the ones that were
   working in 1989 had a lot more experience of working outside
■0 5

                                                        S.R. SEWELL

          the turnstiles, and that is specifically why I picked then,
          and this was in consultation with Inspector Sykes who has
          worked that duty outside the turnstiles, I believe, most
          matches since 1980, so I would rely on his information.

       Q. We see, for example, that Sergeant Morgan who was the Serial 1
          Sergeant in 1988 was working on Serial 18 in 1989? - A. That
          is correct, sir. Sergeant Morgan used to be the plain clothes
          Sergeant, and now Sergeant Chapman takes up his duty, and that
          is why he has gone on the track for all of this season.
          Sergeant Morgan throughout the past season and League matches
          more often than not has worked on coach reception outside
          Leppings Lane turnstiles, and is an experienced Sergeant and
          that is why he was picked for those duties.

       Q. So we see that six of the Sergeants, if you look at the very
          end column, who were on duty this year, had also been on
          duty in different positions in 1988? - A. That is correct,
          sir, and again Sergeant Burman was in the West Stand this
          year, and is one of the regular Officers who works at the
          ground. He normally works on the Kop, and he works in the
          West Stand sometimes at the League matches. He is an
          experienced Officer. That is why they were all picked.

                                                   S.SEWELL

Q. It does seem to follow then, does it, that you were not
   really trying to get the same people in the same position
   as you had had last year? -A. Where possible but we were
   trying to improve.  I altered the ones on the turnstiles
   because of Inspector Sykes' ....

Q.You have explained that. - A. Yes.

Q. But the net result seems to be that so far as the part
   of the ground that we are concerned with is concerned
   you did not have any of the same people on this year as
   you had in 1988? -A. Well, the ones that were on in 1988
   do not regularly attend the ground and so the ones that
   were chosen for 1989 do regularly attend the ground
   and have experience of that particular end and that is
   why they were positively chosen.  They are experienced
   officers who know what they are doing.

Q. You see, the reason I am asking you this, Mr. Sewell,
   and the reason I looked at this is that in your statement
   on page 4 you say, "The serials around the turnstiles
   at Leppings Lane and Penistone Road and in the enclosure
   to the same were the same as for 1988 which had proved
   adequate." That is not right? - A. What I mean by that,
   sir, is they were the same amount of men on it, that
   there were four serials outside and two inside.

Q. Oh, the same number of people, you mean?- A. Yes.    My
   mistake, sir, but that is what I was ....

Q. They were not the same serials? - A. No, sir.  No, sir.
   I am sure they were an improvement on last year, sir,
   a vast improvement.

Q.Do not you think the experience of the 1988 semi-final
   would have bean something that could have been carried
   forward in the way that has been put forward, it appears,
   until now? -A. Probably a lot of those Officers that
   were on it last year on those turnstiles, I am not sure,
   but they probably were not all working the match this
   time any way.  They were not regular officers. The ones
   that were picked were the ones that have done it, by and
   large, throughout the whole of the season on the League
   matches which have involved large matches and large crowds
   at Leppings Lane and they were officers which Inspector
   Sykes would have chosen.

Q. In fact then it is   experience during that season which
   you reckoned to be   more important than experience of the
   1988 semi-final? -   A. Yes, sir, for that particular match,
   yes.  The officers   knew what they were doing.

Q. Now, having gone into that then you did then, I think,
   attend on the day and took part in the briefings.  Is
   that right? - A. That is correct, sir.  I also took part
                                                S. SEWELL

on the pre-briefing the day before which was to Inspectors
and above.

And we have again your notes of the - is that your note
of the briefing on the .... - A. That is correct, sir.
I have got the original here.

I do not think there is anything in it I particularly
want to ask you about.  You were really concerned with
radios, were not you? - A. That is right, sir.   I think
probably one relevant point is that with the radio
issues, that is serials 1 to 21, which were all the
serials which were in the ground, thee Inspectors and
Sergeants were to have earpieces.

Did they all get earpieces?- A. Yes, sir.  There were
36 ordered.  That is the only amount we could get.
There were 36.

We heard from one witness that it was expected that all
of the Police Officers on serial 1 would have a radio
with them, many of them would have them because they were
Community Constables, any way?- A. Yes, sir.

Was it not in fact your intention to equip every officer
on serial 1 with a radio? - A. Yes, sir, I think the
majority of them would have had them.

They did not all have them, as we have heard. - A ® Yes,
well, I did not issue the radios and it did not specifically
say everybody should have got one but I assumed that they
would have but they are not far away from another officer
if they have got a problem.  There are 20 of them round the
track.  They could easily walk to somebody that had got
one and the majority would have had one.   There were some
spare radios.  If anybody had asked for one they would
have got one.

On serial 1, you mean? -A. Yes, sir, definitely, yes.
The constables onedither serials would not! ha®e got them
unless there was some specific duty but there was no
problem.  I ordered 16 dozen radios, I believe itwas,
and there were some spare.

Were those radios all tested before the   event? -A. I
assume that they would have been tested by the
Communications Department.  I ordered them with the loud
hailers and base station and so forth before from the
Communications Department.  I am sure they would have
tested them.

With loud hailers, you say? - A. Yes.

How many loud hailers did you have at the ground? - A.
                                                 S. SEWELL

I believe there were five. I believe.

 Where were they? -A. In the gymnasium.

All of them? - A. They were inufeheggymnasium available
for any Senior Officer that wanted to have one.

You see, we heard that when a loud hailer was required
at the Leppings Lane terraces Constable Buxton ran back
to his Landrover, I think it was, to collect it from the
Landrover because there did not seem to be one at the
ground.  Were the Senior Officers told that there were
loud hailers there? -A. I would have thought they would
have been aware, sir.   They were certainly in the gym­
nasium with the radios.   P.C. Buxton usually takes one
in the Landrover for if one of the Senior Officers wants
a lift.  He is the driver, is P.C. Biixton, with the
Landrover, so he is available for any of the Senior Officers
outside who might want taking to anywhere round the ground.
He quite often will take one in with him so that if
anybody wants to use it they can do.   He has also got
the loud hailers on the Landrover, got a public address
system.  I know down to Mr. Mole this was updated, that
system, certainly some months ago any way.    He had it
updated on the Landrover.

Well, I know.  I was asking about loud hailers.  Would
Mr. Murray have known that there were five loud hailers
in the gym? - A. I do not know, sir.

He was your immediate Superior at this game, was not he?
-A. He was, sir. He was in the: control box.  They were
there at the beginning any way.   They were in the gym?*
nasium because I can recall using one in the gymnasium
myself to ....

Now, you have told us about the issue of radios.  It was
Sergeants and Inspectors who had earpieces then? - A. On
the ground serials which is 1 to 21 and obviously any
Senior Officers as well, Mr. Greenwood and the Chief
Inspectors inside the ground.

The sentence at the top of page 5 of your statement,
"The issue of radios including all ground serials to
have an earpiece"? -A. Yes, sir.

Is one earpiece per serial? - A. T& the Sergeant, yes, sir.

Yes. - A. Oh, yes, sir.

Yes, I see. - A. Because; fey<&and large the constables do
not have a radio.  If they did there would be too many
to go through the system, the radios.     It would just clog
the system up.

                                                    S. SEWELL

Q. That is your briefing then.  The issue of radios on the
   day.  Did you participate in anything to do with the
   stewards on that day? - A. No, sir.  I had arranged for
   the four Inspectors in the stands to brief the serials
   in the respective stands at 11.15.  That was Inspector
   Darling the South Stand, Inspector Calvert on the Kop,
   Inspector Woodward on the North Stand and Inspector White
   on the West Stand.  This had all been arranged with M r .
   Lock and, I think, Sharon Lane at the club so that they
   were all aware and in fact I wrote on to the particular
   Inspectors' orders for them to do that and I am aware
   that they all did get briefed, the stewards.

Q. Yes.  And;of course that briefing to the stewards would
   be in accordance with what you had previously said at the
   beginning of the season? - A.That is right.  I would
   imagine the main thing would be for the evacuation
   procedure so that they knew it because obviously on the
   large matches the club enlist a few extra stewards for
   the semi-final and obviously to ensure they were aware
   of the emergency evacuation.

Q. Now, on the day itself you also received, did you not,
   a report from Mr.Charlesworth, Sergeant Charlesworth,
   on intelligence? -A. Yes, sir.

          MR. PHILLIPS:   I am moving now to the bottom of
     page 7, sir.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Thank you.

Q.       MR. PHILLIPS:    What did you learn from him?   - A.
     On the day?

Q. Yes.  Towards the bottom of page 7 of your statement,
   you see .... - A. Y e s .

Q ..... you say in the paragraph about two-thirds    of the way
    down, "Detective Sergeant Charlesworth gives details of
    intelligence"? - A. Yes.  That was the briefing.    Mr.
    Duckenfield was up first, then Mr. Murray, then Sergeant
    Charlesworth and he prepared a full booklet on the
    intelligence and he went briefly through one or two
    points on that which was condensed.

Q. What did you hear from him? Can you remember? - A. I
   cannot specifically.  There were no problems about
   anything that affected me particuarly that day that
   I did not already know about.

Q. Nothing adverse? -A. Nothing at all.   I mean, I do not
   think I particularly listened to what he was saying on
   that briefing.  I knew it did not apply to me.He had
   been talking to me several times that morning.    I had
vS                                22



                                                        S, SEWELL

          seen him probably about 7 or half-past-7 that morning.
          There were no problems and he was in contact, I am aware,
          with Liverpool and Notts, people that day. He would keep
          letting us know throughout the day that there were so
          many people on that train arriving at such-and-such a
          time, so many people on that, and this was relayed to
          officers at the Midland Station., That was the sort of
          thing he was telling us but there was nothing that was
          out of the ordinary.

     Q.    Now, can we come to just before the match started? Did
          you get a message - I think your position was really in
          the gymnasium, was not it? -A. I got a roving commission,
          sir, but coming up to, sort of - if everything had gone
          to plan, at 3 o'clock there would have been a number of
          officers coming into the gymnasium to have a hot meal
          which had already been supplied from ....

     Q. In the quarter-of-an-hour before 3 o'clock you were in
        the gymnasium? -A. In the vicinityc6f i t ,yes.

     Q.    Well now, did you get a message to get in touch with
          South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive? -A< I
          do recall that they were wanting me to contact Bert
          Middleton who is the liaison that I have.   I was aware
          that at that stage he would be still at the Midland
          Station or on his way from the Midland Station having -
          supervising the people getting on buses down there and
          I told the control that if they rang Herries Road bus
          garage   they would be able to get in touch with him
          because I was not in touch with him and they would get
          him on the radio from Herries Road bus garage.

     Q. Were you told why they wanted you to get in touch with
        Mr. Middleton? -A. I cannot recall, sir.  They wanted
        to contact him for some reason.

     Q. Did they not tell you that Leppings Lane was to be closed?
        - A. I do not recall that specifically, sir, no.

     Q. At all events, you did not get through to the Passenger
        Transport? -A. No.

     Q. You threw the ball back to control? - A. I told them how
        they could contact him, yes.  When he comes to the ground
        he stands down by the North Stand and the Kop for the
        majority of the game and I regularly go and liaise with
        him for if there are any problems with the buses.  He
        does not usually get there until some time after the
        kick-off but control probably thought I woald have been
        able to get hold of him straightaway.

     Q. Had you heard then messages about closing the Lane over
        your radio? -A. Probably but it does not recollect anything

                                                              S. SEWELL

          with me, sir.

       Q. Did you know anything that was going on outside the
          turnstiles in Leppings Lane? -A. No.  I am aware that
          in the - round about quarter-to-3 that there was some -
          there were obviously some problems at Leppings Lane and
          they were requesting manpower to Leppings Lane.

       Q. You responded to that, did not you? - A. Yes.    I told
          the control there    were a number of officers from Wist
          Bar that had come up from the station, they had been
          riding with the fans on the buses, and I went to the
          gym. to deploy them.

       Q. Did you receive a telephone call from the control box?
          - A- Not a telephone call, sir.   There is not a telephone
          link in the gymnasium.   There is one in the Police room
          which is adjacent but I did not have a telephone call,
          no. I heard them on the radio.

       Q. I see.   There is just a telephone link between the Police
          room and the control box to that side of the ground? - A.
          There are two telephones in the actual Police room which
          is across the way from the gymnasium.   There is an outside
          line and you can contact on the club's internal, get
          straight through to the Police box as well.   I do not
          recall speaking to them on the telephone at that stage
          any way.

       Q. Yes.  But any way you got the message and you sent these
          people off to Leppings Lane? - A. Yes, sir.

       Q. What instructions did you give them? -A. It was obvious
          to me that there was some problem at Leppings Lane but
          I knew nothing more than that and that they were wanting
          several serials.   Sergeant Goddard's voice was having,
           like a warbling effect on the radio and at first I
          thought there was some problem with my own radio.
          Spoke to another officer as I thought it was probably
          the battery was faulty on my own radio.   Spoke to
          another officer.   They were having the same problem.
          I then assumed it was obviously a radio fault as opposed
          to my own radio.   They did say they wanted them to
          various locations.   I realised by deploying a large
          number of men from the gym. this was possibly something
          quite serious, so I got Sergeant Sewell who was on
          logistics in the gymnasium to record the details of the
          Sergeants who I was deploying and where.

            I just said to the sergeant —  I did not know what the problem
            was other than Leppings Lane and so the only brief to the
            sergeant was: Take your men to the location I am sending
            you to, see the senior officer up there, and do what he wants
            you to d o .

       Q.   We find that the locations in your statement are at page
             nine. A. That is right, and the first lot of officers were,
             according to my watch, deployed at 2.50 and that was recorded.

       Q.   2.50?   A.   2.50.

       Q.   At that time two serials were deployed to the track.    Do
             you know who Sergeant 2916 and 915 are? A. I know 1055
             is Dowson.   I will know them by sight but there were other
             of ficers from West Bar and all over the place.

♦      Q.   Is not one of those Sergeant in charge of Mr. Houson?
             A. Yes, Sergeant 2379 Swift, who was sent to the West
             Stand.

       Q.   To the West Stand? A. That is where I told them to go but
             obv iously they went up the track.   I heard the evidence of
             Police Constable Ho uston and they went up the side of the
             North Staad.   They were obvi ously head i n g in that direction.

       Q.   That was at 2.50? A. That was at 2.50 by my watch when they
             were sent out and there is nothing to believe my w atch was
            wrong.

       Q.   Thank you very much, that is helpful. A. That has been
             recorded and has been made an exhibit at the time.         I know
             that I then r e -grou ped another serial.      It says 'E' Division,
             Crime and Vandal Sqaud.     That was with Inspector B e rris ford
             and his Sergeant and ten men.     They had been a reserve serial
             who had gone out he lping on Pen i s t o n e Road.  I re-group ed
             those together and set them out and it was three o'clock
             when they went.

       Q.    I think you heard something over the radio about gates.
            Can you recall what you heard? A. I cannot honestly recall
            what I heard now about the gates.        T here was some refe rence
            to gates but the radio r e ception was very bad.       I got the
            impr e s s i o n there had been a problem at the Leppings Lane
            end and there was some pitch invasion.         That was the
            im pression that I got.

       Q.   Gates, when you heard about gates on the radio, did you know
            whether that referr ed to gates on the perimeter fence or
            gates at the turnstiles? A. I did not know, sir.   My main
            object was they were wa nting men up there.  I was deploying
            men and I knew who I was sending and seeing who I had got
            left in the gym.  That was my main object.

       Q.LORD JU STICE TAYLOR:   W here you were in          the gymnasium,
                                         25



SDF2                                                    S. R. SEWELL

            is that right, was the crowd noise a problem on rece ption
            on your radio? A. Not in the gymnasium.

       Q.   Any problem there was was actually to do with the
            co m m u n i c a t i o n s itself? A. That is right, yes. We were not
            receiving a lot back.

       Q.   Someone has suggested that the concrete all round makes
            difficultes.  Has that been your e x perience before or not?
            A. Not really, sir, no.

       Q.        MR. PHILLIPS: At other times you have been able to
            receive and transmit from the gym n a s i u m wi thout trouble?
            A . Yes .

       Q.   You had sent these officers out and I think that you remained
            in your position, did you?  A. In that vicinity, yes.

       Q.   Did you get to u nderstand at some stage that there was a
            dreadful disaster h a ppening out on the terraces? A. I do
            recall seeing Chief Superin t e n d e n t Nesbitt very shortly
            after that.   I then went down to the edge of the field,
            to the North Stand and the Kop.         At that stage I could
            see there was a very large amount of officers up at the
            Le ppings Lane end on the pitch.        At that stage I still
            thought there had been a ptich invasion.

       Q.   What time is that? A. Some time, as I recall, round about
            ten past three or just after, but that could be a little
            vague .

       Q.   Had the game stopped? A. I think that it would have done,
             yes.  I got the i m pression  that there was a pitch invasion
             and I thought there was going to be some large scale public
             disorder.   My concern at that stage was to get back to
             the police room becaue I knew that there was in the region
             of twenty to thirty prisoners that were already in the cell
             buses and in the police room and I thought we could have
             some problem if the fans got back there.     That is what hit
             my mind at that stage.     I had no idea at that stage what
             the disaster w a s .

       Q.   You had not heard anything on your radio to inform you
            by this time of what was going on or what was required?
            A. I had not, no.  I thought that there was a pitch
            invasion at that stage.

       Q.   How soon were you d isabused of that idea? A. Shortly after
            they were bringing casu alties down on hoardings.

       Q.   That is when you realized? A. Yes.     At that stage I still
            thought that it was a disorder pr oblem and there were just
            a few injured people but then obvi ously things escalated
            and I went back to the g y m nasium and things started to
            flow from there.

SD 3F                                                       S. R. SEWELL

        Q.   It is at this point,  is it not, where your discussions
              with the fire brigade and the a m b ulance people in August,
              1988, come into effect? A. Yes.

        Q.   Did you r e a l i z e then that this was just the situation that
              had been catered for in that meeting? A. I do not think that
              it crossed my mind actually at that stage.

        Q.   Did you regard it as being your duty to ensure that there was
             proper access to the ground, proper i n f o r m a t i o n to the
             em ergency services? A. I had already seen Station Officer
             Easton at the ground.   I presume he was with Mr. Higgins
             but I do not really know Mr. Higgins by name.           He was with
             anotherambulance officer. I had seen them in the region of
             2.15.   I was aware that they were at the ground.           I
             just had a brief chat with them and said: "If things are
             all quiet and you go into the gym n a s i u m when the game has
             started you will be able to get a meal".        I did not see
             them after that until I saw Station Of ficer Easton in the
             region of 4.30 when I spoke to him again, something like
             that.

        Q.   At this time we are talking about ten past three or t h e r e ­
             abouts.  You are in the vicinity of the gymnasium.             You
             have in mind, or you have certainly in effect an a r r a n g e ­
             ment with the ambulance and t h e f i r e service.       What I am
             asking is did you put that a r r a n g e m e n t into effect at that
             point? A. I was aware that the St. John's Ambulance
             were already on the pitch when I went down.             I have a
             vague reco l l e c t i o n of the other a m b ulance personnel
             bewing around at the same time and having gone up towards
             Leppings Lane end.

        Q.   Did you take any steps to clear the access for these
              em ergency vehicles? A. I do not think there was any
              problem at that stage of any a mbulances getting in the
              region of gate 'o'.    There were a number of mounted officers
              that were stood by at the back of the Kop and there   were
              some dog handlers as well that had been brought in but
              there would have been no problem of getting a vehicle
              through.

        Q.   There were still mounted officers in the yard behind the
              North Stand and the Kop? A. They were actually behind  the
              Kop near to the gate entrance coming in from gate 'o'.
              There were a number in there, probably the ones, I assume,
              that had been on Penistone Road end.   If it was looking
              as if there was a public order event I assumed that the
              officer who was in charge of those may have thought that
              he may well have been having to go on to the pitch with
              the horses .

        Q.   You took no    specific   steps?   A. No,   but there was no block-age.

        Q.   That is your evidence about that?       A. Yes.

        Q.   We have heard, however, that emergency vehicles that were
             trying to go to Leppings Lane and, indeed, some of the fire
             of ficers and ambulance people who arrived, were met with
             Po lice Officers, C o nstables and the like, who appeared
             not to know what was going on.     Did you not detail anyone
             to direct these emergency vehicles outside on Peni stone
             Road or at the entrances to the ground? A. There were
             plenty of   officers round the gate 'o' that were
             seeing to any problems with any traffic at all.     I did not
             say specifically to someone: "Go and do it", no.

        Q.   How would they know what the problem was, why the fire and
             ambulance had been called in, unless you told them or saw
             to it that they were told? A. When the casu alties were
             brought off the field I think that it was fairly obvious,
             and the ambu lances were coming up on P e n i s t o n e Road. They
              seemed to be getting up, there did not seem to be any
             pr oblem with getting up so far as I was concerned.

        Q.   It does appear to be the case that some of these office rs
             did not know what was going on and had not the faintest
             idea why the fire brigade and the a m bulances were turning
             up. A. At the earlier stages I thought that there had been
             a pitch invasion.   I was not aware of what had happened
             until I saw these casualties bring brought off the field
             myself .

        Q.   You  then knew that the a m bulance and the fire service were
             being called. A. I assumed they had, yes, that is why they
             were getting there, yes.

        Q.   Do you not think, looking back, you should have made it
              clear to     everyone round about, at the entrances from
              P e n istone Road, what they were required to do with regard
              to these emergency vehicles? A. It would have been better
              if I had specif ically said something to someone but I did
              not.     I never saw any problem. If I had seen any problem
              at all I would have seen to it.      There was also an insp ector
              who was specif icall y seeing to the loading of officers
              that would have been on coaches and in charge of the
              Transits. There was Inspector Scarf in the vicinity of
              P e nistone Raod and he had a Sergeant wo rking with him as
              well.     I know that he did assist with emergency vehicles
              shortly after.      Having spoken to him he said that there
              was no problem.

        Q.         LORD JU STICE TAYLOR: But you never received any
             m ess a g e from control as to what the situation was-
             A. I did not hear anything at all, Sir, no.

        Q.   Al th o u g h they could have been in touch with you by radio?
              A. There could have been something on the radio which I
              did not hear or a problem with the radio but I did not
              get anything that I received, no.

       Q.        MR. PHILLIPS: When you say that you knew that s o m e ­
            thing was wrong and that there were these emergency service
            would be coming, that is something you worked out yourself,
            from seeing what was happening at the g y mnasium end?
            A . Yes.

       Q.   Thank   you,   Mr.   Sewell.

                                 Cro s s - e x a m i n e d by MR.   KING

       Q.   Packing.   As I understand your evidence you distinguish
             between small occaisons and large occa sions? A. Yes.

       Q.   Small occasions, as I u nderstand it you are referring
             to something like a league match, where you are not e x p e c t ­
             ing the whole of the Leppings Lane terrace to be filled?
             A. That is correct.

       Q.   On those occasions over the years there has been a specific
             system directed to the packing of the terraces? A. The
             practice would be on a small league match to use probably
             the two centre pens, and there would be an officer stood
             on the sterile side, behind the gate.

       Q.   The police, and perhaps even the club, had directed their
             minds on those small occasions to a system for the control
             in the packing of the terraces? A. Yes.

       Q.   And the purpose of that is crowd control, it is to enable
             you to keep within a rela tively small space those relatively
             small number of supporters so the better to control them,
             a. Yes, sir, for segregation.

                           38


                                               S.R, SEWELL

Q. Forgive me, Mr. Sewell, I don't think that is right. - A. I
   beg your pardon.

Q. We have heard from Mr. Higgins that the first thing he did
   once he realised what was happening was to go to the gymnasium
   and ask for it to be cleared to receive casualties. - A. I beg
   your pardon on that.

Q. The other thing that Police control plan might have taken into
   account, you were asked about the Tango units and what they
   could have done. We are all aware when an important person
   has to be got to the airport quickly or Royalty to get to the
   theatre through the rush hour, Tango units go to all the
   intersections and are ready to block off the traffic so there
   is a clear run through? - A. That is correct, yes, sir.

Q. That would have been a very simple and the Police are well
   aware of that sort of procedure for these Tango units to have
   done to designated hospitals? - A. Yes. I am not aware of
   ambulances having problems getting through, and I think the
   Tango units were engaged all at the ground assisting, sir.

Q. It is right to say that once everybody did get going after the
   initial delays, ambulances did not have difficulty getting
   through. - A. J. don't think they had any, sir.

Q. The other is this, Mr. Sewell. You say that there was no
   agreement as far as you could recall that ambulances would
   come in one entrance and go out the other by the gymnasium? -
   A . Yes.

Q. In fact the vehicles that were parked by the gymnasium, there
   was a Police canteen vehicle, was not there? - A. Yes, but
   there was room to get past that.

Q. There was also a Police prison van? - A. There were two, sir.

Q. Parked adjacent to the gymnasium between it and the Police
   room and the first-aid room? - A. That is correct, sir. They
   were not blocking anything, those cell buses, because in fact
   the St. John's ambulance initially parked outside the
   ambulance room which is behind the Police room, and we always
   leave room for that to get out, sir.

Q. We also know from the evidence that Mr. Mote and Mr. Garrett
   who were the stand-by ambulance who went to Gate 0, were
   directed by the Police to reverse in adjacent to the
   gymnasium, between it and the Police room and the first aid
   room? - A. That may have been right.

Q. The other matter which caused a difficulty was that Operation
   Support was called for, and in particular dog handlers were
   summoned to the ground. Did you know that? - A. There were a
   number of dog handlers initially behind the Kop with the
   horses, and I can only assume I think Chief Inspector Beale
   got them removed at very early stages, because it looked as
   though there was going to be a pitch invasion, and obviously
                             39




                                                 S.R. SEWELL

     the horses and dogs - as soon as he realised it was not I do
     recall him telling the dog handlers to put their dogs back
     in the vans.

Q. You do recall that, do you? - A. Yes.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  Who was that? - A. Chief Inspector
     Beale. To the best of my recollection it was him, anyway.

Q.        MR. KALLIPETIS:   And what about the vans themselves? -
     A. I think the vans would have been parked somewhere outside
     on Penistone Road. However, there were some large Jumbo cones
     which had been placed on Penistone Road blocking the whole of
     the nearside lane off right along outside the Penistone Road
     entrances, so that would have assisted with any emergency
     vehicles getting in. So there was a lot of room on Penistone
     Road.

          At a later stage when I went out on to Penistone Road I
     recall there were Police vehicles parked on the central
     reservation, and there was no problem with the roads.

Q. Mr. Sewell, page 11 of your statement you refer to a time of
   3.20 p.m. when Superintendent Bates arrived, the second line
   of page 11 of your statement? - A. Yes, sir.
Q. You then go on to describe how the gymnasium was cleared, and
   then some injured people were being brought in. Police
   Officers were bewildered and then bodies were being
   placed on the floor, etc. - A. Yes, sir.

Q. And then do you find the sentence where you say: "I was
   asking control for a doctor to ensure that they were dead”? -
   A. For certification, yes, sir.
Q. In other words, to certify people were dead? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Did you radio that through to control? - A. Yes, sir, several
   times, because I was concerned that we did not want to have a
   problem that people were being brought in, that there was no
   suggestion at all that anybody was other than dead, no
   suggestion whatsoever, but I wanted to be satisfied that
   nobody had forgotten to get a doctor there for the
   certification early doors, and that was my main
   concern.
Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Did you say you tried several
     times? Were you having difficulty then getting through to
     control? -A. I was not getting a reply back. They had
     probably got my message, but that is why I kept repeating it.

Q. They probably had a lot of other things? - A. That is correct.
   I am sure they did get it, because it was not long after -
   there were several doctors came to the gymn - but I recall a
   doctor with a beard coming, and I think that he was the first
   one there and we got him underway.

                                                  S.R. SEWELL

Q.        MR. KALLIPETIS:   In your statement you say he arrived
     about 30 minutes after that, you see. - A. Yes.

Q. The doctor with the beard arrived after about 30 minutes. -
   A. Time is very hazy, sir. It could well have been then. It
   was not a ridiculous time we were waiting.

Q. There is no criticism, Mr. Sewell, so don't think that, but I
   want your help on something else. Did you eventually get a
   reply back from control to say they had put a Tannoy message
   out on the ground, and also they had asked Radio Hallam to put
   a special broadcast out? - A. I did not hear that, but
   certainly when you are in the gymnasium you would not be able
   to hear the Tannoy inside the gymnasium. I can only assume
   that is how the doctors got there, so some message must have
   got through, sir.

          MR. KALLIPETIS:   For your note, sir, the call from
     ground control to Snig Hill asking them to put a message
     through to Radio Hallam was 15.29:

Q. Lastly this, Mr. Sewell. You said that there was no
   information at all that fans were going to arrive late, and
   you had spoken to Sergeant Charlesworth and reaffirmed that
   his calls round to various forces asking for there
   intelligence did not reveal this? - A. I did not specifically
   ask him if he had done it, but he did not give us any
   information about that all, and I am fully aware he is a very
   dedicated Officer and goes to a lot of trouble.
Q. Again, no criticism of him. I want to ask you about something
   else. Is there a central computer which would record all the
   match reports from different Forces and thus make it available
   to any force who has to plan for a particular football match?
   - A. I am not personally aware of one. So»ebody from the
   football liaison department at Headquarters probably would be
   able to answer that. I am not personally aware of it myself.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I think we were told there was
     not, but there are plans there should be.

          MR. KALLIPETIS:   Yes.   That is right, sir.   I had
     forgotten that:

Q. We have been served with details of match reports, Liverpool
   attending various matches prior to this match, and in
   particular Liverpool -v- Hull on 18th February 1989, and that
   appears to indicate the difficulties those Officers
   controlling that match encountered were these. First, that 7
   fans had jumped over or crawled under the turnstiles and
   entered illegally. Secondly, that two wire mesh gates between
   turnstiles and fans passing their retained part of their
   ticket to the fans outside who tried to gain entry alleging
   they had lost the other part of the ticket or had it snatched
   from them by somebody else. Thirdly, that crowds were
   physically pushed back from these gates at which point
   the fans inside crumpled up their retained part of
                           41


                                                 S.R. SEWELL

   their ticket and threw them out of the ground for fans
   outside to pick up. Fourthly, from conversation
   overheard about 100 fans were gathering outside
   without tickets, and the conversation led the Officers
   to believe that those fans were of the opinion that
   the Police would let them in the ground shortly after
   kick-off. - A. Yes, I am aware of that report you are
   reading from, sir.

Q. Was that report available to the Officers planningfor this
   match? - A. No, sir. This has been found out in thelast few
   weeks, since the Inquiry. I am astounded that Sergeant
   Charlesworth was not given this information when he was making
   his enquiries.

Q. This is Inspector Jarvis from Humberside, for the mach that
   took place between Hull City and Liverpool on 18th February
   1989. - A. Perhaps Sergeant Charlesworth could answer the
   question, sir. I can't. He is the one that supplies us with
   the information.

Q. I am told this morning he is not available.

        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   What is your point, that they
   might have heard from the Hull Police?

        MR. KALLIPETIS:   Indeed.

        THE WITNESS:   I am aware that he does not only just ring
   to the host Force of the teams that are playing, he quite
   often rings to places where they have been weeks before to see
   about crowd behaviour and attendance and all the lot. I am
   astounded that this was not forthcoming.
        MR. KALLIPETIS:   Sir, there are other matters which will
   be the matter of submissions in relation to the yellow bundle.
   Thank you.

                 Cross-Examined bv MR. GLASGOW:

Q. Inspector Sewell, when you had your meeting, and   you have Tab
   15 in front of you, with the emergency services,   was the
   purpose of that meeting to ensure that there was   some co­
   ordination between them and that the Police knew   what the
   plans were in the event of trouble? - A. That is   correct, yes,
   sir.
Q. Just this, Inspector, did the Ambulance Service give you any
   indication that they were other than satisfied with the plan
   they had and the arrangements they had made with the club? -
   A. I think, yes, they were satisfied.

Q. They were satisfied? - A. As far as I am aware.

Q. And they gave you no indication that the arrangements they had
   come to with the club from their point of view were anything
   other than idea? - A. I think there was comment that they
                           42



                                               S.R. SEWELL

   would have liked to have had an ambulance at the club as
   opposed to St. John’s Ambulance. There was some comment about
   that, yes.

Q. But that was not a sufficiently serious matter for you to
   think of minuting? - A. No. We were only talking about the
   emergency evacuation procedure in here, but there was
   conversation to that effect.

Q. Can I ask you secondly about the monitoring which you agreed
   was casual. Did you hear Mr. Calvert’s evidence yesterday? -
   A. Yes, sir.

Q. So far as you are aware was the system of liaison and
   particularly the monitoring of the pens you inherited the same
   as the one that he had been carrying out? - A. Yes, sir, I
   cannot see there has been any change.

Q. Can I take you through the steps he told us about in the
   monitoring, that the situation in the pens would be looked at
   through the screens and through the windows of the control
   box? - A . Yes.

Q. And that the people in the control box would be listening to
   messages passing between people in the ground? - A. That is
   correct, yes, sir.

Q. That they would, in his words, be asking those in a position
   to answer, "What have you got outside?” , that would be
   normal? - A. Yes, sir.
Q. That the question would be asked of those in the West Stand,
   ”Go and have a look what the situation is below you” . Would
   that normally be asked? - A. More than likely, yes, sir.

Q. And that with that information an assessment and a final
   assessment would usually be made? - A. I would imagine that,
   yes, sir.

Q. And in respect of the perimeter fence his answer was,
   "Normally the Inspector would be told to go and have a look? -
   A. If there was thought to be a problem, yes, sir.

Q. And that is the system which ought to be followed? - A. That
   is the system which has been followed, sir.

Q. Forgive me, but if that system is followed is there anything
   at all casual or unsatisfactory about it? - A. You can’t see
   ;how many are in the pens without specifically knowing the
   numbers coming through, can you?
Q. No. Is that the point you were accepting by the use of the
   word "casual”? - A. Yes, I would say so.
Q. It sounds like a pretty organised system to me, Inspector.     Is
   that unfair? - A. It has worked in the past.
                             43



                                                 S.R. SEWELL

Q. You say you need counting as well. The total numbers are
   being given regularly from the computer, are they not? They
   are certainly available at the touch of a button? - A. They
   are available, yes, sir.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   The monitoring depends upon what
     over a long period people at football matches have come to
     accept as being the density is tolerable and tolerated? - A.
     That is correct, sir.

                   Cross-Examined by MR. WOODWARD:

Q. Mr. Sewell, on the matter Mr. Glasgow has just asked you
   about, you identified the various points that Mr. Calvert was
   asked about. The people in the control box, they would be
   looking around? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. They would be carrying out their other duties? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. They would have to be looking not only at the terraces but
   they would be looking over the whole of the ground, would not
   they? - A. That is correct, and then dealing with any incident
   that caae over the radio as well that might happen.

Q. No-one had the specific job of standing as it were and
   exercising surveillance over the West terraces? - A. That is
   totally correct, sir.

Q. So in the sense that I think you agree with Mr. King that it
   was casual, it would be a question of as one took a view,
   happening to notice something before any further steps would
   be taken? - A . Yes, something had to be brought to your
   attention.

Q. One would be looking around generally as one might look around
   this room and one might notice some people are more encumbered
   than others with paper? - A. yes, sir.

Q. But unless something drew that problem to your attention would
   the matter be taken any further, unless the eye or the mind of
   the Officer was tuned in to say, "There's a problem there” .
   Would it go any further? - A. No, sir. It is down to the
   individual in the box.
Q. I think you agreed with Mr. Glasgow in answer to one of his
   questions, that these other steps, the communication with the
   outside, going and having a look, sending an Officer down,
   that would depend on something having been noticed, would it?
   - A. Yes.
Q. Because you would not be sending runners down to all points of
   the ground to just check that everything was OK? - A. No, sir.

Q. May I ask you about the briefing of the stewards. When you
   took over from Mr. Calvert you had some notes which you
   briefed from? - A. Correct, sir.
                               44



                                                    S.R. SEWELL

Q. And if we look at those notes there is written in capital
   letters at the fourth entry: "EMERGENCY EVACUATION
   PROCEDURE"? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Did the stewards have any particularrole to perform in the
   emergency evacuation procedure? - A. They were to go to the
   exits and cover the gangways and exits from the stands and the
   exterior gates.

Q. Would it be right to say that their role in the emergency
   evacuation procedure was crucial? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. And unless they understood what they had to do in the
   emergency evacuation procedure the thing would founder? - A.
   That is correct, and we also had two tests, dummy runs,
   throughout the season, sir.

Q. Whenit came to discussing and briefing the stewards, what was
   your attention intent on focusing their minds on? - A. The
   main thing for me was the emergency evacuation.

Q.          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    They had to go to the   gates? - A.
     Yes.

Q. What did they actually do there? - A. Assist with people going
   out and make sure that the gates open.

Q. That is the gates out of the stand? - A. Yes, and the exterior
   gates.
Q. And the exit gates? - A. Correct, sir.

Q. But beyond that.... - A. And generally just assist with people
   going out, and be there as a calming influence because they
   were obviously identifiable as stewards with the tabards on,
   sir.
Q.        MR. WOODWARD:   You would want them to know exactly what
     to do and for them not to leave and evacuate? - A. Exactly.
     They had got to be the calming effect with the Police
     Officers of getting people out, and this was impressed upon
     them.

Q. And although some of the stewards were experienced individuals
   would it be right to say you had no knowledge in detail of
   their level of understanding? - A. That is correct. I knew
   one or two, but obviously I know the senior stewards.
Q. And did you spend the time of the briefing in spelling the
   evacuation procedure out to them? - A. That is right, and I
   wanted to hammer it home by showing them this very descriptive
   film at the end.

Q. Is it right in the course of that briefing of the stewards you
   did not give your attention to telling them about supervising
   and moving people around and dispersing them? - A. No, Mr.
   Lock went through that in full detail.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        Thank you very much.

                      DOUGLAS JOHN LOCK Called

                      Examined by MR. GOLDSACK:

Q. Mr. Lock, for some     years prior to your retirementfrom the
   Police in 1985 you were a Superintendent based in FI Sub-
   Division covering Hillsborough? - A. I was, sir.

Q. And is it for three years you personally were in charge of
   policing there? - A. That is correct, sir.

Q.   1982 to 1985? - A. That is correct, sir.

Q.    Were you present at the  1981 Semi-Final?- A. No, I was not
     sir. I was in Headquarters at the time.

Q. Were you aware of the memo that had been raised in 1981
   expressing Chief Superintendent's Herold's dissatisfaction
   with stewarding? - A. I was aware of the original intention of
   the memoranda. I was very fortunate because my predecessor in
   the post I occupied at FI was Mr. Chapman, and he had moved
   sideways to become Detective Superintendent, so he was able to
   liaise with me and brief me about many things appertaining to
   the Sub-Division.




                                  /     He talked about that
                             46


                                                     D. LOCK

     He talked about that;asewell, that in actual fact the
     Police had come to an arrangement with the club that
     they would steward that particular end of the ground
     and when Mr. Chapman and I visited the ground, ted I
     remember very clearly the first large match and that
     was in the season before we were promoted, it was
     against Leeds United and there was a very high level
     of public anxiety because of the actions of the Leeds
     fans at that time.  We went to the ground and we dis­
     cussed what we were going to do and, as Mr. Woodward
     said, there was an awareness of the level of limitation
     of the stewards and consequently it was decided the
     Police would do that and the system which was in fact
     adopted was the filling of pens on all occasions.
     There was not any disparity about the differences
     in the matches.  There was a difference in the level
     in which - the number of Policemen were used on those
     terraces.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     No difference in the way
     they were packed;, just the   number of officers? - A.
     That is right, sir.  If you   had a small - each game
     was categorised before each   season into A, B and C.

Q. What I was pausing for, I did not catch the names.
   You said you went to the ground and there was a
   specific meeting about this, was there? - A.No,  I
   went to the ground with the Police Officers, my
   Chief SuperintendentKlecold.

Q.   Yes.   And who else? - A. And Mr. Chapman.

Q.   Chapman.   Yes. - A. We looked at the ground.

Q.   Presumably somebody from the club? - A. Yes.    We met the
     secretary, Mr. Chester.

Q. Chester.  Yes.  This was when? - A. This was before the
   Leeds United game and there had been - it was early on
   in the season - there had been a number of incidents
   which involved Leeds fans in other parts of the country
   and there was a high level of anxiety about the policing
   arrangements for that day and that was when it was
   emphasised to me the fact that although there had been
   this memoranda as a result of the 1981 problem that it
   was not in fact being adhered to and that Police were
   stewarding that end of the ground and that is the system
   which pertained when Mr. Chapman was there and that is
   the system which I carried on and I know was carried on
   by both Mr. Freeman and Mr. Murray because when I changed
   my roles I spoke to them about the policing at the
   Leppings Lane end of the ground.

Q. This game with Leeds United was when?- A. I think that was

                                                    D. LOCK

     1982, My Lord.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   1982.   Thank.you very much.

Q.        MR. GOLDSACK:   So although this was not reduced
     into writing it was a reasonably formal agreement between
     the club and the Police? - A. Yes.

Q. About Leppings Lane terrace in particular? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. And so throughout the rest of your time in the Police
   Force is that what in practice you did, namely, you
   directed the fans on the Leppings Lane terrace? ~ A .
   It was incorporated into the Police order for each
   match.  It clearly stated the control box would monitor
   and would direct in the way in which the pens were filled.
   The pens were not as they are now.  There were only three
   pens, the South pen, the central pen,  that is 2 and 3 as
   it is now - 3 and 4 as it is now - but there was the
   South pen, the central pen and the North pen and then
   the elevated section.

Q. Now, you retired early 1985 and you took up your part-
   time appointment with the club later that year.  Is that
   right? - A. I actually retired on the 28th of February
   but I ceased duty on the 22nd of February, 1984, because
   I had time owing and annual leave to come, so I did not
   work into 1985 and I commenced employment as the Security
   Officer at the club in August, 1985.

Q. In between those two I think you had written certain
   articles for the Police Review about policing at football
   matches? - A. I wrote several articles for Police Review
   attd thesSheffield Telegraph, sir.

Q. Would this be correct, Mr. Lock, that in at least one of
   those articles you were fairly critical of football] r,i
   management in general, club management? - A. Which way
   do you mean, sir?

Q. In not taking sufficient responsibility for crowd
   problems. - A. There was an incident at Barnsley just
   at the time I was retired when a lot of damage was
   caused by fans from Leeds United again and houses were
   damaged and the club completely fefused to accept any
   responsibility for what was going on outside the ground
   and in my article I did raise the question, what did the
   club think those fans were doing in that part of Barnsley
   at that particular moment.

Q. Did you also before taking up your employment with the
   club - were you of the view that very often stewards did
   not do that which they should be doing? - A. It is a
                            48


                                                        D. LOCK

     difficult question, that, sir.  I can answer it really
     retrospectively.  The stewards are generally well meaning,
     salt of the earth lads who go to the match because they
     are supporters of the club but of course their limitations
     inasmuch as their knowledge of the law and their physical
     abilities are restricted by their ages.  Consequently we
     all have to acknowledge that the stewards can only do so
     much and this was another factor in deciding whether or
     not the Police should steward the away end of the ground.

Q. Mr. Lock, you are quite right but in the article I have
   in mind which is in the Sheffield Wednesday bundle you
   are at pains not to criticise the stewards but you do
   make the point that frequently they do not do certain
   things and therefore in practice the Police have to do
   it and you make the observation this is not acceptable?
   - A. Can you tell me which page that is, please, sir?

Q. This is document 2B.    It comes after page 15.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Ik?

          MR. GOLDSACK:   In the Sheffield Wednesday bundle, sir.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Thank you.

Q.        MR. GOLDSACK:    There is a double document at 2A
     and then there is your article covering two pages at 2B.
     - A. I am sorry, sir.  I have not quite accustomed myself
     to the way these documents run.

Q. They started out all right but they have had so many
   additions.  It is about 25 pages into the bundle?

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     What page is it?

          MR. GOLDSACK:   It does not actually have a page
     number.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Whereabouts does it come?in the
     pagination?

          MR. GOLDSACK:   After page 15.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Thank you.

          THE WITNESS:   I am sorry, sir.       We are having
     difficulties.  2B, sir.

Q.       MR. GOLDSACK:    2B.    - A. The Police Rfeview article.

Q.    Itis immediately before  page No. 16 which is in the
     bottom right-hand corner.  The actual document in mine
     is not paginated, - A. I have found it, yes, sir.   2B
w                                49


                                                         D. LOCK

         It is page 66 of the Police Review.

              MR. GOLDSACK:   That is what the document looks like.

              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Yes.   Now we have got it.

    Q.        MR. GOLDSACK:  Towards the bottom right-hand of that
         page, it is under the paragraph heading of iscorting
         visiting fans. - A. Yes, sir.

    Q. Towards the bottom of that page you say "My regretful
       experience of stewards,and I must say it is through no
       fault of theirs, is that they are usually less than
       useful."   You then make reference to a particular club
       where they are not.   Then you say "Otfmrsdo not and
       frequently the Police take upon themselves to assume
       stewards' duties.   This is not acceptable"?  - A. Yes,
       that is quite true, sir.

    Q. Was that your general feeling at the time you took up
       your position at Sheffield Wednesday? - A. No, it was
       not.  I was talking - I should explain to you that I
       visit at least two football matches a week.  I have
       always done.  I have been a football supporter and I
       have seen numerous grounds in the country and looked
       at them, the policing and the stewarding problems.   I
       did not find that, sir, at Sheffield Wednesday.  We
       knew the limitations and obviously, as a Police Officer
       in charge of the policing arrangements, I did make these
       arrangements for how to steward the West end but I did
       not find that the stewards - there are exceptions of
       course - failed to carry out their duties.   We
       particularly included in their instructions what
       they had to do and what the effects would be if
       they failed to carry out their function.

    Q. You say when you changed hats and went to Sheffield
       Wednesday you confirmed with your successors in the
       Police that they would in practice continue to steward
       the West terrace? - A. That is true, sir.

    Q. Do we take it that at no stage up until the present
       time have you discussed that that should change? - A.
       I was asked to provide additional stewards in respect
       of the Kop for the semi-finals in 1987, 1988 and this
       last year and in fact we provided those additional
       stewards.  We followed the recommendations made by
       Mr. Calvert in respect of the stewards' instructions
       and every time the Police came to the club with a
       request, and there was no restriction financially
       because werwere not paying for the stewards, we
       would have complied with anyyrequest which had been
       made and if they had asked for more stewards on the
       Leppings Lane end we would have had to make arrangements
                                              D. LOCK

but we were never asked.

I wonder, Mr. Lock, if you would have available a copy
of the latest Green Guide which is no doubt a document
you are very well aware of? - A. It is, sir.

And if you go, please, to Chapter 13, headed Stewarding.
This would be a document that became available to you
not very long after you took up your position with the
club? - A. True, sir.

Now,  the heading under paragraph 13, the first item
referred to, is that effective stewarding should prevent
overcrowding? - A. That is true, sir.

In practice that must refer to the standing areas rather
than the sitting areas? - A. Of course.

What was your view when that new copy of the GreanGGuide
came out as to whether that was the responsibility of
stewards? - A. It was the responsibility of the club.
The Green Guide clearly emphasises that. But it does
not say that we cannot use any other agency in achieving
that managerial objective and we knew what we were doing
in all of our stands with our stewarding levels, we knew
what we were doing on the Kop with our stewarding levels
and we knew what we were doing on the Leppings Lane end
with our policing levels as arranged and agreed between
the club and the Police.




                           /|Q. The documents that
                                                  D. J. LOCK

The document that came into existence -- and we have
them at pages 451 to 7 in our core bundle —             of stewards
duties and match day i s n t r u c t i o n s . Is it right that there
is no reference in those to ove r c r o w d i n g or preventing
ov ercrowding. A. You mean this document, sir?

Yes, amongst other documents.. A. Yes,         that   is true,     there
is no refe rence to stewarding.

No reference to stewards having a re s p o n s i b i l i t y   to prevent
over crowding? A. That is true.

       LORD JU STICE TAYLOR: Would not that have been appropriate,
though, for the Kop end? A. Yes, I suppose we could have
put it into the Kop end but the fact of the matter is that
on the Kop the main obje ctives of the stewards is to keep
the gangways clear and also the entry ways, and work in
co n j u n c t i o n with the police.

As I understood it you were saying that the duty to see to
over crowding, in effect, the club employed the police to do
that at the Lepping s Lane end and were therefore within the
Green Guide? A. That is true, sir.

But at the Kop end, as I unde rstood it, the stewards accepted
re spons i b i l i t y for doing it? A. There were stewards and
police at the Kop end wo rking in co n j u n c t i o n with each
other, sir.

There were no i n s t r uctions   for the stewards     for that     end?
A. No.

       MR. GOLDSACK: Had you got any formal arrang e m e n t with
the police for that end? A. We used to speak to the police
liason officer, either Mr. Calvert or Mr. Sewell, and
a c c ording to the category of the match and the number of
stewards we were wa nting we could come to the arrangements.
In the last match which caused this Inquiry, the 15th April
match, Mr. Calvert and I spoke about the stewarding and the
number of additional stewards required.     He came and saw
me during the pre-match build-up and we discussed the
deployment.     One of the things that he emphasized was that
he was aware that there was going to be quite a number of
Liv erpool fans on the Kop, which was the N o t t i n g h a m Forest
domain, and that he wanted to put them over an elevated
area near to the North Stand.     He was asking my stewards
to keep the gangways clear, to keep the entrances clear,
and if they could identify any Liverpool supporters to
direct them over to the police.

    LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: You say Mr. Calvert?             A. Mr.    Calvert.
He was the officer in charge of the Kop, Sir.

    MR. GOLDSACK: P a ragraph 198 of the Green Guide is
clearly r e f erring to club stewards rather than police
                                                   D. J. LOCK

is it not?   A. That    is right,     sir.

Do we take it from what you are saying, Mr. Lock, that at
no stage during your time at the club have you ever said
an ything to any of the stewards that they should take any
part at all in m onitoring for over crowding? A. The
stewards were perfectly aware — Mr. Thorpe and his
stewards in the West Stand —       were perfectly aware of
the police a r r a ngem ents which were going on unde rneath
them.

Does that mean, Mr. Lock, that at no time have you said
an ything to any steward to suggest that they should keep
a careful eye, or even a general eye, on possible over
crowding? A. We speak about safety generally and, of course,
we do me ntion the fact that if there is a n y thing which is
unsafe that it should be brought to our a t tention straight
away, but specif ical ly should they keep an eye on the
Le ppings Lane terrace, no.

You heard this morning Mr. King asking Inspector Sewell
whether he accepted that all the police efforts on the
Leppings Lane terrace were directed to crowd control.
A. That is not correct.

You disagree with Mr.       Sewell?    A. Vehemently.

Does that not suggest there     has been a total break-down
in c o m munication? A. No, Sir, I am afraid it suggests that
Mr. Sewell is not quite aware of what was h a p pening on
those terraces.     Can  I explain to you what the system
was?

Please do. A. When I arrived there —                   and I continued this
system —           we had no benefit of t elevision cameras and
c on s e q u e n t l y everything was byob s e r v a t i o n  and radio
communi cation.           As a   result of that we had decided, in
liason with the club, that we were going to police those
pens on the Leppings Lane end.             The matches, as I have
already explained, were categorised, and there is no
disparity between the matches, it was a qu estion of levels
of policing.            If it was a 'c' match that would mean to say
that there would be a small number of people in the ground,
usually below twenty             thousand.      Then the number of police
officers we required             were few. What I did was that I decided,
as it was a shared facility, to keep the Centre pen, which
is three and four now, sterile.               I would pack into the South
pen immediately under the police box, the away fans.                      We
knew that the South pen held just under two thousand and
if we were going, through our intelligence, to receive only
that number, we would put them in there.                     If they were going
to be inexcess of two thousand and we had to utilize the
Central pen we would keep the North pen sterile.                      We would
use more officers but we would pack and we tried to pack
sequentially originally fans into first of all the South

SDJ3                                                    D. J. LOCK

            pen and then the Centre pen.          All the time we were doing
            this officers who were wo rking on the track were looking
            at the people coming in and many is the time we have had
            to say: "Can you see if there is room down at the front?
            Can we get any more in?" because we were concerned about
            safety.      Many times Mr. Creaser I can recall on one occasion,
            Mr. Sykes on another, used to come along to my control
            box and say to m e :"How is it going on, sir, have we any
            more room? Come and have a look".           I used to look and it
            was not a casual or even cavalier from the way Mr. Woodward
            described it, looking over and doing other duties.            It
            was a concentrated      effort ensuring that not only were the
            people controlled properly but they were packed properly.
            All of the time I was m o n i t o r i n g from i nformation and from
            ob s e r vation what was going on.

                When the pen became tolerably full I would say: "Close
            the pen".  The police officers would bring across barriers
            and stand there and direct the fans into the other pens.

       Q.   What you have just been d e scribing is a s i tuation of less
            than full capacity.    During your time as a senior police
            officer did you in fact have any full capacity games?
            A. Can I say that —    and you are aware and this Inquiry
            is aware —   that the capacity of the ground has been
            in creased by the addi tional terracing on the Kop.

       Q.   Yes. A. Our capacity was just over 50,000.           I cannot
            recall our ever having a 50,000 gate.           What you must
            appreciate is that when I went there we were running for
            pr omotion and we did not achieve that the first season.
            The second season we achieved promotion and the third season
            we were in the first di vision for the first time in some
            cons i d e r a b l e time.   We had in excess of 40,000 on many
            occasions.          The diff erence between the occasions when
            Manch e s t e r United and Liverpool came for the first time
            were not very great to the diff erence between the s e m i ­
            finals which had gone over the last three years.

       Q.   So you had occasion, did you, during your policing,       when
            the Leppings Lane end was full to capacity? A. Yes,       sir.

       Q.   On how many occasions?   One or two?   A.   It was more than two
            or three.

       Q.   You are saying, are you, you had no pr oblem on those occasions
            in making sure there was an even dist r i b u t i o n of the crowd?
            A. We have filled the pens, observed the filling, and
            we have closed them.  Inspector Calvert closed the centre
            gate of the centre pen on one occasion I can recall.

       Q.   On those big matches, Manch e s t e r United, Liverpool, you
            filled the pens one by one, in your time? A. We did on
            the small matches.  On the larger matches we found this
            was not possible.  It is before my time but the club
                                       54


SDJ4                                                      D. J. LOCK

            in the past used to use a system of numbering.         You can
            still see on some of the positions in the ground one,
            C ent re pen two, and three.      This was a pparently on the
            tickets.    The police asked for this to be discon tinued
            becaus e it caused a problem in the packing of the pens.
            When it was a large match you can imagine the d i f f i culties
            if people enter through the t urnstiles and they have a
            nu mbe red ticket which shows entry number three and they
            are on number one or two side and there would be this
            cris s-cross.   As a conseq u e n c e I am led to believe that
            the police asked for those numbers to be taken off.

       Q.   On the big matches, the full house matches that you policed,
             did you in effect let the crowd find their own level on
             the Le ppings Lane Terrace? A. Yes, that was all we could
             do .

       Q.   You are saying that in your time there always seemed to
             be a fairly even d is t r i b u t i o n of people? A. No, of course
             not, because as everyone knows sometimes the centre pen is
             the one w hich is the most popular and it fills the quickest
             I have had to say: "Close off the centre pen".            I have
             done it many a time; not once or twice.

       Q.   How did you achieve that? A. Because we had barriers outside
             the back of the West Stand near to the entrance to the
             Centr e pen, and those barriers used to be drawn across and
             police would man them and deviate the people to the ends,
             the wings of the West Terracing.

       Q.   Did you in fact have barriers near to that position for that
             s pec ific purpose, if it became necessary? A. Yes, Sir.

       Q.   Were they there in fact for any other       purpose?    A. Not as
            far as I am aware.

       Q.   Can I come to the recent     semi-final.   A. Yes,    Sir.

       Q.   Were you aware of any problems at the 1988 sem i-final?
             A. Only I was told that the Centre pen -- and of course it
             was a full house on that day —   the Centre pen was closed
             off by the police because the fact that it was so full
             and they had to de viate them around.  That was no problem,
             that is what I would have expected with our system.

       Q.   Help us please,    who told you that? A. I think that it
             was Mr. Thorpe,   my steward at the West end of the ground.

       Q.   Can you help us as to when he told you?         Was   it on the
             day? A. It was on the day.

       Q.   That is obviously s omething you would      expect him to pass
             on to you? A. Of course.

       Q.   Did   you ever discuss   that with any police   officer?

SDJ5                                                        D. J. LOCK

            A. I think I discussed it with Inspector Sewell about the
            closing of the centre pens, and also Mr. Mole.

       Q.   At that particular match?        A. No,   not at that match.

       Q.   I ask that because you may not be aware that a number of
            senior officers who have given evidence here were appa rently
             totally unaware that that had happened at the 1988 s e m i ­
             final. A. That may be so, sir.

       Q.   But you were aware of it on the day,           from your chief
            steward? A. Yes.

       Q.       LORD JUST I C E TAYLOR: Would not you expect control,
            if it did not itself issue the i nstruction to close
            off the Centre pens, at any rate to be made aware that
            it was being done? A. I would have expected it, Sir,
            when I was in charge.

       Q.        MR. GOLDSACK: Would you have expected to inform
            control? A. I would have thought, Sir, that it was obvious
            for a start that the centre pen was getting full and that
            co ntrol might be the one that issued the instructions to
            close it.    If someone took some action on their own accord
            I would have expected the inspector in charge of the area
            at the West end of the ground to have said: "We have
            closed the centre pen".

       Q.   Coming to 1989 it was r e asonable to suppose that that same
            pr ob l e m might arise, namely that a time would come when
            you would need to close off the centre tunnel? A. I cannot
            say that, can I?      How can I say that it was reas onable to
            ex pect the centre pen? It might have been reas onable to
            expect any of the parts of the ground to be full.

       Q.   I thought you said that the areas behind          the goal was
            us ually the most popular? A. Yes.

       Q.   Th e r e f o r e it was quite likely, was it    not, that what
            h a p pened in 1988 would have to happen        in 1989? A. I
            concede that, yes.

       Q.   Were there any extra stewards on duty at the 1989 s e m i ­
            final to assist in persuading people to go round to the
            outer pens? A. Not to carry out those specific tasks,
            sir, because we did not do that.

       Q.   Was there ever any d i scussion to the effect that perhaps
            that was a stewards job rather than the police? A. No, if
            the police had told us that they wanted us to do that we
            would have done it.    We provided a dditional stewards in
            the West Stand.

       Q.   On the 15th April     itself you arrived       at the ground     fairly
            early. A. I did.

       Q.   You would no doubt have a lot of routine ma tters to
            attend to during the mo rning and early part of the a f t e r ­
            noon. A. True, sir.

       Q.   Can I come to a p p r o x i m a t e l y two o'clock.    Between two
            and three o'clock where would you be on a match such as
            this? A. I could be anywhere, Sir.              P r imarily I would be
            in the control room because that is where people know where
            I am to be contacted but my duties could take me anywere
            in the ground.

       Q.   This year were you in fact in the control         room at about
            two o'clock? A. Yes, I was.

       Q.   Where, of course, you can find out at the touch of a
            button how many people are in the ground. A. I do not need
            to touch a button.  I look at the display monitor from
            the computer and it tells me.

       Q.   What was the position at about two o'clock. A. If my memory
            serves me right I think that there were about 24,000 people
            in the ground at that time.

                             Cross-examined         by MR.     KING:

                                                    D.J. LOCK

Q. And you would expect that in every operational order for any
   match? - A. Yes.

Q. And the typical sort of order which you might expect would be
   the one we have already looked at this morning, but by all
   means have a look at yourself, which is at document 21 in the
   South Yorkshire Police bundle, Serial 9? - A. The format is a
   little different, but in general I think....

Q. We will pause and have a little look. - A. What do you want me
   to look at specifically?

Q. Serial 9 in document 21.    Can you see it?    Leppings Lane
   terraces. - A. Yes, sir.

Q. You see: "Ensure pens are filled in accordance with
   instructions from control". That is the sort of thing you
   would expect to see. Is that right? - A. "Maintain order and
   ensure pens are filled in accordance...."  No, we were more
   detailed than that.

Q. Even more detailed? - A. Yes.

Q. But you would certainly expect something like that at least? -
   A . Of course, yes.

Q. When you then transferred to the club did you ever yourself
   have sight of the operation orders of the Police for any given
   match? - A. Yes, Graham Mackrell used to receive a copy of the
   order.

Q. Did he ever show it to you? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you see the operational order for the Semi-Final of 1989?
   - A. No.

Q. Was there any reason for that? - A. Yes.

Q. What? - A. The Police did not provide us with one.

Q. Did you see the operational order for 1988? - A. Yes.

        MR. KING:   Sir, I am now at a total disadvantage because
   I have not got a copy of the 1988 one. I don't think I have
   ever seen one.

        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I think we had it this morning.
   Serial 14 are you looking for?

        MR. KING:   Yes, indeed, sir:

Q. Could you keep document 21 open, if you will, Mr. Lock, and
   turn to the document you have just been shown, which is the
   1988 document. - A . I have not been shown that.(Document
   handed to witness)
Q. You see there the orders.       Before I ask you any questions I
                             64


                                                 D.J. LOCK

     would ask you to read Serial 14 in that 1988 Semi-Final, which
     is to do with the Leppings Lane terrace, and look back again
     to Serial 9, the same duty in the League game in document 21?
     - A. Yes. I have looked at the differences.

Q. Do you see the omission as between the League operational
   order and the Semi-Final operational order of the express
   instructions as to the filling of the pens in accordance with
   instructions from control? - A. I do, sir.

Q. Does that come as a shock to you? - A. I must admit I am
   surprised.

Q. It comes as a shock? - A. If you wish to say "shock".

Q.   On your evidence it ought to be kept in, should not it?   - A.
     It should, certainly.

Q. When you read this in 1988 did you say to yourself, "There is
   not a word in the operational order for the semi-final to do
   with the filling of the terraces"? - A. No, sir, I did not
   read it in that detail.

Q. If you had read it what would you have done? - A. I would have
   questioned it if I had read it and noticed it.

Q. Do you understand even now why it is omitted? - A. According
   to what Mr. Sewell Said this morning quite a number of things
   were omitted on oversight, so I don't really understand why it
   was omitted.

Q. That as I understand Inspector Sewell's evidence was not an
   oversight, it was deliberate? - A. It may have been, sir, but
   if it was it certainly was not drawn to the attention of the
   club.
Q. Let me pursue this with you if I may. It was deliberate, so
   Inspector Sewell would say, because those plans which were in
   the League game orders and which had always been there in one
   form or another, were directed to ensuring for crowd control
   purposes that individual pens which had been designated were
   filled first, so the Police had an eye on away supporters.
   That was the purpose of that planning and that system of
   packing? Do you understand that? - A. So he says.

Q. And you disagree with that totally? - A. Not for the purpose
   of crowd control. For both purposes of crowd control and
   safety. I have already explained the way in which we took
   particular pains to ensure that the pens were filled correctly
   and observation, and I used to say "Close them".

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   When you were Superintendent
     there, before you left the Police, were you in the
     corresponding role to the role held by Mr. Murray on this
     occasion? - A. Yes, sir.
Q.       MR. KING:    When you are filling individual pens one by
                           65


                                               D.J. LOCK

   one, presumably there has to a plan In advance of which
   particular pen should be filled first? - A. Of course.

Q. And that no doubt is put down in writing somewhere?   Those are
   the instructions? - A. Yes.

Q. Somebody therefore has to be designated presumably to ensure
   the filling of that particular pen first? - A. Yes.

Q. A specific system? - A. Yes.

Q. And you are controlling the filling at the point of entry, are
   you not? - A. At the point of entry on to the terraces?

Q. Yes, and in so doing you are not waiting for signs of
   discomfort or signs of people in distress. You are actually
   controlling the numbers going in with a view to not reaching
   that point presumably? - A. That is precisely the object of
   safety, that you don't reach a point where it is too full and
   it is unsafe for people.

Q. The only way you canmonitor for overcrowding by observation
   is to wait until yousee signs of discomfort, is not it? That
   is the only real way     you can do it? - A. You don’t have to
   wait and see people standing on each other's heads. You wait
   until you can see there is no room left on the terrace. You
   don't wait until they are pressing down. You then say, as I
   did, "Close the pen".

Q. So are you saying you are expecting somebody to be
   specifically designated to keep looking at a given pen in
   order to see whether or not the number has been yet ;reached
   which is safe? - A. There was an Inspector in charge of the
   West end of the ground, and he looked and walked around, and
   looked there. There were serials placed, half used to go on
   the terraces and half used to be employed behind the West
   Stand. I looked there and I designated myself to have a look.
   I could see quite clearly because it is the best view in the
   ground. If you look from that box it is the best view of the
   Leppings Lane terraces in the ground, and I could see quite
   clearly whether or not there was any danger to anybody in
   those pens.

Q. Would you if you had been in charge of a full capacity ground
   at that end of the ground have allowed a situation to arise
   whereby there was obviously a disparity arising between the
   end pens and the middle pens? -A. There can always be a
   disparity, but you are saying a capacity crowd. You don't
   allow the disparity to arise. You stop it.

Q. A capacity crowd is one which is going to fill the whole end?
   - A . Precisely.

Q. And you don't wait you say, I suspect, until you can see the
   middle pens are absolutely full and the side pens half empty.
   That is a situation you don't want to arise at all? - A. True.

                                                              D.J. LOCK

        Q. When did you personally in 1989 notice that exact situation
           had arisen? - A . I noticed when C gate was opened, when it
           went for the first time as I have just described, one of the
           reasons I went down on to the pitch was to see whereabouts the
           vacancies which I knew were there, 2,500 on the Leppings Lane
           end, were. I went down     there and looked and I could see that
           the centre pen was full   and there were spaces on the two
           wings.

        Q. You did not have to go down to see that. That was obvious
           just looking across, was not it? - A. From where?

        Q. Between the hours of half-past-2 and 3 o'clock did you at any
           stage have an opportunity to see the state of the Leppings
           Lane end terrace? - A. Yes.

        Q. From where? - A. From the pitch.

        Q. At what sortof time? -A. if I say I went down on to the pitch
           3 or 4 times between 20-past-2 and the time I went down
           because of the gate, that would be 10-to-3-ish, I went three
           or four times.

        Q. During that time you must have been able to observe that the
           central pens were filling up and getting very full and the end
           pens were not, because that was obvious? - A. No, it was not
           like that.

                MR. KING:   May I borrow a photograph which I know should
           have been exhibited. There was a photograph taken at about
        2.59.
                  LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       Yes.   It was resting on there
             yesterday.

                  THE WITNESS:      Yes, it would'be at 2.59.

                  LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   The one that was put in yesterday,
             something like 212 if I am not mistaken.

                  MR. GLASGOW:   Sir, while that is being looked for could
             I tell you that the other photographs we have given you this
             morning, so you are not misled by them, are the 1988 game. We
             promised to provide you with photographs of the 1988 game and
             i did not want you to be confused. They are still on the
             balustrade in front of you.   The ones we gave you this
             morning were pursuant to a promise yesterday of the climbing
             over the fencing in 1988.
        Q.        MR. KING:      One can see at 2.59 the state of the central
             pens? - A. Yes.
        Q. I am not going to ask you about those at the moment, because I
           have no doubt you are going to say they did not look quite
           like that when you were looking between 20-past-2 and 10-to-3.
           - A . Correct.
                                               D.J. LOCK

Q. Don't let us look at that. Let's lookat the side penwhich
   as we look at it would be pen 6. Yes? -A. Yes.

Q.   That is at 2.59. - A. I accept that.

Q. I don't think it would be unfair to say it is half empty    at
   2.59? -A. Yes.

Q. It follows earlier than that it must have been even more
   empty? -A. Quite.
Q. So it must have hit you in the face, looking at that end, let
   alone the central pens, that that side pen was not filling at
   all? - A. When are you telling me I saw that?

Q. Between 20-past-2 and 10-to-3 at these various occasions when
   you say you went down on the pitch? - A. No, the centre pen
   was full.

Q. I am not talking about the central pen. - A. The other pens
   were building up slowly, but I said to you and you can check
   with the notes, that at 2.50 when I went down after the gate
   opened that there was space on both the wing pens.

Q. Mr. Lock, just listen to the question. At some stage between
   20-past-2 and before 10-to-3 you looked at that end of the
   Leppings Lane end? - A. Yes.

Q. It must have hit you in the face, not about the central pen,
   but that the side pen was not filling at all, hardly? - A. I
   accept that. Don't condition my reply, please. I accept that
   they were filling slower.

Q. If this is the state of pen 6 at 2.59 it does not take much
   imagination to work out that it must have been even emptier in
   the half-hour before? - A. I will accept that. Well, I won't
   accept it, no, because you can't say that to me because you
   were not there and you didn't see it.

Q. Are you accepting that you did not identify a major difference
   between the rate at which the central pens were obviously
   filling and the rate at which the side pens were filling? - A.
   Yes.

Q. Did you observe that? - A. I am accepting that I did not
   notice.

Q. You did not notice that? - A. Yes.

Q. You are not now saying that the central pens were full? You
   did not even notice a disparity? -A. Of course I noticed a
   disparity, but I did not notice such a disparity that I would
   be alarmed at what is going on.

Q. Are you seriously saying that to this Tribunal? -A. I am.

Q. If you had noticed such a disparity what would you have done?
                               68



                                                      D.J. LOCK

     - A. I would have asked the Police what they were doing with
     regards to the closing of the pens.

Q. Exactly, because if you noticed that disparity you would have
   said to yourself, "The Police are not doing their job
   properly"? - A. Precisely.

Q. The job you say they had to do? - A. Yes, but I did not notice
   it.

Q. Can I ask you about something else. We have heard evidence
   from Inspector Darling that around 2 o'clock he had a
   conversation with somebody in the control room, the club
   control room, as to the rate at which the ground was filling
   up, and that someone said to him, an observation, that there
   was clearly a major difference in effect between 1989 and
   1988, and that whereas at that time the previous year there
   were about 20,000 in the ground, now there were only 12,000.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        20,000 Liverpool.

          MR. KING:   Sir, the original observation was in the
     ground generally, and then the observation developed that it
     was the Liverpool fans. It was in two stages, as I understand
     it:

Q. First of all the general observation that the ground at about
   2 o'clock was not asfull in 1989 as it was in 1988. Wasthat
   person you? - A. No.

Q.   Did you notice that:? - A. No.

Q. Let me ask you what you would have done if you had noticed it,
   and I will put to what I will ask you you would have done if
   you had noticed it.    Ifyou had noticed this that at about 2
   o'clock there were some 8,000 fans less thanthere were
   previously and that there were only 12,000 in the ground, and
   the bulk of that shortfall it was obvious from the way the
   ground was filling were at the Leppings Lane end, the
   Liverpool end, would you have been concerned? - A. Yes, I
   would haveasked the Police, "Why is this happening?".

Q. What would you have been concerned about? - A. The fact they
   might arrive late.

Q. Not only that, you only had an hour left? - A. That is what I
   am saying, that they might have arrived late after the kick-
   off.
Q. Even, with respect, they arrived in the next quarter-of-an-
   hour you were going to be in difficulty, were you not? - A.
   Yes.

Q. And that is not arriving late, is it? - A. No.
Q. So whoever it was who noticed that on the evidence, in the
   club control room on behalf of the club, what would you have
                           69


                                               D.J. LOCK

   expected them to do? - A. I would have expected the Police
   Inspector to have done something about it first, and he
   obviously did not, but I would have expected them to have
   drawn it to my attention if that conversation did in fact take
   place.

Q. Never mind the conversation with the Police. If you in the
   control room had noticed this and the person who noticed it,
   because you have club personnel in the control room? - A. Yes.

Q. If they had noticed it what would you expectthem to do? - A.
   Bring it to my attention so I could speak to the Police about
   it.

Q. And then what would you have expected the Police to do? - A. I
   don't really know because I don't know what reaction the
   Police would have had to that. I don't know what the Police
   arrangements were outside the ground, sir, so you are putting
   me in a difficult position. It is not that I am unwilling to
   answer but I can't.

Q. Are you aware - I am sure you are aware - of the number of
   turnstiles which were allocated to the Leppings Lane terrace?
   - A. Yes.

Q. How many? - A. Seven.

Q. For how many people? - A. 10,100.
Q. What rate do you say turnstiles can effectively in a crowded
   game like this take people through? -A. You are asking me
   questions which are really beyond my knowledge, but I
   understand from conversations with Mr. Mackrell that the
   Police were expecting them to come through, both the club and
   the Police, were expecting them to come through at a rate of
   about 1,000 an hour per turnstile.
Q. I think Mr. Mackrell yesterday said 800. - A. I will accept
   that.

Q. On that basis, with half-an-hour to go, if you are going to
   get everybody in, how full do you say, roughly, I don't want
   figures; I don't want you to do it in your head; roughly,
   how many do you think ought to be in the ground by half-past-
   2, for example, if you are effectively going to get the rest
   in in the last half-hour? What percentage would you say? - A.
   I don't really know, because if I might digress a second, my
   experience of Sheffield Wednesday is that people do tend to
   come late. I accept we are putting them through the whole of
   the turnstiles. They come through about 1,000 per hour.

Q. What was your position with Sheffield Wednesday? - A. The
   security officer.

Q. Just give us some idea on a full capacity game of how many you
   expected would have to be in the ground with half-an-hour to
   go if you are going to get everybody through 7 turnstiles of
                           70


                                                  D.J. LOCK

   that 10,000. About how many? - A. Well, how are you telling
   me are wanting to come in, because I believe that around 10-
   to-3....

Q. Would you just answer my question. Listen. There are 10,000
   people who have to get through 7 turnstiles. - A. Yes.

Q. Never mind about what happened on the day. Just think, from
   your experience of the ground, a full capacity, to get through
   7 turnstiles in your experience what percentage of that 10,000
   must have already arrived by half-past-2 if you are going to
   have enough time in the last half-hour to get the remainder
   in, roughly how many? - A. Roughly I would have thought 6,000.

Q. That is over half? - A. Yes.

Q. It is in fact nearer three-quarters you need in the ground
   with half-an-hour to go if everything goes right at that rate
   of 800? Does that astonish you? - A. Well, you are asking me
   questions I am not really qualified to answer.

Q. Did it ever strike you as security officer with half-an-hour
   to go, just looking at the empty spaces, that there was no
   way, leave aside opening gate C or anything like that? - A.
   Are we back to what was on the day now or a hypothetical
   question?

Q. No. On the day. - A. On the day at 10-to-3 I believe there
   was somewhere in the region of 4,000 people outside that West
   end.
Q. So it never ever entered your head with half-an-hour to go
   there were going to be problems? - A. The point is at 10-to-3
   there were 4,000 people somewhere outside. They were not
   going to use 7 gates, because I have already told you there
   were 2,000 vacancies in the North Stand and 2,500 in Leppings
   Lane, and so they were coming through the whole of the 23
   gates. They could have been accepted into the ground in 15 to
   20 minutes.
        MR. KING:   I have no further questions, thank you.

        MR. GOLDSACK:     May I just clarify one matter before the
   adjournment. It is something Mr. Collins spoke of just before
   we adjourned last night. It was the figures concerning blood
   alcohol results taken from the deceased, and he said that
   broadly it was one-third, one-third and one-third. May I be a
   little more accurate. There were 44 of the deceased with no
   discernible trace of alcohol, 36 between 0 and 80, and only 15
   over 80. Of those 15, two were over 150 and the highest was
   177. I mention it at this stage because I think the press may
   be going to report it.
        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Thank you very much.   We will
   break until 5-past-2.
                     (Luncheon Adjournment)

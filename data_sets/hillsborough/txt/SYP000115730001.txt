  I saw        that   persons were          being      Lifted      out     into    the      seats
  above    .


  I r e a l i s e d t n a t m y e f f o r t s to      get        the    crowd back was

  I tnen         n o t i c e d a f t e r a s h o r t t i m e t h a t o n e of t h e g a t e s
 had been opened.                    I approac hed this gate                     where        a few
 other         officers          stood.          F r o m inside the            crowd I           was
 hanaed a youth wearing                       a Liverpool           shirt.            H e w a s no
 o l d e r t h a n 15 y e a r s , i f t h a t ,          I carried him a few yards
 onto the p i t c h and laid him down.                           His pulse was beating
 frantically               but     he    was not b r e a t h i n g ,           I c a r r i e d out

 supporter             and     told him            to m o n i t o r    his b r e a t h i n g etc
 A r o u n d m e m o r e boriies           had been laid              o u t so I m o v e d ' t o
 another young white                    mate     and together with a doctor                        I
 carried           out r e s u s c i t a t i o n    for      what       seemed        to     be    a
 considerable time                   in     tandem       before the            doctor        said
 'It's no use, he's gone,"                                                                         '

 R person         (not   known)       said,      "I'll     take     over."

 I s t o o d up a n d           w a l k e d a r o u n d a n d it w a s t h e n I s a w t h e

 on       the   ground          in t h e p e n a l t y      area,    people who       were
 injured        sat       or      lay about           virtually      being tended        by
 t el t o w s u p p o r t e r s .

 I went         to t h e a s s i s t a n c e of a st     John's A m bulan ce man
 who       w a s t e n d i n g a m a n on the      ground and attempted            to
 revive         him for        some time;        he   d i d n o t r e s p o n d to my

I saw that pe r s o n s were    standing around, doing nothing,
and more  b o d i e s /per sons were being  c a r r i e d out of the
ground.-

 I approached           a     g r o u p of         obviously stunned             youths and
asked them            to a s s i s t      me       to c a r r y p e r s o n s to t h e S p i o n
Kop end.             Together with these tads                     I carried 3 persons
across        the p i t c n on a a v e r t i s i n g b o a r a s ana left s o m e o n e

 I r e t u r n e d to t h e         West Stand end            to      try and find       my
colleagues.                  I saw       sgt   6RAZENER           who        was   carrying
b o d i e s /per sons         from the crowd from a differ e nt gate                      to
t h e o n e I w a s at a n d w e n t           to     his assista nce.               Almost
i m m e d i a t e l y we w e r e p a s s e d ^ a y o u n g lad,           we carried him
o n t o the         pitch and         gave    him     m o u t h - t o - m o u t h and heart
massage.            A f t e r a w h i l e he b e g a n b r e a t h i n g a g a i n and   we

            people were being c r u she a and some were o b v i o u s l y dead.

 I saw that the gates               leading out           onto      tne     pitch were
 shut.         I c l i m b e d off the f e n c e and r e q u e s t e d       to    match

 were opened           I assisted fans            on      the     pitch      that were
 injured.

 Once the           gates       w e r e o p e n e d I a s s i s t e d in c a r r y i n g  out

 O n c e all       the bod i e s were          removed       f r o m t h e g a t e to the

Upon my arrival              I saw        at l e a s t        20+      bodies apparently
dead on the          t e r r a c i n g and p o l i c e m e n s t r u g g l i n g     to m o v e
 them.       Behind        t h e m were Liverpool, s u p p o r t e r s s c r e a m i n g
at       the  police stating                there        were         others     that     were
injured but breathing.                    I s h o u t e d to t h e p o l i c e o f f i c e r s

seriously injured.                 i t h e n t o o k h o l d of an I n s p e c t o r a n d

were out we         t h e n c o n t i n u e d to         m o v e the c e a d out of the
West S t a n d and onto the pitch.

I recall removing              both men,        women     and      children who were
apparent Ly dead .

There were        m a n y b o d i e s on the p i t c h        in t h e p e n a l t y area
and others        about the p i tch who we r e                seriously injured.

I recall being               given a young         y o u t h at t h e g a t e to t h e
west Stand, I carried him with p c                       w r l t o n onto the pitch
and       gave him m o u t h -to-mouth and             heart massage, shortly
after         he    began     breathing. _         I     then       shouted   to   an
a m b u l a n c e m a n w h o r e l i e v e d us*.

Once        alL     the bodies were              out of   the       West      S t a n d I,
together with other                officers and         supporters, organised
c a r r y i n g the dead       and i n j u r e d on a d v e r t i s i n g b o a r d s and

This then resulted            in a     line      of p o l i c e o f f i c e r s b e i n g
deployed         at  the   halfway         line      to      prevent          further
confrontation.         I r e c a l l s e e i n g a n u m b e r of     d o g s on the

F o r e s t f a n s as t hey left.

There       were a number               of s m a l l sporadic    fights              between
rival      fans which were               quickly dealt        with.

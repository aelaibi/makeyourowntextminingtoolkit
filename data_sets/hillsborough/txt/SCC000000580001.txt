                         arranged.-Interviews for Admin staff and team leader were held.
                         Referrals were dealt with by Div 2 staff. Information was
                         collated, sorted and filed.

THE STORY 30 FAR.

     Much Q'f this history will be familiar to everyone, but recounting
it will ensure that we all start from the same point.   As in most
histories we have the legacies from past decisions to adjust to and
interoretations of the history will vary, but I will endeavour to set
out the facts and the objectives as I saw them.

PRIORITIES

A number of tasks and objectives had to be quickly established on my
arrival,, which was nearly two months after the disaster and adecision
had been taken earlier to leave many issues to be dealt with by the
team on its establishment.
1. Responding to the 20+- oustanding referrals,,
2. Establishing the team.
3. Defining a broad based and coherent strategy.
4. Taking the work over from Community Workers that was being
undsrtaken with the Lepp ings Lane s t ew a r d s .
5. Putting together a publicity package.
6. Training needs and support.
7. Liason with the ground and access arrangements.
S. Liason with the north west authorities.
9. Becoming proficient at workinmg with the new admin systems.
    These are probably' in a rough order of p r i o r i t y , though at various
times some objectives moved up or down the scale, depending onwhat
o oportunities presented themselves to move ahead quickly on them.

Pen P icture of

I was born in Liverpool in 1953, where I lived until I left school in 1972.
I then did a four year degree in Latin American Studies at Portsmouth
Polytechnic. This included a years living and studying in Mexico - I also
lived for a short while in Spain.

En 1976 I returned to Liverpool, working for a year in Huyton with Merseyside
C.V.S. I then began working for the Richmond Fellowship who run therapeutic
communities/halfway houses for ex-psychiatric patients. I worked for them for
5 years in Liverpool, Chester and London, ultimately returning to the ' ' r
Liverpool hostel as warden (officer in charge).

In 1982 I moved to Sheffield and wedded bliss(???). To finance this burden
I worked for F&CS at Todwick Grange Children's Centre as a group leader - hard
work and 'character-forming' stuff.

In 1987 I was seconded to Sheffield Polytechnic to do a diploma in social work
I have come to the team direct from the Polytechnic, as Todwick is in the
process of being closed and after 10 years residential work I thought it
was time for a change.

As a Liverpool supporter I was at Hillsborough on April 15th and assisted
after the match and through the following week or so at the Northern General
Hospital.

Important things about me:   I am a Liverpudlian , I am a socialist ■(but then
who isn't?). And I am a stepfather - character-forming stuff???
Pen P icture of




I have been married for 8 years, my husband is a station officer in the
Fire Service. I am 31 years of age. I was born in Leeds and lived there
until the age 18 years when I commenced a 4 years degree CQSW course at
Sheffield City Polytechnic. I graduated in July 1980 and commenced work
as a social worker at the Lodge Moor hospital Sheffield, where I was
responsible for 3 wards; the acute medical and one neuro medical/neuro
surgical ward. I remained at Lodge Moor hospital for 8 years until September
1988 when I left the hospital and went to work at Grenoside Div 7, family
and community services. I worked there for 10 months as a generic social
worker before commencing work with the Hillsborough Task Team.


The social work experience that I have had has been mainly medical. Whilst
at Lodge Moor hospital I had a varied client group, and worked with people
who suffered from heart attacks, strokes, cancer, amputations and chest
infections. The majority of this client group were elderly. On the neuro
medical wards however the majority of my clients were young or middle aged
and suffered from multiple sclerosis, brain and spinal tumours, epilepsy,
motor neurone disease- and huntingtons chorea, other patients who were recovering
from surgery convalesced at the hospital and several of the patients had
suffered head injuries following accidents. The work that I did was therefore
some short term work, assisting with patient discharge arrangements and various
problems that a patient encountered as a result of being in hospital.-I also*
did some long term work which involved counselling and support over a longer
period of time with people whose circumstances may have been dramatically
changed as a result of a new diagnosis or a traumatic injury.


The social work that I did at Grenoside was generic in that I worked with people
of all age groups and had statutory child care cases as well as physically
handicapped, adolescents, young offenders, elderly and single parents.



Throughout my social work career I have been involved in benefits advice work,
short and long term counselling, assisted with practical needs, eg. aids and
adaptations, bereavement counselling.
Pen P ic tu re of


On leaving school I became an apprentice maintenance fitter and becam'e^a qualified
tradesman after five years. For some years I mainly worked.as a contract construction
fitter before moving to Sheffield and working in the cutlery industry. After
redundancy I worked at an advice centre for about a year.

I began work on the Task Team on 4th May and have thus been involved in all aspects
of the evolution of the office.

I hope that in the future the office is fully utilised in its main task and its
many possible subsidiaries.
Whilst working as a nurse at St. Bartholmew|,s Hospital in London, I became
interested in psychological aspects of physical illness. I then did my
undergraduate degree in psychology at York University, my M.Phil degree and
clinical psychology training at Edinburgh University.

Since then I have worked as a clinical psychologist in West Lothian, and in
Edinburgh. My posts have involved working as a sector psychologist working
with people in psychiatric and general hospitals, and in general practice.
I also worked with a psychiatric rehabilitation team.

I have recently completed a research project for a doctoral thesis which
involved trying to identify people with anxiety and depression at an early
stage, to see if it is possible to teach them coping skills which will
prevent them requiring professional help in the next few months. Several
projects aimed at helping staff to identify and reduce stress have been
carried out.
Since leaving school I have always worked in a computer environment, at various
engineering firms and also for a computer bureau.
I have worked for the past 6 years in Computer Services in.the Town Hall.

I joined the Hillsborough Task Team initially, for 3 weeks to set up the computer­
ised information system and became very interested and involved in what was going
on, so applied for the job as clerical assistant, which I do on a job-share basis.

My personal involvement in the disaster is that my husband is a police-officer who
attended the match

I get on very well with my colleagues in Admin and feel I get every help and support
from them.

After talcing 'A* levels I joined F & CS (or Social Services as it was then)in 1972
as a Supervisory Junior Clerk, responsible for nothing but doing a loti (e.g. putting
all the clocks back an hour in Redvers, counting telephones etc)
In October 1972 I became a Clerk/Receptionist, responsible for the departments main
telephone and reception points.
Since 1974 I have worked in the Records and Statistics Section being responsible for
the supervision of six or more staff, provided a vast range of statistical and client
based information about the services of the dept. I have also been responsible for

smooth running and day to day management of the section.
In September 1988 I moved to Division 2 to a temporary basis to cover the Admin.
Assistant Post whilst the postholders were on maternity leave. This job involved
providing admin, support to the Divisional Management team and being responsible for
a range of admin, systems and staff.
My involvement with the Task Team began on Monday 17th April at the debriefing
meeting. As the Admin. Assistant for the Task Team I Have been involved in setting up

I completed my three year social work course in Edinburgh in 1972 and
following this I worked as generic social worker with Edinburgh City
Council for 2 years. I then moved through to the West Coast of Scotland
and was employed for 18 months as a fostering and adoptions officer.
Following local authority re-organisation in Scotland I moved jobs to

The information contained in the following pages has been summarised
from the Inquest Training Day held at Lodge Moor Hospital, Sheffield
on the 6th October, 1989*

The day was chaired by John Pilling, Assistant Director, Sheffield
Family & Community Services Department.   In his opening address, he
acknowledged the reason for our need.to come together on-such'a’Training
Day and therefore asked for one minute's silence as a mark of respect to
all those who died at Hillsborough on the 15th April, 1989.

The talks of each of the main contributors have been reproduced and
therefore some duplication of facts and points will be found. The major
recommendations however have been summarised at the end of this document.

It must also be noted that some of the information is general to
disasters and some specific to particular ones, e.g. Zeebrugge and King's
Cross. The information on inquests is also general, as at this stage it
is not possible to say exactly what the scenario will be for the
Hillsborough Inquests. It is, however, hoped to run a further Training
Day once the date and details of the Inquests are known.




Hillsborough Task Team
Sheffield

February, 1990
                                     2

MR. K. D. POTTER - Coroner, South Yorkshire East District

Mr Potter began by indicating that he would be unable to comment
Specifically on the Hillsborough disaster. He stressed that he had
no connection with the incident and that as such his knowledge of
what had happened on the day of the disaster was the same as (no greater
than) any intelligent individual who read newspapers and watched television.

Mr Potter then talked about the history of the Coroner's Court and how
it has evolvedinto its present form with specific reference to the
inquisitorial, as opposed to accusatbrial, nature of the Court. For
the purpose of this paper, it is not necessary to go into detail
about the the history of the Coroner's Court. Suffice it to say that
over the years, many of the previous responsibilities of the Coroner
have been shed, until the Coroner of the present day is involved almost
totally with the investigation of death, though some vestigial
interests such as treasure trove still remain.

The Coroner today is an independent officer appointed by the Local
Authority. He/she is independent of Central or Local Government and
must be qualified either medically and/or legally. The Home Secretary
offers support and advice to the Coroner but he has no control over
him/her. A Coroner is appointed for life or until voluntary retirement
and cannot be dismissed, except for a grave breach of behaviour.

Circumstances requiring an Inquest

Certain types of death cannot be disposed of without an inquest.
These comprise criminal cases (murder, manslaughter and infanticide);
suicides; road, rail, aviation, domestic and other accidents;
industrial accidents and diseases; deaths in prison or police custody;
deaths where negligent medical treatment is alleged; deaths from
neglect and any other case where the Coroner feels that a public
hearing would be beneficial.

Certain of these cases must be held with a Jury (see Section on Jury).

Adjournment of Inquests

In some cases , it is necessary for a Coroner to open an inquest and
then adjourn it. This would be the case if the death was an obvious
criminal one, in order to allow time for criminal proceedings to take
place. An adjournment also is necessary if the Director of Public
Prosecutions is asked to examine the circumstances surrounding a
death in order to make a decision whether or not to prosecute. This
has been the case with the Hillsborough disaster.

Functions of the Coroner's Court

The Court has two functions in relation to a death:

(1)    To establish the medical cause of death;
(2)    To enquire into the circumstances and cause of a death if the
       death is violent or unnatural.

The Coroner has the power to order a post mortem if he feels it
necessary. As all accidents are reportable to the Coroner, a major
incident involving a number of deaths, as in the case of Hillsborough,
would be referred to a Coroner, and post mortems would be required to
establish the cause of death in each case.
                                     3

Reporting of Deaths

The majority of reports of a death are made by the Police, but in
some cases, a doctor or the Registrar will notify the Coroner of a
death in his/her jurisdiction.

Jurisdiction

The Coroner to whom an inquest would be referred depends on where the
body of the deceased is found. In the case of the 95 people who died
at Hillsborough, it will be necessary for the Inquest to be held in
Sheffield under the jurisdiction of the Sheffield Coroner.

The Jury at an Inquest

There are four circumstances where a Coroner must summon a jury.
These are:-

(a)         that the death occurred in prison.
(b)         that the death occurred while the deceased was in Police
           custody.
(c)         that the death was caused by an accident, poisoning, or
           disease, notice of which is required to be given under any
           act to a Government department.
(d)         that the death occurred in circumstances where the continuance
           or possible recurrence of which is prejudicial to the health
           and safety of the public or any section of the public.

Under category (d) therefore the Hillsborough Inquests will have a Jury.

Qualifications of Jurors

The same rules and qualifications apply to Jurors summoned to attend a
Coroner's Inquest as those who might be summoned to attend a Crown Court.

Number of Jurors

The Coroner shall summon no less than seven and no more than eleven
Jurors.

 Verdict

 A unanimous verdict must be sought; the majority can be accepted
 with no greater minority than two, but the Coroner is only obliged
 to accept a unanimous verdict. If the minority is greater than two
 then the Jury is discharged and a further Inquest must follow with
 a fresh Jury;. In order to reach the verdict, the Jury must retire
 from the Court and consider their verdict in private, without either
 Coroner or anyone else present.

 The Jury can visit the scene of an incident where the death occured
 if it helps them to reach a verdict. Dr Popper may decide to take
 the Jury to Hillsborough to look over the scene of the incident.

 After summing up, the Coroner or Jury must consider what verdict is
 to be returned.
                                       4

The List of possible verdicts includes:

             Natural causes
             Industrial disease
             Dependence on drugs/non/dependent abuse of drugs
             Suicide
             Accident/Misadventure
            ‘Sentence of death
             Lawful killing
             Open verdict
             Unlawful killing
             Stillbirth
             Want of attention at birth
             Attempted/Self induced abortion

Further explanations of these verdicts can be found in Jervis - Book
on Coroner's 16.12.

Mr Potter gave further details on an unlawful killing verdict and
noted that it covers murder, manslaughter, infanticide, and causing
death by reckless driving. A gross negligence manslaughter verdict
requires proof beyond reasonable doubt of gross negligence - going
beyond a mere matter of compensation and showing such disregard for
the life and safety of others as to amount to a Crime against the
State and conduct deserving punishment.

Witnesses

All witnesses at an Inquest are under oath, but the rules of evidence
are not applied as strictly as they are in other Courts. For example,
witnesses in a Coroner's Court have three privileges:

(1)         Against Self incrimination
(2)         Privacy between their lawyer and themselves
(3)         Public interest immunity.

Any person who satisfies the Coroner tha,t he falls within one of the
following categories of person is entitled to examine witnesses at an
Inquest, either in person, by counsel or a solicitor:

(a)         Parent, child, spouse and any personal representative of
             the deceased;
(b)         any beneficiary under a policy of insurance issued on the
             life of the deceased;
(c)         the insurer who issued such a policy of insurance;
(d)         any person whose act or omission or that of his agent or servant
            may in the opinion of the Coroner have caused, or contributed
             to, the death of the deceased;
(e)         any person appointed by a trades union to which the deceased
            at the time of his death belonged, if the death of the deceased
            may have been caused by an injury received in the course of
            his employment or by an industrial disease;
(f)         an inspector appointed by, or a representative of, an enforcing
            authority, or any person appointed by a government department
             to attend the Inquest;
(g)         the chief officer of police:
(h)         any other person who in the opinion of the Coroner is aproperly
             interested person.
            Jervis 13.2
                                   5


The evidence given by witnesses at an Inquest is usually oral, but
documentary evidence can also be used, including photographs. Written
statements made earlier by witnesses can also be used.

A witness must first be examined by a Coroner, after the conclusion
of which any properly interested party may examine the witness. The
witnesses’ own representatives should examine him/her last of all.
An important point to note here is that Legal Aid is not yet available
for representation in Coroner's Court.

Joinder of Inquests

Where an incident involving many deaths occurs it is common for the
Inquests to be held concurrently. It is the right of each person to
have his/her own seperate inquest even where as at a multiple inquest
the cause of death may be the same in many cases.

The Hillsborough Inquests

If the Director of Public Prosecutions decides not to bring charges
the Coroner's Court can commence and will take place with a Jury and
witnesses.

IF however the D.P.P. decides to bring a charge of manslaughter then
Section 16 of the Coroner's Act 1988 requires the Coroner to adjourn
the Inquest until after the conclusion of the relevant criminal
proceedings.

The findings of the Inquest as to the cause of death must not be
inconsistent with the outcome of any relevant criminal proceedings,
i.e. IF the ensuing verdict is a conviction of manslaughter then the :
Inquest Jury must return a verdict of unlawful killing, but if there
had been an aquittal then presumably only a verdict of Accidental
Death or Misadventure or an Open Verdict would be allowed.

IF no charges are preferred, then in due course the Coroner's Inquest
will be resumed and verdicts returned. Should there be a verdict of
Unlawful Killing the Coroner could refer all the papers to the D.P.P.
for further consideration.

     Optional Legal Strategies

     Doug Fraser - Solicitor from Liverpool Steering Committee


     Mr Doug Fraser is a partner in the Liverpool firm of Silverman and
     Livermore, which was contacted within the first week of the disaster.
     He is also a member of the Liverpool Steering Committee. Within that
     first week, Liverpool's local Law Society thought about forming a
     Steering Committee. This Committee was duly elected at an open meeting
     at the Law Society in Liverpool. Six lawyers were elected and they
     have gone on to represent over 130 firms of solicitors around the
     country who are acting for the bereaved and injured. They call them­
     selves the Hillsborough Solicitors Group. The Steering Committee see
     their priorities as falling into five main areas. These are:-

     (i)      The Inquiry. To represent relatives en bloc. The Home
               Office had given approval for this to happen and paid for
               this representation.

     (ii)     Inquests. To represent relatives en bloc once again. This
               had worked well at the Inquiry and seems an appropriate way
               of handling the Inquests.

     (iii)     Trust Fund. To have some legal input to the Fund.

     (iv)      Civil claims. To represent families in any claims they
               might wish to make for compensation.

     (v)      Information. The Committee publishes regular bulletins
               which are sent out to various firms of solicitors which
               make up the Hillsborough Solicitors Group. These solicitors
               are then able to take from the Bulletins relevant information
               to pass on to their clients.

     Having given a background description about the Steering Committee, Mr
     Fraser went on to describe how his talk would give a flavour of other
     legal matters, including the Inquests themselves, and he divided this
     part of his talk into eight sections

     1.       Effects of the Disaster on families.
     2.       Timetable of events.
     3.       Criminal Proceedings.
     4.       Public Inquiry.
     5.       Civil Claims for damages.
     6 .      Distribution of Trust Funds.
     7.       Inquests.
     8 .      Questions and Answers.


1.   Effects of the Disaster

     It is recognised that the physical damage incurred as a result of an
     accident or disaster is easier to see and assess then emotional and
     psychological damage. The lawyers have to try and assess the emotional
     damage in financial terms for compensation. This, by necessity, will
     take some time,as it needs to be at least a year after the event before
     the full extent of the damage is known, i.e. is it permanent; has it
     passed and if so how long did it last for? One area that the Steering
                                          7



      Committee is looking at is the Press and the effect it had in terms
      of psychological damage.

2.    Timetable of Legal Events

      (i)     . The    original timetable of events would have been as follows:-

                (a)      Public Inquiry and the publication of its findings in
                        two parts.

                (b)     Inquests. They had been due to start in January, 1990
                        and would have had a very high profile.

                (c)     Civil Claims.

                (d)     Steering Committee would then have invited the Director
                        of Public Prosecutions to look at all the papers and
                        evidence available with a view to a question oi criminal
                        proceedings.

      However, asPeter Wright, Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police, sent
      a copyof Lord Justice Taylor's report to D.P.P., the timetable of events
      has had to be revised.

      (ii)      The revised timetable is as follows:-

                 (a)    Public Inquiry.

                 (b)    D.P.P. must nowconsider Lord Justice Taylor's Report
                        and evidence being gathered by West Midlands Police.
                        If no charges or minor charges are brought then the
                        original timetable would come back into effect, with
                        either the Inquests or the Civil Cases coming first.
                        However, if the D.P.P. recommends Prosecution then
                        those charges must be heard before either the Inquests
                        or the Civil Cases.

       If there are serious prosecutions, i.e. manslaughter, then solicitors
       would expect every procedural opportunity and device to be used that
       would prolong and delay the event. Those prosecuted will almost
       certainly seek an oral committal before Magistrates, and seek to have
       it thrown out. Then there would be a full blown Crown Court trial. All
       this would extend the timescale by some months, meaning that the Inquests
       would be severely delayed.

 3.   Criminal Proceedings

       Since   the Zeebrugge disaster, it has been possible to charge a corporate
       body with manslaughter. This is because manslaughter can carry a fineas
       a sentence, whereas the sentence for murder is life imprisonment.
       Currently, the West Midlands Police are investigating various agencies
       and bodies in a corporate sense, and individuals within these organisations.
       These include the South Yorkshire Police; Sheffield Wednesday Football
       Club and the Football Association; Sheffield City Council; the
       engineeering company who designed the barriers in the pens, and the fans
       in their broadest sense are under consideration. There may also be others
       who are being investigated. The charges that could be brought range
       from manslaughter to minor breaches of rules and regulations.

4.   Public Inquiry

     The injured and bereaved were represented at the Public Inquiry by way
     of bloc representation. The Liverpool Steering Committee therefore had
     a team of lawyers at the Inquiry. This bloc representation took the
     form of:-

     (a)       A Q.C.
     (b)       A junior barrister.
     (c)       Input from the six lawyers'representing the Steering Committee.

     At the Inquiry, the various solicitors in the Hillsborough Solicitors
     Group gave information obtained from their clients to the six lawyers
     representing the Steering Committee. They then acted as filters of this
     information, i.e. as information came in, it was sifted and then
     presented to the barristers.

     There was a massive amount ofevidence  to be dealtwith at   the Public
     Inquiry and it made sense to have bloc representation inorder   to avoid
     a situation whereby over 150 solicitors were acting on behalf of
     individual clients.

     The Steering Committee believe that bloc representation should also be
     used at the Inquest. Doug Fraser has already discussed this with the
     Coroner, Dr Popper, who also agrees that it is an appropriate way to
     represent the bereaved at the Inquest.

5.   Civil Claims

     In Doug Fraser's opinion, the system of compensating the victims of
     disaster in this country is woefully inadequate, but it can only be
     changed by Parliament.

     In relation to civil claims, the Liverpool Steering Committee met the
     insurers of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and the Police in
     July, 1989. The insurers denied liability so writs were issued by the
     Committee and statements of claims served.

     Since this time, the Police insurers have in fact agreed to pay in full
     claims for killed, injured or those suffering from shock as a result
     of their experience at the match. Seven hundred (700) claims have been
     dealt with. Liability has not however been accepted and the insurers
     have not agreed to compensate any other category of people affected by the
     disaster. The Steering Committee are seeking to extend the category of
     compensation to include those who saw the events unfold on the television
     and were severely affected by what they saw. Test cases have been selected
     from this group of people, including relatives of the deceased and
     injured, and will, be put before the insurers in June, 1990.

     The Steering Committee believe that the victims of disaster who suffer
     from post traumatic stress disorder should be adequately compensated
     and they are seeking to push back the barriers of compensation to include
     this group of people.

     It is also the opinion of the Steering Committee that someone was
     responsible for the disaster at Hillsborough, that it was not "just one
     of those things", which the denial of liability might suggest.
                                          9



        In relation to payments made to individuals from the Trust Fund, it is
        important to note that civil claims are not affected by Trust Fund
        payments. It is therefore possible for people to be given money by the
        Trust Fund and claim against insurers. The main difference to note is
        that money paid to children in Civil Claims will be invested by the
        Court who have absolute authority to do this.

6   .   The Trust Fund

        The Trust Fund was set up with the intention of making financial payments
        to people affected by the disaster from donations given by the general
        public as an expression of sympathy.

        At the present time (January, 1990) the total amount of money received
        into the Trust Fund is £11.5 million.     The Trustees have paid out
        approximately £ 6 million to the bereav'ed and £ 2 million to the seriously
        injured. Seven hundred and fifty (750) claims have been received and
        four hundred (400) have been dealt with.

        The Fund is administered by a group of Trustees who are experienced
        lawyers and accountants. Individual levels of need have been, and
        continue to be, assessed by a group of doctors and lawyers who contribute
        to the decision as to who should get what.

        The Liverpool Steering Committee have no active part in the decisions of
        the Trust Fund, but they are in a position to offer financial advice to
        families, many of whom will receive substantial amounts of money. Never
        having had vast amounts of money before, they will benefit from professional
        advice on investing the money for their children, etc.

7.      The Inquest

        At the time of writing (January, 1990), the date of the Inquest remains
        unknown.

        (1)       Where the Inquest comes in the.timetable of events.
        (2)       What the "opposition" are going to do.

        Both of these will influence the type of profile that the Inquest has and
        therefore the nature of the Inquest.

        Listed below are possible scenarios that will dictate the nature of the
        Inquest.

        HIGH PROFILE                                 LOW PROFILE

        IF the D.P.P. decides not to make            IF the D.P.P. decides to prosecute
        criminal charges the Inquest will            and brings minor charges, the
        be used to try to bring a verdict            Coroner may decide to defer the
        of unlawful killing and will                 Inquest, in which case the
        therefore be high profile,                   Inquest will not be held until
        involving many witnesses and                 after the Criminal proceedings
        substantial representation from              and will therefore be low
        Solicitors.                                  profile.
                                   10



 HIGH PROFILE                               LOW PROFILE
 IF the D.P.P. decides to make              IF the D.P.P. decides to bring
 minor criminal charges, the                major charges, e.g. manslaughter,
 Coroner may decide to go ahead             the Coroner must defer the
 with the Inquest. A verdict of             Inquests until after the
 unlawful‘killing by the Inquest            criminal proceedings and again
 jury could still be sought and             the Inquest will be low profile.
 the Police and the Club decide
 to have representation at the
 Inquest, thus making it high
 profile.

It is the Coroner's reponsibility to each individual family to investigate
into the cause of death of a relative; the main questions being where,
when and how the person met his/her death. Every family is entitled to
have representation at the Inquest. The majority of families will be
legally represented by the Steering Committee Solicitors.

Doug Fraser has had a number of discussions with the Coroner, Dr Popper
and will remain in contact with him to discuss issues arising regarding*
the Inquest..                                                         &

Dr Popper is likely to hold the Inquest in two parts. The first part will
be a generic inquiry into the events of 15th April, 1989. This may be
done in a relatively short time because Dr Popper will have the information
from the public inquiry available to him.

The second part will be the actual Inquests. Dr Popper is keen to have
95 separate inquests, one for each bereaved family, to give them as much
information as possible about the way in which the relative met his/her
death.

In fact, many of the families have already had access to post-mortem
reports, because the Coroner has released them to solicitors if the families
have requested them.

At Dr Popper's request, the West Midlands Police are currently preparing
95 files, one on each of the deceased. Solicitors so far do not have
access to these files. (See question iv).

Timetable of Inquest

In Doug Fraser's opinion, Dr Popper is likely to structure the order of
the inquests around the Pathologists who examined the bodies. This means
that the order may appear to be random.

Logistics of the Inquest

According to the Steering Committee, the Medico Legal Centre is not big
enough to hold the Hillsborough Inquests even if they are low profile.

The bereaved families have already told their solicitors that they would
like certain facilities made available to them, and these include:-

(1)      A Private room to get away from the attention of the media and
         where they can sit quietly if things get too difficult.
                                  11



(2 )       Separate facilities for the client to talk to the lawyer in
           private, should they so wish.

Finally, Doug Fraser stressed that individual families should make sure
that their lawyers spend sufficient time with them before and throughout
the Inquest.

              Questions & Answers - I

                           of Knowsley Borough Council asked if T.V. companies
              were being considered for liability, as some people had suffered
              shock through watching the event on T.V.

A.            "The Steering Committee looked at T.V. companies and newspapers';'
              but you have the option to turn off your T.V. set. The Steering
              Committee decided to concentrate on one or two people to blame.
              If we receive specific instructions from clients, as individual
              solicitors, to look at other issues like T.V. we will do so."

Q.    (ii)                of Gloucestershire Social Serviced commented that
              as the Steering Committee had said they were not going to have
              anything to do with the national press, could some sort of
              statement be made that would help to deflect some of the press
              interest.

k.            "The Steering Committee have a press officer. We are not
              prepared to give lerigthy interviews to the media. We would be
              prepared to give a press statement, but these are often not
              published. Television is different; it has an air of
              respectability. We will talk to the T.V. if our clients want
              it, but not to the press."

Q.    (iii)   _______________ of Sefton wondered how clients would get on
              at the Inquests if the Inquests were managed in an adversarial
              fashion and those clients were represented by solicitors who
              were outside the umbrella of the Steering Committee.

A..           "The Steering Committee would like to think that those
              solicitors who had the best interests of their client at least
              would come under the Steering Committee umbrella, but if a
              particular solicitor did not want to be represented under the
              Steering Committee then Dr Popper would be informed of this:"

              David Wilkins replied "One family at the Zeebrugge inquest
              was represented by a very eminent Q.C. outside the bloc
              representation. He did a lot to probe into the area of
              corporate responsibility. A solicitor working on his own
              can do some good work."

Q.    (iv)    ________ J  of Sefton commented that in relation to files
              held by the West Midlands Police on the 95 deceased, social
              workers had already had access to these files and been able
              to pass on relevant information to the families.

A.            "I know that social workers have seen the files, but lawyers
              haven't. With respect it's not the same as a lawyer seeing it
              and explaining the legal implications. The main thing is that
              families are entitled to the information and should get it."

Q.    (v)                of Warrington asked if it was still possible for
              people to make claims to the Trust Fund.

A.            "The Steering Committee can only deal with those people who
              come forward. People should be encouraged to come forward.
              People see the Trust Fund for people who were bereaved or
              seriously injured and would rather claim against Insurers.
              The Trustees decide who gets paid, not lawyers."

THE PROVISION OF THE DECEASED'S PERSONAL DETAILS TO THE BEREAVED

Sophie Tarassenko - Chairman, Kings Cross Action Group

                    - Team Leader, Kings Cross Support Group


Following a disaster, a significant number of bereaved want, need,
detailed information concerning - in the words of one of the bereaved
following King's Cross - "exactly what happened to the person they
loved: how, where, how quickly they died."

Following King's Cross this was done in private consultations with^
Public Inquiry lawyers representing victims. These took place during
the Inquest.

Following Clapham Junction this was done by Individual Inquest for each
family.

This information, and the manner of its transmission, can be of very
great importance in the process of coming to terms with grief. The
following points have emerged.

1    .    it must be remembered that not every bereaved wants this
          information, but every bereaved person should be offered it
          without having to request it. Naturally, if the bereaved
          person does not want the information it does not have to be
          given.

2    .    The- information when given should be both full and frank
           and not edited (much less distorted) with kindly intent to
           be less hurtful to the feelings of the bereaved.

3    .    Timing is important. Experience indicates that the need to
           know arises after months rather than weeks (with one exception,
           see para, k below). It is often prompted by the media coverage
           of the public inquiry. In some cases, the need to know arises
           after a year or more has elapsed. Therefore, the bereaved
           should be told both that they can have access to the information
           at an Individual Inquest (see para. 5 below) and that a proper
           documentary record of that Inquest will be available to them.

 4   .    The exception is seeing the body. Whereas the great majority
           will not be strong enough to want or need the detailed information
           with which we are here concerned for at least several weeks it
           appears that the strongest member of a family has often wanted
           to see the body in the immediate aftermath. Out of a wish to
           avoid injury to feelings such a request has on occasions been
           discouraged or refused. This has sometimes given rise to long-
           lasting anger. Every deceased should be offered the opportunity
           to see the body without having to request it. This should be
           done with skilled support before, during and after the viewing.
           The bereaved should also be told that they can have access to
           any photographs taken of the body. Even where these offers are
           not taken up the fact of their having been made is important.
Returning to the provision of detailed information, the best
approach seems to be by individual Coroner's Inquests
expressly focused on these details, held several months
after the disaster, and where the bereaved are represented
by one of the team representing the victims in the public
inquiry if there is one.

This approach leans heavily on the Clapham Junction experience,
which appeared to work very well. Apart from ensuring that
there is formal structure for addressing the question this
approach has the following advantages

(a)    it treats each deceased individually.

(b)    where both Coroner and public inquiry lawyer are involved
        it doubly ensures that all information will be brought
        out.

(c)    since the inquests will be consecutive, bereaved will be
       brought together in a way which affords a natural
        (rather than contrived) opportunity for sharing their
       grief, which can, for some, be valuable.

(d)    there is, or should be, transcripted record so that where
       bereaved do not attend, given that the detailed information
       will be elicited in just as exacting a way, there will be
       a proper record in case they should one day feel the need
       to know (see para. 3 above).

Some further matters should be noted.

Where there is no public inquiry, the bereaved should still have
legal representation for the Inquest. Experience indicates a
compelling case for a lawyer to be at their side to de-mystify
the procedure and explain everything in layman's terms.

It should be emphasised that the Individual Inquests would be
limited to this purpose. In the usual case they would all then
be adjourned to deal with the other statutory obligations of an
Inquest in such form as the Coroner deems appropriate.

At the Individual Inquest a room should be set aside for private
consultation. Sometimes, this detailed information is best
transmitted initially in private.

If Recommendation 151 of the Fennel Report becomes law (the
duplication involved in holding both a public inquiry and a
coroner's inquest should be avoided), the Inquiry Inspector
should hold Individual Inquiries.

           Questions and Answers
           - I                   I"and Sophie Tarasenko


Q.   (1)   Bill Pemberton, a member of the H.F.S.G., asked whether or not
           the claims for liability were settled before the Inquest or
           afterwards.

           Sophie Tarasenko replied that most of them were not settled
           yet. Writs had not been issued before the Inquest and liability
           had not been admitted to date (6 .1 0 .8 9 ).

           Bill Pemberton then queried whether or not the Inquest result
           would have any bearing on liability claims.

A.         Sophie Tarasenko said that the Inquest result would only have
           a bearing on Criminal proceedings, not civil liability.

           Doug Fraser said that although in theory it doesn't, the
           result of the Inquest does have a bearing on civil liability.

Q.   (2)                  social worker, Sefton, asked whether there were
           any families at King's Cross who were not represented or did
           not want to attend the Inquest.

A.                             - Yes. Several families were not present
           initially, because some members of families had tried to
           dissuade those who wanted to attend the Inquest from doing so.
           Not all families were represented initially, but by the second
           day, all the families were represented because there was a lot
           of anger about the way the families were being treated. Eventually,
           one lawyer represented all the families.

           David Wilkinson stressed the role of the caring profession,
           which had to be to help people to do what they want to do.
           This can be problematic because of conflict with other family
           members. Social workers themselves will need strength and
           support around the Inquest to support the families.

Q.   (3)                Runcorn Social Services, asked whether families
           had information about their relatives' death prior to the
           Inquest.

           Sophie Tarasenko - The King's Cross families had a death
           certificate but had to wait ten months for this. They had
           post mortem details indicating carbon monoxide levels prior
           to the inquest, but no details of where their relative was
           in the station and how long they may have survived for. At
           King's Cross, this was important because where they were
           affected how they died.

Q.   (4)              Sefton, asked if the families do not want to attend
           the Inquest, will it do them a disservice.

A.         Doug fraser indicated it won't make any difference in legal
           terms, but may in psychological terms.
Sophie Tarasenko recommended individual inquests with
transcripts of the dialogue between the lawyer representing
the family and the Coroner. Details of how, where, when
their relative died are a necessity so that families can
look at them if and when they are ready.

David Wilkinson - At Zeebrugge, the individual lawyers got
the transcripts to hold for families for the future. He
indicated that it may be two years before a family might
want to see the information and that it could be useful for
social workers to have the information available to them
for counselling purposes.

_            social worker, Alder Hey Unit, asked if the
individual time spent with the lawyers answered the questions
that the families wanted. '

Sophie Tarasenko - Yes. With the Inquiry and Police reports,
it was possible to establish the whereabouts of people. The
lawyer showed them a map of where their relative was and also
showed them the fuller pathologist report, which answered
all their questions.

Bill Pemberton asked whether the alcohol levels in blood were
taken into account.

Sophie Tarasenko - No. The only blood levels measured were
carbon monoxide and cyanide and the general state of the body,
whether the person was fit and healthy, overweight or
whatever.

David Wilkinson - Area Manager, Swale Social Services

Involved in the Herald of Free Enterprise disaster at Zeebrugge


In the Herald of Free Enterprise disaster, 193 people died and there were
346 survivors. Potentially, every one of the survivors with relatives,
and bereaved relatives, could have attended the Inquest and been
represented. This could have an intimidating impact on 'carers' and as
much preparation as possible is important.

The Inquest was the first time the families came together again since
the tragedy as they were scattered around the country. The Inquiry
had had little impact on families, many of whom were still in a state of
shock. Therefore, the Inquest was their first opportunity to take in
what actually happened.

Preparing Families

It is very important to share as much information with families as early
as possible before the inquest. Some only heard the details of what
happened to. their loved ones for the first time in the Inquest. (This also
applies to survivors and their families). So, they need to have heard the
description of the body and the circumstances (e.g. where and when) of
death before they go to the Court. At Zeebrugge, a body's appearance had
been changed by chemicals in the water. The family had not known this and
the 'wrong' description they heard gave rise to false ’'hope' and great
distress - an unforgivable mistake. Social workers therefore need to do
their homework on all the reports available - although you can never
eliminate all risks.

Survivors

Survivors will also be present at the Inquest in large numbers as
interested parties, or many may be called as witnesses. They and their
families must not be forgotten and considered to be the "lucky ones".
They too will need the offer of care and support.

The Inquest

Number of People

At Dover, in addition to the Coroner, his/her officers, and the jury,
there were lawyers for groups of families, individual families, survivors,
crew, company and Police. With all these groups and individuals and their
legal representatives, the Court fills up very easily. All of these are
potentially in need of some sort of support at some stage of the hearing.

The local Coroner's Court was inadequate, so the Inquest was held in
the ballroom of the Town Hall.

 Scheduling of Individual Inquests

 Families were told beforehand on which day they could expect to have their
 individual inquest heard. There were problems however when (as can happen
 in the case of a full-scale adversarial affair) arguments over points of
 law arose causing adjournments for advice or rulings. If this happens, it
 can mean delays of minutes, hours or days. There is no way of avoiding
                                     18



this and it does need to be anticipated by carers - what do you do when
families have travelled for their particular inquest and have to wait?

Needs of Families

Exhibits, such as models or drawings, can be valuable so that families
can identify precisely where their loved one died. At Dover, it was
important for carers to be with them as it was at this point that people
could put different pieces of stories together, perhaps for the first
time.

Some families may wish/need to sit through the complete hearing, which
at Dover lasted 3£ weeks. Consideration needs to be given to how such
families may be provided for. Even families who are there throughout
will not hear and take in all of what is said, and may need to go back
over the information at a later date.’ Social workers need to take this
into account.

Conflicting Needs

What lawyers need to do in order to establish blame, and what the families
need to hear can often be very different. Ultimately, the end result may
come together, but the process of gettingthere may involve conflicts of
needs.

Similarly, a very upsetting aspect of the inquest can be if bodies are
identified as numbers, e.g. during pathologists' evidence. This makes
things easier for the pathologists but it is extremely distressing for
relatives. Thought and attention need to be given to this before coming
to the hearing.

Somefamily members may be called to give   evidence as well as to hear it,
which can be doubly difficult.Thought has to be given to    caring for
these people as witnesses and observers.

Private Rooms

In Dover, there was inadequate provision for rooms where people could
speak with their lawyers and carers in private or just take 'time out'
- protected from the public and press.   It is important for people to
have this. Families may also need a base in Sheffield, separate from the
hearing venue, where they can go.

The need for accommodation also has to be considered.

Role of Social Workers

David Wilkinson felt that the inquest was more difficult than the 'impact'
phase, with carers having to sit and listen, calmly and quietly, watching
what is happening in all quarters for long stretches of time. There was
therefore a need for adequate numbers of carers, but there has to be a
limit.

They always had present in Court three members of the Herald Assistance
Unit who were not connected with the individual family, as well as any
particular carer that a family may wish to have with them.
                                      19



In advance, they tried to establish what would be the role of the Herald
Assistance Unit during the Inquest. This included:

(i)       To support families and individuals through the Inquest and
           afterwards.   (Families may not wish to leave immediately after
           the Inquest, but stay and talk to other families); and to
         ' provide 'time out' facilities within or near Inquest setting.

          This involved negotiating with families and individual carers
          what support they required: This ranged from meeting people
          at the station and taking them to the Unit, to holding their
          hand and comforting them when giving or hearing evidence. It
          is about responding to what the individual needs - including
          them not wanting you! (But still being available just in case).

(ii)      To respond to   requests of assistance form anyone in the Inquest
           setting.

           This means that social workers have conflicting roles working
           with bereaved families and survivors as well as with the
           'culprits' and 'villains'. In Dover, this particularly meant
           the crew (in Sheffield, it could mean Police, club employees,
           stewards, council employees, etc.). Some of these may be
           facing charges. They will be under extreme pressure at the
           Inquest (Witnesses can refuse to answer questions which may^
           incriminate them - in Dover, no-one refused to answer questions).
           They are people who made mistakes and who deserve care and
           support if they require it. A person needs to be allocated to
           this group.

           This can be hard for the vereaved relatives to understand, and
           carers may be subjected to their anger for helping the 'culprits'.

Other Participants

All witnesses should be offered support.

Pathologists often appear blase and callous, but the one iri Dover was hurt
by the experience and was changed as a result. Who cares for them?

Who cares for the Coroner? They could not get near theirs in Dover, but
he did write a lto about it and may have had some influence on others.
(Although not ideal, the Zeebrugge inquest was^handled sensitively).

The jurors may require support after the Inquest.

 Press

 Another aspect of the social worker's role relates to the press. They will
 be there and will focus on the most distressed people. The job of the
 carers is to protect people when required. It is useful for local carers
 to know the building well - e.g. knowledge of rooms, corridors and exits,
 and making an ally of the janitor - in order to enable people to avoid
 the press as much as possible.
                                      20



  Visiting Ground

 David felt that many people will also want to visit the place where
 h           °nes died when they come for the Inquest. This may be
 difficult to organise, so that it is dealt with sympathetically, and
 have the press kept away. Negotiations would need to be made with the
 football club to discuss this.

 Caring for the carers

 The Inquest will also be a very stressful experience for the carers
 Despite preparation they cannot predict what will happen, and will be
 trying to support people they have never met in some cases, not knowing
 how they will react or what they will require of them. As has been said
 ™    ^      treated.in a hostile manner when they try to help the 'villains'
 Thought has to be given to caring for the carers.

 Also, it is only natural that during the course of events there may be
 some things which happen or are said which are funny. Nobody can be
 bu[1 0 desDi£eWt h f ; ™ S CanHfeel difficult and awkw^ d in the circumstances,
 but despite the pain around we are all human and have to laugh.

After the Inquest

Reports

Families should be able to have access to verbatim reports of the Inquest
hearing, although a family who does not wish to attend may want the social
worker to tell It to them in his/her own words. If a family is no? “
attendance, the social worker needs to pay special attention to what is

                             laWyeP kn°WS
so that if at a later date the family ask
                                            that you want that information,
                                            you for it, you have it. This
service has to be made available for when   the family feel they need it
even if it means the social worker taking   notes and storing them.      ’
Jurors

In Dover, a de-briefing service for jurors was offered for after the
Inquest. The Coroner agreed to this and wrote to jurors but they did not

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS - DAVID WILKINSON


Does the Inquest help the healing process?

Getting the information is very important and can help some families
move forward.

Getting the death certificate, having identification positively proven,
knowing how a person died, etc. are things that people may take away
from an Inquest which may allow them to move on. For others, it is a
resurrection of the feelings, particularly for survivors who have to
re-live the events.

How do you prepare people for the Inquest?

In Dover, they were not in a good position to prepare people. They went'
into it cold - most had not previously been to an Inquest, or to a
Training Day. They did not know what to expect, and in any case, it was
not like an ordinary inquest - more 'theatrical* with large numbers of
lawyers and press.

When verdicts were given, the foreman of the jury had to readout 'Unlawful
killing' 1 9 2 times, and three crew members had to listen to it- how do
you prepare for that?

Number of workers in Court?

This has to be gauged in accordance with what is reasonable for the
families.   You must not swamp the Court with carers.

In Dover, they had permission from        the Coroner to come and go as required.
He would call on them if he felt a        witness needed assistance.

How did you liaise with other agencies?

There weren't any other agencies as such. The large number of people
scattered all over the country made it difficult to ensure that all had
support agencies involved. For those people outside the immediate vicinity,
it was very difficult as people forget very quickly and did-not understand
the families' needs, leaving them extremely isolated.

The Dover team visited 80% of the families 'away' from the area, used
lawyers and contacted local branches of CRUSE and Social Services
Departments.

 (a)       Was there provision for accommodation for families wishing to
           stay over?

 (b)      Is there a role for the clergy or medics at the Inquest?

 (a)      Families did wish to stay in Dover and Zeebrugge.        Whenever
           this was needed Townsend Thoresen paid the bill.

 (5 )      People should be allowed to have whatever support system they
           require, so clergy should certainly be available for those who
           wish to have them.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS


These recommendations have been summarised from the text of the various
contributors to the day.

In the afternoon, the participants were divided into groups to look at
reactions to the day and to plan for the future. Their contribution is
also included in the following summary.


General Observations

1*       In all the build up of the Inquests, it is vital to remember
         that the most important people there are the families.

2.       The verdicts for the families are not just a formality to be
         gone through. The outcome for them will be important.

3.       It was thought important to note that Sheffield's feelings
          around the time of the Inquest may be quite different to
          those of Liverpool.

4.       The study day was useful as a way for people to meet; exchange
          views, ideas and information.

5-       A refresher study day to be held, once the date of the Inquests
          is known.

Social Workers

1*       Social workers need to help famililes be as informed and
          prepared as possible before the Inquest re circumstances of
          death and description of body. To do this, the social workers
          need to do their homework and be as well prepared as possible.

2.       Social workers could arrange locally to attend a Coroner's
         Court for a day to help them in their work with families.

3.       There may be conflicts within families about whether or not
          to attend the Inquest. The role of carers is to help people
          do what they want to do.

4*       Numbers of carers needs to be gauged carefully. There need
         to be adequate numbers, but there has to be a limit - should
         not swamp the Court.

5.       Social workers should provide a rota cover for the Inquests.
         The role of the social worker at the Inquest could    be
         discussed by all the authorities who would provide    cover
         for this rota.

6   ..   The Inquest is not a place for counselling, but for support
         and clarification of what is going on.

7.       Social workers should negotiate their role/relationship with
         people, responding to what they want.
                                          23



8   .           Survivors also need care and support. They are not the
                "lucky ones."

9       .       All those involved in the Inquests may need some support
                 at some time. (Families, survivors, witnesses, jurors,
                 Coroner, Sheffield Wednesday F.C. and council staff.)

10.             There would be a need to support the Police and other agencies
                 during the Inquest. The question was raised as to whether the.
                 social work support for the various agencies should come from
                 a different group of social workers than those working with
                 the bereaved.

11.             Witnesses may be cross-examined very severely.   They will need
                 support.

12.             Carers need to be supported’ and cared- for during and after
                 the Inquests, and need to prepare themselves for it.

1 3         .   Sheffield Team should be kept informed of which social workers
                 and families are likely to be attending the Inquest.

14.             Social workers from teams other than core teams often feel
                 isolated and lacking in information. Could they be linked
                 or adopted by core teams?

1 5         .   Co-ordinators of core teams should take responsibility for
                disseminating information to isolated workers.

16.             As some teams may not be in existence at the time of the
                Inquests, it was considered necessary that managers needed to
                take this into account when closing teams, to ensure a
                continuation of a smooth flow of information and to help
                reduce administrative problems.

Families

1       .       It was acknowledged that families need to be aware of what
                 information is available to them and the importance of having
                access to this information before the Inquests. They should
                be offered the information without needing to request it.

2.              Post mortem reports are available from the Coroner.
                Families should be offered the opportunity to see these before
                 the Inquest.

3       .       West Midlands Police have files on each of the deceased.
                Social workers can contact the West Midlands Police for
                 information contained in the files which can then be passed
                 on to families.

    4.          Information should not be edited or distorted in an attempt
                 to protect the feelings of the bereaved.

    5   .       All bereaved should have legal representation and if possible
                 someone to sit with them to de-mystify and explain the
                 procedure.
                                      24




6.           Families should make sure lawyers give them sufficient time
             before and during the Inquest. It is important for people
             to get to know their lawyer before the proceedings.

7.           There should be 95 separate inquests to give as much
             information as possible to bereaved families.

8   .        The Sheffield Medico-Legal Centre will not be big enough
             for the Inquests even if low profile.

9.           Whether or not the bereaved attend,a transcript record of
             the Inquest should be made and kept, so that information is
             not lost to the family and can be referred to at a later
             date.

10      .    A schedule of individual inquests helps families. Carers
             need to try to be prepared for the delays in the schedule.

11.          Families may wish to attend the whole Inquest.   They need to
             be catered for.

12.          Provide a close-circuit T.V. for families or relatives if
             they feel unable to go into the Court itself.

 13.         Telephones should be provided so that families can keep in
             touch with relatives to give information and receive support.

 14.         It was stressed how necessary it would be for the deceased
             to be always referred to by name during the Inquest, and never
             by number.


 15-         Accommodation may need to be provided for families who need
             or wish to stay in Sheffield.

 16.         Private rooms should be provided for relatives to have
             'space' and privacy, and to be able to consult with lawyers.
             A separate room should also be provided for witnesses ior
             the same reason.

    17.       Families may also need a base, separate from the Inquests.

    18.       Bereaved families may wish to visit the ground at the time
              of the Inquest. Negotiations need to be made in advance.

    19.       People should be allowed the support they want, e.g. clergy »
              social workers, relatives, friends, etc.
    20 .      Families will be assisted by the Coroner being prepared to
              listen to them, and direct information to them as well as to
              lawyers.

     Press

     1.       Press be excluded from the Coroner's Court itself - maybe
              watch the proceedings via closed-circuit T.V.
                        25



The families should be protected from the Press.

Social workers to be given advice/training on dealing with
the press and the media. It helps for them to know the
building and the area.

At the Kings Cross Inquest, the families got together and
nominated a group of four to represent them with the press.
These gave prepared statements to the press while the rest*
left by a back door.

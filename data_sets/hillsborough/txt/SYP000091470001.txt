                     On S a t u r d a y   15 April     1989     (15Q489)           I went   to the F .A. Cup Semi-Final

                     m a t ch between Liverpool             & Notts           Forest at Hi 1 Isborough,            Shef f i e 1 d .     1'

                     am a Liverpool           Supporter,



                     I -got my ticket          from a fan at the ground who                     had some spare              tickets,

                     I paid £20 for a £6 standing                    ticket         for L ep pings Lane.



                     I t ra ve lled to the m a tc h by car with

                                    and                           also        of                                        ;



                     We were      not delayed on the way to Sheffield,                          but we did stop on the

                     M ot or wa y at some       services        for something           to eat.
                                                                                                    PAGE         2
                                                                                                    S3573

We a rr iv e d      in S h e f f i e l d at about      11.30hrs    ( 1 1 3 0 ) and we    parked     in a

side    st. about        150 yds from the           ground.



We then got a bus             into   the    centre     of S h e f f i e l d and went    for a

drink.         I had bought my ticket               from a man outside         the gro un d before

we went       into    the town.       We got the        bus back     to the ground and

a r r i ve d at     the ground at about           13.50hrs      (1350).      There were       queues

at the t urnstiles            but not very        long.     Host    people were along           the

road where          the off    licences were,          having a drink.         There were Police

Of fi ce rs    on    the turnstiles        and    I was    searched     before     I ente re d the

ground.        I did not see any stewards                 outside.      I did not see anyone

climbing       over the walls         to get      in and    I     did not see any gates             open

other    than the turnstiles.



Once    inside       the ground      I did not see any signs telling me where                         to

go.     All    I saw was       the tunnel        and   I presumed that        I had to go that

way.     1 do not        remember     seeing any Police Officers               or S te wa rd s      by the

entrance       to    the tunnel.       I     had no     problems     going a long the        tunnel. I

did not see          any drunks      or anyone      fighting      either    inside      or outside         the

g round.



I went       into    pen 3 a n d e v e nt ua ll y      I stood near the front an d near                the

fence    b etween       pen 3 & 2.         It w o ul d be about 2.20         - 2 .3 0 p m   (1420)     -

(1430).        There was a lot of            people      in the    pen but not       packed.



The    pen carried on filling               until at about         14.55hrs     (1435)      I was

c rushed and         could not move.          I was     on my own then the other              two wanted

to go to the toilet and had                  climbed over         the fence     into     pen 2 about 5

mi nu te s    previously.         I then thought about             getting    out myself        but    I was

too    crushed to move.              It had been a gradual           crushing.          I had not

breathing.           There were          people all a ro u n d me screaming.                  I was

e ven tu al ly      crushed against            the side          fence.     People were       going       blue all

a r o u n d me.     At the side           of me was a young               lad about       IS years    of age.

His    head       came up to my arm            pit.        He had short        brown hair all         I could

see was his head.                 His face was            turned up and his/face was                blue.        His

eyes were         shut.      I do not know            if he was         br eaj/ni ng or not.         I think

that    he probably was             not.       Be hi nd me was a/man,, a white male                   in his

late 50's he was             pressed against my backs                     he was about 5*1 0 high.                He

breathing.          Later     on I am sure            that       he stopped breathing.              His    face

of    pen 2 and onto          the    pitch. / If they had not helped me                       I w ould

have    fallen down.



I went       onto    the    pitch and sat         down.           A St.    J o h n ’s Amb ul an ce M an

We all      just sat down on the                      terraj^          pen 2 and w a t ch ed what was

We sat there         in a state          of shock             until    about     17.30hrs    <1730)

T hen we decided to             leave.           We went        back     out through the tunnel

out of the ground and wa lk ed                         back    to, the    car.     And we then made

I did not see any th ing               in the ground that                  I consider       to be a

I think      that    the L i v e r p j / o l     supp or te rs        should have     been given the

I had bruises         to |i(y leg and                 chest.      I did not go to Hospital             or

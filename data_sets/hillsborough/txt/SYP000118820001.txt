                 the ground       for a b ri ef i ng at 10.00am.                Our role was        to p ol i ce     the

                 turnstiles       at the L ep pings         Lane end of the g ro un d and the serial was

                 I had been on dut y             last year,     9th April        1988,       on the L ep pi ng s     Lane

                 t urnstiles whfen the same two teams met                       at the same gr ou nd         in the FA

                 Cup Semi       Final    and k ne w that       things w o u l d get m or e he ct ic as the kick

                 fans who were          in that part of the g ro u nd arrived m o r e spa ce d out                         in

                                                                                         R243

the hours     leading up to the m a t ch and we had no p ro blems                of the crush

outside    the gates,           I do not think that m o r e came this y ea r but that

t he y £§ifie in a s h o r t e r space of time, due to d i f f e r e n t travel

a r ra ng em en ts perhaps.
The fans w ere v er y good natu re d          in the w h ol e and there was m uc h good

hu m o u r e d banter   about     the s ea rching etc.     In this early p hase none of

the fans could be d e sc ri be d as drunk.             The day was bright         and

pleasant and the d uty was quite enjoyable.

The   influx of fans           rema ined fairly steady until       about    2.30pm.      I had

been busy s e a rc h i ng a steady st re am of fans who were no w a rr iv in g and

had had    little       time    to look through    the turnstiles      to see what was

h a p pe n i n g outside.      The fans had o bv i ou s ly been q ue ue i ng for a while

but now the m o o d of them changed dramatically.                  Some had clearly

arrived with o u t       tickets and had tried various           ruses w it h the

turnstile operators.              Some tried p r o te s ti n g that the m an who had

entered before          them had given the operator          two tickets one of w hi ch

had been for them and others              tried more     s t ra i gh tf or wa rd bribery.

The operators wer e offe red ten p ound notes                to admit fans and I dealt

w it h four or five who had tried this and the operator                     had b een honest

eno u g h to alert us          to what had happened.       It was by this        time too

crowded outside          the    turnstiles   for pers on s without      tickets    to reverse

and so they wer e admit te d          into the ground once one of us was present

and then ejected.              The tempt at io n on the turnstile operator must have

been great      to accept at        least some of this brib er y and           it m a y be that

some were a d m i t te d with o ut      tickets by this means.         We had already

decided    that    if it was busy w he n we had to eject persons                 they would

not be taken to the po li ce room but ejected via the near es t gate.                            To

adhere    to formal       p r oc ed u re s would have grea tl y d ep le te d    the numbers

of police at the t u rnst iles whilst             two escorted each ejec te e           to the

the only w ay to act             e x pe d it i o u s l y w he n   things are busy.                 The

Inspector was aware              and    in approval         of this.

At    the m a t c h   last year        some fans rushed               the turns ti le s and came over

the heads       of their       f el l ow s up po rt er s          and over         the tu rn st il e     since

there are no bars          above w aist height.                   I    did not           see this h a p p en at

all    this year.        The c ru sh outside p r o b a b l y p re v en t ed                  them g et ti ng

enough of a run at the                 turns ti le s    to do         this.        The    s up p or t er ' s moo d

last year,       on the whole,           r em ai ne d p l e as a nt      till       the end and did not

exhibit      the same d ra ma t ic        change as this year.

It became       obvious    to me some           time past         2 .3 0 pm that          there was       a great

crush outside.           Our    sea rc hi ng had d r op p ed            to about          one    in three and

we were having          to becom e mor e         selective.             The police           outside,      w hen I

could see them thro ug h the turnstiles,                          had a ba n do n ed any s e ar ch in g

and were p re ss ed up against                the turnstiles.                 At    times       I could see a

m o u n t e d officer    in a wh ite        shirt      in the      throng trying                to b re ak up the

crowd.       I did not     r e co gn is e hi m as aS outh Y o rk sh ir e                     m o u n t e d and took

h i m to be a fore ig n force             Inspector.

The moo d of the         fans had co nt in ue d           to deteriorate.                  The y wer e now

v er y aggressive,        no doubt due           to ha vi ng bee n p us h ed towards                     the

t urnstiles by the force                of the crowd.             M a n y fans wer e d e m a n d i n g          that

we did som et hi ng about            the s i tu at io n o u ts id e and h u rl i ng a lot of

abuse at us as they came                 through.        Some      fans       even got hold of some of

us and m a n h a n d l e d us as they m ad e            their point.                It almost got          to the

p oint of s cu ffles b r e a k i n g out           in our area w ith enraged                      fans blaming

through the t ur ns t il e s ahead of their                   fath er s        in order          to avoid

injury.       There was        then the added p r o b l e m of some f am ilies                       being

I was caught           in a surge of fans wh o rus he d                     through p u s h i n g w i t h no

p eople w ere p u sh e d            to the ground by            impatient m a r a u d i n g      fans and

po l i c e and fans          and my se lf pu ll ed           these     to their        feet and     tried          to

slow dow n the su d d e n              influx.        I saw one or two fans,                 wh o had,        like

us,    sensed the danger                   of this h e a d l o n g charge,          han d out some summary

justice to their               f el lo w s u pp or te rs      in a       c re di t ab l e a t te mp t    to stem

the tide.

As    soon as the p r e s s u r e eased on the o ut si de                         the gates w er e a gain

closed and the fans                  entered       in the normal manner.                 The c r u s h

o b v i o u s l y built up a gain beca us e a few m i nu t e s                      later    the same gate

was opened a gain to                 let     in anot he r b a tc h of supporters.                  T he se came

in a little better                  o r de re d than the first            rush but w er e        still

impatient and a n no y e d at ha vi ng had                      to wait.

In both the influxes                   of fans       thro ug h the gates            there w er e    some who

w a nt e d   to shelter            a way    from the general           rush.        They w er e c l ea r ly

t errified by wha t                they     had a l re ad y e x p e r ie n ce d     outside     and what           they

wer e seeing.

The fans seemed              to be st re am in g d ow n           the tunnel         under     the stand w hi ch

leads        into the central               sect io n of     the terracing.             This    tunnel        is

m a r k e d w it h sector           letters p ai n te d on the wall                 and there are other

m a r k in g s d i r e c t i n g    fans around either             end of      the stand        into     the other

areas        of the terrace.                The general       flo w was d own this             tunnel     and       it

does     seem m o re       obvi ou s        and logical      to head       in this d i r e c t i o n     rather

than round the ends of                      the stand.       However,        if     the fans had b een              less

h as t y and those w i t h             tickets had taken             the time        to cons ul t       the

a few stewards          or police being able to divert                   them to other        areas of

ground       level   it w ou ld have been           i mpossible     to divert      this s udden

influx w ha tever        the m an po we r available.

I have seen m o r e m an po w er d ep lo y ed            in that area before,          but however

m a n y serials      there wer e        inside w ou ld not have pre ve nt ed           the problems

outside w hi ch w ere           the cause of the gates being opened.                       If more

m an po w er was ne ed ed a ny where          it was      outside     the turnstiles         to break

up the body of the supporters                     into smaller m ore m a n a g e a b l e     groups

whilst       they w a it e d    for    the turnstiles.

Our se co nd b ri ef in g had taken place on the terrace and we w ere aware

that there were           railings from the front of the stand                      dow n to the

perimeter        fence at the rear of the goal.                    There was only one transfer

gate       in each of     these railings,            a n a r r ow gate at the       rear of the

terrace       in each     case.        PC W a s h i n g t o n and PC Macmanus       were depu te d to

m a k e their wa y to these gates                 in the case of an e va cu at io n to try and

assist people         through them.           Fro m the tone of the Inspector                 at the

b ri ef in g he a pp r ec i at e d that          in the event of this being n ec e ss a ry               it

w ou ld be a very        "tall        order” .

Although       I could see that the m a j o r i t y             of fans were      m a k i n g their way

into the central            section and I k ne w that sideways m o v e m e n t w ould be

ve r y slow due to the small                transfer gates         I never m ad e     the c onnection

betw ee n the two facts.                I did not      e nv isage problems on the scale that

were       to follow.

W h er e    I was    inside     the turnstiles          I was c om pl et el y u n aw ar e of the

start of the match.               We were fairly confident               that the start w ould be

d el ay ed    in order      to a ll ow the l atecoming            fans extra time to find

their wa y       into the ground.            This     I found out       later was not        the case.

I heard two a n no u nc em en ts on the g ro und's public address                          sy st em

h e a r d was as ki ng Liverpool           fans    to leave     the p l ay in g area.          I assumed

that      there had been a         pitch    i nv asion    fro m the    latter.

Suppo rt er s w er e still         a rr iving and m a k i n g there w ay        into      the ground

w h e n I was    told   that we were n ee de d on the pitch.                   Although        I did not

have a personal         radio    I assumed         that   this m e s s a g e had come to our

serial      serge an t who did have one and               then was spread         to us all          by

wo rd of mouth.

As a serial we m a d e our way a ro u nd the end of the s tand and behind

the police control          r oom through a t ra nsfer gate and d ow n a pass ag e                             in

the stand o cc up i ed by N o t t i n g h a m fans.           We turned      left d own another

pass ag e    in this stand and m a d e our w a y out onto the pitch.

On a rr iv in g onto      the p itch I still d id not a pp re c ia t e             that      there had

been any play.          I was under         the    i m p re s si o n that I was g oi ng        to ste m a

p it ch    invasion at the Leppings               Lane end and m y a t t e n t i o n was           focussed

there,       I did not     see any play er s          leaving the pitch.           T he re was a

g row in g g roup of p eo pl e be hi nd           the goal    and we m a d e    s tr ai gh t       across

the pitch       towards    them.      As    I ran over       to the p er i me t er       fence      the

fans were p o ur in g over         the top and one of the gates                 into      the central

south sect io n had been opened.

It was      i m me di at el y obvi ous     that    this was not a s t r a i g h t f o r w a r d pitch

invasion caused by h o o l i g a n i s m b e c a u s e       those that w er e on the pitch

w er e s ta nding    in a g roup and not            r u nn in g across    the p i t ch as w o ul d be

expected.

As soon as       I a r ri v ed at the fence           I c ould see the real             rea so n    for    the

top of the        low wall         in front of the fence of the central                        s e ct io n and

shouted       to the fans          to mov e back.        I soon r ea li se d          that w i t h      the

forward,       to m a k e    them m ov e     fast    enough.          The ones      further       bac k did

not a pp re c ia t e     the p r o b l e m in front of them and did not                       r e al is e       the

reason for        the pol ic e action.

W hi l st    I was d o in g     this    I m ad e    eye contact w it h a m a n who was about a

re alised      that he m u s t have b een near w h e re               the crush barr ie r           had

collapsed.

From s ho uting and s ig na l li n g         to m o v e b ack       I turned m y eff o rt s          to what

I hoped w o u l d y ie ld better           results.         I wen t    to the gate w h i c h was

open and tried          to h el p get pe op le out.           T he re w er e a l re a d y about           six

officers       there at this gate,           one of w h i c h       I r e co g n i s e d as S er geant

Swift,     wh o wer e p ul l in g at pe op le         to get       them t h ro ug h the gate.              Some

of these peo pl e w er e a l re ad y u n c o n s c i o u s         and some w er e not but               the

p re ss u re   on this n a r r o w gate was         such that         it was     like a log jam.                So

m a n y people wer e p r e s s e d      into the area ar ou nd            the gate         that   it took

h er c ul e an efforts       to get     just one out.             One m a n we tried          to pull      out

was u nc on c io u s    and was w e ar i ng a m a r o o n         jumper.      A b o ut   six m e n were

p u ll i n g on h i m to pull        hi m through      the gate,        out of the m as s           inside.

We m ust have        injured p e op le      in our h a st e        to get    them out a nd relieve

the p r e s su re on the rest.

Progress at that gate was so p a i n f u l l y s low and there w er e m a n y other

p olice ar o u n d     it so I turned m y a t te n ti o ns            to a gate         into the south

enclosure.         The p eo p le here had room to m ov e ar ou nd and                        I r ea so ne d

that    if we r e mo v ed p le n ty of p eo pl e        from here         thro ug h the gat e and

moved    the rest       over    to the edge         then those from the central                   south

sect io n w he re all        the c as ua lt ie s     lay,    c ould climb over             the d iv id i ng

fence and ease          the p re ss u re    in the central            south area.            This had

a l re ad y s t ar te d to h a p p en n a t u r a l l y and I tried to s peed up this

proc es s and once         the crush s ub si de d wen t            into the e nc l os u re        to m ove

the people about.

There was       every e m ot io n present           in those people.             A    lot of anger         and

abuse was d i r e c t e d      towards us as we fought                to hel p       their    fe ll ow

supporters,        we were,         I suppose   the n ea r es t       target     for      their

u n de r s t a n d a b l e anger.    M an y w ere   so shoc ke d as to be almost                  immobile

and some wer e         just s ta nd in g weeping.            As    the p r e s su r e     e as ed near me a

large number          of pe op le         climbed over        the d i v i d i n g fence,      w h e re    I now

was,    and as they did we could see mor e                         and more bodies           lying on the

c oncrete w he r e all            these pe op le had bee n standing.

The mass       of b o di e s was near             the front      fence and a p p ea r ed        to be three

or four deep all               a long the front          of the central          south section.                There

were more bo d ie s            further back up the terrace but mor e                       sp ac ed out and

not    in such great            concentration.

I was w o rk i n g w i t h a number               of fans and a few people                in this area

ferrying       the    injured        from this section,             lifting      them over        the

dividing       fence and p a s s i n g them one by one to people                          on the p it ch via

one of the gates.                 The     injured se em ed endless,            mos t w e r e u n c o n sc i ou s

the others had            injuries         to limbs and d i f f i c u l t y breathing.               We

c o n c e n t r a t e d our    initial      efforts      on r em ov in g    those w i t h m ost          chance

of survival.            T ho se    o bv i ou s ly dead w ere        left    in situ until           later       to

ha s t e n those a live           to a mb ul a nc e s and the doctors,              I hoped,       wer e now

on hand.         I have no p o s s i bl e wa y of r e me m b e r i n g           the d e s c r i p t i o n s    of

any of those          I removed.

During this time               I was      tota l l y p r e o c c u p i e d w i t h what   I was doing,           I

have no r e c o l l e c t i o n of what was g oi ng on in the                      i mmediate d is ta nc e

from me or indeed who                   I was w o r k i n g with.         I had felt       so h el pl e ss

before and no w I was                at    last    in a p o s i t i o n   to do s o m e t h i n g positive,

I just had a f ee l i n g            that     it had b ee n      too s lo w to save          so many.

There was        still        a lot of abuse and a g g r e s s i o n d i r e c t e d         towards us but

I totally d i s r e g a r d e d         this and I a m sure           I p u s h e d aside,      rather

roughly,       anyone who          impeded me.

I stayed on the               terrace and c o n t i n ue d r em ov i ng people.               When       the    live

had been carr i e d out we m o v e d the d e a d and only w he n                          they w ere       all

moved     out onto        the p it c h did         I wan t    to pause and         look around.            It was

then that        I saw the crush barrier                   that had g iven w ay bent              out of all

shape.        These b a r r i e r s       a p p e a r e d so stout and solid          it was      incredible

that     the p re ss u re       of people had bent             it and forced         it over.         It was

then that         I m ad e    the c o n ne c ti o n b e t w e e n the m an who had bee n s ho uting

to me at the b e g i n n i n g and the c ol la ps e                  of the barrier.           I feel

cert ai n that         the de at hs he had b een trying to tell me about                             had been

caused by the p r e s su r e prior                to the collapse.

I left the terrace                 and went      onto   the p i t ch to see         if I could help

carry any c as ua l ti e s             over    to the ambulances.           I p i c k ed up an

a d v e r ti s in g h o a r d i n g    to use as a str et ch er but most              of the people had

a l re ad y been moved.                I felt s u d d en l y surplus       to requi re me nt s.         All

the c asualties had b een m o ve d but we wer e now s u r ro u nd e d by a lot of

a ng ry and a g g re s si v e          fans.     I sensed     that     if their      anger     and brief

turned towards            the N o t t i n g h a m s up po r te r s we w o ul d have       some       serious

problems       on our        hands.

It was      then that         I n ot i ce d that po li ce had a lr ea dy set up a cordon

across      the p i tc h and since there was                  little else for me              to do    I went

and    joined that at the end w he re                   it met       the stand close          to the

d ir ec to rs box.

I stayed there            in the cordon w a t c h i n g         the fans until         I noticed a

scuffle b r e a k i n g out nearer              the goal      line.      A p h o t o g r a p h e r w i t h dark

hair and beard w e a r i n g a b lack                leather        jacket was      trying     to take

pictures.          It m a y have been            i ns en si ti ve    to do so but he no doubt

thought he had goo d reasons.                       I went w i t h several          other p ol i ce     to his

aid as I thought              that      this m ig ht be the spark of a m aj or p r o b l e m that

w a n t e d n ip p in g   in the bud.           Two po li ce        escor te d h i m f rom the p it ch or

at    least be hi nd         the      cordon and the rest            of us stayed      to try and

def us e    the situation.

I then saw the rest                   of my serial      s ta nd i ng   in a g ro up near        the goal

m o u t h and made my w a y over               to them.       We     stood for some time until                the

a n no un ce me nt    came     that      the m a t c h had b ee n abandoned.             As    the    fans

started       leaving        the gr ou nd we went          as a serial        out    into L ep pi n gs       Lane

               1 1 .45          pm.

               There            were two other          stewards    an this    gangway with me.

               There            w a s n ’t that man y that       came   in between       ■11.45 pm and         1.30 pm and

               then there was a steady flow up until                           2.30    pm - 2.45        pm.    After      this

               time         there was a bit of a rush until about a minute                           to 3.00       pm.

               At this            time the stand was          nearly full w i th only a few empty seats,

               we were           just about       to go up to the top of the gangway to watch                            the

               m a t ch and a Liverpool                 supporter      who was   irrate      came up to me and sai

               off     the        pitch.

               One     of the other            stewSrfds had a sked one          of the      supporters what             had

               The     steward at the top of our gangway told us                             to slow them down

               because           of the teams had gone off the                 pitch.

               We then heard an ambul a n c e s                  horns and     it drew       my a t t e n t i o n to   the

               About            one third of the         pitch at the Leppings Lane End was                    covered wi

               At    this         time some Liverpool            supporters      in the N orth Stand were                being

               v e r b a l l y abusive         towards     us.      We went    down to the bottom of the

about '3 minutes and told us to                        take    off our yellow stewards              bibs and

passes      due to the abuse we                    had received and         to    put them   in our         coats.

He also       said there was          three         dead.

The    same Liverpool          fan who             has told me      that    people were getting

crushed outside            the ground came up /to me and said,                        I told you so.

He was d is t r e s s e d and        crying.          t ye   went   onto    the    pitch through the             gat*

to see      if we     could help at ally

I saw that          there was       room at/e i the r end of Leppings                  Lane,     but    in the

middle      behind the goals           it Jlas over            crowded and thats where              the

problem was.

The Police          had lined up across               the halfway          line and we had to walk

through them.

B i l l b oa rd s   had been    ripped down to use as stretchers and                           I saw        people

lying     down      receiving       first aid treatment.

I. w ould estimate           I saw about            15 people with          coats over their           heads

both at       the    rear of the N orth S tand and on the                         pitch as well        as    some

b e i rig carried off t h e p it          c   h„

I w o u ld say that          injured and            possibly dead          people were       from   15 years

old thro ugh to middle ages.                        I helped move          one man who was about

4 5 - 5 0 years      old wi/h       curly ginger             brown hair,      stocky build a bout               14

stone about 5 5S !i#           I think        he had a Liverpool              shirt    on with      jeans and

trainlng        shoes, «              /

He d i d n ’t app e a r to be/ breathing and he d i d n ’t move.                          He was a dark

blue     colour around hj/s mouth.                    We     lifted him up from the            right        hand

corner      of the        IS ya/d box and 6 lads                brought a bill         board over and we

put him on          it.

Th e y then took           it/off

There was so much going                   on and the steward               I was with was upset              so we

wa l k ed off the         pitch and to the stewards                   room w h i c h   is u n d e r n e a t h    the

N o r t h Stand.

              It was about 4.15         pm by then,    and   I just   handed my jacket   in and   left

              the     ground,

              I then      came home    in the   car.

              I dont know the? stewards          I was working with on that day as        it was my

              first     time as a steward,

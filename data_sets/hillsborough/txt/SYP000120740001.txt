By     the       time     the     f o o b t a l 1 special             had      arrived         Penistone             Road      N o rth was

these        fans       who      were       asking        for     directions            to     the    nearest            pub.          Quite

a    number        of     these        requests           were       made      for    a specific:            p ub       called

It wa s          around       this      time       that        I was       ordered        to    proceed            towards          the

place        inside       the    ground.

I was        first       met    by    supporters             in a d i s t r e s s e d            condition          emerging           from

Fearing        he w o u l d      be    trampled            on m y s e l f        and    the       two       helpers        dragged

him     c l e ar    to    relative          safety where                 he w a s      placed          in    the    recovery

themselves               with       th e      injured.

Once      fully          inside          the    ground         I could           see     the      full      scale       of    the     events

taking         pla ce .         P i t c h was          awash with               Police       and     fans        alike       attending

to     injured           parties             lying     on     the       p l ay i ng    surface.              Directly           in f r on t

of me         inside       No.       3       enclosure         were        people        lying       on     the     terraces.

Police         Officers             and       fans     alike        were        working        frantically              passing

apparently               lifeless             bodies        through           a g a te      on to      the       playing        area.

Attempts            were    being             made     to     force        back       the    b lu e m e s h       fencing

surrounding               the       enclosure            to m a k e        the    recovery           of     bodies       easier.              It

was     as     the       dead       and        injured were               being       moved        o n to    the     pitch       t h at      fans

in the         seating          area           of    the      west       stand        appeared        to     be     spitting          on

officers            and    fans          alike       working            below.         Also       in Mo.         3 enclosure             I

could         see    that       a    crush          barrier          had      been     twisted and               flattened          to       the

ground.             There       were          it ems     of    clothing           and       other      personal          effects

stewn         everywhere             and       I could         see       blood        smeared        along        the    length          of

th e    damaged           barrier.

Because           most     of       the        dead and            i n j ur ed    ha d      been    removed         f rom       the

enclosure            I made          my        way     on     to    the       pit ch .       It wa s        there       th at    I wa s       met,

with      a    couple       of       supporters               carrying           a display           hoarding.               This

hoarding            was    immediately                 used        to    transport           an a p p a r e n t l y      lifeless             man

from      the       pitch       to       a    location         behind           the    North       Stand adjoining                  the

gymnasium.                This       unknown           person           was     placed       on    the      ground       and myself

and a supporter                     commenced            giving          mouth        to m o u t h a n d         heart       massage.

This      proved          unsuccessful                 as     indicated           by a D o c t o r          who     examined          the

body.          I arranged                for    t h is      person         to    be    taken       into      th e    makeshift

mortuary            (g y m nas i urn).

As     o t he r     lifeless             bodies        were        brought        to     the      rear      of    the    North        Stand         I

assisted            in    their          removal         to    the       gymnasium.               It w a s       whilst       I w as

undertaking               this       t as k     t ha t      myself         and    other        officers           had    to m a n o e u v r e

around        a stream              of       liquid      pouring           from       the    rear     of     the     s t a nd a b o v e
                                                                                                                       P AGE.
                                                                                                                       R435-

  our    heads.        This     liquid          had    the    appearance           of    urine     which was          running

  down    the      sheeting         which       made    up    the    rear     of    the    s t an d wall.            Lined        up

  behind      this     wall     were       numerous          Liverpool        fans       who    we re o b s e r v i n g      the

  events      taking         place       below.

  It w a s    w h i 1st      I was       outside       the    gymnasium        I was       approached          by     a man

  who    announced           himself       as a m e d i c .         He a s k e d    if    I could assist              h im

  with    the      injured      inside          the    gym.     He     h a n d e d me     various       bits     of

  medical       equipment           and    once       inside    the     gym    he       performed       first        aid     on

  the    injured.            I was       also    required       to     transport          the     injured       by

  stretcher         to a w a i t i n g     ambulances.

  It w a s n ' t    until      the       last    of    the    injured       had     been       removed      from      the

  gymnasium         t ha t    I was       ordered       to    the    North     Stand       for     a de-briefing.

  At    the   conclusion            of    the    de-briefing           I made       my w a y      to C l a y w h e e l s     Lane

  traffic       garage        and    then       I was    transported           home.

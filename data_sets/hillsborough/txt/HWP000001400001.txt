Dear Ian

On Tuesday 10 December I held a meeting with colleagues in the Parliamentary
Labour Party representing constituencies in Sheffield and Merseyside, to discuss calls
for a reopening of the inquest, or a separate new inquiry, which have been made
following the screening of your programme last week about the Hillsborough disaster.

As a result of my meeting I am now writing to you to ask if you would be good
enough to specify any new evidence which was not available either to the inquest or to
the Taylor inquiry.

I should also be grateful if you could clarify the allegation which has been made about
a missing video tape. Is it alleged that this “missing video” was, in whole or part, not
available to the inquest or to the inquiry?

I shall look forward to hearing from you. I have copied this letter to all Labour
colleagues with Sheffield or Merseyside constituencies.

Yours sincerely




JA C K STRAW MP
Shadow Home Secretary

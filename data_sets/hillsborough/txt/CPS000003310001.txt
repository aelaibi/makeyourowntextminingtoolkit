The Report of the Inquiry conducted by Lord Justice Taylor into the
tragedy at Hillsborough has been published today.  In his findings Lord
Justice Taylor criticises a number of officers of the South Yorkshire
Police, particularly Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield.

During the course of the Inquiry the question of manslaughter by criminal
negligence was raised by Counsel for the bereaved and injured and attempts
have already been made to obtain a private prosecution against me and the
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club for this offence.

I am of the view that the finding of the Inquiry will cause renewed
attempts to be made to pursue private prosecutions against the major
parties involved including Mr Duckenfield.

The question of criminal offences arising out of the events at
Hillsborough will continue to be raised and I should be obliged if you
would give this question your consideration and let me have your advice.

All the available evidence collected during the course of the Inquiry is
in the possession of Mr Geoffrey Dear, Chief Constable of the West
Midlands Police.

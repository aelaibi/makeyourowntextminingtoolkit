A c tiv itie s
Tn order to carry out the above terms of reference, it is
envisaged that the Advisory Design Council will carry ou
the following activities:
          +-/-) i d e n t i f y   a n d c o m m issio n r e s e a r c h ,
S)        to acquire and store best practice, both relating to

 c)       to    d iss e m in a te      in fo rm a tio n by:

           i)   promoting meetings,
           ii) issuing guidance notes,
           iii) developing databases for access by clubs and
                professionals working on behalf of clubs,

 dl       to provide courses                      . ,
 e        to consider qualifications for the provision of
          goods and services and to provide accreditation,
 f)       to prepare business plans for the Advisory Desig
          Council for consideration by The Football
          Association and The Football Association and The
           Football League.
 The C o u n c i l ' s o b j e c t i v e s c a n b e s u m m a r i z e d a s b e i n g t o :
           Assist clubs to meet their legal obligations,
           upgrade   their   facilities   and    achieve   their
           aspirations in a cost effective and timely way.
           Work   with                 local    authorities   in                    developing
           consistency                in   standards   required                   for   Safety
            C e rtific a te s .

            Gain the confidence of Clubs and Local Authorities.

            Identify priorities.
  With the following timetable for the introduction of a3-l"
  seater stadia ( o r , more strictly, the elimination of
  standing facilities), there is necessarily a very tig
  timetable.

                                                                -25-

       It will therefore be necessary for us to undertake much
       work during the next year if our recommendations are to
       be available in time for clubs to take them into ac^ n t
       when designing the changes needed to meet ^he abov
       targets.    I anticipate that we shall be issuing an
       interim Report no later than next summer and that that
       will be followed by further more        detailed reports
       amplifying and developing the themes developed in
       Interim Report.

10 .   Our work will necessarily deal separately with:

            Large and small grounds
            New stadia on green field sites, and improvements to
            existing stadia
            Items which are regarded by us as Essential e.g. in
            the interest of Safety, and those which are regarded
            as Desirable, i.e. in the interest of spectator
            comfort etc.

1 1 . Our    objective is to help clubs to meet             legal
        obligations   and their aspirations     for the gener 1
        improvement of the facilities at their grounds.          In
        developing recommendations we must recognise the v a r Y. 9
        financial resources of clubs and tailor optimum design
        with financially attainable objectives.

1 2 . Among the topics which we shall be addressing are those
        on the next page.

13.     In our deliberations we will take account of existing
        legislation and guides e.g. The Green Guide issued by The
        Home Office and currently being revised. Our aim will be
        to develop a comprehensive guide which will be a single
        point of reference for clubs and their professional
        advisers which will incorporate key requirements from
        e.g. The Green Guide, Fire and Building Regulations etc.

 14.    A very important aspect of our role will be to establish
        relations with the Local Authorities who are responsible
        for the issue of Safety Certificates with a view to
        getting greater uniformity of interpretation across the
        Country.

PttFJ TMTNAHV INTRODUCTION

Before looking at the subject of the Stadia of the Future, let me m ake reference to
the Sports Council’s work on A renas and it publication on the subject.

I would like to introduce you to some definitions which may help in g reater clarity in
our debate.   These are term s which have b een evolved:

       STADIUM                   -        an outdoor facility


       ARENA                     -        an indoor facility


       V ELO D R O M E           -        Indoor cycling facility

       COVERED STADIUM           -        a recent term most associated with indoor
                                           schemes for spectator facilities of football-
                                           pitch size.   (min. 5,000 seats)


       SPO R TSD R O M E OR
       SUPER D R O M E            -        commercial labels for large American-style
                                           dom ed arenas, generally in appropriate to
                                           U K needs at present.


 Indoor A renas by their nature are m ultipurpose spectator facilities catering for a wide
 range of events and many of the supporting elements are as relevant to this type of
 building as they are to the Stadium of the Future.

TAT K INTRODUCTION

Mv job is to look at the design factors of new stadia, developments, but firstly let me
give you some reactions from the Sports council to the present situation and to the
recom m endations of the Taylor Enquiry.

Firstly we welcome the move towards all-seated stadiums, which we consider safer
and m ore suited to the needs of today’s public, with also improvements in food
outlets, toilets and general amenities.

Secondly we welcome the recom m endation to develop a new G reen G uide to safety
at sports grounds.    The present Guide is aim ed at the upgrading of existing stadia
and is not primarily aim ed at design guidance for new stadia, surely a much needed
new direction.   The G uide is now being redrafted by the H om e Office.

Perhaps we should look also at the voluntary nature of the Guide, and to consider
w hether the new G uide should be given a new status as a m andatory docum ent of the
 Building Regulations.

 We also welcom e the action of the FA and The Football League to create a new
 Advisory Design Body, which can surely only result in b e tte r standards. O ne
 contribution on the Sports Council will be to bring in the needs of stadia o th er than
 those for football. W e must not forget the m ajor stadia and grounds of other sports,
 Rugby Union, Rugby League, Athletics and Cricket, and also those stadia aim ed at
 multi-purpose use.      It is significant that at Twickenham the Rugby Football U nion
 has already moved towards an all-seated solution.          It is building a huge new north
 stand and the lower tier, intended as a standing terrace, has already been built as a
 seated area.

 And, o f course, in co-operation with the RIBA , we have already arranged this second
 sem inar to discuss the issues for future stadia. W e hope that this will be a positive
  step forward to an improved situation.

  So, now let us look at some criteria and ground rules which will affect the
  developm ent o f m odern stadia into the nineties.

         T H E FO RM :               alternatives, shapes


         VIEW ING:                   distances and criteria


         SEATING:                    types and dimensions


         STADIUM RO O FIN G :        implications and types
       PRIVATE BOXES:             some of the criteria


       PE R IM E T E R FENCES
       & MOATS:               some of the design factors


       FA CILITIES FOR
       DISABLED PEO PLE:



Only a few new stadiums have been built in the U K in the last few years.   These
include:

           Walsall, Scunthorpe and St. Johnstone in Scotland.


T h ere have b een some good examples of non-league stadiums:

                 Yeovil, D orchester and W ycombe W anderers.


However, as you will have heard, many other clubs are actively considering this
possibility including Luton, Millwall and Leyton Orient.


M any others are considering new stand developments.



ZONES OF THE STADIUM

T he following zones can be considered in designing for safety in a Stadium:


                 Zone 1:           Pitch activity area


                 Zone 2:           Spectator zone


                 Zone 3:           Circulation area


                 Zone 4:           Final safety zone.


My talk will concentrate on Zones 1 and 2.



VIEWING DISTANCES

The maximum comfortable viewing distance for football is 190m.
                                                                                              -32-




                                           -   3   -




T he nptimum is 150m.:     the optimum circle from the centre spot is a 90m. radius.
This gives excellent conditions for rugby and football.    Ideally all spectators should be
within these criteria.



VIEWING ANGLES

These are crucial to good viewing.     It is desirable for all spectators to be able to see
the pitch over the heads of the other spectators, both for comfort and for safety.
This will prevent standing and crowd movements.        Three standards are shown in the
diagrams, and these have differing effects on the gradient of the stands.



PREFERRED VIEWING POSITIONS

These are p referred viewing positions for different sports:


               Football
               Athletics
               Rugby



COMBINED ATHLETICS AND FOOTBALL STADIUMS

Continental stadiums often combine athletics and soccer in the same stadium,          this is
not common in Britain.     T here is also the question of atm osphere that is found in
tight specifically designed football stadia.

T he viewing distances from the football pitch involved in combined stadia m ean that
crowd intimacy can be difficult to achieve.



 STADIUM ROOF STRUCTURE

T he roof structure of a stadium is often architecturally one of the most im portant
 features.

T he reasons for providing a roof are to protect spectators from rain, sleet and snow.
 W ith an open grass pitch, it is impossible to provide complete cover for all the
 spectators, and the diagrams show the extent of the levels of protection from rain.
 T he lower the ro o f edge the b etter the protection but obviously sight lines must be
 adequate.
                                                                                           -33-




                                          -   4   -




It goes without saying that supporting columns which obstruct views must now be
avoided in m odern structures.




TRANSLUCENCY OF STADIUM ROOF

T he translucent stadium roof has developed largely because of the problem s of colour
television in overcoming the shadow cast by large grandstands.     T he difference in
light values betw een shade and sunshine caused real problems for the T V cameras.


T here was no doubt another reason:     there is also an aesthetic appeal of translucent
grandstands to give spectators a pleasant feeling of being in the outdoors.


Examples include:

(a)    W embley Stadium, London, w here the front part of an existing roof was
       extended in translucent material

(b)    M unich Olympic Stadium:     one of the finest examples of a translucent roof
       representing a high point in the technology of such roofs


(c)    Twickenham South Stand and W atford Football Club. Pre-cast cantilevered
       structures with barrel vaults in double and treble skin translucent plastic were
       used

(d)    Twickenham N orth Stand under construction:       cantilevered beam s with
       translucent roof sheeting


(e)    Split in Yugoslavia:   a beautifully structured solution as part of a
       com prehensive stadium design

(f)    T he M ound Stand with tension cable construction.     This roof does not need to
       concern itself with rainfall in front of the spectators, because cricket cannot
       take place in rain


(g)    The Italian Stadiums for the W orld Cup.



T he P rater Stadium in V ienna has been comprehensively re-roofed with a beautiful
structure which has won a E uropean Structural Design Award:        one feature is that
the rainw ater is collected at the front and then pum ped back over the roof.
                                                                                                -34-




                                            -   5   -




rOYKRKD STADIA

T here are developm ents taking place to experiment with various solutions, e.g. sliding
a natural grass surface into the stadium from the outside, or using som e kind of
moveable roof structure, which can be very costly. A nother proposal by H O K
involves jacking the central pitch area into a roof over the central pitch, but at present
this solution rem ains on the drawing board.

T he two most significant examples of the moveable roof structures are the T oronto
Skydrome, which is an ingenious system of sliding roof and the M ontreal Olympic
Stadium which has a moveable roof pulled up on a cable structure from a very high
tower.

T he m ost economical perm anent cover is some kind of lightweight m em brane.           This
can be either supported by an air-supported structure, e.g. the Tokyo "Big Egg"
stadium in Jap an and the BC dome in Canada, or by a m em brane structure supported
by cables.

C overed stadiums with perm anent roofs include the Louisiana Superdom e, which has
an opaque roof and the H ouston A strodom e which has a translucent dom ed roof.
This was originally designed to perm it grass growth indoors but this failed - hence the
invention of astro-turf and its name.



SYNTHETIC OR ARTIFICIAL GRASS

T he whole subject of artificial turf which has followed would be w orth a Sem inar in
itself and is impossible to cover in a brief time.


Suffice to say the following:

1.       W e have done a great deal of work at the Sports Council on specifying the
         qualities of and testing artificial grass. This is published in the "W interbottom"
         report.

2.       Artificial grass is, of course, now normal in stadiums for hockey.    At Luton
         several m ajor tournam ents have been held.


3.       W e did som e work on the fire qualities of artificial grass, speculating on w hat
         would have happened in 1985 in Bradford.        It you rem em ber, spectators
         exited onto the pitch as a place of refuge.
                                                                                                    -35-




                                                -    6   -




SEATING

In the move towards all-seated m ajor stadia, it is im portant to give some consideration
to the seat itself, w here spectator will spend some time.

T he time for sitting in the seat will vary with the stadium type.          The following are
some examples:

        C R IC K E T                   -        All day, perhaps even m ore than one day


        FOOTBALL                       -        l 1/: - 2 hours


        RUGBY                          -        IV* - 2 hours
                                                 (for 7-a-side tournam ents perhaps all day)


        P O P CO NCERTS                -        3 hours or more

        ATHLETICS                      -        Sometimes all day, e.g. Olympics
                                                    M ajor events 3 - 5 hours


        AMERICAN FOOTBALL                  -    3 - 4 hours

So the need for com fort will vary.        M ulti-purpose stadia will need to be quite flexible
in this m atter.



MATERIALS

M aterials for outdoor stadia seats need to be weather-resistant, robust and
com fortable to sit on.   M aterials include aluminium, suitable wood and the most
com m on m aterial for m odern stadia, some form of plastic.            This latter m aterial has
the greatest potential for moulding and shaping for comfort.


Fire retardance needs to be taken into account.              W ith plastic, additives can be
introduced b u t these often limit the colour choice, and sometimes these additives will
only add delay to fire resistance.    T h ere are those who query this process because,
w hen the m aterial ultimately burns it can produce dangerous toxic fumes, including
cyanide.


Some m anufacturers feel that the design of a plastic seat is a t least as critical as the
m aterial itself, regarding fire resistance.        D ouble skin forms which avoids edge details
which can catch fire easily are also considered important.
                                                                                             -36-




                                            -   7   -




T he life of a seat should be considered as about 20 years.

Colours are im portant and can add to m anagem ent of the stadium by colour blocks.
T he colour of the seat can also be im portant when the stadium is partially empty.
O ne approach is to use a varied p attern of colours which give a random effect and
help to reduce the feeling of emptiness.

Some colours will also behave better in reducing loss of colour by ultra violet rays.


Additives to plastics can also sometimes affect the qualities of static electricity, which
can affect the com fort of spectators.



OTHER DESIGN FACTORS

T h e seat must be easy to clean.   This is im portant also to deter vandalism, as users
will give greater respect to a clean seat. Thus it should be easy to clean around and
u nder the seat. Fixings must be designed with this in mind: in general, the fewer
floor fixings the better.

T h e fixings must be corrosion resistant and robust, again to resist and deter vandalism
and mis-use. Spectators will occasionally stand on seats and rest their feet on them
from behind, exerting considerable force.


In existing stadia, the problem s of adequate fixings can encourage consideration of
com plete units, including floors, which can be superim posed over the existing
construction, as recently carried out a t Leeds United.



FORMS OF SEATING

T he quality of the seating will vary depending on the use, but also it is desirable to
produce a range of priced seats available in the stadium.     Standards of comfort
dem anded by users tend to be rising.


B etter quality seating will be on an individual seat basis probably with backs.


In this case the seat will inevitably be designed with a seat which folds back when not
in use. This increases the seat gangway, providing greater convenience and vitally,
g reater safety.
                                                                                                   -37-




                                              -   8   -




C heap er seating can be provided by the use of benches or seats with no backs.    This
can result in a m ore economical spacing back to front between the seats, as shown in
the diagrams.

This form of seating is also considered by some to be safer because it can allow
spectators to step over the seats in the event of emergencies, but it also creates the
need for a m ore robust seat because inevitably spectators may also stand or step on
the seats in norm al use.

It is interesting also to speculate on the various standards in Europe.           T here is talk
now of developing a CEN (Central E uropean N orm ) to bring this together.



SPONSORSHIP AND HOSPITALITY BOXES

T he introduction of private facilities for sponsors is a feature of m odern stadia which
helps to finance new developments.        T he principle is simple:       the sponsor buys a box
and its facilities for a defined period, providing capital for the stadium.          They are
likely to be found in most m ajor British stadia of the future.


T here are a num ber of types, as shown in the diagrams:


(i)     type A is a glazed sealed box


(ii)    type B has a small private external balcony


(iii)   type C has private roms with access onto the grandstand           seating.


T he favourite sizes are units catering for betw een 6 - 1 0 and about 20 people.           Each
box is provided with some kind of kitchen facilities, sometimes within the box but
usually also served from a central kitchen.           Toilet facilities can be provided
individually or collectively, but to a high standard.         Access will need to be private and
secure.


The main factors to be borne in mind when developing such facilities are:


(a)       It is an advantage if the access to the facilities is planned so that they can be
          used even when events are not taking place.          This can provide added use and
          income.


(b)     A careful balance must be preserved, particularly with glass-fronted suites, so
          that the atm osphere of crowd participation is not damaged.
                                                                                            -38-




                                           -   9   -




C urrent opinion seems not to favour a glass fronted box which separates the viewer
from the pitch, but to have a private balcony in front of the box, so that spectators sit
in the stadium environment.     Variations include access from the boxes onto the
grandstand seating itself.   This gives greater flexibility of numbers.



PERIMETER FENCES BETWEEN SPECTATORS AND PLAYING AREA

T here is great controversy over perim eter fences.    Inadequate access through such
fences has caused accidents and tragedies, e.g. the Sheffield Hillsborough disaster of
1989.

T he purpose of these fences is to prevent spectator access onto the playing area, and
by and large will only be applicable to stadia catering for football, though in France
they are found in stadiums for Rugby.


Design features must include:

(a)     The fence must be robust and capable o f withstanding crowd pressures.


(b)     The fence must be unclimbable.

(c)     The design should perm it the best vision possible through the fence.


(d)     T here must be adequate provision for escape through the fence. This can be
        achieved in several ways, but whichever m ethod is used it must be as foolproof
        and as safe as possible.

        G ates must be provided in the fence, with a minimum width o f 1.1 in clear
        opening, at regular frequencies.

 (e)    T here are several versions of open fences now possible.      These open in
        emergency, but the following need to be checked -

        (i)    Will the fences withstand the loads of crowd pressure ?


        (ii)    Is the opening mechanism reliable and "fail safe" ?


 (f)     Ideally, in a multipurpose stadium the fences should be removable; they are
         only needed for "High Risk" games.
                                                                                               -39-




                                           -   10   -




(g)   A fter the Sheffield Hillsborough disaster, the Inquiry recom m ended that all
      fences have adequate escape gates onto the pitch, and these must rem ain opgn
       during an event.     This requires perm anent supervision at each gate.



THE "MOAT" SOLUTION

T he "moat" separates the spectators from the playing pitch.        It has the advantage of a
physical separation which prevents access froj spectators onto the pitch, without
im pe ding the view.     It is a solution little known in this country, but frequently found
overseas.   It is a feature of the U trecht Stadium, much adm ired for its safety features
by Lord Justice Taylor.

W here it is im portant to prevent access onto the pitch, this is a solution which is
preferable to perim eter fencing, which obstructs the view and can be a safety hazard.


T he factors to be taken into account regarding "moats" are:-


(a)   A way of bridging, ramping or using a moveable platform must be found to
       provide vehicular access onto the pitch.         It should be capable of taking heavy
       vehicles.

(b)   The m oat can be used for escape from the front of the spectator areas.            In
       this circumstance, properly designed stairways must be provided, and there
       must be access to the outside o f the stadium.


(c)    T he dimensions of the moat can provide for access for police, am bulance and
       service vehicles.


(d)   T he m oat can be used for help in cleaning the spectator areas.        R efuse can be
       air-blown or swept forward into the moat.          The front balustrade must be
       designed to allow this.


(e)   Access for teams, perform ers and police onto the pitch must be provided.



TUNNELS

If Sheffield has taught us anything, it has taught us that tunnels are to be treated with
great caution.     T here was also an accident in 1985 in the very beautifully designed

grandstand.   As far as I can gather 10 people died and 70 were seriously injured
trying to get in to see a match but the gates had been locked one m inute before
kick-off.

Conditions of crowd control were somewhat different from the UK.         Truncheons and
tear gas had also been used by the police.



DISABLED PEOPLE IN STADIA

T he im portance o f Sport for Disabled People is now well established both to
participate and to spectate. It is obviously im portant to provide facilities for
spectators who have a_ disability.

T he G reen G uide "Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds" does not give guidance on
provision for disabled people.

T he key references available are the Building Regulations 1985 Access for D isabled
People A pproved D ocum ent M (Nov. 1987) and "Arenas", the Planning and Design
and M anagem ent G uide published by the Sports Council.


Scale of Provision: Sports Stadia
T he Building Regulations state that the num ber of places for wheelchair bound
disabled people should be one-sixth or 1/100 of the total num ber seats available to the
public, whichever is the greater. In Italy the standard is one place p e r 400 people,
i.e. 2.5 places p er 1,000. O ur equivalent figure would be four times that, i.e. 10
places p er 1,000.

Obviously w here possible these places should be covered or have protection from the
w eather.

Dimensions and Detail
A wheelchair space m eans a clear space with a width o f 0.9m. and a d epth of 1.4m.,
accessible to a w heelchair user and providing a clear view of the event. (T he eye
level of disabled people must be taken into account when designing rails, and glazed
screens.) Each area, however, should ideally m easure 1.4m. x 1.4m. to allow for a
wheelchair and a friend’s seat. T he spaces should not be all together, but generally
dispersed am ong the seating.


E ntrance routes should be obvious and not arduous for disabled people.        By and
large they should use the same entrances as the main body of the public.
                                                                                             -41-




                                           -   12   -




Changes in level should be kept to a minimum and designed to blend into the design
of the landscape and the building.

O th er factors which need to be taken into account are:


•     Ram ps, not kerbs and steps

       A pproach ramps should not be steeper than 1 in 20 and have a clear width of
       at least 1200mm.

       R am ps may be steeper, up to a 1 in 12 slope, but then they must have landings
       and as details set out in the Approved Document.


•     adequately wide doors, gates and corridors


•     adequate adjacent parking


•     information signs


•     toilet provision

•     access to refreshm ent areas and other amenities.

C om plem entary to carefully planned escape routes for the disabled is a well rehearsed
m anagem ent procedure for an emergency.

A rrangem ents should be m ade with m anagem ent for stewards to m arshal disabled
spectators to supervise their safe exit.   BS 5588, the primary reference on this
subject, stresses the im portance of staff training and program m ed fire drills.   For
example, discarded wheelchairs could be a real hazard to escape routes.


Other Safety Factors
In addition to the design criteria m entioned in this paper, there are many o th er
factors which need to be considered.

(a)    Good co-ordination betw een security and emergency services, and club and
       stadium m anagem ent.     G ood communication with the control room is
       necessary.

        Efficient devices for addressing the crowd.     T here is a great deal m ore to be
        said; m ore detailed information on request to those who are interested.

STADIA COSTS

In the analysis o f stadia costs it would be wise to start with a word of caution before
applying general criteria to a proposed development.

Firstly, the kind of construction will vary greatly and consequently its cost.
Additionally, the cost per seat in a single stand may be higher than that produced for
the same stand in a full ground development.

It is, therefore, very difficult to generalise about costs.   Trying to apply simple factors
such as cost per m2 or cost per seat are often quite misleading.

Whilst our research shows all these difficulties to be true there is, nevertheless, from
the data received, a pattern that may enable us to state typical guidelines.

OTHER COSTS

1.   G randstand Costs generally. From the data received individual stand costs
     range betw een £400 and £1,000 per seat. All exclude fees and external works
     costs.



2.   G randstand Costs from Holland.     An analysis of 3 projects in Holland, two
     with full facilities and the third with storage for m aintenance equipm ent only,
     with a seating range of £440 - £760/seat.   The cost source states that
     construction costs in Holland are roughly on a par with the UK.



3.   Provision of a new stand covering and seating to existing standing terraces.
     Assuming that the existing terraces can be retained and that no facilities are to
     be provided in the stand, a reasonable cost range might by £200 - £400 per
     seat.



     Seating
4.   Plastic fire retardant tip-up stadium seating. A wide range ofseats exists.
     Cost sources suggest a range of £13.50 to £35.00 per seat in large quantities,
     supplied and fixed to p repared concrete terraces. This very much depends on
      the quality and comfort of the product.

COMMUNITY USE

T here is much m ore to say about the m atter of shared community use, something the
Sports Council is naturally very keen on. G ood community schemes exist at Millwall,
Lewisham and o th er clubs.

T here is no doubt that community and other uses of the Stadium of the future will
need to be considered.   This will help to achieve two aims:

(a)    to involve the community, which may help to achieve a better relationship
       betw een the supporters and the clubs

(b)    to m ake b etter use o f the stadium other than once a fortnight for matches:
       this should help to add to income potential.



CONCLUSION

1.     It will be obvious that whatever the size, w hether new or upgraded,
       considerable design skills are needed to provide the best answer.


2.     A good design team needs to carry out research, and see m ore of the changing
       requirem ents and technology available.


3.     T he choice of a good design team is vital, and a great deal of time and trouble
       would be justified in being spent in finding it.

4.     W e must rem em ber that it is possible to build a stadium that meets all the
       regulations and guides, and yet produce a building that is not fit for its
       purpose.

5.     V alue for money is not just the kind of cheapest, short-term solution which has
       given us some of the stadiums of the past.         A m ore enlightened appraisal of
       value for money may now be needed.

6.     Lastly let us hope that the R ecom m endations of the Taylor Sheffield R ep o rt
       are im plem ented and do not gather dust.       Let me give an example.      O ne of
       the recom m endations of the Popplewell Inquiry of 1985 into the B radford
       D isaster was that "consideration should be given to the Design of a standard,
       efficient perim eter fence, with pro per exits."


        If that R ecom m endation had been acted on, perhaps the disaster at Sheffield
       would not have occurred.      Let us hope that this does not happen again.

       MARKETING FOOTBALL MORE EFFECTIVELY
                 A TEN POINT PLAN


1.    Give the people what they want, viz entertainment, drama, meaningful relevant

      games, safety/security and comfort at an acceptable price. These assumptions

      should be validated by a quantitative research study.



2.    The pre-requisite for giving the people what they want thereby selling the game

      sucessfully is to recognise and respond to the inherent event-like quality o f all

      football. Applying this principle will result in revolutionising the way in which

      the game is played in this country, m ost particularly in the way the Football

      League is organised.



3.    One ruling body for English football - equal representation on a power sharing

      body between the FA and the League with a Chief Executive Officer as supremo.



4.    The Football League should be re-organised so that the four divisions become a

      broad based pyramid moving upwards from regional divisions 3 & 4 through

      national division 2 to a smaller premier division (maximum 18 clubs) providing

      the showcase for English football at the top of the pyramid.



 5.    Time and space given to the National team to be developed alongside the premier

       division.



 6. Evaluation via the criterion of scarcity value so there must be more true events and

       less non-events. These will lead to the retention of the League and the FA Cup as

       the param ount events together with a separate competition for the Third and

       Fourth Division clubs. The Rumbelows Cup should go (or at least be revamped

       to becom e an early season com petition perhaps clim axing in a Christm as

       Wembley final).
                                                                                               -54-




7.     A fair price for television, a servant of the game. Recognition that football is both

       a live event, but more importantly a potential television spectacular. Provision

       must also be made for a magazine programme. A balance must be struck between

       money and presentation.



8.     A corporate policy based on drastic financial ‘restructuring so that "league-think"

       not "club-think" becomes the order of the day:



       i)        Divisional maximum wage

       ii)        Transfer policy encompassing all clubs
                                                          lo '
       iii)       Redistribution of gate receipts

        iv)       Television levy

        v)        Minimum contracts for players and managers

        vi)       Standing accommodation to be retained



 9.     Membership has its privileges.



        i)        Creation of fans o f football scheme
        ii)       The introduction of true club membership - representation at director

                  level

        iii)      Municipal involvement at board level



 10.     Getting it right off the field is not incompatable with getting it right on the field.

         Comparison and contrast o f Glasgow Rangers and Tottenham Hotspur.
                                              oCv/vmj^ •M'fc

 In conclusion, what is needed then is drastic financial restructuring, central marketing

 and dynamic leadership. A showcase prem ier division underpinned by a vibrant

 regional league structure and a national team to be proud of. Football must remain a
                                                                                           -55-




mass spectator sport. The passion of large crowds make it the event is is and it is only

then that television can entertain and prosalyze. A ll this will follow if football

recognises and respects its different audiences and duly exploits the event-like quality

inherent in all football.

                     SPORTS STADIA IN THE ‘90’S
                         The Problem s of P lanning C ontrol

Peter D Spawforth MBE, RIBA, FRTPI, Director, Lyons Spawforth Urban Regeneration
Limited, Planning Consultants

1.          D EV ELO PM EN T TRENDS

                   major stadia are required for many sporting activities, eg football,
                   athletics, rugby, cricket, speedway etc. Some stadia are multi­
                   purpose.

                   most have been on the site for a long time. M odernisation has been
                   incremental.

                   many stadia are in urban areas with lucrative intensification/
                   redevelopment potential. Many proposals for redevelopment/relocation
                   have been made, especially by football clubs, in the past fifteen years.
                   M ost have encountered serious ‘town planning problem s.’

                   a recent survey (Ref 1) o f the local authorities covering the 92 Football
                   League Clubs found that:-

                           37 clubs have made a planning
                           application to redevelop their
                           existing ground for continued
                           football use.

                           42 clubs have had or currently
                           have proposals to relocate
                           elsewhere.

                   there are few examples o f new stadia ‘on the ground’ in Britain,
                   particularly in comparison with some other countries.

                    the current heightened interest in new stadia is directly related to the
                    Taylor Report.

2.           PLA NN ING ISSUES IN T H E D EV ELO PM EN T O F N EW STADIA

             W hen faced with a proposal, the local planning authority must take all the
             following issues into account.

             a      Redevelopment o f existing sites, incorporating upgraded/new stadia

                           planning policies, in relation to the range o f uses proposed.
                                                                         -58-




          physical size o f site related to the degree o f intensification of
          use

          visual impact, especially if the stadia themselves or surrounding
          areas are in Conservation Areas or contain Listed Buildings.

           landscaping

           access for emergency services

           changes to services eg electricity, gas, telecommunications,
           drainage etc

           access for people with disabilities

           effect on noise levels/disturbance, particularly in relation to
           nearby residential areas

           use by the local community for recreational and other uses, in
           relation to existing provision in the area

           effect on traffic congestion, traffic management and highway
           improvements

           car/coach parking provision

           access by those without cars, especially bus/train services

           economic impact and employment generation

           other factors may be relevant in specific circumstances

b   Stadia on ‘new’ sites

    All the factors relevant to redevelopment of existing sites will apply,
    with the addition of:-

           previous use of the site, eg loss o f agricultural land

           existing features/attributes o f the site, eg ecological value,
           archaeological remains

           new traffic routes and investment in transport infrastructure and
           management to deal with traffic generated

    W here relocations are involved the local planning authority must
    compare the two sites on the range o f planning issues.
                                                                                   -59-




            Because o f the size o f site required for new stadia and their effects on
            surrounding areas, sites outside built-up areas are usually involved,
            where there may be important planning policy issues and statutory
            designations eg

                   Green Belt,

                   National Park,

                   Areas o f Outstanding Natural Beauty,

                   Sites o f Special Scientific Interest.

            Therefore the planning policy context is particularly crucial.

3.   PLANNING POLICY GUIDANCE

     Local authorities work within a planning policy framework provided by the
     Department o f the Environment, through a series o f Circulars and Guidance
     Notes. There are safeguards, through planning appeal mechanisms and ‘call­
     in ’ procedures to ensure that the Secretary o f State for the Environment has
     the right to exercise control over and above the local planning authority if
     required.

     Relevant DoE guidance:-

            general - Planning Policy Guidance Note 1

            "There is a presumption in favour o f allowing applications for
            development, having regard to all material considerations, unless that
            development would cause demonstrable harm to interests of
            acknowledged importance" (Ref 2).

            dearth o f guidance specifically related to sports stadia

            to fill this gap and cover other planning issues regarding sport and
            recreation the DoE are preparing a draft Planning Policy Guidance
            Note on sport and recreation matters. I understand this is intended to
            be available ‘within weeks’ for public consultation. It should be noted
            that the draft will have limited value until it is replaced by the final
            version after consultation and revision.

     Some o f you will be aware that a new 1990 Planning Act is now on the
     Statute Books, providing the legislative context for planning procedures.
     Suffice it to say that this merely represents a rationalisation and updating of
     the 1971 Town and Country Planning Act incorporating subsequent legislation.
     The Section numbers may have changed but the main principles as they affect
     planning control as it relates to the development o f sports stadia have not.
TAYT.OR REPORT

The Taylor Report only touches on planning issues, in the context o f local
authority assistance (paras 124-126). It says that ‘local authorities should
surely give what assistance they properly can" (Ref 3). As can be seen from
the foregoing notes, this must be within the context o f planning policies and
the whole range of planning issues.

Appendix 1 to the Taylor Report lists the organisations submitting evidence
to the Inquiry, included amongst which is the Royal Town Planning Institute
(RTPI), the professional body for town planning in this country.

The RTPI propose that football league grounds should be improved on their
present sites unless there is a better alternative location acceptable to
supporters and selected for good planning and safety reasons, rather than
financial exploitation.     It is seen as particularly important to resist
development proposals which do not lead to new facilities in better locations.
I f the new site meets these criteria, favourable consideration should be given
to proposals for new stadia, including sites in the Green Belt or other open
areas, subject to standard planning safeguards.

It is important to recognise that the RTPI’s views are those o f a professional
body, and not a statutory policy-making organisation.

EN V IRO N M EN TA L ASSESSM ENT

U nder the Town and Country Planning (Assessment of Environmental Effects)
Regulations 1988, which implements EEC Directive 85/337, planning
applications for many major developments are required to be supported by an
Environmental Assessment.

There are no guidelines specific to sports stadia specifying whether an
Environmental Assessment is required, but stadia will often fall under the
category o f ‘urban development projects’. W here the site has not previously
been intensively developed, urban development projects may require an
Environmental Assessment depending on the sensitivity o f the location (Ref
4) and particularly if:-

i      the site is more than 5 ha (12 acres) in an urbanised area, or

ii     there are a significant number of dwellings in close proximity to the
        site (eg more than 700 dwellings within 200 metres o f the site
        boundaries) or

iii    the development would provide a total o f more than 10,000 square
        metres gross (107,640 sq ft) o f shops, offices or other commercial
        uses.
                                                                                -61-




     An additional factor to be taken into account is where high rise development
     over 50 metres is involved.

     I think it is clear from an examination o f the above that in certain
     circumstances a local planning authority could properly ask for an
     environmental assessment in relation to a project for a new sports stadium,
     and in certain cases for extensive refurbishment o f an existing stadium.

     W here an Environmental Assessment is required, an Environmental Statement,
     covering all the environmental issues, such as those listed in Section 2, will
     need to be submitted with the planning application. W here significant
     detrimental environmental impacts are identified the Environmental Statement
     must indicate what mitigating actions will be taken to deal with them.

     Although Environmental Assessments place a burden on the prospective
     developer, I have found, through the experience o f my company in preparing
     Environmental Statements, that they have im portant benefits:-

     i     planning and environmental problems are identified at an early stage,
            and decisions made as to what mitigating actions the applicant is
            prepared to make to obtain planning approval, thereby avoiding
            potential delay in the planning process.

     ii    it allows the applicant to take the initiative in dealing with planning
            issues and can highlight the benefits o f the scheme.

5.   H O W TO D EA L W IT H ‘T H E PRO BLEM S O F PLA N N IN G CONTROL*

     The title o f my paper is framed in a negative way by the organisers which is
     a reflection o f perceptions o f the planning system.

     The planning system can work constructively and to your advantage. I would
     suggest the following principles.

     i      Early consideration to town planning issues at the concept o f your
            proposals.

     ii     Recognition o f the importance of the views o f club supporters and
            local people

     iii    Early contact with the local planning authority to establish principles
            for development from your initial proposals

     iv     An awareness o f the need to undertake Environmental Assessments for
            major schemes

     v      Maintenance o f a dialogue with the local planning authority

     vi     Presentation o f development proposals in a clear and co-ordinated way
                                                                                      -62-




             vii    A readiness for negotiations with the local planning authority and
                    attempts to extract planning gain.

The attached diagram illustrates some critical stages as a sports stadium proposal goes
through the planning system.

By 1987 YTFC had an agreement in principle with F.R. Bartlett,
a local builder/developer, to exchange their town centre stadium
site (with its famous sloping pitch) for £2.4m and a new 25
acre site 2 miles from Yeovil.

This site, a former army camp, was owned principally by Bartletts
but also partly by the local authority, who had zoned it for
recreational use, and saw the new stadium there as forming
the centre of a community sports facility.

At this time the football club believed that the £2.4m would
be matched by a Football Trust grant,'and that additional grants
would be available from the English Tourist Board and the Sports
Council, which would give them a total budget of £5m.

There was a fly in the ointment. The planning authority had
received 5 separate applications for various types of shopping
developments in and around Yeovil, and the Minister had decided
to call them in, and to hold a Public Inquiry. To show that
they meant business, the club felt it important to lodge an
outline application for their new stadium/leisure park without
delay.
We were appointed to do this in March 1987. An application
was submitted in June, and received conditional approval in
August. The Inquiry started in Septemberl987, but no decision
was given for another 18 months.
One of the conditions in the YTFC/Bartlett agreement was that,
within six months of an Inquiry decision giving approval for
the development on the old stadium, irrespective of whether
or not Bartletts opted to go ahead with the shopping development,
the club would have a scheme, with full planning approval,
ready to start on site. Also, Bartletts would have the sole
right to build the new stadium.   With this in mind, we gave
considerable time between September '87 and March '89 to research
and development of the stadium design.
This was often not a fruitful exercise. There is a dearth
of information on the design of new stadia, and the club found
it difficult to formulate their needs.

It was also during this period that they discovered no grants
would be forthcoming, and the budget shrank to £2.4m. The
plans to develop a leisure park with sports hall, squash courts
etc. were shelved.

Late in 1988 the Yeovil directors visited Scunthorpe United's
new ground, and were very impressed. They saw this as a model
for their new stadium. We fully appreciated the excellent
facility of covered stands and terraces on all four sides,
but felt strongly that the visual obstruction by the roof props
was unacceptable, and that the whole design lacked flair.

The Inquiry decision was announced on March 14th 1989, giving
the football club a date of September 14th 1989 to be ready
to start building.

With the reduced budget in mind, and in response to conditions
on the outline approval which related to the potential nuisance
value of noise and floodlights, we re-planned the site with
the stadium at the south end where it would be bounded by the
existing tree-lined Memorial avenue on the east and a proposed
all-weather pitch on the west. This pitch was to have been
for 5-aside and hockey tournaments with a viewing gallery to
it along the back of the accommodation building. In the event
costs dictated that no all weather surface or gallery would
be possible.

The draft findings of the Taylor Committee emphasised the safety
aspects of all-seater stadia. We recommended that the club
should proceed along these lines.

Our QS reported that allowing for inflation etc. a cantilevered
version of Scunthorpe would cost £3.5m at September 1989.
This the club found almost impossible to accept. They remained
suspicious of the costings, even in the face of increasing
evidence to support them.                                                  ^

We encouraged the club to raise additional finance, eg. from
pre-letting executive boxes. Bartletts contributed a further
£400,000, but no other money was forthcoming, and the club
finally accepted that end terraces would not be covered. This
precluded seating at each end in the short term, although that
possiblity remains for the future. Stand roofs were extended
around corners to give the future facility of roofing the 4
sides.

A detailed planning application on this basis was made in June
1989.
Our preliminary construction programme highlighted the need
to pre-order steel and pre-cast concrete terracing in July.

Bartletts, who by this time had confirmed they would exercise
their option to develop the old ground and to build the new
stadium , eventually agreed to take this risk themselves.
The programme also helped us to identify the need to get some
32 sub-contract and supply packages out to tender within beteen
mid-July and mid-August. We took this approach as a means
of verifying cost predictions and of getting the most competitive
price for the club in a potentially non-competitive situation.
At the club's specific request we were able to include many
local firms, well knowi to them, on the tender lists.

With time running out, the feedback from these confirmed the
need for further big cuts. Corner accommodation was reduced
in height and the planning application revised. Although this
precluded a future continuous roof around the ground, we felt
that it maintained the architectural integrity of the scheme.
There were other areas where the club would not countenance
reductions, eg. the main accommodation building.
                                                                 -67-

In early September, without prior discussion with us, the club
and Bartletts jointly appointed a QS as Project Manager, who
added another voice to the increasingly frequent meetings to
discuss the budget problems.

As a result of these meetings we made further changes which
went against the grain with us as we felt the design was being
compromised. These especially included the loss of corner
accommodation and reduction in specifications.

To cut the Gordian Knot, our QS finally proposed a Design/Build
contract, in place of a JCT 80, so enabling the club to pass
the financial risk on to the contractor.

This was accepted and the contract signed on October 16th.
Work started on site on November 16th 1989, and was completed
in time for the inaugural match against Newcastle United on
4th August 1990.

The structural engineer was the only design team member to
have a post contract role.

Our work was completed with production drawings. Regrettably
we were not involved with final detailed design decision such
as colour schemes and some fittings and finishes etc. These
were taken by the club and the QS project manager (who by the
time the contract was signed was retained by the club only,
as client's representative).

The anticipated capacity of the ground at October 1989 was
5020 seated and 3848 on the terraces in phase 1. The extendable
terraces would take a further 1772 in phase 2. The Taylor
Report reduced the allowable density of terraces. We were
not involved with the re-calculation of the stadium capacity
in Summer 1990, but there will have been a cut of about 13%
in standing numbers.

The club and their design team found themselves at times facing
grave difficulties. That these were eventually overcome, and
the objective of a new stadium gained, is a source of considerable
satisfaction to all concerned.

SPORTS STADIA IN THE 90'S       SEMINAR   RIBA   THURSDAY, 25TH OCTOBER
CHELSEA FOOTBALL CLUB - A CASE STUDY BY STEPHEN GREENBURY
CHAIRMAN ARCHITECTS NEWMAN LEVINSON
Notes for Conference documentation
    1.   Introduction
         The euphoria which excited us all when watching the
         magic television shots of the new stadiums in Italy must
         not allow our fertile minds to wander and believe that
         we can create such schemes within the economic
         straitjackets that the game of football in the United
         Kingdom imposes.
         Inner city football clubs do not necessarily permit such
         romantic structures and there are alas examples in the
         UK where Architects have placed their own ego before the
         economics of the Club.
         The Chelsea of today.

         The necessity to maintain the traditional British
         football ground format.

   2.    The necessity for compromise in view of:
         1.    Financial constraints

         2.    Planning limitations

         3.    Transportation links
         4.    The political climate

         5.    The neighbours
   3.    The constraints of the site:

         (a) A busy Fulham Road

         (b)   The residential neighbours

         (c)   The necessity to segregate residential
               accommodation from spectators.
         (d) A direct link to Fulham BroadwayStation

         (e) The necessity for small footprint stands to enable
              maximisation of the remainder of the site.


   4.    The Brief - the financial necessity to maximise the
         commercial development potential but at the same time
         maintaining football on the existing ground during
         building operations to provide:
       NEWMAN -LEVINSON

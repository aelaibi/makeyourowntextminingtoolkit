Dear Roy,

The Hillsborough Disaster.

     Some time ago I took up the question of the low
level of compensation to families who lost relatives in
the awful Hillsborough Disaster.

     I wrote to the Home Office, but did not get very far,
and I am enclosing copies of correspondence to date,in the
hope that you will look at them, and possibly give me some
guidance.

     The families of course, are Liverpool families,in
general, and they are still pursuing this matter through
their own solicitors,but have found themselves up against
existing law, which the Lord Chancellor, in a recent letter
to me, made it clear that he had no real intention of trying
to change.

     I would be most grateful.


                                          Yours ever,
I

    Thank you for your letter of 8 January to the Home Secretary
    enclosing two press cuttings about the level of compensation
    payments to families who lost relations in the Hillsborough
    disaster.

    Under section 48 of the Police Act 1964, a police authority
    may make payments in settlement of any claim which has or
    might have given rise to proceedings for tort against the
    chief officer or any constable or special constable serving
    with the force.

    The decision on whether to pay compensation is for the police
    authority concerned.  The law on compensation payments is,
    however, a matter for the Lord Chancellor and I have passed a
    copy of your letter to him so that he can reply direct to your
    points.

                                    HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER


             Thank you for your letter of 8 January to the Home Secretary
about the level of compensation payments to families who lost
relatives in the Hillsborough disaster.                                    Your letter has been
passed to me because of my responsibility for the civil law on
compensation in personal injury and fatal accident cases.                                               I am
sorry for the delay in this reply.


             The whole nation was shocked by the scale of the disaster
last April.                  The relatives of those who suffered in this tragedy
and,          indeed,          the survivors who were               injured have my deepest
sympathy.


             It would not be appropriate for me to comment on the levels
of       compensation which might                         be payable       in    individual        cases.
However, I am able to offer some general comments on the matters
which you raised in your letter.


             In order to establish liability to pay compensation in a
fatal accident case, it is necessary for the relatives of the

London
SW1A OAA                                                                                           .../2.
deceased to show that the death was caused by the negligence
(fault) of another person or by a breach of a statutory duty.
Once liability is established or admitted, the victim's relatives
must also show the financial extent of their loss, which will,
of course, vary from case to case.


        Under the Fatal Accidents Act 1976 damages are recoverable
by relatives who had been dependent on the deceased.                           A claim for
loss of dependency may amount to a substantial sum, particularly
where    the    deceased      was    a     breadwinner.            Damages       are      also
recoverable      by     the   deceased's         estate    under        the    Law   Reform
(Miscellaneous        Provisions)         Act    1934   for      loss    to    the   estate
resulting from the accident.                    This will include any pain and
suffering of the deceased and any financial loss he or she could
have recovered.


        Before 1982, the estate of a deceased person could, rather
anomalously, claim damages in respect of the deceased's loss of
expectation of life.            The conventional award was about £1,250.
Following a recommendation of the Law Commission in a report of
1973,    this    right    was    wholly     abolished         by   section       1   of    the
Administration of Justice Act 1982.                 A new claim, for damages for
bereavement,      was introduced by that Act.                      The Law Commission
found that there was in two cases a strong case for allowing
recovery of damages for the bereavement caused by the death of
a close relative.             The Commission believed that                    an award of
damages,       albeit    small      and    arbitrary,       could       have     a     slight
consoling effect where a person was widowed, or parents lost an
infant child.           It considered,          but did not        feel       justified     in
recommending      any     further     extension,          such     as    a    more     widely
available claim for loss of a relative's society.


        The level of the award for bereavement damages was fixed at
£3,500, but the legislation gives me power to vary the sum by
order made by statutory instrument.                     I have already announced
that the present level of the award is under review and I shall
be issuing a consultation paper on this very shortly.
      The review of the level will not touch on the question of
the   categories   of   relatives    entitled      to   claim   bereavement
damages.   I have to say that at present I remain to be convinced
that we should extend the categories laid down by Parliament in
1982, based as they were on the clear recommendations of the Law
Commission   in    their   1973   report   which    followed    widespread
consultation.


      It is of course open to the parties to litigation to settle
the amount of compensation to be paid without going to court.
In that event, the parties are not obliged to follow the level
of awards made by courts in similar cases, or, in the case of
bereavement damages, the statutory sum.


      I hope that this is of some help.

Dear Home Secretary,

     Enclosed are two cuttings from the Yorkshire Post,
one on the 1st January, and one on the 2nd.

     You will remember that in the Hillsborough Disaster at
the Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground,95 people from Liverpool
died, and hundreds were injured.

     According to these articles, you will see that many of the
compensation payments are so low as to be quite unbelievable,and
apparently this is in keeping with the law on compensation.

     Would you be kind enough to explain to me such details as to
whom the law refers?  Is it for instance, the people who are held
responsible for the tragedy, or believed to be responsible, and are
they then, as of right, to limit the compensation to the amount
specified by law?

     I would welcome any other explanations that you feel to be
relevant, but I feel that these people, sometimes having lost two
children in one family, and for instance, the breadwinner in another
family, have suffered such misery and heartbreak of a continuing
nature that surely justifies much bigger compensation than appears
to be the existing case.

     Possibly a change in the law should be looked at in the light
of such a new and terrible experience, and I would welcome your
comments on this as well.



                                  Yours sincerely,

TAYLOR REPORT:   NEW OFFENCES                                         S * jjfr jn o T fc l‘&



Thank you for copying to me your letter of 20 August 1990 to
Geoffrey Howe outlining the proposals which Lord Justice Taylor made
for new criminal offences in his final report into the
Hillsborough Stadium disaster.

I agree that legislation to give effect to these proposals should be
brought to Parliament at an early opportunity. I will consider
making similar provision in Northern Ireland taking into
consideration that football in the Province does not generate
attendance on the same scale as in England.

           in respect of the injured parties for whom we act.    We confirm that
           we hold the original of those statements and we also confirm that
           further copies have been sent direct to Miss. E.M. Steel the Chairman
           of the Hillsborough Steering Committee who in turn will, no doubt,

           our clients at the Inquiry.

THE TRUTH REGARDING LIVERPOOL FANS
                                                            'M

1 went to Hillsborough by Amberline coaches, I think that there where
approximately 50 coaches going and that we were on the 1st coach, which
left at 10.30am.      Before we left at 10.20am. Liverpool police boarded our
coach and told us that if anyone had any alcohol we were to get rid of it
as they were going to search the coach, they said that if they found any
alcohol they would arrest the driver.        Before the police left we all
shared a joke with them, and they wished us the best of luck.


As we travelled the driver told us that the police had pre-determined the
route and that all coaches would travel in convoy.               As I've already
mentioned I was on the first Amberline coach to arrive in Sheffield so
how did the fans find the time to consume all the beer that the Yorkshire
police claimed they had drunk.      We arrived at the coach parks at 1.15pm.
from here it took us 20-25 minutes to go to the club with which we were
familiar.


At 2.30pm. we left the club and headed for the ground, as we walked we
started talking to a couple of Forrest fans.


2.45pm. As we walked down the Leppings Lane End the police where arm to
arm all the way.       These police could have been used to control the fans
leading up to the turnstiles.


2.52pm. Noticed sane familiar Liverpool mounted police who where incharge
of two turnstiles to the right of the Leppings Lane, this queue was very
orderly,    even     though there was two queues about 16 deep with fans.
Within approximately 3 minutes of joining the queue we where inside the
ground.     Once inside the ground we went to the toilets where we saw only
2 youths who looked 'the worse for drink'.


Reflecting on the events outside the ground prior to the kick-off, I did
witness to the left of me a policeman throw a punch at a fan, I don't
know what for but the fans were really crushed in this area.            The area
being the gate in question.
THE TRUTH REGARDING LIVERPOOL FANS CENT..


On leaving the toilets to take our place in the ground I saw no police
around the conjested areas.       Last year I was behind the goal, where it
was bad, on reflection the same type of disaster could of occurred last
year.    Knowing how crowded that area got last year, we decided to go to
the right of centre this time, looking down the pitch.


After only a few minutes of play it was clear that something was wrong
behind the goal, yet there was no police there.


At first the police tried to push the fans back into the ground as they
tried to climb out.      It was only when larger numbers started to get over
did they realised what has happened, but surely being at the front they
would have had the best view point?


I was    in the ground till 4.15pm.      as we were asked to stay by the
Liverpool Manager and co-operate with all officials.


Apart from one incident where a Liverpool fan ran the length of the pitch
in reaction to the Forrest fans taunts.       The police then formed a human
chain,   the width,    of the pitch as they believed that there would be
trouble.     As soon as the Forrest fans realised what was happening the
taunting stopped, yet the police held their chain for ages, when their
time would have been put to better use giving first aid to the injured,
which is incidentally part of their training.


Fire engines and crew where outside the ground and all the fans thanked
them for all that they had done to help the injured.


After waiting 35 minutes to use a public phone, we had to go back to the
coaches which were parked at the back of the Bass brewery.           When we
reached the car park I asked one of the police inspectors if I could use
one of     the phone   lines   in the headquarters which    they had set up
especially for the match.      The inspector told me that there was no phones
inside, which I consider to be highly unlikely.       I saw approximately 30
police officers sitting around cm chairs in the police headquarters.        I
can guarantee that I was not the only person to see this, hundreds must
have.    Why were they hot helping the injured?__________________________

Dear Sir,

Club, and to my local I*).P ., Mr. Malcolm Thornton.

     It expresses my feelings very briefly, but I have tried to cover all
the points that I think are relevant.  I hope they are noted along with all
the others that you will no doubt receive.

Dear Sir,

     As a supporter of Liverpool Football Club for the past 32 years, I would
like to express my feelings about the F.A. Cup Semi-Final at Hillsborough.

     We left Liverpool at 10-30a.m. on Saturday and, fortunately, did net follow
the suogested route. Had we done so, our journey would have t^ken longer and l
is possible that my husband, .son and myself would have been caught up in the
melee outside the around. We parked near the sicns showing, 5 mins to grou      .
This sur^y, did not »ean on foot, as it took us 2D minutes. During this journey
ue passed two public houses whose windows were boarded up, b u t w e also passed a
large Gateway supermarket doing a roaring trade in alcohol. Did this Just^ V
delay1'ng some of the traffic to search for the dreaded alcohol? this, coupled
with the roadworks and volume of traffic must have contributed to the late arrival
cf so many people at the ground.

      The road alongside the ground by the North Stand and the Leppings Lane entrance
 was, at 2p.m., still open for the regular use of traffic. This seemed very
 us at the time.

       Ue entered the ground at 2-10P .m. Everything was fairly quiet, ,      and there was
 v/ery little evidence of police around. This was a very d i f f e r e n t situation from
 the 1988 Semi-Final when there was, at the same place, a uery                P
 presence. The entrances at this corner of the ground seem r a t h e r inadequate to
 cater for spectators to enter two sides of the ground if they arrive in any ™*bers.
 Me experienced the problem in reverse last year when we tried to leave the ground.
 By nature of the shape of the area, everyone was condensed and swept along on
 tide.

      Yet again, like at the Heysel Stadium, where I witnessed what happened, the
 whole tragedy seems to have resulted from bad organisation, mismanagement and lac
 cf cc-ordination rightfrom the beginning.  At Heysel, the P ° ^ c e aPP®a*.
 completely ineffective.  Were they rather too complacent at Hillsborough, and
 resting on their laurels from 1988? No two occasions ever run in exactly the
 same way.

           This was another dreadful event to witness.         I felt problems w o u l d occur
 Hevsel as soon as I entered the ground and vowed that this would be my :               last visit
 to a European game. Ho. right I was.               I had si.ilar feelings at Hilljborough^,? ^
 when I saw the crowded centre section behind the goal so long
 W h e r e  w a s t h e c o — ordination between those inside the ground and those outside?


       I* has been suggested that part of the problem on Saturday was caused by
  people turning up at the game without tickets.  I know that many people have
  complete tickets and it would be an interesting exercise to collect these
  see just how many there are.
Liverpool Foo tba ll   Club Ltd.                                       13th   April,   1589




     I am now certain that I will not visit any other football ground in England.
I have not yet decided whether to visit Liverpool's cround again. I feel sc sorry
for Liverpool Football Club which has always been such a friendly and good-humoured
place to be. When will the Club’s views, ideas and suggestions ever be listened
to?

       I had been giving great thought as to whether I would participate in the
proposed membership card scheme, about which I have many reservations.             I am not
a hooligan, and have only ever been treated with great respect wherever I have
travelled with Liverpool supporters.             I think all the people who were involved
at H i l l s b o r o u g h mho have spoken on radio and television have shown themselves
not to be in any way hooligans, but ordinary, decent, articulate and erudite
people who do not need to be controlled by computerised identity systems.             I am
torn between loyalty to the Club and succumbing to the whim of the Go\ernment,
or reluctantly parting from football.              I will make my decision about this if it
becomes necessary, but make a plea that this will not have to happen. My mind
is made up about the fact that the game at Hillsborough was not well organised,
and identity cards would not have prevented the disaster.

     It aoes withcut saying how sad I am at the unnecessary loss of so much life.
Some of those that died were known to me. This was only a game of football!

                                         Yours sincerely,




This letter has been written on behalf of myself, my husband                       and

Dear Mr. Thornton,

                          Hillsborough Traqedy

     I enclose a copy of a letter I have written to Liverpool Football Club.
It expresses very briefly my feelings about what happened at Hillsborough last
Saturday, but I have tried to cover all the points that I think are relevant.
I hope they are notsd along with others that will be received.

     My plea to ycu is to disagree with the proposed membership card scheme.
I think there are more reasons to be against the scheme than for it.  If it
does go ahead it might easily sclve the Government’s problem, because, like
me, many people will not participate, this will mean less football spectators
and smaller crowds to control.  It will also leave many unhappy and unsatisfied ,ormer
football supporters.

Dear Sir


I was in the Leppings Lane pen on Saturday at 3.00 p.m. but was
extremely fortunate to have been helped out by fans that
brought me over the side fence.


I am incensed by the Press and T.V. mis information since the
tragedy. I did not know what to do or how to express my views;
so I have set out what I did on Saturday afternoon along with
questions that I feel need answering and are pertinent to the
disaster.


I attach my statement and I would welcome the opportunity to
attend any Enquiry or Meeting.


Yours faithfully

                      STATEMENT OF EVENTS


                   SATURDAY 15TH APRIL 1989

My ticket is Leppings Lane Standing Entrance B.      I have not
been into the Hillsborough Stadium     before.   I was meeting
friends at 1.15 p.m. to 1.30 p.m. in the Fat Cat, Alma Street,
near the centre of Sheffield to go to Hillsborough together. I
drove south down the Ml to Junction 34 (Tinsley) arriving
before 1.00 p.m. - but then spent over 45 minutes travelling 4
miles to reach the city centre,late because of the       traffic
congestion/roadworks.


We then travelled half the journey by car parking near Hillfoot
Bridge, Neepsend Lane where Forest fans had congregated.     We
walked up Penistone Road, then up Parkside Road turning right
into Leppings Lane arriving at 2.35 p.m.     Penistone Road was
heavy with Forest fans.


In my opinion this time was comfortable bearing in mind that
the game was all ticket.    There was chaos in the narrow area
between Leppings Lane and the turnstiles.        There were 2 I.JM
Policemen on horses outside the outer gate and 2 Policemen on fy
foot. No other Police were in sight.    There appeared to be no »//
plan to the Police action when at the outer gate I noticed that j «
the ground gates to the right of the Entrance B were opened to
allow fans in directly. I was separated from my friends in the
crush by the panicking horses. In the mass of fans in the area
between the outer gates and the turnstiles, I headed for the
right of the turnstiles hoping to get to further turnstiles or
that the gates would be opened again.


The gates were opened for a second time and I entered the
ground at 2.50 p .m . without ticket inspection.   I still have
the full ticket.     In my opinion there 'was not a sufficient
crush to cause the gates to be opened.    There was no evidence
of any drunken behaviour - just many anxious people trying to
enter the ground.


Once inside the gates I was opposite the tunnel under the West
Stand and could see the pitch down the tunnel.   From my ticket
map I assumed Entrance A and D led to the two corner areas
therefore I should go down the tunnel.         No Police were
before/in or at the end of the tunnel.
                                                          -   4   -



When through the tunnel I took to the right hand side to be
behind the goals.   It was still not kick off time.     I felt
uncomfortable as more and more fans kept coming down the
tunnel.  I kept moving to the right heading away from the main
crush.

Soon after kick off I was getting squashed but still tried to
get to the right hoping that it would thin out towards the
corner of the ground.     There were no Police at the centre
behind the goal so when the first fans escaped to the edge of
the pitch the only immediate reaction was from the Press who
merely took photos of the crush.      It was nearly 5 minutes
between the crush becoming unbearable and any Police action.


As the game stopped I came upon a crash barrier and took the
risk of going underneath, but struggled to stand up. I managed
to move further to the right.     It was then I realised there
were fences between the perimeter fence and the West Stand.    I
was shoulder to shoulder with one fan who was next to the
fence.   He pursuaded supporters in the adjacent area.to help
him climb and get over the fence.       I followed him over the
fence.   I then lay down and gradually recovered over the next
half hour.I saw no    looting or any theft.   I saw no Policemen
being attacked.   The events between 3.10 p.m. and 4.00 p.m. are
well logged   by T.V. so I have not covered them in any detail,
suffice it     to say that there appeared to be insufficient
medical staff (i.e. St John's Ambulance volunteers/firemen) or
equipment (e.g. stretchers).

                  HILLSBOROUGH QUESTIONS



Ticket allocations were clearly wrong. I would suggest
they should be in proportion to the average home gate. The
parking could have been as on match day, but Forest fans
use Parkside Road to reach Leppings Lane end.


Why was Junction 34 off the Ml used for Nottingham Forest
fans when there are diversions/roadworks which caused
considerable traffic delays.


The landlord of   the pub by Hillfoot bridge, Neepsend Lane
was interviewed   on ITV on 18 April. He was describing the
vast amounts of   alcohol consumed by fans - but did not
state that they   were Nottingham Forest supporters, instead
he implied they   were Liverpool supporters.


Many thousands of Forest fans must have arrived at the
Spion Kop turnstiles well after 2.35 p.m. Can the
electronic turnstile records show how many fans entered
the Spion Kop in the last 25 minutes compared to the
Leppings Lane end as the Liverpool fans accused of being
late; in my opinion more Forest fans were outside the
ground at 2.35 p.m.


The Police presence outside the Leppings Lane end was
minimal and inadequate. More officers should have been
there to do an initial ticket check to keep fans without
tickets well away from the turnstiles.


Why did the Police outside Leppings Lane not get the fans
to form queues. This is surely standard practice.


When the gates were opened the Police could still have
collected the ticket stubs as fans entered.


A better solution to cater for crowd safety outside the
ground would have been to delay the start by 15 minutes
to allow everyone to enter.
                                                             -    6   -



9.   The gates shown on BBC T.V. on 17 April and in the
     Financial Times on 18 April as the gates that were opened
     were not those that I entered the ground. The gates on
     T.V. were concertina metal gates to the left of turnstile
     B, I entered by wooden gates to the right of turnstile B.


10. The P.A. System should have been used to tell fans at the
    rear of the West Stand/outside that the central area was
    full. The video T.V.'s must have shown the concentration.
    The P.A. System could have given instructions how to get to
    the crowed - free areas. If the P.A. System was
    inadequate; then the Police/Ground Stewards could have done
    it.


11. Th ticket ground plan needs clarifying. My ticket is
    Leppings Lane Standing Entrance B which the plan would lead
    you to the tunnel only. One would assume A and D have
    access to the corner terraces.


12. The tunnel was unlit and sloping downwards.     It would be
    far safer to be both properly lit and flat.


13. Why weren’t the Police at either end/in the tunnel.


14. Why didn’t the video T.V. show the crush and so action
    prior to kick off.


15. Why didn’t the Press raise the alarm or help.


16. The Police action immediately after the game was stopped
    was very slow. Only a handful of Policemen were in the
    trouble spot.


17. Why were the fences across the uncovered standing area not
    taken down as the end was entirely Liverpool fans. The
    gates at the back of those fences should have been open.


18. Why didn't the Police have ladders or rope to pull fans
    out onto the ground fence.
                                                          -    7   -



19. Why was the immediate Police priority to create a Cordon
    across the pitch (approximately 100 Officers were out in
    the middle) when only a small number were assisting the
    crushed. Where were all the other Police.


20. Why wasn't the P.A. System used properly. Instead of
    telling fans to get off the pitch it should have told the
    Forest fans what was happening and also asked for medical
    people in the ground; many doctors must have been in the
    ground unaware of the crisis. The P.A. could also have
    told fans to go back up the tunnel.


21. Why did there appear to be such a shortage of medical
    staff. Why was there such a lack of any medical equipment.


22. I was annoyed by the immediate T.V./Radio comments,
    particularly from Mr Kelly. Why say the gates were forced
    by fans without tickets if you are unsure. The Police
    waited until 7.00 p.m. before admitting that they had
    opened the gates. Why the four hour delay!

My Lord,

The Hillsborough Disaster


I am one of those fortunate and bewildered people who now share a survivor
guilt complex. I have felt a genuine need to put in writing my personal
observations following the Hillsborough disaster, although I have deliberately
delayed doing so in order to gather my thoughts and put forward an objective,
factual report of the events leading to, and during, the catastrophe. I
must state that my feelings are still a mixture of deep sorrow and bitterness.

I will not comment upon the choice of venue, the allocation of tickets,
or the condition of the stadium as there will be numerous accounts on these
points - the conclusion being painfully obvious! Instead I want to explain
the events of the disaster as I and thousands of people saw them, mindful
of many people's opinions that their voice will neither be heard nor
considered.

First of all I would mention that I am 27 years of age, have a wife and
a 4 year old son, and am employed by a very reputable Liverpool professional
firm. I am reasonably well educated, having sat the final part of my
professional qualifications on 14th April 1989, and I have never been
convicted for so much as exceeding the speed limit. However, none of this
makes me any different from the other supporters as I and my colleagues
have a drink before each game, and basically go out with high spirits to
enjoy ourselves. I actually drove to Sheffield and then drank two lagers
before the game (purchased from an off-licence which closed at 2.00 p.m.),
but none of the above makes me a thug or a drunken hooligan.

Now that the character reference is over, I wish to describe the change
in my nature when I tried to get into the ground at approximately 2.30 p.m.
I arrived to no queuing, no attempt by the police to form a queue, or to
stop people from joining the build-up of people at the few turnstiles
available, and two police horses walking into the crowd and causing panic.
The attitude of the mounted policemen was absolutely disgraceful, with one
of them basically acting like a crazed person. I then found myself being
knocked about by a horse, which led to my shouting at the police when they
totally ignored requests from everybody else to sort out the situation.

Eventually the exit gate was opened at approximately 2.40 / 2.45 p.m.,
resulting in a rush of people wanting to escape the pressure. Unfortunately
I, and one of my friends, was in the first group through the gates and ended
up being bundled to the floor, along with approximately twenty other people.
Having frantically picked ourselves up, in fear of the crowd behind, we
saw the gates closed with only about fifty people inside (I cannot be
definite about these figures). The police inside the gates had already
seen evidence of falling bodies on the first opening - luckily without
injuries!


                                                        /Continued
Page 2.



I then walked round the ground and entered the terracing by the corner flag,
due to my experience of last year's game. Last year I entered the ground
at approximately 2.00 p.m., went straight through the tunnel behind the
goal, then came straight out again to go to the corner, as it was completely
full behind the goal at that time.

As the game started there was a feeling of unease in the centre of the
terracing, which as you know turned to screams and angry shouting and which
was, as you will be aware, initially ignored by the police - even to the
extent of making spectators re-enter the terracing after they had escaped
over the fences. At that time I was not aware of the gates being opened,
for the second time and after seeing the results of the first opening. I
must say that the police must have seen the same pictures to which we were
all subjected by the Daily Mirror, and consequently I can only assume that
the cries and shouts were completely ignored!

As the horror of Hillsborough began to unfold before us there was an immense
feeling of anger about the lack of attention given by the police &s spectators
tried to revive friends, or complete strangers. The human barrier formed
across the pitch was of no use whatsoever, unnecessary, a complete waste
of manpower, and probably based.upon the premise.that hooliganism was at
the root of the problem. I am not saying that every police officer was
useless, or unmoved, as they obviously did what they could in the circumstances,
but there was no apparent lead from "the top, no organisation, there were
no facilities of any note, no contingency plans - nothing!

The events seemed to last about an hour, during which time the media displayed
their true colours in filming, or photographing, as much detail as they
could. Why on earth couldn't they have acted as normal human beings, put
down their cameras and helped? Perhaps people in positions such as yours
can make this sort of vile conduct the subject of criminal law! It is also
worth bearing in mind that those spectators who hit out at the media, or
the police, were confused, upset and angry,, and in the circumstances could
be said to be justified. This behaviour by a minority of people was not
an act of inherent hooliganism, but one of pure frustration and anger.

During the hour or so, the public address system was, first of all, used
to instruct everybody to retain their tickets for a replay, and, secondly,
to call for people in the crowd with medical knowledge. However, it.could
hardly be heard, either due to the inadequacy of the system, or the frailty
of the operator. The only audible message came from Mr. Dalgleish, whose
words you will be familiar with.

Before I draw my conclusions, I wish to bring home to you the feelings of
people on Merseyside concerning this disaster. Before and during the tragedy
there was genuine and, I feel, justifiable anger which slowly turned t o
sorrow and disbelief as the 15th April gradually expired. On 16th and 17th
April Merseyside was devastated. On 18th April the'disgusting remarks of
the South Yorkshire police.Federation turned the tide towards anger once
again, and frankly I believe this feeling will exist for some time. The
sorrow will never disappear.




                                                        /Continued ....
To conclude, I have to say that careless neglect of the planning before
the game should be looked at, the overall lack of reaction, facilities and
liaison on the field appeared to be nothing short of gross negligence, and,
finally, the remarks of the South Yorkshire Police Federation can only be
regarded as criminal!

I acknowledge that the behaviour of some supporters outside the ground may
have been difficult, but please remember the reasons explained above. I
did not see one act of violence or hooliganism, and saw only a handful of
people drunk. At the end of the day with a crowd of 50*000 people the
police should have learned to expect problems given today's society. Why
could they not learn from decades of enormous crowds at Anfield or Goodison.
My friends and I always arrive at the Kop late, after having a drink beforehand
(sometimes for about two hours), and accept that we must queue up (even
with Season Tickets), but there is never a problem, and if anybody misbehaves
in the queue he is simply sent to the back!

Finally, turning again to last year's match, Sheffieldpoliceactually
checked tickets before admitting people into the area in front of the
turnstiles. Also, there were stewards and police directing the flow once
inside the ground. The comments of Mr. Peter Wright of the South Yorkshire
Police Federation that there were no "significant alterations" from the
operation last year are not correct (London Evening Standard — 21/4/89,
page 2).

You may consider this letter to be bitter, biased and ill-conceived, but
I can assure you it has been carefully thought out after some soul-searching.
It is not a catalogue of bitter accusiations - it is fact! A photocopy of
my unused ticket is enclosed.

I «nH thousands of others do.not want the South Yorkshire Police   to be
allowed to indulge in any cover-up!

I will gladly give this evidence at any enquiry In order to squash the smear
campaign against the many thousands of good people on Merseyside whose sense
of loss and unity cannot at this moment be described.




Yours faithfully,

  ,|            HILLSBOROUGH SATURDAY 15TH APRIL 1989
Together with my brother, my 11 year old son and a friendl left
Liyerpool^gi.JLQijLJafliirs to travel to Hillsborough to attend the FA
tnB«JWrtBp5eini-Hnal match.
I drove toSheffield by car along the M62 heading as       press reports
advised to join up with the Ml motorway.
On approaching the junction of the M62 and M602 motorway,
road traffic signs advised 'Football Traffic' to follow M602.
This was in fact misinformation as these signs are for football
traffic heading towards uid Trafford, Manchester United's
ground. These signs are for use in conjunction with road works
on the Barton Bridge, and could have been covered up for the day.
Much has been said about the effect of the latearrival of many
Liverpool fans at the ground, but anyone following the directipn
signs on the M62 would have incurred a lengthy and time consuming
diversion resulting in late arrival in Sheffield.
After a trouble free journey with no traffic congestion we arrived
in Sheffield at approx 1230 hours.
Ne proceeded towards the ground passing numerous Police Officers
who appeared in a pleasant and receptive manner.
Ne reached the perimeter of the ground at about 13 h 5_hours and
and having ensured my young son and friends safe arrival in the
No^th Stand my brother and I entered the Leppings Lane terraces
a'  urnstile B as shown on my ticket. It was then approximately
N e * /ere body searched twice, once as we approached the turnstile
and again as soon as we passed through.
Continuing through the tunnel under the Stand we made our way onto
the terraces. I aid not see any Stewards or Police directing people
within the ground nor did there seem to be anybody checking the
build up of spectators in the various pens.
Whilst I had no complaint regarding the body searches
this activity was given great priority compared to the direction of
spectators within the ground thereafter.
Inside the pen there appeared very little space and we had difficulty
making our way through the crowd to find a space on the right hand
side of the pen; this in fact proved almost impossible as.np space
was available. At about 1.430 people around me were complaining
that they were having difficulty in breathing as a result of the
intense pressure and heat generated by the crowd.
A gentlemen of middle age who had his son with him was distressed
that the young lad was upset and tried to leave the pen.
This proved impossible as one was unable to turn around
or move in any direction. Ne lifted the lad on the the gentleman s
shoulders so as to ease his distress. Many people around were by
this time shouting to the Police Officers in front ?fthe wire to
take action and relieve some of the pressure by moving youngsters and
others in distress out of the central pens to the emptier touchline
pens. Requests were also made to the Police at that time to stop any
more fans entering the centre pens.
Regrettably, no action was taken.           ...............
As the 3.00pm kick off time approached the situation had already
I

     reached and passed the condition of acceptability. Everybody
     was shouting at the Police Officers to relieve the situation. In many
     cases these pleas were vehement, and arguably abusive - however when
     you are struggling to survive and unable to move there is little
     alternative.
     A fan with pain etched on his faced climbed onto the fence
     and appealled to the fans at the back to ease off, but this was an
     impossible request as we could not move in any direction.

     I
     The fan was swiftly pushed back into the crowd by a
     Police Officer who apparently was still unaware of what was
     happening to the fans on the other side of the wire, despite the
     continuing appeals from spectators for the pressure to be relieved.
     The gentleman again climbed onto the fence and shouted towards
     us that fans were dying in front of him.
     The match had still not kicked off.
     Fans all around were trying to move back but were unable to do so as
     others were apparently still entering the pen.
     The situation at that time was horrific.
     The game by now had kicked off but nobody around was watching
     we were trying to breathe and stay upright as the pressure was
     unbearable and the fans a few feet in front of us were screaming
     in terror. Somehow the game was stopped and all hell was let.loose.
     Fans were trying to pick other fans up who had slipped down into
     the crush, but this was proving impossible as once you got your
     hands and arms free you were unable to put them back down again.
     Many fans were eventually lifted out of the.front of that pen,
     many fans scrambled and were aided upwards into the stand above.
     Only then did the Police open the gates at the front of the terraces.
      On returning to our car later that afternoon I Mas sickened and
      found it hard to believe that so many fans had died. I was unware
      that a gate had been opened and so many fans lost the lives in the
    lutunnel entrance and the central area of the terrace.

    U crushed to their deaths from about 1415 onwards.
     The pressure had been unbearable from that time and there
     were many instances of crushing before the external gate was opened.
     Some of the fans died in that pen not as a result of that decision
     but because of the steadily increasing pressure in the preceeding
     hour.                                             ,,,      ...
     Fans were being crushed to death and many more would have died
     irrespective of whether the external gate was opened or not.
     I can only state in the section of the terrace we were in many would
     still have died as a result of the gross incompetence of
„    many people who had the power to act and failed to do so.
     On realising the extent of the tragedy the help then given by
     the Police was exemplary. The people of Sheffield late that
     afternoon surpassed all levels of human kindness and understanding,
     and for that we are extremely grateful.
     The events which lead upto this waste of human life must never
     be allowed to happen again. A little thought for our fellow human
     beings would have saved the lives of so many friends.

    Dear Sir

    I am writing to request the opportunity of presenting both written and

    which I feel to be of some importance.

    I will be   out of the country from May 7 until May 17 and again from May 22
    until May   27.  However I will be in regular contact with my secretary at
    Liverpool   University (________________________ , telephone: 051-794 5576)

    Dear Lord Justice Taylor,


                                 HTUfjBOfOJGH DISASTER

                           POLICING OUTSIDE LEPPINGS LANE
                             AT APPROXIMATELY 2.45 P.M.


    I am aged 48 years, Senior Partner of this firm and went to the Football
    Match with my two friends from Liverpool, one of whom is retired and one of
    whom is a BA 747 Pilot.

    We planned to arrive at Gate "A” of Leppings Lane entrance at 2.30 p.m. to
    meet a friend there.   We had a ticket for him. We had £14.00 ickets for the
    North Stand.    We approached the Ground from Penistone Road having parked a
    long distance away.     When we got to the Penistone Road side of the Ground
    just before 2.30p.m. we were told that we would have to walk right round the
    Ground to gain entrance at the Leppings Lane end.   However we were not able
    to go along any of the small roads from Penistone Road to Leppings Lane i.e.
    Vere Road, Fielding Road or Bickerton Road but were told we had to go right
    to the roundabout at Herries Road where we should turn left.   This we did.
    This delayed us. I did not expect to have to make such a detour.

    I would estimate w7e arrived outside the Leppings Lane entrance at about 2.40
    p.m.   We would have been there earlier had we not had to make such a long
    detour.

    When we got there, there were many people in a great mass outside the Gates.
    There seemed to be no queues for the entrances.

    We teere unable to see out friend in the crowd.    Because we were already in
    the crush moving towards the three Gates "A” we were unable to stop and wait
    for him but were pushed forward towards the Gates.

    So far as I can recall there were a number of Policemen outside the big blue
    Gates, some of whom were on horseback.    They seemed to be doing nothing at
    all to control the crowds.

    I   saw no ill humour or drunkeness of any sort, outside the Ground.                      There
          no anger until I was pushed right up against the brick cabin                      holding


    the turnstiles.      Because we were all being crushed from behind we were
    getting frightened and angry. People were shouting back over their shoulders
    asking those behind not to push.

    People   were shouting at the Police Officers by the side of              the    turnstiles
demanding that they ask their superiors to take action.

I would estimate that I was in the crush**^ outside the three Gates          marked
"A" for the North Stand between about 2.40 p.m. and 2.55 p.m.

I was eventually crushed up against the brickwall of the turnstile.      By
this time I was separated from my companions, both of whom are about 6ft
tall.    Immediately in front of me at one time was a woman in a white
annorak.    She was being crushed against the wall and became hysterical.
She could not move towards the turnstile because of the weight of numbers.
Som ehow or other those of us around her managed to push back from the wall
sufficient for her to get through the turnstile.

At this time there was a young male Police Officer and and young woman
Police Officer immediately in front of me.    I had been pushed over towards
the right, away from the three Gates marked "A".      I think that the woman
Police Officer was manning the Gate at the right.       As I got near to them
the crowd around me demanded that the male Police Officer do something and
he tried to climb the brickwall of the Cabin housing the turnstile.    He was
not able to do this but I believe eventually got through the turnstile to
the inside of the ground.     The wroman Police Officer remained in front of
me.    She became more and more alarmed as she was being crushed against the
brickwall.    She did not seem to say anything at all but looked completely
terrified. I think she got into theground just before me.

I eventually got tothe righthand of the turnstiles marked "A" when       the
crowd swayed again tothe left.      The person immediately in front of me
seemed to have only half a ticket and the person on the turnstilesaid
something to him, to which he replied that he had lost the other half in the
crowd approaching the turnstile and could not bend down to pick it up.    He
was allowed entrance to the ground.           Ifollowed him in through the
turnstile and would estimate that I was on the inside of Gate "A" at
approximately 2.55 p.m. because I just got to my seat on row "H" of the of
the North Stand just as the game started.

Having got through the turnstile, along with many other people I immediately
turned to my left where there wrere a number of Police Officers - I would
estimate between 10 and 20 standing about.     People were screaming at them
and shouting with great anger to take control of the situation outside the
gates.    A black Police Officer shouted something back to me, I am not sure
what he said.

Many   people   walking   from   the turnstile   totheir   seats   were   angry and


incredulous at the scenes that we had just been through outside the gate.
When I arrived at my seat my 51 year old male friend was white faced.  He
said he had been supporting Liverpool for a very long time and had never
seen such ineffective crowd control outside a ground.

I was very shaken.

                     AFTER THE INCIDENT INSIDE THE GROUND

Very   soon after the incident a man in the row behind showed me the whole of
his ticket.    He had not had to part with any part of this in gaining
entrance to the ground.     I remember other people nearby saying that they
had not been asked for their ticket.

From my seat I had a clear view of the Leppings Lane enclosure behind the
goal.    Along with many other people it took me a long time to realise that
something serious had occurred when the game was stopped.      I think that
there we#C- very sad failures to deal with the situation.         Among the
failures that occurred after the game was stopped, I would list the
following

1.      For a very long time no medical help was given to people      who   were
       obviously injured and lying on the pitch.

2.      For a very long time, most of the Police on the pitch stood about
       doing nothing, even when spectators were carrying their injured and
       dead friends on advertising hoardings towards the far end of the
       ground. Sometimes the Police and the spectators helped to carry those
       that were injured or dead.

3.       It seemed a very very long time before any Ambulances          arrived
       anywhere near the Leppings Lane end of the ground.

4.      The tannoy loudspeaker system was hardly used at all either to direct
       the crowd or to inform the crowd.    I heard no demand for a Doctor or
       other medical services up until the time Ileft, at about3.55 p.m. I
       heard, only one request early on for thespectators to clear        the
       pitch.

      I heard one request that spectators clear the Leppings Lane enclosure
      which also was a long time after the incident.

5.     No use was made of anyone in authority including the two Managers to
      give either encouragement, information or direction.        This was
      particularly unfortunate as for a long time much of the crowd were
      unaware of the seriousness of what had occurred and there were
      occasional dangers of confrontation, particularly when one Liverpool
      fan ran towards the Nottingham Forrest end of the ground.


6.     No use was made of the Electronic Notice Board up until the time I
      left the ground.       People around me were particularly angered when
      it became clear that people who were dead were being carried past us
      and the Electronic Notice Board continued to give out advertisements.

On walking away from the ground with my friends I saw many people who       were
very distressed and extremely angry with the Police.      I saw many        many
people shouting at the Police.

Whilst I have no knowledge of the immediate cause of the crush in the
Leppings Lane enclosure that caused people to die, I am in no doubt that the
lack of effective crowslcontrol outside the Leppings Lane entrance b e t w e e n
approximately 2.30 p.m. and 3.p.m. caused a very serious hazard and risk to
life.
I hope you can acknowledge receipt of this letter.

Yours in very great sorrow,




    Solicitor.

19 April 1989


Dear Sir

Having attended the match at Hillsborough last Saturday and been very close
to the proceedings, standing in the Leppings Lane enclosure, it had been my
intention (need) to put down in writing, my personal view of the tragic and
traumatic events which led to the ninety-five deaths.   I'd thought it better
to allow more time than this however, in order to enable me to provide a
more balanced and objective assessment of the events which led to the
appalling loss of so many lives, with the incalculable after effects to the
bereaved, and to those involved.   The item I have just witnessed in the BBC
News Bulletin however, in which the implications were made that drunken
disorderliness of the Liverpool supporters was a direct cause of the events
leading to the catastrophe, impel me to express my indignation and revulsion
at such claims,   and to offer a fan's eye view of the proceedings, in the
naive hope that   both sides of the argument be heard.

That many fans arrived late for the match is indisputable.  The reasons for
this are not important (or relevant) but I would offer two major reasons as
being:

1   fans were obviously travelling from far away, and the cross Pennine
    journey and the last leg of the journey through Sheffield was difficult
    and slow;

2   fans always arrive lait to an all-ticket match as their ticket guarantees
    them entry.

What is equally   indisputable is the fact that the police presence outside
the ground,in particular at the Leppings Lane End of theground, was totally
inadequate, and therefore incapable of providing the controlled ushering
towards the turnstiles, necessary to guarantee safe entry.    At 2.45 pm, I
along with many thousands of others, was still a long way from any turnstyle,
and in the midst of the throng growing increasingly rowdy and aggressive at
the lack of any progress or even movement.  As I could see, this throng of
literally thousands, arriving from all sides, was in the charge of approxi­
mately four mounted police, and a handful of foot-police!! ! The crowd
sensing the lack of control or progress took it upon itself to make it's own
progress, and the warning sounds were growing ever louder.

To control this increasingly and admittedly difficult situation, the police
took the (fateful and unforgiveable) decision to ease the problem outside by
opening the perimeter gates.  This did two things:

1   it allowed into the terrace area a large number of people who probably
    did not have tickets, thereby swelling the number beyond capacity;
2   more crucially, was the PACE at which these people (including myself) were
    allowed in. A turnstile by definition staggers and controlls the flow
    into the ground, and thereby allows people the time to manoevre into
    position.  A swift and sudden and large influx such as that caused by the
    opening of the gates was uncontrollable.
 2




Jffinside the ground ie. between the gates and the terracing, there were
7iliterally no controlling officials whatsoever - neither stewards nor police.
If
 Instinctively, the crowd flowed towards the action - visible through the
 tunnel at the centre of the Leppings Lane End, and leading directly towards
 the central pens of the terrace.     The tunnel itself took a massive effort
 of nerve to negotiate, being low ceilinged - and completely unlit, thereby
 increasing the desire of the crowd to progress towards the light of the pitch

 Little did anybody know that this progress was into an area already full to
 capacity, and that the only thing that could give,   as the perimeter and
 pen-fencing would not, were the human bodies inside.

 The purpose of the letter is not to describe the horrors experienced inside,
 which will remain with me for the rest of my life,  as these havebeen all
 too graphically displayed in the press and on TV.  My purpose is to describe
 inadequately I feel, how I as an ordinary person, not drunk or disorderly,
 was swept, because of lack of adequate supervision and preparation by those
 whose job it was to do so, into a situation of indescribable terror, and
 ultimate tragedy.  The major failings as I see, were in summary:

     1   incorrect allocation of tickets in the first place and therefore incorrect
         placing of fans;
 2       inadequate police presence OUTSIDE the ground, leading to inability to
         direct people towards the turnstile;
 3       seemingly inadequate communication from authorities outside the ground
         to the authorities inside the ground.  It was obvious at 2.45 pm that
         there would still be many people outside - DELAY the kick-off and
         announce to the people trying to get in that kick-off has been delayed,
         thereby lessen their impatience;
 4       no communication from those authorities INSIDE the ground to close   the
         central areas and channel people to the (seemingly) underpopulated   wing
         areas of the terrace;
     5   incorrect decision to open the gates - literally a case of opening the
         flood-gates;
     6   inside the turnstiles no control whatsoever to direct people away from
         the central areas;
     7   appalling tunnel entrance area - a classic death trap in it's own right;
     8   the incredibly slow reaction of those authorities on the pitch to under­
         stand what was happening in the central area or STOP further people
         entering, and to understand the necessity to let those in, out onto the
         pitch..
     9   to my knowledge,   the only use of the PA system was made by Kenny Dalglish,
         at about 3.45 pm after all the damage had been   done.

Much air-time and press space will be allowed to the authorities, the Police,
the FA and Hillsborough ground, MP's etc.  My plea is that the common voice,
and individual voices of those people most affected by this tragedy, and with
perhaps more insight into their own welfare than any of the above, be given
hearing, that is the voice of the supporters themselves.

Yours faithfully




                                                                                  • 0 -7:

Dear Sir,

I am writing this letter as I feel I owe it to all those fans
who died or who were injured in such tragic circumstances at
Sheffield Wednesday's ground on April 15th.

Firstly I would like to relate to you my experiences at the same
ground last year in the semi-final between Liverpool and
Norfc^ngnam Fortest. My 11 year old son, his friend and his
fatheb and myself obtained tickets for the Leppings Lane part of
the ground.   To get into this part of the ground, after passing
through the turnstiles, we had to pass through a narrow tunnel
beneath the West Gate stand.   There were many, many fans heading
for this tunnel and it became very congested many yards before
entering the tunnel.   There were no police officers or stewards
to control and marshal the fans through this tunnel and once in
the tunnel the congestion obviously greatly increased.

Now although the tunnel is relatively short it took some time to
actually get through it.   Inside the tunnel there was jostling
and pushing and many people were stumbling.   My son during this
time was being severely crushed and had difficulty in
breathing.  I'm 6ft 2" and weigh 16 stone and had extreme
difficulty in pushing people away from him but fortunately I
managed to hold on to him.

Eventually we moved out of the tunnel but if anything the
situation became worse and the pressure of the crowd behind
became worse, causing many fans to stumble and fall down the
steps only to disappear under the crowd.  Even once through
the tunnel it was impossible to move sideways as the
momentum of the crowd continued to push us forward.  We were
forced to duck under metal barriers or suffer even more
crushing.  Finally we were forced right up against the
barriers which prevent the fans from getting on to the
pitch.  During the match we had to constantly bear the
crushing force of the crowd swaying forward from behind.   It
would not have been so bad if we had been able to move
sideways, away from this central part, but it was so packed,
and the constant pushing, jostling and surging of the fans
made this prospect appear even more dangerous.
During the game some fans actually collapsed or fainted and
were passed over peoples heads towards the front of this
section of the ground.  We were by the gate in the barrier
fence just behind the goal and witnessed the following:-


  Some fans tried to open this gate but it had been
  padlocked. Some fans attracted the attention of a
  policeman or steward, I can't remember which,, but he
  appeared to be totally unaware of the situation.   As a
  result these fans became extremely agitated and tried to
  force the gate open but eventually an official obtained a
  key, the padlock was opened together with the gate, and
  the distressed fans passed to safety.

  During the whole of this game we were very concerned for
  the safety of our youngsters but the police were only
  allowing injured fans through the gate.  After the match
  finished we all vowed never to enter the Leppings Lane
  end ever again.

As far as I am concerned, when there is a large crowd
entering this part of the ground, it will always be a death
trap.  It must be on very rare occasions when Sheffield
Wednesday have enough visiting supporters to this part of
the ground sufficiently to fill it completely and I believe
they are not aware of how dangerous it can be. The whole
layout for entry into the Leppings Lane end of the ground
and the layout inside the ground is a major hazard when
there are lots of fans entering the ground.

Under the circumstances I have described to you and the
additional events which occured at this semi-final - large
crowds, gates being opened to allow more fans in, lack of
police and stewards to act as marshals who would guide and
control the passage of fans into the ground, apparent lack
of police communications, then it is not surprising that
today, innocent people were injured and even more
tragically, lost their lives.

At this semi-final we had tickets for the West Gate stand
which is built up over the Leppings Lane part of the ground
and it was from here that we were to witness the harrowing
and heartbreaking chain of tragic events.
                            -   3 -




The match had been started for about 5 minutes when we saw a
slowly growing number of fans trying to ascend the barrier
which is supposed to keep them off the pitch. At first we
thought that this was due to hooliganism and violence going
on unseen beneath us or even just a pitch invasion but as
the events unfolded, we soon realized that many fans had
been seriously injured.

Even so the police took a long time to open the gates in the
fence - were they reluctant to do so or were the gates
padlocked once again. Even when the gates had eventually
been opened the police were pushing fans, who had climbed
over, back through this gate into the ground where people
were still being crushed to death.  The police on the pitch
seemed to be the last people in the ground to realise a
major tragedy had happened and confusion amongst them
increased.  Some police were helping fans to climb over the
fence while just a few yards away other officers were
preventing fans getting over the fence by pushing them back.

Now everyone in the ground were dismayed and unable to
believe what was going on before their very eyes.  People
lay all over the pitch, some appeared to be in agony, some
had collapsed once they got onto the pitch, still yet others
were carried, apparently unconscious to us, and laid down on
the pitch.  St. John's Ambulance men, nurses and even fans,
were giving heart massage, mouth to mouth resuscitation and
all sorts of other first aid.  Some policemen were also
trying to help but the vast majority were either spread
along the half way line or huddled in groups, apparently
bewildered and lacking any directives, as to what to do,
from their superiors.

During this time we did see one police officer spat at by a
Liverpool supporter close to the gate behind the goal but I
can imagine him being incensed because the police were
pushing fans back into the gate.

I also saw two scuffles between fans on the pitch itself but
it was against police officers who were just standing round,
seeming unwilling to help.  I can understand the frustration
of these fans towards these particular policemen.

We saw angry Liverpool fans run up towards the Nottingham
Forest fans, the latter had been jeering and booing, the
former had been trying to save lives. We saw angry
Liverpool fans scuffle with a cameraman, he had been taking
pictures of the injured and dying, while they had been doing
their best to save them.
                            -   4 -




Even more astonishing events were to take place.  It
appeared that when the ambulances eventually arrived they
had difficulty in getting to the dying and injured.  Then
the majority of fans who were on the pitch, who had not been
seriously injured, but obviously suffering from shock, began
to rip down hoardings and use them as stretchers to ferry
the injured, and unknown to us, many dead.  The fans carried
them from one end of the pitch to the other in a seemingly
endless relay.  Again stewards and other people helped but
again so few policemen got involved as they still stood in
groups or in a line across the pitch.

Later, having learned that a gate had been    opened,bythe
police, to let fans in, it became obvious that this must
have been a major contribution to the tragic disaster that
occured.  These fans headed for the same tunnel I described
earlier and what was to happen is to me inevitable.   I feel
great sympathy for the policeman who gave the directive for
the gate to be opened, in his opinion, lives were at risk
outside the ground and he took the action he considered the
best under the circumstances known to him.

The factors which have contributed to   what   happened as far
as I am concerned are


1)   Police stopping coaches well before the ground so that
     fans had a 20 minute to 30 minute walk to the ground.
     This could be a likely cause of the late arrival of
     fans and the consequent build up outside the ground
     just before kick off.

     We consider ourselves extremely lucky as our coach
     driver dropped us off as near to the ground as possible
     even though police wanted him to turn round and drop us
     off a lot further away from the ground, despite the
     fact this would have resulted in us arriving even later
     at the ground. We had a 10 minute walk to the ground
     and arrived at Hillsborough at 2.35 p.m. If we had
     been dropped off where the police wanted them we would
     have been arriving in the ground at the same time as
     those unfortunate supporters who were to be involved in
     those tragic circumstances.

2)   Police not taking immediate control of the fans and
     getting them to line up in an orderly manner.  There
     appeared to be more police on duty miles away from the
     ground than there were directly outside it. This
     shortage of policeman immediately outside the ground
     must surely have resulted in total lack of crowd
     control.
3)   The entrance to the Leppings Lane end and this part of
     the ground itself is a death trap when large numbers of
     fans are trying to gain entrance.


4)   The ultimate responsibility of what happened must lie
     with F.A. Authorities.  For the second year running
     they gave Liverpool fans the smaller part of the
     ground, even though they must have an average of 15,000
     to 20,000 more fans attending their home games.  This
     was despite the fact that Liverpool F.C. appealed to
     the F.A. to either give Liverpool fans the other end of
     the ground and so more tickets or choose an alternative
     ground which would be able to accommodate their fans.
     The F.A. officials with characteristic lack of interest
     in the problems of the fans, coldly dismissed
     Liverpools claims.

     The people who deserve commending are the Liverpool
     supporters who so bravely helped their injured
     colleagues who lay dying and injured on the Pitch.   The
     ambulance men, nurses, stewards and firemen who also
     put in tremendous effort.  The Nottingham Forest fans
     for their behaviour after they became aware of the
     extent of the tragedy unfolding before them. And last
     but not least those few policemen who did try their
     best and the people of Sheffield for showing such
     generosity and help to those fans in need of it.

     My condolences and heartfelt sympathy goes out to those
     families who have lost their loved ones in such tragic
     circumstances caused by the negligence, incompetence
     and ignorance of the F.A. and other officials.

     From a very sad but very angry Liverpool supporter, who
     stood there and watched, helpless to do anything.  I'm
     not a fanatical or completely biased supporter, what I
     witnessed on both occasions is the truth.


     Yours sincerely,
                                                                                      M IR .15

    Thank you for your letter of 19 April to the Prime Minister
about the tragedy at Hillsborough.               I have been asked to reply.


    As the issues you raise are a matter for the Inquiry now set
up under the Chairmanship of Lord Justice Taylor to investigate
the events of Hillsborough and to make recommendations, I have
forwarded your letter to Mr R Whalley, Secretary to the Inquiry,
who can be contacted at this address.

 ♦ c i r c u l a t i o n l i s t of address ees attached



 Dear S i r s ,

 F.A.    Cup      Semi-Final

I would l i k e to bring t o your a t t e n t i o n th e f a c t s below which may help
with the enquiry i n t o th e t rag edy which took place a t th e above l a s t
Saturday.


Admittedly, my son and I did not have t i c k e t s but went on t h e offchance
of purchasing th ese o u t s id e t h e ground - t h i s i s not uncommon f o r people
t o do t h i s on major s p o r tin g occasio ns.


We purchased t i c k e t s o u ts i d e t h e Lepping Road end a t 2.45 p.m.


I must complain about th e harassment experienced with p o l i c e on horseback
who were f o r c in g fans towards t h e t u r n s t i l e s . As we d i d n ' t have t i c k e t s
we spent a lot of time avoiding t h e s e "wild horsemen" t r y i n g to get fans
stood in an o rderly s t i l l p o s i t i o n t o go to the ground, I'm sure some
of these so c a l l e d policemen would be more at home a t S h e f f i e l d c a t t l e
market!


When we t r i e d to e n t e r th e ground a t 2.50 p.m. t h e r e was chaos at the
t u r n s t i l e s - th e p o l i c e had no o r d e r l y queues.


We stood on th e bridge over t h e stream; and we agree t h a t t h e po li ce
had no option but to open th e g a t e s t o avoid tragedy o u ts i d e the
turnstiles.


However, when we did e n t e r in a reasonably o r d e r ly manner th e policemen
who l e t us in only looked a t th e t i c k e t and did not tak e t h e coun terfo il
(see copy of t i c k e t attached)


                                                                        /continued            2
 Once in th e ground t h e r e were no d i r e c t i o n s by stewards or p o l i c e ___ and
 thank God my son and I did not decide t o go up t h e ' f a t a l t u n n e l ' .


 There was obviously no communication between th e p o l i c e and o f f i c i a l s , since
 the k i c k - o ff was on time and no c o n s id eratio n given t o fans who had paid
 good money but c o u l d n 't get in th e ground due t o diso rg anized police ar range­
 ments - unlike the Arsenal v Liverpool at Highbury in October which was
 delayed because of crowds t r y i n g t o e n t e r the ground.


Also, looking back on th e s i t u a t i o n , i t was amazing t h a t th e two s e t s of
policemen led by so c a l l e d le a d e r s could 'walk' along t h e to uchline to the
scene when people were lying in j u re d and dying            s u r e l y communication
equipment reached beyond 70 yards!


I have j u s t heard on TV t o n i g h t (Tuesday) p olice accusatio ns about drunken
fans - t h e r e i s a big d i f f e r e n c e between cheerful fans (who were th e main
nucleus of what I p erson ally saw on th e day) and drunken f a n s.


I have attached           my business card i f you wish to co n t a c t me f o r any f u r t h e r
comments             I    do fe e l very s t r o n g l y about the p o l ic e on horseback, p a r t i ­
c u l a r l y th e one    with gold-rimmed g l a s s e s , who, in my opin ion, acted worse
than any c a t t l e      drover!!


L astly , I have enclosed a diagram giving my viewpoint of th e s i t u a t i o n at
th e Leppings Lane end of th e ground.

Yours f a i t h f u l l y ,

      Thank you for your letter of 24 April with
which you enclosed a copy of one from Mr S Jones of
                        Preston, Lancs to the Prime
Minister.

      I attach a draft reply for the Prime Minister’s
consideration.   Given the fact that the matters
raised in Mr Jones'letter are for the inquiry, there
is nothing more of substance we can add^tOA*-

      If the Prime Minister is content with the
reply, you might care to use it as a model in
response to similar letters.

account in making their recommendations.        The Secretary to the inquiry is

                                                      Telephone

                                                      16th April, 19-89«

Dear Sir,

                 Nottingham Forest v Liverpool - 15.4.B9

           Yesterday it was my misfortune to attend the Notts Forest v Liverpool
F.A. Cup Semi-Final in Sheffield and the events I witnessed there, what I have
subsequently read in newspapers, and what I have seen on T.V. has prompted me to
write to you.

           I am not a supporter of either Club but over the last 30 years I must
have attended over 1,000 Football matches in over 50 grounds. I drove to Sheffield
with my l8 year old son who had purchased two tickets in Nottingham arriving on the
City side of Hillsborough shortly before l.JOpm. It was a lovely day. We had lunch
on grass by the car before setting out in what was a carnival atmosphere at 1.45pm.
I have been to Hillsborough on many occasions before but never have I seen so much
drinking in the streets before the game. Crowds, all Nottingham Forest supporters,
had gathered outside pubs drinking from glasses, cans, or bottles they were
carrying with them. Many empty cans, bottles, and glasses littered the floor. I
suspect the same applied to Liverpool supporters at the other end.

           On arriving at the ground at 2.00pm we went straight inside to stand at
the very back of the Spion Kop - can I say at this stage if I had not got a ticket
I would have not gone to Sheffield at all. I was suprised at this early time to see
the centre of the terraces at the opposite end of the ground tightly packed with
swaying supporters whist the wings were almost deserted. Even at kick-off time the
wings at the Liverpool end were not full which was most supprising as all tickets
had been sold. We wer^ not aware of the mayhem outside the ground at kick-off time
which was obviously caused by a) Ticket holders arriving late, and b) Many people
arriving without tickets at all. Could not the kick-off have been delayed or did
no one inside realise what was happening outside? Those on the terraces at 2.00pm
were obviously ticket holders. They were well behaved, patient, and not like those
who arrived at the last minute - worse for drink.

           What happened at 3«07pra and subsequently is now history but it was
obvious that the Liverpool terraces had suddenly filled to full and overflowing
very quickly.

           Being aware that football supporters from the City of Liverpool have no
regard for authority or the need to purchase tickets in advance it comes as no
suprise that many thousands turned up at the turnstiles without tickets. I suspect
the common purpose was to gain admission for everyone especially as press reports
since the draw was made had made great play on the 'unfairness' to the 'loyal'
Liverpool supporters. Was there no Police intellegence from Liverpool with regard
to numbers travelling without tickets? As yet I have heard no condemnation of the
thousands who intended to gain illegal entry into the ground and my sympathy lies
with the Police commander who was faced with a riot outside the ground or risk a
crush inside. In retrospect I am sure he/she will agree that it was wrong to open
the gates but I am also sure that had he/she not done so the supporters with and
without tickets would have broken down gates and gained admission.


                                                                  Contd

             The truth of the matter is that the hooligan element have won again.
They have escaped criticism and at the same time as killing 100 true Liverpool
supporters who had sufficient foresight to arrive early and properly they have
managed to point an accusing finger at the Police.

             This is not to say that the Police are free from criticisn. No one     ^
seemed to be in charge. Many of those officers who were rushed into the ground, lil
me, did not appear to know what was going on or what to do. The least that could
have been expected was swift and truthful loudspeaker annoucements and appeals -
there was   none. Whether the maniacs pushing in at the back would have backed off we
shall never know but it would have been worth     a try.

              Where does this all leave us for     the future?I have heard cries for
all, seater stadiums, and it looks as though identity cards will be introduced.
Neither would have prevented the horrors of yesterday as those who intended to gain
entry would have done so. In fact matters may have been worse.                       I,

               I am sorry to be so negative but     I just don'tknow what to suggest.
I do make    the following recommendations which   may help:-

1. The building of a new and second jfgfrtena1     -i»m i n the north so it and/or
   Wembley can both be used for big batches.

2. The use of more video cameras to monitor crowd movements in streets up to 200
   yards away from grounds.

3. Perimeter fencing consisting of hugh swinging_£xjae«^tes which when unlocked
   ancTopene3~cSh allow easy access^o tne pitcn vkeep the small gates for the
   Police and stewards to enter the terraces).

b.   Audible and efficient loudspgf&pr systems are essential both inside and outside
     all grounds no matter how small.

5. Better medical and first aid facilities are required by law.

6. Ground stewards and Police should be issued with personal radios on a ratio of
   1 radio to two persons so they all can be made aware at an early stage of what
   is required rather than passing messages by word of mouth.

                Thankyou for taking the time to read my letter.

Dear Mr Dear

In the aftermath of the tragic events at Hillsborough, and with the public and
police inquiries about to begin, I thought the time was appropriate to write
to you on a personal basis both as the                 of a
in the West Midlands and as someone who almost died   few yards from the
security fence behind the goal at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.

Firstly, as a __________________ of a               I fully appreciate from
personal experience the complexities associated with conducting such a large
scale independent inquiry and the importance of securing accurate information
and balanced and objective evidence from a wide range of people.

Secondly, and much more importantly leading from this first point, I owe it to
the people of Merseyside, those who died and their bereaved, to draw on that
experience in giving evidence to the two inquiries which I would hope will
have a bearing on their outcome.

I have carefully recorded my experiences on the day itself and my assessment
of all the key issues which collectively contributed to the tragedy which
occurred.

As an illustration I witnessed and experienced:-

a)   The difficulties in getting to the ground.

b)   The harrowing experiences outside the ground and the many dilemmas
      faced.

c)        The opening of the gate bypassing the turnstiles,   which I was standing
         next to when it was opened.

d)       The crush in the tunnel leading into the section behind the goal.

e)        The tragedy as it unfolded in the terracing behind the goal and the
         response to it.

f)           The network of communications that had a bearing on events.

g)            The security and stewarding arrangements both outside and inside the
             ground .

h)            The aftermath when the full extent of the tragedy had been realised and
             the actions which followed.

There are many more points I could highlight at this stage, but essentially
the most important contribution I can make is by giving a full and balanced
perspective and an objective assessment of what actually occurred to both of
the inquiries, and I would ask you to provide me with that opportunity.

I have supported Liverpool Football Club for many, many years, have managed
many of the City's Hospitals and lived in the area where many relatives and
friends still reside, and giving evidence to the inquiries will I believe be
my small way of helping the people of Merseyside and a token of my respect for
those who died and their bereaved.

Thank you for taking time to give consideration to my letter and I should be
grateful if the letter enclosed could be forwarded to Lord Justice Taylor.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours sincerely

Dear Sir,

Re;    Hillsborough Enquiry

I enclose herewith a copy statement that I have made which hopefully may be
of assistance to you in the conduct of your enquiry.

         my home telephone number is

I hope that my evidence will be considered despite the fact that it is

                     will say as follows



 I live   at                                                South Wirral,


I am 25 years of age my date of birth being


I am employed as a solicitor by                         of Liverpool.


On Saturday 15th April 1989 I went to the F.A. Cup semi final at Hillsborough
with my father and some friends.


We did not get to the Leppings Lane end of the ground until approximately
4.40p.m. because of traffic jams which held us up in the Stockport area.


I arrived at the ground with my father.      We had tickets for seats behind the
goal at the Leppings Lane end.


It was    chaos outside   the ground.   There were   thousands of people pushing
towards the turnstiles which could not cope with the amount of people.


It was immediately clear to me that we were not going to get into the ground
for the kick off.


My father did not want to get involved in the pushing that was occurring to
get to the turnstiles and we therefore decided to stand back on the road and
wait for things to ease off.     We thought that it was likely that the kick off
would be delayed in view of the queues in any event but that never happened.


As we waited on Leppings Lane it was clear there were a number of Liverpool
fans who did not have tickets and a lot of them were rushing around asking
for spare tickets.    I was not aware of any violent behaviour outside the
ground.   There were clearly people pushing but that was really because they
were desperate to get in for the kick off which was getting nearer and nearer.


Since the match, I have seen film of angry youths surrounding the police horse
but I was quite near to that police horse and people in the vicinity of the
horse were more scared of it than anything else in case it kicked them or
backed into them.     *


As the kick off drew nearer,     it seemed that/progress was being made to get
people into the ground.
                                                        -   1   -



 There did not appear to be any danger outside the ground although it may be
 that people at the front towards the gates or turnstile were being crushed.


 During      this    time,     there seemed to be no effort by the police to organise
 matters.         At that time I suppose it was too late because they should have
 organised matters outside the ground at an earlier stage.


 There seemed to be only two police officers involved in controlling the crowd.
 There was one police officer on a horse who was surrounded by fans and really
 could do nothing.


There was another police officer who seemed more senior who was in a white
 coloured Land Rover and kept on shouting on a megaphone for the Liverpool fans
 to get back.


Apart      from     those    two,   I   cannot     recall           any    other   police   officers   taking    an

active part in the proceedings and there were a number of police officers
standing in a circle on the road talking to each other and there were some
more police officers standing by the bridge over the river that runs adjacent
to   the     turnstiles.       I    cQuld    not   believe           that    they were just        standing there

doing ^ h i n g .       There was no attempt made by the police to get people to form
queues /there         was    no     attempt    to make              some    sort    of   barrier    to ease     the
situation.


I    think    that     it was       about     2.50p.m.          when       the     gates were opened.       Quite
understandably there was an immediate rush of people going through the gate.


The police have since said that they opened the gates to avoid fatalities
outside but I think that they had let the situation get out of control and
it was the easiest way out of reducing the amount of people outside.


If they had simply opened the gates to avoid fatalities they would have closed
it very quickly.


However they left the gates open and all the people that had been queuing up
to   the     turnstiles       to    the     left   of   the gate             (as I looked)      were actively
encouraged by the police and I think perhaps stewards as well to run through
the open gate.


After perhaps three or four minutes the gates were still open.                                     By this time,
a couple of police officers on police horses tried to form a sort of barrier
at the set of gates nearer the road but people were either getting around the
horses or underneath them.          There was also a large number of people who walked
along the river bank and then through the fence nearer to the gates that had
been opened.


By this time the crowd had eased off and my father and I therefore made our
way towards the turnstiles.


I should add that during this period there was a police officer standing on
the wall helping youths over the wall.             I watched this carefully and no
check was made of tickets as he pulled them over the wall.


As I got towards the turnstile I spoke to a police officer.             I said to him
that I simply could not believe that they opened the gates and let so many
people in at once.            I said to him that they had simply transferred a minor
problem     outside    into    a major one   inside because   there would be an over
capacity.        He agreed and said there would be thousands too many inside the
ground.     He was only a young police constable standing by the turnstiles and
did not have any part to play in the organisation.


When I finally got into the ground there were no stewards directing people
where to go.        If I had a standing ticket I would have gone straight down to
the tunnel underneath the stand were the tragedy occurred.          Indeed I have been
to Hillsborough on a number of previous occasions I did not even know that
there were entrances for the standing area to the left and right.


There were stewards on the gates to the entrance to the stand checking tickets
although one       fan managed to get in behind me without a ticket when I was
entering.


When we got into the stand we could not walk down the aisles because they were
full of people       sitting on the steps.      When we got    to our seats   they had
already been taken.


I will not comment on what happened inside the ground because there will be
a large number of people who had a much better view than me.


I have been going to football matches nearly every Saturday for the last 15
years and the organisation outside the ground was appalling and there was
clearly     no    co-ordination    between stewards and police officers    inside   the
ground and the police officers outside.
                                     -3-



In my view the gates were opened simply because it was the easiest way to
solve the problem outside the ground and the problem had been caused by the
total lack of organisation by the police and the authorities.

Dear Sir/Madam,

                Re: HILLSBOROUGH TRa GEDY. 15th April 1989.


Unlike many of those who have been pontificating on the above disaster,! write
as one who was there - in a position very close to the action.I am a Nottingham
Forest supporter,but I am writing as objectively as possible.Seated on the,front
row on the side of the ground adjacent to the trouble area,i witnessed scenes
such as I've never seen before,nor ever hope to see again.This included seeing
people dying just.a few yards away,and one would like to express the utmost
sympathy with the families of the dead and injured.
My immediate impressions were that I was scared,sickened and saddened.
SCARED because at first I thought that this was just another case of
hooliganism.Many supporters were on the pitch,and one thought of it becoming
another "Heysel".
SICKENED as I watched Liverpool supporters running across the pitch - surrounded
by the dead,dying and injured - still trying to stir up trouble.I can never
understand that.I came to the comclusion that they must be either mad or drunk!
People have said there was no hooliganism.                                ihere was! I have never seen such
hatred on people's faces.Only a strong police cordon across the pitch,plus a
lack of response from the Nottingham supporters,prevented this trouble
spreading.All of those officers in the cordon could otherwise have been helping
the sick and dying.
Here I must point out that the behaviour of the Nottingham supporters was
impeccable,and should be commended.So too was that of the great majority of
the Liverpool fans - but - the Liverpool Club must aacept that they do have
a real hooligan problem which must be curbed.
SA-UP-aNaD as I saw a young teenager - probably about i y e a r s old - die about
k yards away.i watched as the police gave him mouth to mouth resuscitation.
He was s i c k and seemed to be r e v i v i n g - o n l y t o f l o p b a c k d e a d i ' . O t h e r s were
dyiajg j u s t a l i t t l e      f u r t h e r a w a y . t s e i n g a c c o m p a n i e d by my d a u g h t e r and a
12 y e a r s o l d boy i was c o n s t a n t l y w o r r i e d b o t h f o r t h e i r s a f e t y and t h e e f f e c t s

CONCLUSION:        Last year,i attended the corresponding match,when there was no
trouble. (.1 have in fact been a football supporter for over ifU years j
Over the past few days i have been trying to think of the differences between
the two matches.it seems to me they are:-
l'** P R I C I N G :    Last year the police operation was brilliant - i wrote to them
afterwards to commend them.ihis year,for some unknown reason,it was just the
opposite.
2;. ALCOHOL,       as   I walked to the ground,I did so by the same route as most of the
Liverpool supporters.! saw hundreds of them drinking inside and outside public
houses.There were prominent notices near the ground advertising, "Ebod and drink
within 5 minutes of the ground" 1 did not arrive at the ground until 2 .30 pm -
those 1 have mentioned v/ere still in the pubsi This accounts for the great
pressure at the last moment - caused by people who could have been drinking
until 2.45pm and after,and thus more likely to be violent.lt was not them but
the innocent ones who got there early who were crushed by the late-comers.This
seems to me a significant change from last year,when pubs had to close earlier -
now they can be open all hours.rhis trouble is one of the spin-offs we never
envisaged when that legislation went through.one feels that many pubicans made
a quick,large profit that day - but at what cost?          incalculable!!!

SUGGESTIONS FOR t H e FUTURE: -
1),    That to help prevent incidents like the Hillsborough Tragedy,all sales of
alcohol be banned within a radius of 5 miles of football grounds and for 2 hours
before the start of any 'all-ticket' match and that it be fully understood that
it is illegal to carry alcohol on coaches and trains to such matches.
2).    That we reconsider the removal of fences.This could increase the amount
of hooliganism.Kather, these should be replaced by the .trench-style gates,or
grounds restricted to Seated spectators.
3). I have never been convinced about the value of I.D. Cards,but if these will
really help remove the hooligan element,then by all means let's try them.


                                   Yours sincerely,

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER APRIL 15th.1989

Account of events as witnessed by
A spectator on the Leppings Lane Terrace.


I have been to Hillsborough before for both League and Cup games, this enabled
me to arrive by a service bus from the city centre at the Leppings Lane end.
Only myself and two friends were on the bus going to the game. We arrived at
the ground at 2.18pm.

On arriving at the entrance to the Leppings Lane turnstiles I saw a mass of
people in front of the turnstiles. There were no queues for the individual
turnstiles just a large group of people. We joined the rear of this group.
Within minutes more people had arrived and we found ourselves tightly enclosed
on   1 sides by other people. I became seperated from my friend who was also
trying to enter this end.

A mounted policeman was isolated between the turnstile I found myself being
taken towards and the one towards which my friend was heading. At one point a
surge pushed me against the horse and nearly under it I had to push hard to
regain ground away from the horse. It was at this point that another mounted
officer tried to drive a wedge into the crowd to my right. The officer soon
withdrew his horse, it seemed to have had no effect.

I tried to speak to the officer on the horse to my left and tell him to use
the horses to take the weight of people off the back of the queue, as he could
do nothing in the position he found himself in. Between the turnstiles was a
police constable on foot. He was outwardly calm and friendly as fans tried to
avoid being squashed against the wall or the officer himself. At this point,
no more than a metre from the turnstile, it was impossible to influence my own
movement. A senior police officer situated to the right of the bank of
turnstiles was shouting at his men. He shouted for those on foot to go through
the turnstiles to avoid the crush.

I was propelled into the turnstile. I handed in my ticket. On arriving inside
the ground there was a line of police, they seemed uncertain as to what to do
as they, like myself, watched the crowd still outside. On finding my friend we
moved towards the terraces. The only marked standing area was the tunnel,
there were no stewards or police to direct you to another ground entrance.
Because I had been before I knew that by going to the right you could reach
the terrace that way. The time now was 2.1*3.

I was situated to the side of the central pen. Like many others I did not
realise the scale of the tragedy until much later on that afternoon.




           Merseyside.
I am a Spion Kop season ticket holder and have stood there for home games for
nearly 20 years. In addition, as I prefer to stand, I have stood on many
terraces around the country watching foothall. My observations concerning the
disaster are -

1. There are occasions when the police lose control of the queues for games
"but these are rare. At Anfield and Goodison the setting up and marshalling of
large queues is good.

Problems have occured at Wembley 1986 and 1988. On both occasions entry to the
ground was only gained by "being subjected to a crush.

Problems arose at Derby County last season, 1988, with severe pressure having
to be experienced to gain entry to the STANDS.

At the league game at Sheffield this year it was difficult to enter the West
Stand. In spite of having tickets I missed the start and had to endure much
pushing to gain entry. There are a lack of turnstiles at this ground.

Police on semi-final day had lost control of the queue earlier than has been
stated. The situation was already out of control when we arrived. Experience
said it could only get worse as kick-off approached. There were no proper
queues at 2.18pm, which there should have been to speed entry. There was just
a mass of people.

2. The behaviour of people in the Leppings Lane area was not as some have
suggested. I witnessed no drunkard fans trying to get in. People reacted well
considering the crush they were subjected to. Once in a mass of people like
that experienced at Hillsborough choice of action goes. To suggest that large
numbers were drunk is.false. To infer that even if a few were drunk it would, 1
could, influence such a large force generated by thousands is equally
incorrect and illogical.

3. There should have been directions given inside the ground to prevent one
pen becoming overcrowded, especially the one behind the goal which is the most
likely to become over full. In terraces like the Kop sideways movement is
possible and does occur. Given that there are pens at Hillsborough it is even
more essential to evenly distribute the supporters. Once in the central pen
the only way out was against the flow of people still entering.

It. Should pens be constructed that allow such little movement of spectators.
Why is entry and exit restricted to that one tunnel?

5. On this, and other, visits to Hillsborough the Leppings Lane terrace has
always seemed over full. It has been uncomfortable in the past. Is a capacity
of 10,000 for this area realistic? Are the entrances and exits sufficient for
a capacity 10,000 attendence?

6. Average home attendances should be taken into account in providing venues
for important games. Sensible planning could avoid many problems. The number
of turnstiles and the space to form queues should be taken into consideration.
The provision,of 'away' ends at many grounds has resulted in many grounds
being unsuited to a match involving two clubs each with an equal share of the
tickets j

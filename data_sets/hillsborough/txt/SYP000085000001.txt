we    were        again       seen       as    a serial            by    our       serial        Inspector              and Sergeants

At    -10.50pm          (2230)          the    serial        was        deployed           into       the     H a 3.i f a        R oa d a re a

Club      entrance.                Whilst       at     this        l o c a t i o n we       saw       the     Liverpool             coaches

start      to a r r i v e          and    park       at     the     top     of      Halifax          Road        near       to    the

junction           with       Deerlands             Avenue,         some       distance              from where             we    were

positioned.                  In a v e r y       short        time        a number           of       coaches          had a r r i v e d        and

the     fans       were       passing          our     location.               It     became          apparent           at      t his      stage

th at    a great             number       of    the        Liverpool           supporters              h ad      been       drinking,

were      in g o o d         humour.           As    the     afternoon              progressed              and       more       and     more

coaches           arrived          it    became        cle a r      t hat      a    large        proportion              of      the     coache

a n d had         b ee n ca r ry i n g a l e o h o 1,              fans     were         getting           off     the      coaches          with

cans     of       beer       or    l a ger     sometimes            more       than        the       one    can.         I asked            what

we w e r e        expected          to    do    in     relation           to       thi s    problem and                 was      told       that

we    were        to   do     nothing          as    long as            they       drank        up    before          getting          to    the

match.            T hi s     information             was     received              from     another           Constable            who

stated        t ha t       those        were    the        instructions               being          given       by     supervisory

officers           in v i e w       of    the       extent         of    the       problem.            I nde ed,         if we         had

enforced           the       law    in    relation           to     alcohol           on    coaches,             then manpower

would      have        been        quickly          drained,            such       was     the       extent        of    the      problem.

approached             .by c o u n t l e s s           Liverpool               f ans    asking            where       to     by      tickets           for

the     g am e     and where               was       the       nearest          pub     t hat      was         open.         In dee d,          fans

were       climbing             over       walls          of    the W o r k i n g           Mens      Club          in a n      effort          to     gain

entry after                they       had       been       refused             by S t e w a r d s         of    the       C lu b .        As    the

coaches          passed          our       p o s i t i o n we         joined           other       Officers               in w a l k i n g

towards          the       ground          in    time          with      the      arriving            coaches.               I saw a            large

group       of     fans standing                     outside          the       White        Horse         Public          House          drinking

alcohol.              It    became          obvious             that       a    l a r ge     proportion               of     the      fans

arriving           late         were       intoxicated.                    It was           also      c l ea r       t hat      a    large

quantity           of a l c o h o l         had        been       consumed             by    f a ns       as    they w a l k e d            from

the     coaches            to    the       ground,             I saw       empty        cans       littering               the       footpaths

and     verges         all       the       way       to    the      ground.             Quits         a    number          of       the    Liverpool

coaches          a r r i v ed     late          at     2.45pm         to       3pm     (1445- to           1500)          and       these       coaches

were       parking          in a       position                near      to     the     junction               with Claywheels                   Lane,

As    my    serial          was       now       gathered            at     the       junction             of C l a y w h e e l s          Lane

awaiting           further            instructions,                   a message              was      received             on P S         D O Y L E ’s

radio       requesting                assistance               at     the       Leppings           Lane         end.         At      the       t ime     we

thought          it wa s         reported              fighting.                In a n y      event            we    made       our       way

quickly          to    the L e p p i n g s             Lane       end.          My     impression               en    route          was       that

nothing          serious          w as      happening               as     Officers           were         passing           us      going       the

opposite          way,          away       from        the     g ro u n d .



As    we a p p r o a c h e d          the       Leppings            Lane        entrance           to      the       ground          I saw a

cordon       of       officers             preventing               entry         to    the     Leppings              Lane          turnstiles..

At    this       s t a ge       I was       still          under         the      impression               t ha t     it w a s        a     problem

with       fighting             inside          th e      ground.              There        were      very          few    fa ns      outside            the

g r o u n d at        this       time.           We a r r i v e d          at     the       Leppings            Lane       en d at         about         3.

1 0 ppm     <1510)          and       we    were          instructed              to    join       the         cordon        and      prevent

f ans      entering             the    turnstiles                 a r ea.         At    this       time,            this     wa s     pointless

as    there       were          only       a few          f ans     and        numerous         Police              Officers.              Whilst
                                                                                                                                           PAGE
                                                                                                                                           S2926

    standing           in the          cordon         it    became        c lear      that       no-one            really       knew       what

    was     happening             inside         the       ground.         We     stood        in    the       cordon          for    two       or

    three        minutes          then      we    were         instructed          to     enter          the       Leppings          Lane       end.

    I ran        into       the    Leppings            Lane       end and        was      immediately                confronted             with

    hysterical              fans       shouting,            "Get       down     th ere ,       do    something,                i t ’s all        your

    fault".            At    this       time      I wa s         entering        the      tunnel          leading          underneath                the

    stand        to    the L e p p i n g s        Lane         terraces.           I s a w PC            TAYL0R       c o m 1 ng      through

    the     t un n e l ,     having         to    fight          his     way    past      fans       who       were       just       standing

    there        seemingly             in a      daze.           The     tunnel       area       was      full       of

    spectators              and a       l a rge       crowd were           at    the      rear       of       the    stand        a r ea.        I

    sa w    t hat      PC    TAYLOR         was       carrying           a young         boy who          was       apparently             dead,

    I then made              my    through            the      crowd      towards         the       terraces,             having       to       push

    and     shove       my way          through.               Th e    vast     majority            of    fans       were       just

    standing           there       ‘
                                   watching            or      shouting         abuse       at      Police          Officers.              As    I

    entered           the    number         3 section             of     the    terracing            it       became       c l e ar    t ha t        a

    major        incident          had      occurred.                 Policemen          and     women were               carrying

    apparently              dead       bodies         past       me    through        the      crow d.             I saw       that    there

    was     literally a                pile      of    bodies          towards        the      front          of    the    terraces             and

    in the        main       near       to a n        e x it     gat e    in the         perimeter             fencing.              There       were

    numerous           Policemen            and       emergency           services          on      the       pitch       i ts elf .        The

    pitch        was    a    sea       of   people.              I enlisted           the      help       of       some    Liverpool             fans

    who     helped          me    to    carry a youth                  from     the      terraces             through          the

    tunnel        and       out    into       the      area       at     the    b a ck    of     the      stand       where          emergency
           ----
5   services           were       begining            to a r r i v e .         1 attempted               mouth       to m o u t h

    resuscitation                 on    the      youth         and     kept     t his     up     for      s o me     minutes           but the

    youth        was    obviously             dead         and    had     been     so     for       s ome      minutes.              The

    Liverpool           f an s     were       continually                shouting         abuse          at    the    police          officers

    kicking           out.        I wa s      narrowly missed                   by a y o u t h           throwing          a    bottle          from

    the     seating          area above               the      terraces         towards          me,      the       bottle       shattered

    on     the    concrete             beside         me.
                                                                                                                               PAGE
                                                                                                                               32926




The    majority          of    the     fa ns       were       heavily         intoxicated              and were         doing

nothing        but    s h o ut    abuse           and     get     in the       way.         There       was    a section            of

the    f ans    t ha t    got     stuck           in a n d       helped,       but     these          were    in the       minority.

I then     helped         to     form       a     lined       lifting         the    bodies           from    the      terraces

along    the     line a n d          through            the      gate      in the      perimeter             fence     and     o nto

the    pitch where             the     majority            of     the      medical      help          seemed     to     be.




After    this        1 went       to    the        end     of     the      tunnel      to    stop       fans     returning              o nt o

the    terraces.              Whilst        there        we      were      repeatedly            abused with            bad

language        we    were       urinated             upon       by fans       from     the       seated       area.          The       fans

perhaps        understandably                   in s o m e       cases,       would     not       listen       to      reason       and

barged     t h r o u g h at      the        first        opportunity.                I was        pushed and            jostled          by

drunken        fans      trying        to       get     b ac k    o nt o   the      terraces.            Unbelievably               a

large    number          wanted        to       get     back      because        they       d i d n ’t w a n t      to m i s s .the

rest a r t o f t h e m a t c h .                T h e f a n s t ha t w e r e b e h a v i n g b a d l y w e r e                the       o n es

that    were     heavily          in d r i n k .           After        a while        all       of    the    bodies       were

removed        and    the      situation              calmed       down and          the     fans       dispersed.             I then

attended        at    the N o r t h         Stand        for      stand       do wn.        We    were       l a ter    transported

back    to M a i n       Street        Police           Station         where       were     were       stood       down      at    7.

30pm    (1930 ).


I was    not     injured          in    the        incident,            and    cannot        assist          further.

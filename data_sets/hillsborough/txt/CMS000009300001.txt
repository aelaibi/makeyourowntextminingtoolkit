Dear

Thank you for your recent letter to the Prime Minister which has
been passed to this department in view of our responsibilities for
the Safety of Sports Grounds Act.  I apologise for the delay in
replying to you.

Lord Justice Taylor, in his Final Report on the Hillsborough
Stadium disaster, recognised the fears of many football supporters
that the introduction of all seated accommodation would result in
large price increases. He commented that it should be possible for
clubs to plan a price structure which suits the cheapest seats to
the pocket of those presently paying to stand. He pointed to Ibrox
where seating is £6 and standing is £4, which he did not consider
to be a prohibitive price or differential. Therefore, the fears of
many spectators that they may no longer be able to afford to attend
football matches may be unnecessary.

                                                          Yours sincerely




                                                          MR S BILBE

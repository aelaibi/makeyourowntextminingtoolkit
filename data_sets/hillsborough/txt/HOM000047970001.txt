Dear Mr Moorhouse

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER

Thank you for your letter of 23 July to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, enclosing copies of the
Authority’s interim statements issued in 1990, and the list of complainants.

Your offer of facilities for the inspection of documentary evidence held by the Authority is
much appreciated, and we shall be in contact further in due course to arrange access as
appropriate. In the meantime, please find enclosed a copy of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s
terms of reference, as requested.

Yours sincerely

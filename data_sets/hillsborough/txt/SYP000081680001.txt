    These      buses     contained a wide               cross section of all ages            of Liverpool

    supporte rs and whilst                in this        location most       of them were well            behaved

    and they were             in good spirits.            We did search a small          number         of the

    supporte rs         carrier      bags,      plastic     bags and     camera      cases   for       prohibited

    a rt i c l e s and/or alcohol.

    I. can say that a l t h ou gh nothing                  untoward was       found,    some of these

    s upporters         did smell       of    intoxicants and         I know some men were

    a p p ro ac hi ng    the buses asking               for any unsold tickets.          I can say that

    two men were             successful       in purchasing        two   tickets      from one of the

    coaches.

    t
    At    1425 hours          ( 1425'^swe were          further   deployed at the junction of

    (C la y w h e e l s Ln with PenislSone Rd N. We were                    positioned outside a p u b 1 i c
1
‘ house        called        ’The G a t e ’ and            duty was defined as          s u p e r v i s 1ng the

    a r r i v in g    fans who were wa lking              down Halifax Rd towards            us    „

    We were          i nst ructed to form a filter                1 i ne of Officers and to             instruct

    the    supporters          that all      alcoholic       drinks would be          left at this

    location.          From this       location you         can see a good distance               up Halifax Rd

    and as far as             I could see there was a continuous                     flow of Liverpool

    s upporters         in groups       of    i0-~"l2 abreast       on both sides       of the

    carriageway.             The m a jo ri ty    of these     supporters were of the               lower age

    bracket          (less    than 30 years            old) and    it was    very apparent at this               time

    that a large amount               of these supporters             had consumed alcohol.               A large

    number       of these        s upporters were          in fact still       drinking alcohol            from

    beer/lager          cans and bottles               of spirits and at       this    junction they were

    stop p e d and told to leave                 the     intoxicants at       this    location.        Some     ot

    them did leave their                drinks,         but others    insisted on consuming               the

    contents          of their      can/bottles          before    leaving them at       the scene.

    G e n e r a ll y they were all         of good behaviour,             they were      drunk but      not

    incapable        or disorderly,

    The    thing that       became a p p arent         to me      now at this time         (1445 hours)

    (1443)     was,    how late      it was,        for hundreds        of them to be still walk i n g

    toward the ground,            and still         further,      what were       the queues      like at         the

    turnstiles,        and how long would              it bs M f l r e     most      of them would get

    inside        the gNiund to see a football                 match,

    At about        1445 hour?;     (1445)       in company with othe'K()f f i ce rs 1 a t t e n d e d

    had flared up inside                        Gtete’ public      house,     This     time    I went   inside

    the    premises-by the front                door and,      although      I saw no fighting          or

    trouble,        ths??Niere about 50-60               people     inside    the     premises.    It was

    Rd N and to         rernaJNt there.         This we     did    in a serial,        arriving    outside

    the gates at          1530 h ot?Ks     ( 153CJ) , The first         instruction given to me was
                   |'J5G>36>               ~
    from    Inspector TOWN E N D to>?Tf inside                 the ground and stop             people   coming

    out    of the     passageway adjacent              to the S pion Kop and N Stand,                I. went
a m bu la nc e     parked near to the metal                  fencaNng dividing       the above      two

areas and behind this a m b ulance                     was two boa1.es,      both men,        and   they

were    covered on their             top halves         with bed blankets,           both a p p e a r e d    to

be dead,         no-one was with them.

I then went          to the metal          gate      into the S p i o n Kop end of the           ground          in

company with two other Officers                        but    the tide of    people wanting           to

leave     the ground was            far    too great         for us to stop,        I. did not know why

they wanted to             leave or what          had occurred.         I honestly      believed at          thi

time    that       there   had been fighting             between fans       or a disturbance              which

had    caused the games             to m i stopped.           I had no idea of the          scale     of the

e nsui ng di saster.

1 then was          told to make my way oS^to \t h e playing area a nd this                         I did

via the      passageway at the              side of the 1M Stand,           as    I walked down the

pass a g e w a y    I saw numerous          persons with minor            injuries,      to shoulders,

arms and         chests.    There were         people being        carried on boards,

stretchers and also              being      physically         lifted and    placed on the grassed

playing area          in front       of me.

I did at this time assist a man who was                           limping,       he was a s s i s t e d     to

the ambulance          I had seen earlier               near to the metal          fencing and        I sat

him on the          concrete and told him help w ould be arriving.                           I then went

back    onto the       playing area and a s s i s t e d another man who                    complained of

chest     pains,      he was also          being a ided by another           man.      I did ask,

" W h a t ’s gone off,"        but all       1 was      told was    that    people had        ’rushed

t h e m ’ and that a lot of               people were         hurt at    the other      end of the

field,     ie W Stand         (L e p p i n g \ L n    end).    I left this man         in the    care of

his    friend and          1 went    to the       cesntre of the        playing area where           I was

told    by a Sergeant          to form a cordo\. acrdss                 the field a nd to move              the

standing         people     towards       the W S t a n d and     to let through the            injured.

This    I did with a number                of other Officers,            only allowing        the    injured

                was at          this time    shouted at by supporters             to the effect        that we were

             m ur d e r i n g   bastards and that we d i d n ?t give a toss to what was                     going       on

             I can say that at              this   time    the N o t t i n g h a m Forest    supporters    were

             cheering and this seemed to insense                      the Liverpool         supporters     who

             became more and more aggressive,                      but e v e n t u a l l y we did manage    to    calm

             abusive       to us and giving          us a g g ra v a t i o n and taunts,      with the     number of

             dead,      saying,      "I hope you are happy             its now 54."         I had no   idea of the

             scale      of the disaster was           so large       in number.

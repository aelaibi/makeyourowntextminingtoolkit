HILLSBOROUGH TRIBUNAL

Following today's announcement by the Police Complaints Authority that the
disciplinary tribunal against Superintendent Bernard Murray will not now
proceed, the Chief Constable, Mr Richard Wells, says:

"The Authority's decision brings no rejoicing among the ranks of the South
Yorkshire Police service.

"There can be no winners from a disaster which claimed 95 lives.          There are
certainly losers.

"First and foremost, of course, are the bereaved families who lost their loved
ones that tragic afternoon.   Words alone will never be enough to ease their
pain and anger. We acknowledge this, though once again feel moved to express
our deep and sincere sorrow to them.

"Many others have been losers, not least members of the police service on
duty that day who, faced with the tragedy, attempted to deal with the horror
of the moment.    Some are still fighting that dreadful battle and we count
the cost weekly in ill-health retirements and in the number of men and women
who still need counselling to cope with their memories. This they share with
the families who lost friends and relatives.

"I echo the sentiments of Dr Hapgood who, at the Memorial Service, said that
no disaster was the fault of one organisation alone or of just one human being,
but rather a combination of factors and shared responsibilities.

"That is why I have never been convinced of the appropriateness of the
disciplinary tribunal. My feelings were strengthened by the Director of Public
Presecution's decision on criminal matters, by the findings of the independent
investigating team, the conclusions of the inquest and advice given by leading
counsel. I have never thought that the police alone should be blamed, although
we firmly acknowledged our own responsibilities by the settlement of the civil
actions against us.

"There were clearly mistakes. These mistakes have had awful human consequences.
The major questions have always been, in law, at which doors these mistakes
should be laid and whether they were culpable mistakes.

"I hold myself personally responsible for the South Yorkshire Police having
advised the Police Complaints Authority to review their decisions about holding
a tribunal and feel relieved that our argument about natural justice has been
so completely agreed.
PR no 152


"Many, many people - police officers and those in the broader community -
will sympathise with the decision to spare Supt. Bernard Murray the further
burden of facing a tribunal alone. We will understand if some of the bereaved
cannot share that view.

"Bernard Murray has thrown himself into his command duties since the day of
the tragedy with his usual energetic commitment to the community.

"All of us in the South Yorkshire Police service are anxious not to forget
Hillsborough, but to draw strength from its lessons and to move forward,
particularly in the area of ground improvements for crowd safety, which are
the real ways in which we can give some meaning to the awful loss of life
on that afternoon."

               After very careful consideration, the Police Complaints Authority
               have decided that disciplinary charges regarding police operation®
               at Hillsborough Football                           Stadium on 15 April             1989 against a

               Superintendent should be withdrawn.


               The Authority had directed that charges be preferred against both
               the superintendent and his superior officer a Chief Superintendent.
               The retirement of the chief superintendent on medical grounds weans
               that what is, in effect, a joint allegation of neglect of duty
               cannot be fairly heard in the absence of the more senior officer.


                Full details of the Authority’s decision are contained in the

                attached statement.




                                          Further information:              Press Officer
                      HILLSBOROUGH gfftPUM T E M 1 BX


X.    On 11 July, 1991 the Police Complaints Authority directed that
charges   of    neglect   of   duty    be   preferred   against   a   Chief
Superintendent and a Superintendent of the South Yorkshire Police,
in respect of their handling of police operations at Hillsborough
Football Stadium on 15 April, 1989.         The Authority wish to make it
clear that their direction was not a finding of culpability, which
would be a matter solely for the disciplinary tribunal hearing the

charges to adjudicate upon.


2.    on 10 November, 1991 the Chief Superintendent was retired from
th£ Force on medical grounds with the consequence that he was, with
effect from that date, no longer subject to the Police Discipline
code and, therefore, the disciplinary proceeding© against him could

not continue.


3.    The South Yorkshire Police have now sought the leave of this
Authority      to   withdraw   the    single   charge   laid   against   the
 Superintendent, who was subordinate to the Chief Superintendent at

 the relevant time*


 4.    The Authority have considered the request with great care and
 conclude that it would be unjust and inappropriate to pursue th.

 charge against the Superintendent alone, in the absence of his
 superior officer.        We have therefore decided to exercise our
 discretion,    In accordance with Section 93(6) of the Police and

 Crininal Evidence Act 1984, to give the Force leave not to proceed

 with the charge.
5.   The Authority do not resile from their original decision to
direct that charges against both officers be heard and considered
by a disciplinary tribunal.      We are satisfied that there was prim*
facie evidence to support such charges.          The subsequent retirement
of the Chief Superintendent,          on medical grounds has, however,

substantially altered the position.


6.   The charges against the Chief Superintendent covered a number
of different matters.     The Authority directed that one of these
charges should be laid both against the chief superintendent and
the superintendent, as his immediate subordinate.                  This charge
alleged failure to control the movement of supporters subsequent to

the opening of Gate 'C1, which was opened in order to avert danger

to supporters outside the ground.


7.   We have made our decision to accede to the South Yorkshire

Police requests for the following reasons:


     a.   the background to the alleged failure to control those
     entering through Gate *Cf involved, inter alia, preliminary
     planning and preparation for the police operation which it
     would be impossible to assess fairly at a disciplinary hearing
     in the     absence   of    the    officer   in    charge   of   the whole

     operation;


     b.   the primary responsibility, for controlling spectators
     entering     Gate    ?c*    did     not     lie    directly     with   the

     Super intendent;
                                                        TO         90742523243   P.05
13-JAN-1992    12:03    FROM   POLICE COMPLAINTS




         c.      the precise nature of the superintendent's responsibility
         cannot be adequately assessed in the absence of his superior

         officer at the tribunal;


         d.       what is, in effect, f. joint allegation of neglect of duty
         cannot be fairly heard in the aba«mc« of the more senior

          officer;


          e.     the superintendent's ability to put forward his case

          fully        in the     absence    of his   superior   officer would     be

          impaired; and


          f.     it would be an injustice to the Superintendent,                 who
          conducted himself with dignity at the Inquest and throughout
          th e    investigations, for him to stand alone ohargedt^ith being

              a cause of the tragedy which occurred and thus to appear to be
              a 'scapegoat* for faults which may veil be attributable to

              others.


    8.        in reaching what we have found to be a very difficult decision
    we have taken into account the interests and feeling. of those who
    have Bade complaints about the police conduct, the Hillsborough
     Families Support Group, all those who have suffered ber.eve.ent as
     the result of the tragic events and the public interest on the on-
     hand and, on the other, justice to the superintendent and the sense
     of unfairness which would result from continuing the process
     against him alone in the absence of His superior officer.

   9.    The Authority have therefore granted the leave sought by the
   South Yorkshire Police not to proceed with the charge which we

  directed against the Superintendent.

    Thank you for your letter of 12 December 1991.   On further consideration
    and after discussing the matter with various people involved in the
    initial enquiry, I feel that these further matters would be best dealt
    with by someone who has already been involved with the Hillsborough
    disaster.  To that end, Detective Chief Superintendent Foster has already
    contacted Superintendent Fell and I understand is making arrangements to
    meet the Counsel who Is conducting the tribunal.

    I understand these new enquiries should not take longer than a few days
    and if there are any problems, no doubt we can discuss the matter
    further.

    Yours sincerely

        93(7) of that Act was merely to indicate that ahould you seek to exercise

      Dear Mr Moore
      Thank you for your letter of December 12 last, In it you request
      the Authority to consider exercising our powers under Section
      93(7) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 to decide on
      the merits of the case as to whether or not proceedings against
      Superintendent Murray should be halted.      I presume that y jut:
      reference to Section 93(7) should read Section 93(6} and. that yo-o
      are seeking leave of the Authority under that subsection,
      behalf of the chief officer, "not to proceed with charges wh..
        . subsection (5) above would otherwise oblige^ him to process
      You give your reasons for making this request in paragraph 2
      your letter cogently and clearly. If you confirm that this
      what you wish us to consider we will, of course, deal with y
      request with care and as a matter of urgency and will give d u;-
      weight to all the points which you so helpfully raise,           !■■
      certainly raises matters which require serious attention.

       We are conscious of vhe fact that time is passing and th*.
       date for the hearing approaches and, as yet, as we underst*
       the charges and the statements have not been served.

procodur* by which it la possible In accordance with Regulation 19 to adduce
written testiaociy would not thus be available to the tribunal. It waa auggeated
by you that eounael ahould preaent the case by examining each witneas at the
tribunal aa to his evidence without precise foreknowledge of what that evidence
would be.

On advice I have decided not to follow this suggested course of conduct for
a nuaber of reasons, not least because it seeas to me to be unfair to the
accused officer. I aa alndful that Annex H of the Hoae Office Guidance sets
out particularly at Paragraph 12 under the heading, "Rights of the accused
officer” the clear principle that, "the accused officer aust be presented with
copies of the evidence." By Paragraph 18 of Section 9 he, "should be given
adequate duty tlae to prepare his defence." It Is difficult to see how he
can sensibly aake decisions as to plea, legal representation or defence unless
he has opportunity to consider beforehand the evidence agalnat him and If
appropriate have tlae to gather and aarahall evidence to refute it.

I aa of the view, therefore, that froa each wltneaa to be used In support of
the charge a atateaent auat be obtained in a proper foraat, signed, dated and
witnessed setting down without aabiguity the relevant evidence he can give
and avoiding extraneoue material. A shorter and less stressful tribunal hearing
is likely to occur froa the provision of such stateaents for the possibility
of the tribunal becoalng weighed down by technical legal erguaente as to whether
the accused officer's right to a fair hearing has been coaproalsed will be
reaoved. The possibilities of an eabarrassing adjournment to rectify the
situation or a subsequent appeal on these grounds will be avoided. Above all,
Smith Yorkshire Police will be seen to have conducted a thorough, rigorous
and professionally prepared presentation.

In the report of the investigation submitted to you by Nr Sharp, the indication
was given that the Investigation so far carried out was incoaplete for the
purposes of proceedings. Since, for various reasons, the stateaents were not
taken before* the task is now an unavoidable pre-requisite of the tribunal.

Such statements ought to be taken by police officers. I am concerned, however,
that the task should not be carried out by aeabers of South Yorkshire Police
since 1 would seek to avoid any accusation that influence had been used cm
any witness* this was a point aade by Captain Taylor at the meting and I
wholeheartedly agree that the statement taking needs careful handling. 1 would
be anxious, for Instance, that It was done as an initiative of the presenter
rather than as evidence gathering Instigated on behalf of the accused officer.


                                                                      Cont’d..

Complaints Authority, Probably tha work could be coapleted in about three
weeks aa tha reaearch into what evidence each wltnaaa nay be able to supply

Accordingly 1 have approached the Chief Constable of West Midlande Police end

subject to your decision, under the supervision of the Authority. He has agreed

SHIP 3AE




At our meeting of 29 November 1991, when the wording of the disciplinary charge
and the way it was proposed to put the case were agreed, Superintendent Fell
produced the original material consisting of the various accounts of each of
the witnesses identified as supporting the charge. This material had not
previously been seen by Captain Taylor or yourself and I indicated that I was
persuaded by those with detailed knowledge of it that this material was
unsuitable for the purposes of the tribunal and that there was a need for signed
statements of evidence to be obtained from these witnesses. I said that I
would make written request for the Authority to continue supervising this
further evidence gathering and I now make that request.

I reiterated to you it has ever been my intention in the unique circumstances
of the Hillsborough Tragedy to consult with and invite the views of the Police
Complaints Authority in the decision making at all stages in the process.
Accordingly I will set out what I see as the position and invite your comment,
should you wish, on how I propose to progress matters although I recognise
that the responsibility for the conduct of proceedings in accordance with
Section 93(5) of the Act rests solely with m e .

As a fundamental consideration it is prudent to assume that Superintendent
Murray will defend the charge with vigour and will require strict legal
obligations to be scrupulously discharged. There is a possibility that he
might waive his rights and co-operate in a procedure that does not perfectly
correspond with what is laid down by Regulations and what is set out in the

in the anticipation of a possibility there is no evidence to expect.

You indicated at the meeting that the Police Complaints Authority takes the
view that the discipline form could be served on Superintendent Murray, together
with the names of witnesses in support of the charge and with copies of those
accounts they have given. T his, notwithstanding that the accounts are not
in the form of proper statements, do««r not include what was additionally said
at the Enquiry or the Inquest and when some do not contain the evidence needed
to support the charge. You intimated that you found it acceptable that the


                                                                         Cont*d.

procedure by which it is possible in accordance with Regulation 19 to adduce
written testimony would not thus be available to the tribunal. It was suggested
by you that counsel should present the case by examining each witness at the
tribunal as to his evidence without precise foreknowledge of what that evidence
would be.

On advice I have decided not to follow this suggested course of conduct for
a number of reasons, not least because it seems to me to be unfair to the
accused officer. I am mindful that Annex H of the Home Office Guidance sets
out particularly at Paragraph 12 under the heading, "Rights of the accused
officer" the clear principle that, "the accused officer must be presented with
copies of the evidence." By Paragraph 18 of Section 9 he, "should be given
adequate duty time to prepare his defence." It is difficult to see how he
ca n a* S sensibly make decisions as to plea, legal representation or defence
unless he has opportunity to consider beforehand the evidence against him and
if appropriate have time to gather and marshall evidence to refute it.

I am of the view, therefore, that from each witness to be used in support of
the charge a statement must be obtained in a proper format, signed, dated and
witnessed setting down without ambiguity the relevant evidence he can give
and avoiding extraneous material. A shorter and less stressful tribunal hearing
is likely to occur from the provision of such statements for the possibility
of the tribunal becoming weighed down by technical legal arguments as to whether
the accused officer's right to a fair hearing has been compromised will be
removed. The possibilities of an embarrassing adjournment to rectify the
situation or a subsequent appeal on these grounds will be avoided. Above all,
South Yorkshire Police will be seen to have conducted a thorough, rigorous
and professionally prepared presentation.

In the report of the investigation submitted to you by Mr Sharp, the indication
was given that the investigation so far carried out was incomplete for the
purposes of proceedings. Since, for various reasons, the statements were not
taken before, the task is now an unavoidable pre-requisite of the tribunal.

Such statements ought to be taken by police officers. I am concerned, however,
that the task should not be carried out by members of South Yorkshire Police
since I would seek to avoid any accusation that influence had been used on
any witness. This was a point made by Captain Taylor at the meeting and I
wholeheartedly agree that the statement taking needs careful handling. I would
be anxious, for instance, that it was done as an initiative of the presenter
rather than as evidence gathering instigated on behalf of the accused officer.


                                                                       Cont'd.
        DRAFT LETTER FROM ACC TO JUDGE PETRE


        At our meeting of 29 November 1991. when the wording of the disciplinary
        charge and the way it was proposed to put the case were agreed, Superintendent
        Fell produced the original material consisting of the various accounts of
        each of the witnesses identified as supporting the charge.            This material
        had not previously been seen by Captain Taylor or yourself and I indicated
        that I was persuaded by those with detailed knowledge of it that this material
        was unsuitable for the purposes of the tribunal and that there was a need
        for signed statements of evidence to be obtained from these witnesses.              I
        said that I would make written request for the Authority to continue
        supervising this further evidence gathering and I do so now make that request.


        I fcoleh you it has ever been my intention in the unique circumstances of the
        Hillsborough Tragedy to consult with and invite the participation of the
        Police Complaints Authority in the decision making at all stages in the
        process.   Accordingly I would 1-ike-to set out what I see as the position
        and invite your commentAon how I propose to progress matters, although I
        recognise that the responsibility for the conduct of proceedings, in
        accordance with Section 93(5) of the Act rests^with me.


        As a fundamental consideration it is prudent to assume that Superintendent
        Murray will defend the charge with vigour and will require strict legal
        obligations to be scrupulously discharged.         There is a possibility that he
  \

taigfoV- m W   waive his rights and co-operate in a procedure that does not perfectly
        correspond with what is laid down by Regulations and what is set out in the
        Guidance, but I consider it would be wrong to plan the conduct of affairs
        in anticipation of fefcie-possibility. *“*—           wm   it*'-* <» •''«      u-       .

he cannot sensibly make decisions as to plea, legal representation or defence
unless he has opportunity to consider beforehand the evidence against him
and if appropriate have time to gather and marshall evidence to contravert
it.


I am of the view, therefore, that from each witness to be used in support

I would be anxious, for instance, that it was done as an initiative of the

accused officer.       It seems best that this work should proceed under the
supervision of the Police Complaints Authority.                   Probably the work could
be completed in about three weeks as the research into what evidence each
witness may be able to supply has been done and an outline of the testimony
has been prepared and approved by counsel.                   It can be predicted that a three
week delay now may well reduce the time the tribunal sits by at least an
equal period.


Accordingly I would-wioh-to -approach the Chief Constable of West Midlands

       realised by yourself to counsel and Superintendent Fell after the
conclusion o7~T*e«^eeting, concern must be felt as to whether a fair hearing
of the charge against Sup^l-iatendent Murray can take place if such an
important witness as ex-Chief Superlntwuient Duckenfield is not available
to give his testimony.            To this must be added tH5^4a£ormation that Inspector

Under separate cover I am writing to Brigadier Pownall about the matters
discussed at our meeting on 29 November 1991, this letter, however, deals
with a distinct aspect of the disciplinary process against: Superintendent
Murray which is outside the ambit of the team preparing the presentation
against that officer.

Now that Chief Superintendent Duckenfield cannot in any likelihoou be brought
before a disciplinary hearing, it might be argued that it would >e contrary
to natural justice to proceed against Superintendent Murray alone.       Some
will always see Mr Duckenfield as the prime mover in the disaster and these
individuals will take no comfort from proceedings against Mr Murray whatever
the result may be.     Likewise, others would consider it unjust to bring
action against Mr Murray when Mr Duckenfield will not be called to account.
Some will question whether a fair hearing can occur when such an important
witness is absent, and will see the tribunal as a means of casting Mr Murray
as scapegoat for the Hillsborough Disaster.

Having regard to these concerns, it would be remiss of me not to request
that you consider exercising your powers under Section 93(7) of the Police
and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, to enable you to decide on the merits of
the case as    to whether ornot proceedings against Superintendent Murray
should now be halted.    Should you decide to exercise these powers, I will
ensure a fully reasoned response.

I hope that    I do not need to reassure you that the preparation for the
tribunal isproceeding with expedition      and rigour, it would nowever be
less than fair of me not to avail you of the opportunity offered by statute
to consider    at this time whether it      is right to continue with the
disciplinary process against Superintendent Murray.

Following our meeting of 29 November 1991> I am writing under separate cover

to Brigadier Pownall about the progressing of the tribunal.    I felt it wise

to write to you personally about the concern being expressed to me about

whether it is not unfair to proceed further against Superintendent Murray

now that it is not feasible to bring ex-Chief Superintendent Duckenfield

to any hearing.



Accordingly, I would ask that you consider the possibility of exercising

your powers under Section 93(7) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984

to enable you to decide on the merits of the case whether proceedings against

Superintendent Murray should be halted.    Should you decide to do so, I will

ensure a full and expeditious response.



There will be some who will always see Mr Duckenfield as the prime mover

in the disaster and these will take no comfort from proceedings against

Mr Murray whatever the result may be.     Some will consider it unjust to bring

action against Mr Murray when Mr Duckenfield will not be called to account.

Some will question whether a fair hearing can occur when such an important

witness is absent and will see the tribunal as a means of casting Mr Murray

as scapegoat for the Hillsborough disaster.



I would assure you of my firm intention to carry out my responsibilities

with the utmost care, but my misgivings as to the rectitude of the course

upon which we are embarked compel me to make this request at this stage.
DRAFT LETTER FROM ACC TO JUDGE PETRS


At our meeting of 29 November 1991, when the wording of the disciplinary
charge and the way it was proposed to put the case were agreed, Superintendent
Fell produced the original material consisting of the various accounts of
each of the witnesses identified as supporting the charge.    This material
had not previously been seen by Captain Taylor or yourself and I indicated
that I was persuaded by those with detailed knowledge of it that this material
was unsuitable for the purposes of the tribunal and that there was a need
for signed statements of evidence to be obtained from these witnesses.     I
said that I would make written request for the Authority to continue
supervising this further evidence gathering and I do so now make that request.


I told you it has ever been my intention in the unique circumstances of the
Hillsborough Tragedy to consult with and invite the participation of the
Police Complaints Authority in the decision making at all stages in the
process.   Accordingly I would like to set out what I see as the position
 and invite your comment on how I propose to progress matters, although I
 recognise that the responsibility for the conduct of proceedings, in
 accordance with Section 93(5) of the Act rests with me.


 As a fundamental consideration it is prudent to assume that Superintendent
 Murray will defend the charge with vigour and will require strict legal
 obligations to be scrupulously discharged.    There is a possibility that he
 will waive his rights and co-operate in a procedure that does not perfectly
 correspond with what is laid down by Regulations and what is set out in the
 Guidance, but I consider it would be wrong to plan the conduct of affairs
 in anticipation of this possibility.


 You indicated that the Police Complaints Authority takes the view that the
 discipline form could be served on Superintendent Murray, together with the
 names of witnesses in support of the charge and with copies of those accounts
 they have given.   This is notwithstanding that the accounts are not in the
 form of proper statements, do not include what was additionally said at the




                                        - 1-
Enquiry or the Inquest and some do not contain the evidence needed to support
the charge.   You found it acceptable that the procedure by which it is
possible in accordance with Regulation 19 to adduce written testimony will
not thus be available to the tribunal.   You suggested that counsel should
present the case by examining each witness at the tribunal as to his evidence
without precise foreknowledge of what that evidence would be.


On advice I incline not to follow this suggested course of conduct for a
number of reasons, not least because it seems to me to be unfair to the
accused officer.   I am mindful that Annex H of the Home Office Guidance sets
out particularly at Paragraph 12 under the heading, "Rights of the accused
officer" the clear principle that, "the accused officer must be presented
with copies of the evidence."   By Paragraph 18 of Section 9 he, "should be
given adequate duty time to prepare his defence."    It is surely true that
he cannot sensibly make decisions as to plea, legal representation or defence
unless he has opportunity to consider beforehand the evidence against him
and if appropriate have time to gather and marshall evidence to contravert
it.


I am of the view, therefore, that from each witness to be used in support
of the charge a statement must be obtained in a proper format, signed, dated
and witnessed setting down without ambiguity the relevant evidence he can
give and avoiding extraneous material.    A smoother, shorter and less stressful
tribunal hearing can occur from the provision of such statements for the
possibility of the tribunal becoming weighed down by technical legal arguments
as to whether the accused officer’s right to a fair hearing has been
compromised will be removed.    The possibilities of an embarrassing adjournment
to rectify the situation of* a subsequent appeal on these grounds will be
avoided.   Above all South Yorkshire Police will be seen to have conducted
a thorough, wholehearted and professionally prepared presentation.


In the report of the investigation submitted to you by Mr Sharp, the
indication was given that the investigation so far carried out was incomplete
for the purposes of proceedings and the mechanics of now taking statements




                                      -2 -
may alert the public to this shortcoming.    Although it is regrettable that
the statements were not taken before, the task is an unavoidable pre-requisite
of the Tribunal.


Such statements ought to be taken by police officers.    I am concerned,
however, that the task should not be carried out by members of South Yorkshire
Police since I would seek to avoid any accusation that influence had been
used on any witness.   This was a point made by Captain Taylor at the meeting
and I wholeheartedly agree that the statement taking needs careful handling.
I would be anxious, for instance, that it was done as an initiative of the
presenter rather than as evidence gathering instigated on behalf of the
accused officer.   It seems best that this work should proceed under the
supervision of the Police Complaints Authority.    Probably the work could
be completed in about three weeks as the research into what evidence each
witness may be able to supply has been done and an outline of the testimony
has been prepared and approved by counsel.    It can be predicted that a three
week delay now may well reduce the time the tribunal sits by at least an
equal period.


Accordingly I would wish to approach the Chief Constable of West Midlands
Police and ask that this work be done by his officers in co-operation with
counsel and under the supervision of the Authority.     It would be helpful
if I could indicate that this proposal had your prior agreement.


As vocalised by yourself to counsel and Superintendent Fell after the
conclusion of the meeting, concern must be felt as to whether a fair hearing
of the charge against Superintendent Murray can take place if such an
important witness as ex-Chief Superintendent Duckenfield is not available
to give his testimony.   To this must be added the information that Inspector
White is probably too ill to give evidence and Mr Guest and Constable Lang
are deceased.
                                                                                 V
                                                                                 %
I do not know whether the concern you expressed respecting the                   %
non-availability of ex-Chief Superintendent Duckenfield indicates that you




                                     - 3 -

are giving consideration to exercising the Authority's power under Section
93(6)(a) of the Act.   Should you request it, in accordance with sub-section
7 of that section, I will be pleased to furnish you with whatever other
information I can give about the circumstances of this case.   Meanwhile I
shall take no action to set in train the task of obtaining the required
statements until I receive your response to my request.

I am forwarding herewith a copy of the discipline charge In relation
to Superintendent Murray, the wording of which has been prepared by
Counsel. Inclosed also Is a copy of a working paper prepared by
Superintendent Pell. It can be seen that there are a number of witnesses
whom It Is felt should be asked to make further statements for the
purposes of the hearing for reasons mentioned In Mr Fell's earlier paper.

These matters will no doubt be raised In our discussions on Friday.
                           Superintendent Murray




On 15th April 1989 being a member of the South Yorkshire Police Force

you did without good and sufficient cause neglect or omit to carry out

to and carry out viz:   you failed to take action for the direction of

the movement of supporters who entered Hillsborough football stadium

Sheffield through gate "C" in order to ensure the safety of persons within

the said stadium.

PROOF OF THE ELEMENTS OF CASE AGAINST MURRAY


This paper sets out in more detail the factors making up each
element of the evidence.  It details the witnesses who can give
that evidence.  Frequently the admissions by Superintendent Murray
shown in the transcript of his evidence given to the inquest touch
on these factors.  References to the admissions though of extreme
importance to the presentation are not always included in this
paper which was prepared for the assembly of witness statement
evidence.

A comparison of the evidence itemised here for a named witness
with the material contained in the DPP report gives an indication
of the problem facing the presentation.

It is worth mentioning that for each point of evidence the names
of all witnesses who can most obviously prove the point are
included, although in the event it is to be anticipated that often
only one of these witnesses would be relied upon.

1.    Where is the duty?

2.    It was someone else's duty namely Duckenfield's giving an
      exceptional order in exceptional circumstances.

3.    He could state that he believed that Duckenfield in the
       3 to 3f minutes was considering all the ramifications of
       giving the order and any consequential orders or
       directions.

4.    What occurred was not a foreseeable consequence of the
      order.

5.    He was busy attending to other areas once he had passed
       the request to Duckenfield for Duckenfield's
       consideration.  He was relieving Duckenfield of all other
       matters.

6.    He did not appreciate the likely route Gate 'C' to
       the tunnel.

7.    Is a failure to recognise a problem a neglect of duty?      To
       omit or neglect do you have to know or understand?

8.    Looks up sees steady entrance of fans for f a minute, then
      returns to other matters, looks again, flood of people,
      too late to take action.

9.    Unique occurrence, no previous practical experience or
       instruction to help him deal with it.

10.   Plan to blame.

11.   Others failed who should have used initiative - eg 4
       Policemen stood against the wall on the concourse,
       Inspector White present.

12.   Surprised by the entry of so many through Gate 'C* -   no
      visible pressure at Gate 'C' prior to the opening.

13.   No training in how to recognise overcrowding.

14.   View of pens 3 and 4 has its difficulties.

15.   Could he have expected the crowd to turn back if 3 and 4
       pens full, rather than to try and push their way in.

ORDER


Prior to the match day a police operational order had been
promulgated by Chief Supt Duckenfield who was in personal
command of the policing for this event.    The order detailed
Supt Murray to be "in overall control" of the control room
located in the police control box at the stadium.


The control room was "to oversee the entire operation and
will operate both UHF and VHF channels."    The nerve centre
for police control is the control room, which is very small
and has seats for only 3 officers.


ROLE


Before the event Chief Supt Duckenfield had said that he
intended to spend most of the time in the control room
where he would oversee events.    At the semi final in I988
when Superintendent Murray was also in control of the
control room, the then Chief Superintendent Mr Mole had
adopted a more roving style of command.


Supt Murray stated at the Inquest, "I saw my role as sort
of monitoring the event as a whole, being responsible for
the reception of and the transmission of all radio
communications and saw myself as advisor to Mr Duckenfield."


In his disciplinary interview it was put to Supt Murray
that he had responsibility and overall commmand of the
control room to which he replied, "Yes, Mr Duckenfield
was in overall command of the event.    My job as I saw it
in the control room, overseeing the event, making
arrangements for reception of all communications and acting
on the information received.”    Acting upon the information
                    received included making operational decisions as the
                    following interchange illustrates:


INQ D2 19G to 20C   Q - "So far as the role you were playing was concerned
                          according to Mr Mole it did not change even when he
                         was there because you would still have the
                         responsibility for making various operational
                         decisions."


                    A - "Yes that is correct."


                    Q - "As long as your decisions were within your operational
                         responsibility you would not need, even if he was there,
                         to go back to him to ask his permission to do
                         something."


                    A - "No."


                    Q - "One of the things that you would have responsibility
                         for doing and the ability to do without asking his
                         permission was to move men from one place to another
                         as you felt fit."


                    A - "Yes."


INQ D2 20D          In the course of the dialogue the relative responsibilities
                    of overall commander and control room commander in the
                    context of a major decision such as an evacuation due to
                    a bomb scare were put in these terms.


                    Q   - "I Mr Mole, would be the one to make the decision   as
                         to whether to evacuate, the major decision, but then
                         I would leave it up to Mr Murray or whoever was doing
                         Mr Murray's job at that time who would then take




                                       - 2 -
     consequential decisions."   Supt Murray agreed with
     that proposition.


This becomes important at a later stage in the Inquest
when the following dialogue occurs


Q - "You would have had, would you not, full authority
     to do whatever you considered necessary at that stage
     to avert any risk to anybody in the ground as a result
     of opening the gates."


A   -"Yes."


Q   -"In the same way as Mr Mole was telling us had he made
     the decision there should be an evacuation as a result
     of a bomb scare and you would have taken consequential
     decisions, in this situation you had the authority
     to do what you considered would be necessary."


A - "Yes I would have."


In his disciplinary interview matters were described as
follows:-


Q - "You are obviously in control of the officers within
    that room (Control Room)."


A - "Yes."


Q - "Radio communications, decisions being made at that
    stage coming in requests being made.   Do you put
    yourself even with Mr Duckenfield in position as the
    person who responds or makes the decision to agree
                       to, for example a request for the Land Rover that that
                       went with the tannoy?


                  A ~ "If the request is to do with the movement of manpower,
                       and specific requests then yes that's down to me."


                  Q - "And that's what you performed on that day?"


                  A - "Yes."


                  Q - "Were there any, was there the occasion within that
                      control room environment when the command structure
                      was difficult because Mr Duckenfield was with you?"


                  A - "I don't think so.     There were certain sorts of requests
                      that came in which would have been referred to him,
                      whether he'd been in the control room environment or
                      elsewhere and I refer specifically to sort of opening
                      of the gates which is not a decision that I would have
                      taken at the request of a fellow Superintendent."


                      Having dealt with the role of Superintendent Murray
                      in the control room I now turn to the build-up of the
                      tragedy.


                  BUILD-UP OF TRAGEDY


INQ D2 52D        He knew that there were 7 turnstiles for about 10,100
                  spectators for the Leppings Lane terraces.


INQ D2 60C to E   He was aware that at 2.17 Supt Marshall had requested the
                  closure of Leppings Lane which he regarded as an unusual
                  request and he knew that the request "was to do with the
                  number of people in Leppings Lane."




                                 -   H   -
INQ D2   62D   At 2.30 he could see that there was a large crowd outside
               the turnstiles. At that time with only J an hour to go
               to kick off he could see clear spaces in the wing pens
               of the West Leppings Lane terraces compared with the centre
               pens.


INQ D2   48F   He was able to look out of the window of the control room
               to view the state of the Leppings Lane terraces, which
INQ D3   26G   he said afforded a good view.


INQ D2   47B   He was aware that at league matches, in particular the
               match on 14 January 1989 when Liverpool had played at
               Hillsborough that a specific order had been given to serial
               10   to ensure pens were filled in accordance with
INQ D2   43D   instructions from control, they were filled sequentially.
               This was not the case for the all ticket semi final, but
               his understanding was that the police had a role to play
               as regards the distribution of spectators across the
               Leppings Lane terraces.


INQ D2 71B     By 2.48 he could see that there were a lot more spectators
               in the centre pens than the side pens.


INQ D1   69B   About 2.40 pm he got a call from the mounted police
               Inspector, outside the stadium at the Leppings Lane end
               asking for more horses. At this time PC Bichard in the
               control box focussed the camera on the crowd and Supt Murray
               could see that the crowd was a lot denser than his earlier
               perception of it had been, it was getting quite compact.
               He deployed a serial to the Leppings Lane end to give what
               assistance they could.




                                - 5 -
INQ D1 70 B/C    There was a request by Supt Marshall for a PA accouncement
                 to Leppings Lane.    PC Buxton announced over the radio that
                 he was on his way to Leppings Lane in the land rover.


INQ D1 70E      At about this time 2.44/2.45 Supt Murray noticed that the
                 rate of flow of spectators through the turnstiles was less
INQ D3 10 E&F   than he considered it should have been, the crowd did not
                 seem to be moving, there seemed to be a problem behind
                 A to G turnstiles so he unsuccessfully tried to get in
                 touch with Mr Lock the Security Officer of the Club by
                 the Club's radio.


INQ D3   10D    At 2.47 the time of Supt Marshall's first request for the
                 gates to be opened, he agreed that on the monitor screen
                 at this time that the number of people who were outside
                 the Leppings Lane end did not look as though they were
                 going to get in by 3 o'clock, the numbers looked too large. •


                 After Supt Marshall's first request to open the gates Supt
INQ D1 74G      Murray's attention was drawn by PC    Bichard to the monitor
                 screen and he could see that people were coming in through
                Gate 'C', possibly 200 came through, the situation was
                 then recovered by the police.


INQ D1 73F      Supt Marshall repeated his request   for the gates to be
                opened, if not people were going to be hurt or killed.
                Supt Murray regarded Supt Marshall as an extremely
                experienced officer, there had obviously been no improvement
                in the situation, they couldn't wait any longer and so
                eventually he said to Chief Supt Duckenfield, "Are we going
INQ D1 74E      to open the gates."   He said, "Yes open the gates."   Sgt
                Goddard in the control box who is very reactive said on
                the radio, "Open the gates, open the gates."




                                -6 -
INQ D2     75D   Supt Murray maintained that Gate 'C' was opened when the
                  instruction was sent through.


INQ D2     80E   He could not recall asking himself the question, "Where
INQ D2     81E   are these these people going to go when we open the gates",
                  he did not consider they were going to go in any particular
                  direction.


INQ D2     77C   He did not give any instructions to receive or direct people
                 who came through the gates nor did he give instructions
                 to close the tunnel.


INQ D2   76G     He didn't think anyone was given specific instructions
                  to receive the people coming in.


INQ D2 86C       At the Inquest he confirmed that he knew that the centre
                 pens were the most popular.


INQ D2 86B       He knew that there was a centre tunnel which led onto the
                 West terraces.


INQ D2 83G       What he claimed not to know was the relationship of Gate
                  'C' to that centre tunnel. He said, "I can see that now,
                 but at the time I couldn't draw the sort of route that
                 people coming through an unexpected exit gate would take
                 when they got into the ground.    I didn't know that end
                 of the ground that intimately."


INQ D2 86F       After the order to "open the gates" was given he saw that
INQ D2   87 A    the gate (Gate 'C') was open and that a lot of people came
                 through the gates. He did not know for how long he noticed
                 this on the monitor screen.




                                  - 7 -
It is known that Gate 'C' was directly opposite the tunnel
leading to the centre pens   3   and 4 which by all accounts
were well populated if not already full.     Above the tunnel
in large letters was the word "Standing" and many spectators
took what must to them have seemed to be the obvious route
to the terraces. The signs to go to the wing pens to the
right of Gate 'C' were relatively inconspicuous, to go
to the wing pens to the left of Gate 'C' they would have
had to go through a gap in the wall which divided the
concourse, signing in this direction was non-existent.
Without direction and without knowledge of the ground layout
spectators were likely simply to go forward to the tunnel
to the already crowded centre pens.


The presentation submits that Supt Murray failed to consider
where the spectators would go consequent on this major
change in the operational order and thereby failed to make
any provision for the direction of movement of those fans
either by informing Chief Supt Duckenfield of the necessity
to do so, or giving orders himself.     He failed both prior
to the giving of the order and later when the order had
been given to deal with the consequences of such order.
He did not seek guidance from, eg Chief Insp Creaser, Supt
Greenwood as to what the likely effect of such order was
or indeed to warn them it was being considered, was about
to be or indeed had been given.


At the Inquest he agreed with the proposition, "You would
have had would you not, full authority to do whatever you
considered necessary at that stage to avert any risk to
anybody in the ground as a result of opening the gates."


Just as with the situation following an order to evacuate
the ground because of a bomb scare he could have taken
•
           consequential decisions, the same applied with the order
           to open the gates, he would not have needed Chief Supt
           Duckenfield to tell him what to do.


    P2°9   Perhaps the situation is summed up in his disciplinary
           interview when he said, "All I would say that my aim as
           far as I was concerned was to remove the danger that existed
           outside the ground and the opening of the gates obviously
           relieved that, but caused problems that I didn't forsee
           at the time." His failures the presentation submit amounted
           to a neglect of his duty.

 ORDER



Prior to the match day a police operational order had been
 promulgated by Chief Supt Duckenfield who was in personal
 command of the policing for this event.   The order detailed
Supt Murray to be "in overall control" of the control room
 located in the police control box at the stadium.


The control room was "to oversee the entire operation and
will operate both UHF and VHF channels."   The nerve centre
for police control is the control room, which is very small
and has seats for only 3 officers.


ROLE


Before the event Chief Supt Duckenfield had said that he
intended to spend most of the time in the control room
where he would oversee events.   At the semi final in   1988

when Superintendent Murray was also in control of the
control room, the then Chief Superintendent Mr Mole had
adopted a more roving style of command.


Supt Murray stated at the Inquest, "I saw my role as sort
of monitoring the event as a whole, being responsible for
the reception of and the transmission of all radio
communications and saw myself as advisor to Mr Duckenfield."


In his disciplinary interview it was put to Supt Murray
that he had responsibility and overall commmand of the
control room to which he replied, "Yes, Mr Duckenfield
was in overall command of the event.   My job as I saw it
in the control room, overseeing the event, making
arrangements for reception of all communications and acting
on the information received." Acting upon the information
                    received included making operational decisions as the
                    following interchange illustrates:


INQ D2 19G to 20C   Q - "So far as the role you were playing was concerned
                        according to Mr Mole it did not change even when he
                        was there because you would still have the
                        responsibility for making various operational
                        decisions."


                    A - "Yes that is correct."


                    Q - "As long as your decisions were within your operational
                        responsibility you would not need, even if he was there,
                        to go back to him to ask his permission to do
                        something."


                    A - "No."


                    Q - "One of the things that you would have responsibility
                        for doing and the ability to do without asking his
                        permission was to move men from one place to another
                        as you felt fit."


                    A - "Yes."


CNQ D2 20D          in the course of the dialogue the relative responsibilities
                    of overall commander and control room commander in the
                    context of a major decision such as an evacuation due to
                    a bomb scare were put in these terms.


                    Q - "I Mr Mole, would be the one to make the decision as
                        to whether to evacuate, the major decision, but then
                        I would leave it up to Mr Murray or whoever was doing
                       Mr Murray's job at that time who would then take




                                      - 2 -
    consequential decisions." Supt Murray agreed with
    that proposition.


This becomes important at a later stage in the Inquest
when the following dialogue occurs


Q - "You would have had, would you not, full authority
    to do whatever you considered necessary at that stage
    to avert any risk to anybody in   the ground as a result
    of opening the gates."


A - "Yes."


Q - "In the same way as Mr Mole was   telling us had he made
    the decision there should be an   evacuation as a result
    of a bomb scare and you would have taken consequential
    decisions, in this situation you had the authority
    to do what you considered would be necessary."


A - "Yes I would have."


In his disciplinary interview matters were described as
follows


Q - "You are obviously in control of the officers within
    that room (Control Room)."


A - "Yes."


Q - "Radio communications, decisions being made at that
    stage coming in requests being made.   Do you put
   yourself even with Mr Duckenfield in position as the
   person who responds or makes the decision to agree
                          to, for example a request for the Land Rover that that
                          went with the tannoy?


                    A —           request is to do with the movement of manpower,
                          and specific requests then yes that's down to me."

P54                Q - "And that's what you performed on that day?"


                   A - "Yes."


                   Q - "Were there any, was there the occasion within that
                          control room environment when the command structure
                          was difficult because Mr Duckenfield was with you?"


                   A - "I don't think so.     There were certain sorts of requests
                          that came in which would have been referred to him,
                          whether he'd been in the control room environment or

                          taken at the request of a fellow Superintendent."


                          Having dealt with the role of Superintendent Murray
                          in the control room I now turn to the build-up of the
                          tragedy.

                experienced officer, there had obviously been no improvement
                in the situation, they couldn't wait any longer and so
                eventually he said to Chief Supt Duckenfield, "Are we going
INQ D1 74E      to open the gates."    He said, "Yes open the gates."   Sgt
                Goddard in the control box who is very reactive said on
                the radio, "Open the gates, open the gates."
INQ D2     75D   Supt Murray maintained that Gate "C* was opened when the
                  instruction was sent through.


INQ D2     80E   He could not recall asking himself the question, "Where
INQ D2     81E   are these these people going to go when we open the gates",
                  he did not consider they were going to go in any particular
                  direction.


INQ D2     77C   He did not give any instructions to receive or direct people
                  who came through the gates nor did he give instructions
                  to close the tunnel.


INQ D2   76 G    He didn't think anyone was given specific instructions
                     receive the people coming in.


INQ D2   86C     At the Inquest he confirmed that he knew that the centre
                 pens were the most popular.


INQ D2   86B     He knew that there was a centre tunnel which led onto the
                 West terraces.


INQ D2 83G       What he claimed not to know was the relationship of Gate
                  'C' to that centre tunnel. He said, "I can see that now,
                 but at the time I couldn't draw the sort of route that
                 people coming through an unexpected exit gate would take
                 when they got into the ground.    I didn't know that end
                 of the ground that intimately."


INQ D2   86F     After the order to "open the gates" was given he saw that
INQ D2 87A       the gate (Gate 'C') was open and that a lot of people came
                 through the gates. He did not know for how long he noticed
                 this on the monitor screen.




                                  - 7 -
•
                 It is known that Gate ' C ' was directly opposite the tunnel
                 leading to the centre pens 3 and 4 which by all accounts
                 were well populated if not already full.   Above the tunnel
                 in large letters was the word "Standing" and many spectators
                 took what must to them have seemed to be the obvious route
                 to the terraces. The signs to go to the wing pens to the
                 right of Gate "C' were relatively inconspicuous, to go
                 to the wing pens to the left of Gate 'C' they would have
                 had to go through a gap in the wall which divided the
                 concourse, signing in this direction was non-existent.
                 Without direction and without knowledge of the ground layout
                 spectators were likely simply to go forward to the tunnel
                 to the already crowded centre pens.


                 The presentation submits that Supt Murray failed to consider
                 where the spectators would go consequent on this major
                 change in the operational order and thereby failed to make
                 any provision for the direction of movement of those fans
                 either by informing Chief Supt Duckenfield of the necessity
                 to do so, or giving orders himself.   He failed both prior
                 to the giving of the order and later when the order had
                 been given to deal with the consequences of such order.
                 He did not seek guidance from, eg Chief Insp Creaser, Supt
                 Greenwood as to what the likely effect of such order was
                 or indeed to warn them it was being considered, was about
                 to be or indeed had been given.


    INQ D2 31B   At the Inquest he agreed with the proposition, "You would
                 have had would you not, full authority to do whatever you
                 considered necessary at that stage to avert any risk to
                 anybody in the ground as a result of opening the gates."


                 Just as with the situation following an order to evacuate
    INQ D2 31C   the ground because of a bomb scare he could have taken




                                - 8 -
consequential decisions, the same applied with the order
to open the gates, he would not have needed Chief Supt
Duckenfield to tell him what to do.


Perhaps the situation is summed up in his disciplinary
interview when he said, "All I would say that my aim as
far as I was concerned was to remove the danger that existed
outside the ground and the opening of the gates obviously
relieved that, but caused problems that I didn't forsee
at the time." His failures the presentation submit amounted
to a neglect of his duty.
              ORDER


              Prior to the match day a police operational order had been
              promulgated by Chief Supt Duckenfield who was in personal
              command of the policing for this event.     The order detailed
              Supt Murray to be "in overall control" of the control room
              located in the police control box at the stadium.


              The control room was "to oversee the entire operation and
              will operate both UHF and VHF channels." The nerve centre
              for police control is the control room, which is very small
              and has seats for only   3   officers.


              ROLE


INQ D1 67A   Before the event Chief Supt Duckenfield had said that he
              intended to spend most of the time in the control room
             where he would oversee events. At the semi final in 1988
             when Superintendent Murray was also in control of the
              control room, the then Chief Superintendent Mr Mole had
              adopted a more roving style of command.


INQ D2 22F   Supt Murray stated at the Inquest, "I saw my role as sort
             of monitoring the event as a whole, being responsible for
             the reception of and the transmission of all radio
             communications and saw myself as advisor to Mr Duckenfield."


50           In his disciplinary interview it was put to Supt Murray
             that he had responsibility and overall commmand of the
             control room to which he replied, "Yes, Mr Duckenfield
             was in overall command of the event.      My job as I saw it
             in the control room, overseeing the event, making
             arrangements for reception of all communications and acting
             on the information received." Acting upon the information




                             - 1 -
                    received included making operational decisions as the
                    following interchange illustrates:


INQ D2 19G to 20C   Q - "So far as the role you were playing was concerned
                        according to Mr Mole it did not change even when he
                        was there because you would still have the
                        responsibility for making various operational
                        decisions."


                    A - "Yes that is correct."


                    Q - "As long as your decisions were within your operational
                        responsibility you would not need, even if he was there,
                        to go back to him to ask his permission to do
                        something."


                    A - "No."


                    Q - "One of the things that you would have responsibility
                        for doing and the ability to do without asking his
                        permission was to move men from one place to another
                        as you felt fit."


                    A - "Yes."


INQ D2 20D          In the course of the dialogue the relative responsibilities
                    of overall commander and control room commander in the
                    context of a major decision such as an evacuation due to
                    a bomb scare were put in these terms.


                    Q - "I Mr Mole, would be the one to make thedecision as
                        to whether to evacuate, the major decision, but then
                        I would leave it up to Mr Murray or whoever was doing
                       Mr Murray's job at that time who would then take




                                   - 2 -
     consequential decisions." Supt Murray agreed with
     that proposition.


This becomes important at a later stage in the Inquest
when the following dialogue occurs


Q - "You would have had, would you not, full authority
    to do whatever you considered necessary at that stage
    to avert any risk to anybody in the ground as a result
    of opening the gates."


A - "Yes."


Q - "In the sameway as Mr Mole was telling us had he made
    the decision there should be an evacuation as a result
    of a bomb scare and you would have taken consequential
    decisions, in this situation you had the authority
    to do what you considered would be necessary."


A - "Yes I would have."


In his disciplinary interview matters were described as
follows


Q - "You are obviously in control of the officers within
    that room (Control Room)."


A - "Yes."


Q - "Radio communications, decisions being made at that
    stage coming in requests being made.   Do you put
   yourself even with Mr Duckenfield in position as the
   person who responds or makes the decision to agree
     to, for example a request for the Land Rover that that
     went with the tannoy?


 ^    ^   the request is to do with the movement of manpower,
     and specific requests then yes that's down to me."


 Q - "And that's what you performed on that day?"

 A - "Yes."


Q - "Were there any, was there the occasion within that
     control room environment when the command structure
     was difficult because Mr Duckenfield was with you?"


A - 'I don't think so.     There were certain sorts of requests
     that came in which would have been referred to him,
     whether he'd been in the control room environment or
     elsewhere and I refer specifically to sort of opening
     of the gates which is not a decision that I would have
     taken at the request of a fellow Superintendent."


     Having dealt with the role of Superintendent Murray
     in the control room I now turn to the build-up of the
     tragedy.


BUILD-UP OF TRAGEDY


He knew that there were 7 turnstiles for about 10,100
spectators for the Leppings Lane terraces.


He was aware that at 2.17 Supt Marshall had requested the
  ?sure       Leppings Lane which he regarded as an unusual
request and he knew that the request "was to do with the
number of people in Leppings Lane."
INQ D2 62D     At 2.30 he could see that there was a large crowd outside
               the turnstiles. At that time with only i sin hour to go
               to kick off he could see clear spaces in the wing pens
               of the West Leppings Lane terraces compared with the centre
               pens.


INQ D2   48F   He was able to look out of the window of the control room
                to view the state of the Leppings Lane terraces, which
INQ D3   26G   he said afforded a good view.


INQ D2   47B   He was aware that at league matches, in particular the
               match on 14 January I989 when Liverpool had played at
               Hillsborough that a specific order had been given to serial
               10 to ensure pens were filled in accordance with
INQ D2   43D   instructions from control, they were filled sequentially.
               This was not the case for the all ticket semi final, but
               his understanding was that the police had a role to play
               as regards the distribution of spectators across the
               Leppings Lane terraces.


INQ D2 71B     By 2.48 he could see that there were a lot more spectators
               in the centre pens than the side pens■


INQ D1   69B   About 2.40 pm he got a call from the mounted police
               Inspector, outside the stadium at the Leppings Lane end
               asking for more horses. At this time PC Bichard in the
               control box focussed the camera on the crowd and Supt Murray
               could see that the crowd was a lot denser than his earlier
               perception of it had been, it was getting quite compact.
               He deployed a serial to the Leppings Lane end to give what
               assistance they could.




                               - 5 -
INQ D1 70 B/C   There was a request by Supt Marshall for a PA accouncement
                 to Leppings Lane.    PC Buxton announced over the radio that
                 he was on his way to Leppings Lane in the land rover.

INQ D1 70E      At about this time 2.44/2.45 Supt Murray noticed that the
                rate of flow of spectators through the turnstiles was less
INQ D3 10 E&F   than he considered it should have been, the crowd did not
                seem to be moving, there seemed to be a problem behind
                A to G turnstiles so he unsuccessfully tried to get in
                touch with Mr Lock the Security Officer of the Club by
                the Club's radio.


INQ D3 10D      At 2.47 the time of Supt Marshall's first request for the
                gates to be opened, he agreed that on the monitor screen
                at this time that the number of people who were outside
                the Leppings Lane end did not look as though they were
                going to get in by    3   o'clock, the numbers looked too large.


                After Supt Marshall's first request to open the gates Supt
INQ D1 74G      Murray's attention was drawn by PC Bichard to the monitor
                screen and he could see that people were coming in through
                Gate 'C', possibly 200 came through, the situation was
                then recovered by the police.


INQ D1 73F      Supt Marshall repeated his request for the gates to be
                opened, if not people were going to be hurt or killed.
                Supt Murray regarded Supt Marshall as an extremely
                experienced officer, there had obviously been no improvement
                in the situation, they couldn't wait any longer and so
                eventually he said to Chief Supt Duckenfield, "Are we going
INQ D1 74E      to open the gates."       He said, "Yes open the gates."   Sgt
                Goddard in the control box who is very reactive said on
                the radio, "Open the gates, open the gates."




                                - 6 -
INQ D2    75D    Supt Murray maintained that Gate 'C* was opened when the
                  instruction was sent through.


INQ D2    80E    He could not recall asking himself the question, "Where
INQ D2    8 lE   are these these people going to go when we open the gates",
                  he did not consider they were going to go in any particular
                  direction.


INQ D2     77C   He did not give any instructions to receive or direct people
                 who came through the gates nor did he give instructions
                  to close the tunnel.


INQ D2   76 G    He didn't think anyone was given specific instructions
                 to receive the people coming in.


INQ D2   86C     At the Inquest he confirmed that he knew that the centre
                 pens were the most popular.


INQ D2   86B     He knew that there was a centre tunnel which led onto the
                 West terraces.


INQ D2 83G       What he claimed not to know was the relationship of Gate
                  'C' to that centre tunnel.   Hesaid, "I can see that now,
                 but at the time I couldn'tdraw the    sort of route that
                 people coming through an unexpected exit gate would take
                 when they got into the ground.    I didn't know that end
                 of the ground that intimately."


INQ D2   86F     After the order to "open the gates" was given he saw that
INQ D2   87A     the gate (Gate 'C') was open and that a lot of people came
                 through the gates.   He did   notknow for how long he noticed

1.   The Archbishop of York preaching at the Hillsborough Memorial Service
     on 23 April 1989 said, "Events of the magnitude of Hillsborough don't
     usually happen just for one single reason, nor is it usually possible
     to pin the blame on one single scapegoat...    Disasters happen because
     a whole series of mistakes, miajudgments and mischances happen to come
     together in a deadly combination.


2.   In this whole tragic affair with the benefit of commonsense and hindsight
     there are many who could have done better or performed differently be
     they police officers, officials of Sheffield Wednesday PC, structural
     engineers, officials of the local council and others, nevertheless it
     seems to the writer on consideration of thousands of documents available
     both in his preparation and in his actions on the day Chief
     Superintendent Duckenfield was not for whatever reason up to the role

bereaved who seek disciplinary action, Chief Supt Duckenfield's health
appears to have failed and we will never know whether a tribunal would
have found that such various act* or omissions as were found proved
would have amounted to neglect of duty.

                                                                           *

There remains, however, the position of Superintendent Murray.    I
start by adopting observations made in the report of the West Midlands
Police to the Director of Public Prosecutions.    Chief Superintendent
Duckenfield, the overall match day commander elected to police the event
from the control room in the ground, but according to Supt Murray there
was no confusion in roles.    However, the adoption of this style of
command must to an extent reduce the overall responsibility held by
Supt Murray because decisions are always likely to be made with the
consent of the present Chief Superintendent. However, by the very nature
of his rank Supt Murray would accept responsibility.   Furthermore there
is a duty on every police officer to act promptly if the situation
requires it and the presence of a more senior officer should not hinder
or excuse that requirement.


At 1M7 Supt Marshall asked the police control box for permission to
open the exit gates, an extraordinary action, but one well justified
given the circumstances prevailing at the time.    Two further requests
were made whilst Chief Superintendent Duckenfield was considering the
position.   At this point Supt Murray addressed Chief Supt Duckenfield
saying words to thfe effect, "Are we going to open those gates-1* Perhaps
this is a good example of Supt Murray, although the junior officer,
making his mark in a situation and at a time he felt it necessary.


Nevertheless the fact remains that the decision to open the gates was
not followed by any direct or indirect orders to deal with the 2000
or so fans who for a period of 5 minutes entered the ground.     There
were no stewards or police officers checking or directing them eo the
majority of them made for the tunnel leading to pens 3 and 4.
5.   The earlier opening of Cate 'C' when 180 or so supporters got in did
     not alert him to consider how to cope with a del iberate authorised
     opening of that gate.


     The order given "to open the gates" was directed not to specific police ^
     officers, but in general.      Bearing in mind the inevitable background
     noise close to kick off he could not know who may or may not have heard
     the order and who for that matter might be alerted to be prepared to
     take action consequent upon that order.


6.   Supt Murray was part of the decision making team employed at the s k i
     final.   In overall terms he had some responsibility for the control
     of matters outside the ground as well as inside.      The use and
     availability of the video and communications by radio placed him in
     a position of overall authority with Chief Supt Duckenfield.        It can
     be argued that he should have recognised the dangers inherent in the
     requests being made, especially as he had previous experience of the
     1988 semi final and of the ground.      Furthermore if the conclusion drawn
     by Lord Justice Taylor that Chief Supt Duckenfield "froze’* is fair and
     correct then the question can be asked why Supt Murray did not recognise
      this and step into the breach.


7.   Whilst the writer accepts that the charge against Supt Murray has some
     prospects of success I am concerned as to whether having regard to all
      the circumstances that now obtain that it is just and fair that Supt
     Murray should as it were be seen to face the music alone.      The following

     may be worthy of consideration


      a.   The proceedings might be considered oppressive because of delay.
           There has, of course, been the Taylor Inquiry, the Inquests, and
           the consideration of some of the papers by the Director of Public
           Prosecutions all of which have naturally taken up time-       It is
           now a little over   2*   years since this tragic event, those preparing
           the case for the disciplinary hearing have taken time to get the




                                         - 3 -
matter in order.   There are administrative and evidential
difficulties to overcome-   Time has been expended in thorough
preparation in the hope that this would facilitate in due course
an efficient and thorough presentation of the complaints and keep
the case within reasonable boundaries in the hope that it could
fairly and properly be dealt with both by the presentation and
the defence in a matter of weeks rather than months.     In Chief
Supt Duckenficld's case 5 charges were to be presented ranging
widely over events from when it was first announced that the semi
final would be held at Hillsborough to the time when the match
was stopped as well as later discussions with Mr Kelly and
representatives of the 3 football clubs involved.   It was known
that having regard to the medical information available charges
would not be served upon Chief Supt Duckenfield until his health
improved.   In contrast Mr Murray faces only 1 charge; much of the
preparation time has been consumed by Chief Supt Duckenfield's
alleged shortcomings rather than those of Supt Murray.


A distinction should perhaps be made between making decisions to
move particular resources and having the ability to move them and
making decisions that cause the need to move resources to arise.
It is open to argument that the role of Supt Murray overseeing
the control room staff was to implement the decisions of others.


The force order entitled, "Standing instructions for the policing
of football matches" does not identify the responsibilities of
"match control" much less the officer in charge.    Para 10.1 states,
"The officer in charge of match control should not be of less rank
than Sergeant and be aided by at least 1 police constable.”      This
might suggest that the officer in charge of match control is not
contemplated as a decision maker next in descent from the overall
commander, but rather as an implementer able to carry out the
routine tasks to be associated with a first level supervisor.
The above has even greater, force when put in the context of what
was on any view a major departure from the operational plan, an
exceptional course of action taken in exceptional circumstances.


Chief Superintendent Duckenfield, unlike Supt Murray, has never
co-operated with the disciplinary enquiry as of course was his
right.    Chief Supt Duckenfield will not be at the Tribunal hearing.
The Tribunal will not have the opportunity of contrasting the
testimony of the defendants.    Furthermore, Supt Murray will be
deprived of the opportunity of asking questions of Chief Supt
Duckenfield.


Regard might be had to matters of detail or stances that could
be taken by Supt Murray.


 i.      Having been in the control box in question the writer is
         well aware that Supt Murray had a reasonably good view through
         the windows of the Leppings Lane terracing albeit at an angle,
         but would not have been in a good position to view the screen
         monitors, he would have to crane his neck backwards.


ii.      The time Chief Supt Duckenfield took to make the decision
         to open the gate was probably of the order of 3 to 3i minutes.
         Supt Murray would be entitled to the opinion that Chief Supt
         Duckenfield during this time was thinking about the
         consequences of such a decision and of any follow up
         information or directions to be given consequent upon such

         decision.


         Supt Murray was there to assist, be sounded out or whatever
         if asked, but Chief Supt Duckenfield didn’t ask.   Supt Murray
         reminded him of the need for a decision and it was then taken
         and given out over the radio by PS Goddard.
               Supt Murray had other matters to consider, he was in command
               of the centre of communications for police activity both
               inside and outside the ground, in particular we know at times
               that there was some concern about the behaviour of Liverpool
               fans at the edge of the spion kop which was allocated to
               Notts Forest fans.    He could fairly advance the claim that
               Chief Supt Duckenfield had taken full responsibility for
               this major departure from the plan and would follow it
               through, by for example observing the monitor screen and
               seeing where fans entering the concourse through Gate    C
               went, and taking such further action as may have appeared
               necessary to him.


e.   In terms of moral culpability there is a significant difference
     between the respective roles, acts and omissions on the part of
     Chief Supt Duckenfield and Supt Murray.        If Chief Supt Duckenfield
     is not to be proceeded against then those directing the charge
     a g a in s t   Supt Murray may wish to reflect on the situation and seek
     to balance justice being seen to be done to Supt Murray, the likely
     distress occasioned to some by the inevitable publicity this matter
     will attract and the likely outcome.


f.   If Supt Murray is to be seen as a "scapegoat" by the media and
     many of the public, this would not I suspect assist the bereaved
     with their grief nor be seen as just action by the police against
     one of their number.


     If the charge against Murray is found proved, I anticipate that
     any penalty imposed would be seen by many as totally out of
     proportion to 96 deaths, 1 person lingering on a life support
     machine and many others having endured an horrific experience.
     Sentencing would be difficult, the prime miscreant is Ch Supt
     Duckenfield who has throughout been suspended from duty, on the
     other hand Supt Murray has remained on what might be termed mainline




                                      -6 -
         police duties and performed them satisfactorily.   A reduction in
         rank in such circumstances may not seem appropriate.   If such
         proposition is correct what would the appropriate sentencing option

         be?

The Archbishop of York preaching at the Hillsborough Memorial Service
on 23 April 1989 said, "Events of the magnitude of Hillsborough don't
usually happen just for one single reason, nor is it usually possible
to pin the blame on one single scapegoat...    Disasters happen because
a whole series of mistakes, misjudgments and mischances happen to come
together in a deadly combination.


In this whole tragic affair with the benefit or commonsense and hindsight
there are many who could have done better or performed differently be
they police officers, officials of Sheffield Wednesday FC, structural
engineers, officials of the local council and others, nevertheless it
seems to the writer on consideration of thousands of documents available
both in his preparation and in his actions on the day Chief
Superintendent Duckenfield was not for whatever reason up to the role
of overall match commander at this major sporting event.    Sadly for
Chief Supt Duckenfield, the South Yorkshire Police and those of the

     appears to have failed and we will never know whether a tribunal would
     have found that such various acts or omissions as were found proved
     would have amounted to neglect of duty.


3.   There remains, however, the position of Superintendent Murray.     I
     start by adopting observations made in the report of the West Midlands
     Police to the Director of Public Prosecutions.    Chief Superintendent
     Duckenfield, the overall match day commander elected to police the event
     from the control room in the ground, but according to Supt Murray there
     was no confusion in roles.    However, the adoption of this style of
     command must to an extent reduce the overall responsibility held by
     Supt Murray because decisions are always likely to be made with the
     consent of the present Chief Superintendent.     However, by the very nature
     of his rank Supt Murray would accept responsibility.    Furthermore there
     is a duty on every police officer to act promptly if the situation
     requires it and the presence of a more senior officer should not hinder
     or excuse that requirement.


4.   At 1 M 7 Supt Marshall asked the police control box for permission to
     open the exit gates, an extraordinary action, but one well justified
     given the circumstances prevailing at the time.    Two further requests
     were made whilst Chief Superintendent Duckenfield was considering the
     position.   At this point Supt Murray addressed Chief Supt Duckenfield
     saying words to thfe effect, "Are we going to open those gates."       Perhaps
     this is a good example of Supt Murray, although the junior officer,
     making his mark in a situation and at a time he felt it necessary.


     Nevertheless the fact remains that the decision to open the gates was
     not followed by any direct or indirect orders to deal with the 2000
     or so fans who for a period of 5 minutes entered the ground.     There
     were no stewards or police officers checking or directing them so the
     majority of them made for the tunnel leading to pens 3 and *t.




                                      -2 -
5.   The earlier opening of Gate *C* when 180 or so supporters got in did
     not alert him to consider how to cope with a deliberate authorised
     opening of that gate.

     The order given "to open the gates" was directed not to specific police ^
     officers, but in general.    Bearing in mind the inevitable background
     noise close to kick off he could not know who may or may not have heard
     the order and who for that matter might be alerted to be prepared to
     take action consequent upon that order.


6.   Supt Murray was part of the decision making team employed at the semi
     final.   In overall terms he had some responsibility for the control
     of matters outside the ground as well as inside.    The use and
     availability of the video and communications by radio placed him in
     a position of overall authority with Chief Supt Duckenfield.      It can
     be argued that he should have recognised the dangers inherent in the
     requests being made, especially as he had previous experience of the
     1988 semi final and of the ground.    Furthermore if the conclusion drawn
     by Lord Justice Taylor that Chief Supt Duckenfield "froze" is fair and
     correct then the question can be asked why Supt Murray did not recognise
     this and step into the breach.


7.   Whilst the writer accepts that the charge against Supt Murray has some
     prospects of success I am concerned as to whether having regard to all
     the circumstances that now obtain that it is just and fair that Supt
     Murray should as it were be seen to face the music alone.    The following

     may be worthy of consideration


     a.   The proceedings might   U considered oppressive becwise of delay.
          There has, of course, been the Taylor Inquiry, the inquests, and
           the consideration of some of the papers by the Director of Public
           Prosecutions all of which have naturally taken up time.     It is
           now a little over 2* years since this tragic event, those preparing
           the case for the disciplinary hearing have taken time to get the




                                       - 3 -
     matter in order.   There are administrative and evidential
     difficulties to overcome.   Time has been expended in thorough
     preparation in the hope that this would facilitate in due course
     an efficient and thorough presentation of the complaints and keep
     the case within reasonable boundaries in the hope that it could
     fairly and properly be dealt with both by the presentation and
     the defence in a matter of weeks rather than months.      In Chief
     Supt Duckenfield's case 5 charges were to be presented ranging
     widely over events from when it was first announced that the semi
     final would be held at Hillsborough to the time when the match
     was stopped as well as later discussions with Mr Kelly and
     representatives of the 3 football clubs involved.      It was known
     that having regard to the medical information available charges
     would not be served upon Chief Supt Duckenfield until his health
     improved.   In contrast Mr Murray faces only 1 charge; much of the
     preparation time has been consumed by Chief Supt Duckenfield's
     alleged shortcomings rather than those of Supt Murray.


b.   A distinction should perhaps be made between making decisions to
     move particular resources and having the ability to move them and
     making decisions that cause the need to move resources to arise.
     It is open to argument that the role of Supt Murray overseeing
     the control room staff was to implement the decisions of others.


     The force order entitled, "Standing instructions for the policing
     of football matches" does not identify   th e   responsibilities of
     "match control" much less the officer in charge.      Para 10.1 states,
     "The officer in charge of match control should not be of less rank
     than Sergeant and be aided by at least 1 police constable,” Thir
     might suggest that the officer in charge of match control is not
     contemplated as a decision maker next in descent from the overall
     commander, but rather as an implementer able to carry out the
     routine tasks to be associated with a first level supervisor.
The above has even greater, force when put in the context of what
was on any view a major departure from the operational plan, an
exceptional course of action taken in exceptional circumstances.


Chief Superintendent Duckenfield, unlike Supt Murray, has never
co-operated with the disciplinary enquiry as of course was his
right.    Chief Supt Duckenfield will not be at the Tribunal hearing.
The Tribunal will not have the opportunity of contrasting the
testimony of the defendants.     Furthermore, Supt Murray will be
deprived of the opportunity of asking questions of Chief Supt
                                                                        •

Duckenfield.


Regard might be had to matters of detail or stances that could
be taken by Supt Murray.


 i.      Having been in the control box in question the writer is
         well aware that Supt Murray had a reasonably good view through
         the windows of the Leppings Lane terracing albeit at an angle,
         but would not have been in a good position to view the screen
         monitors, he would have to crane his neck backwards.


ii.      The time Chief Supt Duckenfield took to make the decision
         to open the gate was probably of the order of   3   to   3i   minutes.
         Supt Murray would be entitled to the opinion that Chief Supt
         Duckenfield during this time was thinking about the
         consequences of such a decision and of any follow up
         information or directions to be given consequent upon such
         decision.


         Supt Murray was there to assist, be sounded out or whatever
         if asked, but Chief Supt Duckenfield didn’t ask.     Supt Murray
         reminded him of the need for a decision and it was then taken
         and given out over the radio by PS Goddard.
     Supt Murray had other matters to consider, he was in command
     of the centre of communications for police activity both
     inside and outside the ground, in particular we know at times
     that there was some concern about the behaviour of Liverpool
     fans at the edge of the spion kop which was allocated to
     Notts Forest fans.   He could fairly advance the claim that
     Chief Supt Duckenfield had taken full responsibility for
     this major departure from the plan and would follow it
     through, by for example observing the monitor screen and
     seeing where fans entering the concourse through Gate ’C’
     went, and taking such further action as may have appeared
     necessary to him.


In terms of moral culpability there is a significant difference
between the respective roles, acts and omissions on the part of
Chief Supt Duckenfield and Supt Murray.   If Chief Supt Duckenfield
is not to be proceeded against then those directing the charge
against Supt Murray may wish to reflect on the situation and seek
to balance justice being seen to be done to Supt Murray, the likely
distress occasioned to some by the inevitable publicity this matter
will attract and the likely outcome.


If Supt Murray is to be seen as a "scapegoat" by the media and
many of the public, this would not I suspect assist the bereaved
with their grief nor be seen as just action by the police against
one of their number.


If the charge against Murray is found proved, I anticipate that
any penalty imposed would be seen by many as totally out of
proportion to 96 deaths, 1 person lingering on a life support
machine and many others having endured an horrific experience.
Sentencing would be difficult, the prime miscreant is Ch Supt
Duckenfield who has throughout been suspended from duty, on the
other hand Supt Murray has remained on what might be termed mainline
         police duties and performed them satisfactorily.   A reduction in
         rank in such circumstances may not seem appropriate.   If such
         proportion is correct what would the appropriate sentencing option

         be?

Dear Brigadier Pownall,

Further to ray telephone conversation of 29 October 1991 with Mr P
Moorhouse, I am writing to you to confirm that the Chief Constable has
decided that Chief Superintendent Duckenfield will be medically retired
frc« the South Yorkshire Police with effect from 11 November 1991.

In order to progress the matters raised in my letter to you dated 24
October 1991. it would be useful for us to meet and discuss the relevant
issues as soon as possible.

Yours faithfully.




Brian L Mole
Chief Superintendent
For the Assistant Chief Constable
Discipline and Complaints
RICHARD WELLS, CHIEF CONSTABLE OF SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE, says

al understand Trevor Hicks’ and the families’ se n se of impatience.     The 96 deaths

resulting from the Hillsborough tragedy are constantly on our minds and we share the

grief of those bereaved. Strong feelings like this have still to submit themselves to the

processes of the world of legal detail.



From the moment when the South Yorkshire Police were directed by the Police

Complaints Authority to prefer charges against Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield

and Superintendent Bernard Murray, we have let no grass grow under our feet.

Immediately, in our role of preparing the case for a tribunal, we instructed counsel to

prepare the evidence and draw up the charges. We have appointed a dedicated team

of officers to assist counsel.    The evidence for consideration consists of 4,000

statements and reports, 8,000 questionnaires, 3,900 other documents, hundreds of

photographs and video tapes, and transcripts of 84 days of evidence given to the

Taylor Inquiry and the Inquest.



Provisional steps have been taken for the tribunal to begin at Sheffield Town Hall

during March 1992. However, it is very difficult for anyone to finalise arrangements

for the hearing while the details of charges have yet to be agreed between the South

Yorkshire Police and the Police Complaints Authority.            There is the further

complication of Chief Superintendent Duckenfield’s illness. As with anybody else

facing legal proceedings, he has to be well enough for the charges to be served on

him and well enough to assist in the preparation of his own defence.
The assessm ent of Chief Superintendent Duckenfield’s illness is not a matter for police

officers, it is a matter of medical advice. He was seen on Tuesday 22 October by a

police staff surgeon. We await the staff surgeon’s report and will be guided by the

findings. This is a process which has been followed in exactly the same way with

several officers suffering ill health in the aftermath of Hillsborough.



Referral of a patient for further medical advice would be subject to the professional

judgement of the staff surgeon.



In terms of commonsense and equity, the absence of Chief Superintendent

Duckenfield from his own tribunal because of illness is unacceptable. I must say that

in the light of the two years of statements emerging from Merseyside, the thought that

Trevor Hicks and the Hillsborough Families Support Group wish to spare David

Duckenfield ttie rigours of the tribunal has a very hollow ring indeed."
                    THE POLICE (DISCIPLINE) REGULATIONS 1985


                            PROCEEDINGS DIRECTED AGAINST


                          CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT DUCKENFIELD


                                         AND


                                SUPERINTENDENT MURRAY




                                       ADVICE




1.   The Archbishop of York preaching at the Hillsborough Memorial Service
     on 23 April   1989   said, "Events of the magnitude of Hillsborough don't
     usually happen just for one single reason, nor is it usually possible
     to pin the blame on one single scapegoat...        Disasters happen because
     a whole series of mistakes, misjudgments and mischances happen to come
     together in a deadly combination."


2.   In this whole tragic affair with the benefit of commonsense and hindsight
     there are many who could have done better or performed differently be
     they police officers, officials of Sheffield Wednesday FC, structural
     engineers, officials of the local council and others, nevertheless it
     seems to the writer on consideration of thousands of documents available
     both in his preparation and in his actions on the day Chief
     Superintendent Duckenfield was not for whatever reason up to the role
     of overall match commander at this major sporting event.       Sadly for
     Chief Supt Duckenfield, the South Yorkshire Police and those of the




                                       - 1 -
     bereaved who seek disciplinary action, Chief Supt Duckenfield's health
     appears to have failed and we will never know whether a tribunal would
     have found that such various acts or omissions as were found proved
     would have amounted to neglect of duty.


3.   There remains, however, the position of Superintendent Murray.     I
     start by adopting observations made in the report of the West Midlands
     Police to the Director of Public Prosecutions.    Chief Superintendent
     Duckenfield, the overall match day commander elected to police the event
     from the control room in the ground, but according to Supt Murray there
     was no confusion in roles.    However, the adoption of this style of
     command must to an extent reduce the overall responsibility held by
     Supt Murray because decisions are always likely to be made with the
     consent of the present Chief Superintendent.     However, by the very nature
     of his rank Supt Murray would accept responsibility.     Furthermore there
     is a duty on every police officer to act promptly if the situation
     requires it and the presence of a more senior officer should not hinder
     or excuse that requirement.


4.   At 1447 Supt Marshall asked the police control box for permission to
     open the exit gates, an extraordinary action, but one well justified
     given the circumstances prevailing at the time.     Two further requests
     were made whilst Chief Superintendent Duckenfield was considering the
     position.   At this point Supt Murray addressed Chief Supt Duckenfield
     saying words to the effect, "Are we going to open those gates."     Perhaps
     this is a good example of Supt Murray, although the junior officer,
     making his mark in a situation and at a time he felt it necessary.


     Nevertheless the fact remains that the decision to open the gates was
     not followed by any direct or indirect orders to deal with the 2000
     or so fans who for a period of 5 minutes entered the ground.     There
     were no stewards or police officers checking or directing them so the
     majority of them made for the tunnel leading to pens 3 and 4.




                                     - 2 -
5.   The earlier opening of Gate 'C' when 180 or so supporters got in did
     not alert him to consider how to cope with a deliberate authorised
     opening of that gate.


     The order given "to open the gates" was directed not to specific police
     officers, but in general.   Bearing in mind the inevitable background
     noise close to kick off he could not know who may or may not have heard
     the order and who for that matter might be alerted to be prepared to
     take action consequent upon that order.


6.   Supt Murray was part of the decision making team employed at the semi
     final.   In overall terms he had some responsibility for the control
     of matters outside the ground as well as inside.      The use and
     availability of the video and communications by radio placed him in
     a position of overall authority with Chief Supt Duckenfield.        It can
     be argued that he should have recognised the dangers inherent in the
     requests being made, especially as he had previous experience of the
     1988 semi final and of the ground.       Furthermore if the conclusion drawn
     by Lord Justice Taylor that Chief Supt Duckenfield "froze" is fair and
     correct then the question can be asked why Supt Murray did not recognise
     this and step into the breach.


7.   Whilst the writer accepts that the charge against Supt Murray has some
     prospects of success I am concerned as to whether having regard to all
     the circumstances that now obtain that it is just and fair that Supt
     Murray should as it were be seen to face the music alone.      The following
     may be worthy of consideration:-


     a.   The proceedings might be considered oppressive because of delay.
          There has, of course, been the Taylor Inquiry, the Inquests, and
          the consideration of some of the papers by the Director of Public
          Prosecutions all of which have naturally taken up time.        It is
          now a little over 2i years since this tragic event, those preparing
          the case for the disciplinary hearing have taken time to get the




                                      - 3 -
     matter in order.   There are administrative and evidential
     difficulties to overcome.    Time has been expended in thorough
     preparation in the hope that this would facilitate in due course
     an efficient and thorough presentation of the complaints and keep
     the case within reasonable boundaries in the hope that it could
     fairly and properly be dealt with both by the presentation and
     the defence in a matter of weeks rather than months.     In Chief
     Supt Duckenfield's case 5 charges were to be presented ranging
     widely over events from when it was first announced that the semi
     final would be held at Hillsborough to the time when the match
     was stopped as well as later discussions with Mr Kelly and
     representatives of the 3 football clubs involved.    It was known
     that having regard to the medical information available charges
     would not be served upon Chief Supt Duckenfield until his health
     improved.   In contrast Mr Murray faces only 1 charge; much of the
     preparation time has been consumed by Chief Supt Duckenfield's
     alleged shortcomings rather than those of Supt Murray.


b.   A distinction should perhaps be made between making decisions to
     move particular resources and having the ability to move them and
     making decisions that cause the need to move resources to arise.
     It is open to argument that the role of Supt Murray overseeing
     the control room staff was to implement the decisions of others.


     The force order entitled, "Standing instructions for the policing
     of football matches" does not identify the responsibilities of
     "match control" much less the officer in charge.    Para 10.1 states,
     "The officer in charge of match control should not be of less rank
     than Sergeant and be aided by at least 1 police constable."     This
     might suggest that the officer in charge of match control is not
     contemplated as a decision maker next in descent from the overall
     commander, but rather as an implementer able to carry out the
     routine tasks to be associated with a first level supervisor.




                                 - 4 -
     The above has even greater.force when put in the context of what
     was on any view a major departure from the operational plan, an
     exceptional course of action taken in exceptional circumstances.


c.   Chief Superintendent Duckenfield, unlike Supt Murray, has never
     co-operated with the disciplinary enquiry as of course was his
     right.    Chief Supt Duckenfield will not be at the Tribunal hearing.
     The Tribunal will not have the opportunity of contrasting the
     testimony of the defendants.     Furthermore, Supt Murray will be
     deprived of the opportunity of asking questions of Chief Supt
     Duckenfield.


d.   Regard might be had to matters of detail or stances that could
     be taken by Supt Murray.


      i.      Having been in the control box in question the writer is
              well aware that Supt Murray had a reasonably good view through
              the windows of the Leppings Lane terracing albeit at an angle,
              but would not have been in a good position to view the screen
              monitors, he would have to crane his neck backwards.


     ii.      The time Chief Supt Duckenfield took to make the decision
              to open the gate was probably of the order of 3 to 3 I minutes.
              Supt Murray would be entitled to the opinion that Chief Supt
              Duckenfield during this time was thinking about the
              consequences of such a decision and of any follow up
              information or directions to be given consequent upon such
              decision.


              Supt Murray was there to assist, be sounded out or whatever
              if asked, but Chief Supt Duckenfield didn't ask.   Supt Murray
              reminded him of the need for a decision and it was then taken
              and given out over the radio by PS Goddard.




                                  - 5 -
          Supt Murray had other matters to consider, he was in command
          of the centre of communications for police activity both
           inside and outside the ground, in particular we know at times
           that there was some concern about the behaviour of Liverpool
           fans at the edge of the spion kop which was allocated to
          Notts Forest fans.    He could fairly advance the claim that
          Chief Supt Duckenfield had taken full responsibility for
           this major departure from the plan and would follow it
           through, by for example observing the monitor screen and
           seeing where fans entering the concourse through Gate 'C'
           went, and taking such further action as may have appeared
           necessary to him.


e.   In terms of moral culpability there is a significant difference
     between the respective roles, acts and omissions on the part of
     Chief Supt Duckenfield and Supt Murray.   If Chief Supt Duckenfield
     is not to be proceeded against then those directing the charge
     against Supt Murray may wish to reflect on the situation and seek
     to balance justice being seen to be done to Supt Murray, the likely
     distress occasioned to some by the inevitable publicity this matter
     will attract and the likely outcome.


f.   If Supt Murray is to be seen as a "scapegoat" by the media and
     many of the public, this would not I suspect assist the bereaved
     with their grief nor be seen as just action by the police against
     one of their number.


     If the charge against Murray is found proved, I anticipate that
     any penalty imposed would be seen by many as totally out of
     proportion to   % deaths, 1 person lingering on a life support
     machine and many others having endured an horrific experience.

          police duties and performed them satisfactorily.   A reduction in
          rank in such circumstances may not seem appropriate.   If such
          proposition is correct what would the appropriate sentencing option
          be?

RICHARD WELLS, CHIEF CONSTABLE, SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE SAYS:-

"I have today made the decision to retire Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield from the South

Yorkshire Police on medical grounds. That decision is effective from 10 November 1991.



My decision was taken after careful consideration of the medical report from the Police Staff Surgeon,

an independent physician whose service is retained for such examinations.



This unequivocal report left me in no doubt that Mr Duckenfield is too ill to continue service as a police

officer.



Details of his condition cannot be disclosed as I am bound by the rules of patient and doctor

confidentiality, but, in general terms, he is described as suffering from severe depression and post

traumatic stress disorder.



I quite understand that the bereaved relatives and friends will be angry at my decision since it rules out

Mr Duckenfield’s involvement in the planned disciplinary tribunal for which South Yorkshire Police have

been preparing for some months. David Duckenfield has become the symbolic focus of much of the

anguish felt by those who were so hurt by the tragedy but I must deal with the man, not the symbol.

The fact is, David Duckenfield is now too ill to serve.



A decision like this is not lightly made, the more especially in a case of such complexity and public

interest. The fact that David Duckenfield is so unwell has simplified that decision. There has been

enough suffering already and I can only hope that time will help to soften the terrible pain feft by the

families of the Hillsborough victims, and will help to heal David Duckenfield as well.



The Police Complaints Authority and the Hillsborough Family Support Group have been notified of my

decision."

We have previously discussed problems seen as impeding progress towards the
disciplinary hearing of charges arising from the Hillsborough tragedy and in
my letter of 1 October 1991 I indicated that I considered it important to meet
and discuss the way ahead.

I have caused Superintendent Fell to prepare a paper which concentrates on
the problem and possible solution regarding the material. In the light of
what he says I have talked with the solicitor to South Yorkshire Police
Authority, Mr Stephen Walker, and both he and Counsel, Mr John Sleightholme,
share my view that further discussion is desirable.

You will be aware that there is movement towards a decision being made as to
whether Chief Superintendent Duckenfield is fit to continue to serve and if
a resolution occurs soon on that issue it will necessarily throw into sharper
focus the question of the charge against Superintendent Murray.

Mr Sleightholme has prepared charges and it would be beneficial if our
discussion were also to encompass that issue.

Accordingly, I should be most grateful for an early opportunity to come and
talk with you and Judge Petre. I would suggest Monday, 28 October or Tuesday,
29 October 1991 as appropriate dates for the meeting.

RICHARD WELLS, CHIEF CONSTABLE OF SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE, says

"I understand Trevor Hicks’ and the families’ se n se of impatience.     The 96 deaths

resulting from the Hillsborough tragedy are constantly on our minds and we share the

grief of those bereaved. Strong feelings like this have still to submit themselves to the

processes of the world of legal detail.


                                     \
From the moment when the South Yorkshire Police were directed by the Police

Complaints Authority to prefer charges against Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield

and Superintendent Bernard Murray, we have let no grass grow under our feet.

Immediately, in our role of preparing the case for a tribunal, we instructed counsel to

prepare the evidence and draw up the charges. We have appointed a dedicated team

of officers to assist counsel.    The evidence for consideration consists of 4,000

statements and reports, 8,000 questionnaires, 3,900 other documents, hundreds of

photographs and video tapes, and transcripts of 84 days of evidence given to the

Taylor Inquiry and the Inquest.



Provisional steps have been taken for the tribunal to begin at Sheffield Town Hall

during March 1992. However, it is very difficult for anyone to finalise arrangements

for the hearing while the details of charges have yet to be agreed between the South

Yorkshire Police and the Police Complaints Authority.            There is the further

complication of Chief Superintendent Duckenfield’s illness.      As with anybody else

facing legal proceedings, he has to be well enough for the charges to be served on

him and well enough to assist in the preparation of his own defence.
The assessm ent of Chief Superintendent Duckenfield’s illness is not a matter for police

officers, it is a matter of medical advice. He was seen on Tuesday 22 October by a

police staff surgeon. We await the staff surgeon’s report and will be guided by the

findings. This is a process which has been followed in exactly the same way with

several officers suffering ill health in the aftermath of Hillsborough.



Referral of a patient for further medical advice would be subject to the professional

judgement of the staff surgeon.



In terms of commonsense and equity, the absence of Chief Superintendent

Duckenfield from his own tribunal because of illness is unacceptable. I must say that

in the light of the two years of statements emerging from Merseyside, the thought that

Trevor Hicks and the Hillsborough Families Support Group wish to spare David

Duckenfield the rigours of the tribunal has a very hollow ring indeed."

 TO: HR RICHARD WELLS - CHIEF CONSTABLE, SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE
     BRIGADIER POWNALL - POLICE COMPLAINTS AUTHORITY
     MR DAVID DUCKENFIELD
     MR BERNARD MURRAY


 HIItLBBOROPOH/POLICE DISCIPLINE

 It is now some months since the Police Complaints Authority
 instructed the South Yorkshire Police to instigate disciplinary
 proceedings against Messrs Duckenfield and Murray in respect of
 the Hillsborough Disaster on the 15th April 1989.


Nothing has, so far, happened - allegedly due to Mr Duckenfield's
 incapacity on undisclosed sickness grounds.


Whilst we regret Mr Duckenfield's illness, the investigation of
the Hillsborough Disaster remains a matter for deep public
concern and it is totally unacceptable for the current stalemate
to continue.   The healing process and the restoration of the
public's confidence in both the Police and the Judicial Process
can only begin when these matters are adequately dealt with.


On the 24th of October 1991 it will be 90 days since the 26th of
July, when Mr Duckenfield commenced sick leave.   He will then be
entitled to apply for early retirement on ill health grounds and
the disciplinary matters relating to him would automatically
lapse.
Whilst acknowledging Hr Duckenfield's right to taka this course
of action I implore him not to exercise this option but to grasp
the opportunity of clearing his name by:-


1.   Submitting himself for independent medical assessment.
2«   Allowing the disciplinary tribunals to proceed with hin
     being legally represented - thus sparing him the rigours of
     the tribunal, yet ensuring his interests are protected.


Similarly 1 call upon the South Yorkshire Chief Constable Mr
Richard Wells and the Police Complaints Authority to immediately
begin the disciplinary proceedings involving Mr Murray*


As long ago as October 1989 the All-Party Home Affairs Committee
of HP's fully endorsed the retirement statement of the first
Chairman of the Police Authority, Sir Cecil Clothier QC, whos-
a)   Castigated some Police Forces for delaying disciplinary
     proceedings and failing to prosecute them with vigour*
b)   Expressed concern over the ever-increasing number of cases
     involving officers who were allowed to retire, whilst they
     were under investigation.
c)   He called upon the Home Office to set up a Board to review
     all applications for medical retirements under these
     circumstances.
d)   Called for tougher action to be taken even when an
     Officer was found to be unfit and granted medical
     retirement.
e)   Called for time limits, to be introduced by the end of
     1989, to eliminate delays in disciplinary proceedings.
One can hardly expect myself, other members of the Hillsborough
families,   or indeed the general public to accept indefinite
delays and/or this matter not being brought to a satisfactory
conclusion.


I implore all those concerned to prevent further distress and
acrimony by dealing with these outstanding matters immediately*

                      PROBLEM PREVENTING PROGRESS OF THE
                            HILLSBOROUGH TRIBUNAL


                            SUPERINTENDENT A FELL
                            SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE


1.   The purpose of this paper is to set out the problem seen as preventing
     the progress of the Hillsborough Tribunal and to offer the solution
     so that problem and solution can be considered by those who will
     contribute to the making of decisions as to the way ahead.    The paper
     avoids detailed descriptions, references and explanations since it
     is aimed at a restricted readership that has knowledge of the relevant
     legislation, the particulars of the tragedy and the identities of the
     different witnesses.


2.   The fundamental problem is that the Tribunal cannot proceed until
     charges accompanied by supporting statements of evidence have been
     served on the accused officers.    Such evidence does not presently exist
     in an appropriate form, that is as statements suitable for Regulation
     10 and Regulation 19 procedures.   A team of police officers conversant
     with the circumstances will have to be appointed to obtain such
     statements.   Such action after the Police Complaints Authority has
     certified on 15 August 1990 that it was satisfied with the investigation
     is difficult to countenance.


3-   The background to this problem is that immediately following the tragedy
     the police officers involved were required to write out their
     recollections.   Some of these were supplemented by further
     recollections.   Some recollections were perhaps influenced by advice
     as to what was required for the purpose of the Taylor Inquiry and civil
     litigation.




                                    - 1 -
Many members of the public, officials, club employees and others
completed questionnaires.   Some persons made signed statements; some
made unsigned statements.   Some key persons were interviewed under
caution and under Regulation 7 Notice and their evidence is largely
in the form of records of interview.


Most of the documentation has been entered on computer and the print
off of the computer version of some was used as 'statements' in support
of the report submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions on which
the decisions as to criminal culpability were made.   It was this report
and its supporting evidence which was used as the supporting material
for the report of the complaint investigation that was considered by
the Police Complaints Authority when the direction was made.     For many
of what appear to be witness statements the computer copy carries a
common heading of 'statement' and 'signed' and 'dated'.     This is
misleading as there are few statements that are signed, dated and
witnessed.   The date quoted is presumably the date that the material
was entered onto the computer.


This material is wide ranging in content and there is much in the
'statement* of a relevant witness that is extraneous to the disciplinary
charges.


Many witnesses gave evidence to the Taylor Inquiry and to the Inquest
that is in addition to that contained in their 'statements'.    In so
far as that oral evidence is pertinent to the charges, but not contained
in their 'statements', their 'statements' are incomplete.


In some cases there is an obvious need for amplification of what a
witness has said to establish what further evidence he can give.
9-    The problem in relation to available evidence was raised in the report
      of the investigating officer to the Director of Public Prosecutions
      (Page l8l) and his comments are revealing:-


      "...many of the statements of witnesses obtained have been in the form
      of non-CJA recollections.     Amongst these are accounts from individuals
      who may be considered to have some culpability in Criminal Law.        None
      of these recollections has at this time been converted into CJA
      statement or admitted under caution."


      "Recollections, whilst a very efficient method of collecting evidence
      early for Counsel to the Inquiry, are very unsatisfactory for a criminal
      investigation.     This is not only because they are not protected by
      the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, but also because they lack
      the thoroughness which invariably follows an efficient one-to-one
      interview.     Secondly, they have been subjected to review and possible
      editing by persons who may be more minded to protect the liability
      interests of the individual or organisation at Civil Law."


      "A related issue centres on the evidence taken from individuals at
      the Public Inquiry oral hearings and the transcripts made of what was
      said...   As far as witnesses are concerned, their accounts, as recorded
      in transcripts, have not been converted into statements."


      "Furthermore, in giving evidence at the oral hearings no person was
      put on oath..."


10.   There seems to be no alternative to obtaining appropriate and suitable
      statements.    The discipline form served on an accused officer is
      designed to include the requirements of Regulation 11.        Schedule 2
      indicates the presumption that statements will be supplied at the same
      time the discipline form is served.        Paragraph 12 of Annex 'H' states
      that "...the accused officer must be presented with copies of the
      evidence..."     By Paragraph 7 of Annex     'Hf "...normally these documents




                                       - 3 -
should be served with the discipline form."   Obviously the discipline
form containing the charges requires the officer to consider how he
intends to plead, consider whether he should engage legal representation
and indicate which witnesses he requires to be called.   He is in no
position to make sensible decisions or be adequately advised on these
issues without having the evidence to consider.


Apart from being demanded by Regulations, the preparation of appropriate
statements will produce real benefits since it will lead to smooth
Tribunal proceedings occupying the least time and incurring the least
cost, inconvenience and distress.   If the evidence the Tribunal is
asked to consider has been put in the form of written, signed and
witnessed statements containing the complete relevant testimony of
the witness concerned with extraneous material omitted, both the
presenter and the accuseds' representatives can have given earlier
consideration to it and have suitably prepared the case.


A further consideration is that the obtaining of appropriate statements
will give an indication of the likely performance of witnesses.     It
is possible that some witnesses will be unwilling to co-operate with
such further investigation and indeed the Tribunal itself.   Possibly
some witnesses from impairment will be unable to complete suitable
statements.   Whether from unwillingness or impairment it is well that
the position is known before the Tribunal begins.


Suitable statements may enable Regulation 19 procedures to operate
and this is crucial to the smooth conduct of the Tribunal's business.


Regulation 19 procedures cannot occur without the consent of the accused
officers and statements unsatisfactory from ambiguity, incompleteness
or inconsistency with other testimony will make it unreasonable to
expect such consent.   It may be, however, that for economic reasons
the accused would have wished to have the procedure operate and being
      prevented from doing so because of the quality of the material can
      be seen as unfair and so unsatisfactory.


15.   Contemplation of the appointment of a team of officers to obtain witness
      statements indicates the need to determine what witnesses are involved.
      The conduct of the presentation would rely in large part on showing
      that Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendent Murray gave
      accounts to the Taylor Inquiry and the Inquest that amount to admissions
      when related to the discipline charges.    With regard to the technical
      proof of the provenance of the transcripts (it is acknowledged that
      general rules of evidence need not be scrupulously followed) one would
      not anticipate difficulty in obtaining witness statements from the
      transcribers.   Similar non-controversial statements will be needed
      from witnesses to introduce in evidence other documents such as plans,
      orders and photographs.


16.   There islikely to be controversy as to     whether it is proper for the
      Tribunal to consider the testimonygiven by the accused officers at
      the Taylor Inquiry.   Similar, but less powerful objection is likely
      to be made to the consideration of their testimony given at the Inquest.


17.   The admissions in relation to the charges (there are no admissions
      at the Inquest in relation to charge five) form a major part of the
      case against the two officers.


18.   Some of the answers given by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield were
      against his interests, but were untrue.     It appears he 'wilted' under
      cross-examination and it would be wrong, counsel advises, to seek to
      rely upon answers that are believed to be untrue.


19.   A fairly   remote possibility exists that the Tribunal might decide not
      to hear evidence of the admissions made at the Inquiry and at the
      Inquest.   It would be likely to attract severe criticism if the
      presented case relied completely on admissions adduced by transcript




                                  - 5 -
        and then collapse because the transcripts were not admitted.    It follows
        that evidence from sources other than the accused officers themselves
        should be used to establish the case.


 20.    Accordingly, Counsel considers that the case will be based not only
        on the admissions made at the Inquiry and at the Inquest, but also
        on the testimony of witnesses.   These may include


       Charge One (Planning):


        (Possibly Mole, Sewell, Marshall), Mackrell, Lock, Charlesworth.


       Charge Two (Monitoring):


       Greenwood, Illingworth, Smith, Goddard, Bichard, Ryan, McRobbie,
       Mackrell, Lock, Guest, Nicholson, Hendry, Lackey, Spearritt, Sutton.


       Charge Three (Failing to Act on Overcrowding):


       Greenwood, Creaser, Illingworth, Smith, Guest, Nicholson.


       Charges Four and Six (Action after Gate C Opened):


       Greenwood, Creaser, Bennett, Bain, Marsh, Sewell, Goddard, McRobbie,
       Bichard, Ryan, Guest, Lock, Higgins, Delaney, White.


       Charge Five (Disrepute):


       Goddard, Bichard, Ryan, McRobbie, Mackrell, Kelly, Kirton, Jackson,
       Robinson, Roworth, Smith, Smart, McGee, Brown, Ensor, Lewis, Lock,
       Mole, Marshall, Sharpies.


21.    In addition Counsel is considering calling a small number of supporters
       who were present in pens 3 and 4 and perhaps Mr Hicks himself.




                                     - 6 -
 The decision as to which witnesses referred to in Paragraphs 20. and
 21. will be used will depend upon the statements given.


 The numbers and the rank, status and publicity potential of some of
 these individuals make it obvious that it is unlikely that the obtaining
 of their statements can be done without it coming to public attention.
 It is of obvious interest that the supervised investigation did not
 explore what took place in the Board Room or later in the police control
box in relation to the allegation of connivance made against Chief
Superintendent Duckenfield and Assistant Chief Constable Jackson.


It would seem appropriate that West Midlands police officers who had
a duty to investigate the evidence supporting or contradicting the
complaints against police should continue this duty and obtain the
evidence relating to the charges arising from these complaints for
the purpose of the discipline hearing.     They have now the knowledge
of the background circumstances that it would take other officers time
to acquire.   Furthermore the West Midlands Police have the necessary
independence so that suspicion of cover-up or manipulation of witnesses
can be avoided.     The continuing supervision of the investigation by
the Police Complaints Authority will provide a further shield against
such accusations.     If West Midlands Police are to do this work the
funding might lead to public comment.


Unpalatable though it might prove, the Regulations must be followed
and the solution to the problem of obtaining suitable statements appears
to be that West Midlands Police should complete the investigation under
the continuing supervision of the Police Complaints Authority.    Unless
someone completes this duty the Tribunal probably cannot begin its
work.


It seems to be established by Paragraph 9-2 of the Guidance that the
responsibility for "the preparation of the case against accused
officers" lies with the discipline authority of the Force.    In so far
       as the obtaining of suitable statements can be regarded as "the
       preparation of the case" the decision to cause this action nay rest
       with South Yorkshire Police.    In so far as the obtaining of statements
       from those who have not previously been asked to make statements, the
       obtaining of statements   following an efficient one-to-one interview"
       and the clarification and amplification of versions must all be regarded
       as investigation, the decision to cause this action may rest with West
      Midlands Police and the Police Complaints Authority.


27.   The possibility exists that when it is widely realised that there is
      a need to take further statements to be satisfactory for the purpose
      of the discipline hearing, questions may be asked whether (as the
      investigating officer indicated) they were unsatisfactory for the
      purpose of a criminal prosecution.      Perhaps there will be some who
      might claim that if the statements were unsatisfactory for a criminal
      prosecution they might not have been ideally appropriate for making
      decisions as to criminal culpability.      Far fetched though such
      speculation clearly is, it would be better if it never could surface.


28.   In the unique circumstances of Hillsborough and bearing in mind the
      interpretation that might by some be put on a new investigation
      supplementary to one already carried out and ratified by the Police
      Complaints Authority, there is clearly advantage in discussion and
      agreement being reached as to the way ahead before any decision is
      made and announced.

                                         A D V I C E




      I have been asked to comment upon the Police Complaints Authority's

letter dated 30th September 1991 and the Assistant Chief Constable's

reply thereto dated 1st October 1991.



     Whilst        I am grateful        for the Chairman's notes,        these do not,

with respect to him, represent the problems that presently give cause

for concern.         I had the advantage of visiting the Chairman and Deputy

Chairman      in London on the 1st August 1991             when I was most courteously

received      and afforded helpful guidance.               At the time of that visit

I was perhaps a child in this matter.                   Now I am hopefully attaining

puberty,     and    the   following      problems   have   become     apparent   to   me:—


1*   Chief Superintendent Duckenfield

     (a)       Whilst I intend so far as possible to rely                 upon evidence

     given    by     Chief   Superintendent Duckenfield at the Inquest,               the

     justification        for    this   being   that he was     then represented by

     Counsel and the Coroner gave regular warnings about the possibility

     of incriminating himself, I had not anticipated that he would

     have      given      sane    answers which were against his          interests but

     were untrue.         It appears that he "wilted" under cross-examination.

     It would be entirely wrong to seek to rely                      upon answers which

     we genuinely believe to be untrue.             It is only by the thoroughness

     of our consideration that such errors were discovered.                      So far
                                  2.

 as Charge 5 is concerned, Chief Superintendent Duckenfield upon
 advice declined to answer any questions at the Inquest.

 (b)   It will be necessary to use scxne of the evidence given

 by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield to the Taylor Enquiry.      Ibis was

 not given on oath, he received no warnings, he was not individually

 represented, but if Charge 5 is to be pursued then as matters

 currently stand the best evidence that is available is that given
 by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield to the Enquiry.

 (c)   For the sake of completeness, I make the observation that

 Chief Superintendent Duckenfield,     when interviewed in relation

 to the Regulation 7 notices on 3rd July 1990, declined at that

 stage to answer any questions.        His Solicitor, Mr. Coughlin,

 at 3 minutes 21 seconds into the transcript of that interview,

makes the position clear in these terms, "Well, I think the position

on the discipline aspects of the case were made clear in our

letter to you Mr. Sharp, on the 25th June 1990 vdiich is essentially

that David has been advised by myself and his legal advisers

that whilst there's any possibility of prosecution for any criminal

matters, then he would wish to reserve his position in relation

to the discipline notices.      However, once the discipline, the

criminal aspects have been dealt with, then Chief Superintendent

Duckenfield would wish to, to assist as far as he can with regard
                     H
to discipline matters.



I have not seen any material to suggest that once the Director

of Public Prosecutions decided against bringing criminal proceedings

that there has been any approach to Chief Superintendent Duckenfield

to resume the interview and seek his assistance or explanations.

Bearing in mind it is now two and a half years since the Hillsborough
 disaster and that the direction has been given to bring such

 proceedings, it may be considered inappropriate to seek to interview
 him further.



The state of material evidence available

 (a)    The vast majority of the written material available is

not in the form of           recognisable statements signed and dated.

The vast majority comprises recollections         in computer format.

There is nothing to indicate that they have ever been checked

by the persons whose recollections are recorded.         There is some

doubt     that   the   recollections   are uncensored or uninfluenced

compilations.     The recollections in computer format do not include

much that the individuals have said at the Taylor Enquiry and/or

the Inquest.     There are conflicts at times with the three accounts.

(b)     Witnesses who give scxne evidence do not expand on the relevant

points,    e.g. Messrs.    Kelly and Mackrell,   regarding Charge 5.

(c)     Many potential witnesses viio it would appear can give material

evidence have not been asked for their evidence, e.g. persons

present in the Boardroom - Charge 5, persons closing off the
tunnel in 1988 - Charge 4.



Consequences

It is vital to the drafting of the charges and furthermore the

Defence have a right to know upon what evidence we seek to rely.

It is therefore necessary to obtain signed statements in order
to:-

(a)    know what the witnesses can be expected to say;

(b)    serve the statements on the Defendants in order that they

       may be prepared to admit some of the evidence without the

       necessity of calling oral testimony and thereby shortening
                                                4-

              the length of the hearing;

      (c) separate the           voluminous material            from that pertinent to
              the discipline charges;

      (d)    adduce recollections Taylor Enquiry, Inquest evidence and

              disciplinary       interviews          of   the   respective     Defendants.

              Prove plans, photographs, video recordings, films, green
                     ^-«vce-
              guide,         standing orders, ACFO document, operational

              plan, print-out of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club computer.


      There is some difficulty with the evidence here.                   I had erroneously

      believed that there was a video recording taken from the control

      box showing what was available to be seen by Chief Superintendent

     Duckenfield and Superintendent Murray had they chosen to look

      on their monitor of the scene outside in Leppings Lane and the

      turnstiles and also Pens 1-7 inclusive.                         Unfortunately, what

     is available is a series of flashing scenes.                  It is very difficult

     to follow and perhaps stills will need to be taken.                    Unfortunately,

     without explanation the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club video

     of     turnstiles    9-16    went      missing       shortly after the disaster.


4.   Who is to obtain the statements?

     There are two types of statements:

     (a)     It would seen to be entirely appropriate for the matters

     at 3(d) above which are essentially uncontroversial to be obtained
     by South Yorkshire Police Officers.

     (b)     Statements    of     potentially         controversial      witnesses,   e.g.
     those present in the control box and boardroom — currently my

     team are     endeavouring         to   prepare       "phantom"      statements   from

     information gleaned from the combined material - but there are

     gaps    to   fill    in     the    sense        of   ambiguities,    contradictions,
clarifications and expansions.      Furthermore, some persons should

be seen in order to determine the state of knowledge of the likes

of Mr. Kelly, Mr. Mackrell, Mr. Curten, and A.C.C. Jackson at

the   timesvdhen Chief Superintendent Duckenfield spoke     about the

events that afternoon.       Furthermore, we need to know what it

is alleged was said by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield.

The   West Midlands Police conducted the investigation       into the
complaints and the Police Complaints Authority have given their

certificate of satisfaction with that enquiry.        I do not wish

to enter into the politics of the situation but if South Yorkshire

Police conducted such interviews for the amplification of matters

in the phantom statements or the eradication where there is possible

conflict or confusion in earlier accounts, then there could be
room for misunderstanding.



Complying with the Regulations

(a)   The charge should be served in the discipline         form set

out in Schedule 2 - that form provides for the names and addresses

of witnesses in support of the charge whose statements are attached

thereto - Regulation 8.      Not less than 21 days before the hearing

the Defendants should be supplied with copies of such statements.

(b)   The Defendants shall be supplied with copies of any statement

relating to the charge made by any person, other than a witness

to be called in support of the charge, to the investigating officer

or to anybody on his behalf, together with the person's name
and address.

The complaints were made a considerable time after most of the

recollections,   statements, oral observations and oral testimony

were given.      It is possible to argue that there is therefore
no requirement to provide copies of such material.
 In my opinion, such a stance would be unconscionable, it would

 be contrary to natural justice.        The difficulty is, of course,

 the sheer txilk of such material, perhaps the hire          of two large

 removal vans would do the trick, but are we to deposit such material

 at Chief Superintendent Duckenfield's home?       My present inclination

 is to provide a list of each andevery witness in categories,

 e.g.   Liverpool   supporters in   pens     3 and 4, and invite Chief

 Superintendent Duckenfield tosay whether he wishes           all or only
 some of the material to bedeposited at his home               or at his

 Solicitor s address,    giving him the option,        if permitted, of

using the services of P.C. Greenway to use the computer to retrieve

 whatever material he seeks to consider for his defence.         However,

 I have to say that we are to some extent seeking the goodwill

and co-operation of Chief Superintendent Duckenfield, who may

not feel inclined to take such a view of matters.           Whatever the

South Yorkshire Police choose to do,       the Regulations are mandatory.

However,   in the eyes of     some of      the public, it would appear

unreasonable or indeed a       harsh application of theRegulations

to make delivery in full.      On    the other hand,     what ifthecharges

or some of than are found proved and the Defence appeal in due

course and claim that they did not have a copy of page 97,104

of witness number 19,739's statement and this might have made

all the difference to the Defence.         I appreciate that the latter
is an extreme but there is a problem!



Problems through lack of representation

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield's representation at the Inquest

was no doubt very costly.       He may well take the view that he

simply cannot afford legal representation at the Tribunal.            On

a Counsel to Counsel basis there are many avenues of opportunity

to smooth the way for the ease of presentation of a case which
                                              7.

      is difficult for all concerned. It has to be faced that at present
      such avenues of opportunity are not open.

      I suspect that the Defence will await the charges and supporting

      evidence    that   Chief   Superintendent Duckenfield may then have

      a conference with his Counsel - matters may then become clearer.
      In the meantime we need to follow the strict Regulations.

      Similar considerations apply to a lesser extent in Superintendent
     Murray's case.



7.   The hearing date

     I, like everyone else in my team, would like a hearing date fixed

     as soon as possible and a hearing that is neat and tidy, keeping

     the issues so far as we are able short and succinct.                     To this

     end, despite the thousands of hours of time already rightly expended

     upon the Hillsborough disaster, still more time needs to be spent.

     The case needs to be in a presentable form before the charges

     are served and the evidence in support thereof is served.                    The

     hearing is in private but I cannot imagine that all the conplainants

     will refrain from communication with the media.                       To fail on

     technicalities or to otherwise be seen to be too short on material

     evidence would compound the grief of the bereaved and lead to
     their     disenchantment    with   the        whole   system,   and    be wholly

     unsatisfactory for all concerned, be they the Police Complaints

     Authority, the South Yorkshire Police, or indeed Chief Superintendent

     Duckenfield and Superintendent Rirray.                 I cannot see that it

     is proper to set a hearing date before the charges have been

     served.     Furthermore, just as we have needed time to get this

     matter into shape, so the Defence will need time to prepare their

     cases.    It could well be nearly three years after the event before

     the hearing finally takes place.               At present we have proceeded
                                     8.


     on the basis that there will be a joint hearing of the charges

     against Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendent Murray

     on the basis that the same evidential material will be used and

     the opportunity thereby afforded of each Defendant to ask questions

     of the other and public convenience and expense.      It is possible
     that either party may seek severance.



8.   Chief Superintendent Duckenfield's Health

     So far as we are aware, Chief Superintendent Duckenfield is

     currently the subject of a sick note and not considered fit for

     duties.   It seems to me that he should be treated like any other

     serving officer who has been off sick for a lengthy period.

     He should be seen by the Police Surgeon.         The Police Surgeon

     should give his opinion as to Chief Superintendent Duckenfield1s

     current state of health and be asked his opinion on the likely

     effect of such health if charges and copy statements in this

     matter were to be served upon him.       It may be that the Police

     Surgeon would recommend investigation by a psychiatrist.   Nevertheless

     if these steps were put in train, a decision could then be taken.


9.   General

     The above are not meant to be an exhaustive list of problems

     but hopefully give some idea of certain broad difficulties that

     have to be faced.   There are, for example, questions as to whether,

     if a charge or charges are based upon a complaint of say Mr.

     Jones or Mr. Hicks, then should Mrs. McBrien be allowed to attend

     the hearing.   On the one hand if she is not invited then this

     could be interpreted by some as a cover-up, if she is invited

     to attend it could be seen as oppressive towards Chief Superintendent
                                           9.

      Duckenfield and/or Superintendent Murray.          If she is considered

      a joint complainant she would have, of course, the right to seek

      to ask questions through the Chairman.            The more persons were

      considered to be joint complainants the more that it would be

      the right of such persons to seek to ask questions which in turn

      would prolong the hearing; but there are competing interests.



10.   I hope the above explanations are helpful and that the Assistant

      Chief Constable will not hesitate to raise any matters not covered

      by   this   Advice,   or   indeed,    matters   that require   expansion.

                  SUBJECT:      hillsborough discipline tribunal



                   I believe that following my report of 30 September 1991 you caused
                   Chief Superintendent Mole to telephone Mr Ord, Deputy Chief Constable
                   of Cleveland to ascertain if any precedent was known for fixing a
                   date for a tribunal without charges being preferred. Chief
                   Superintendent Mole spoke to Mr Ord, who later telephoned Acting Chief
                   Inspector Brentnall asking to speak with me. I was unavailable, being
                   in conference with Mp Sleightholme at his chpbers in Leeds.

                   I returned Mr Ord's call today. He told me that following his
                   conversation with Chief Superintendent Mole he had an afterthought
                   which he felt I should know, that is to say that when the charges
                   have been framed they should be sent in writing to the Police
                   Complaints Authority to secure agreement. This removes the possibility
                   of subsequent dispute in the event that they fail.

                  I took the opportunity of re-raising the original point with Mr Ord
                  as to precedent for setting a tribunal date before the charges were
                  fixed. Mr Ord's view is that the arrangements for the tribunal are
                  the statutory responsibility of the discipline authority for the Force.
                  He felt it would be best if once the charges are fixed then a date
                  set, an early date. Thereafter it would be a matter for the tribunal
                  to adjourn at the request of the accused, say because of medical
                  reasons. Mr Ord is to send a copy of a letter he sent to the Police
                  Complaints Authority concerning responsibility for tribunal
                  arrangements.

                  I took the opportunity of asking him whether there was any precedent
                  for serving the discipline form unaccompanied by the evidence
                  supporting the charges. (I gave him a hint only of our difficulty).
                  Mr Ord felt it best that the discipline charge be accompanied by what
                  could be given and notice that further was to follow.

                  I thanked him for his interest.

                  I would urge that fixing a date for the tribunal should be contemplated
                  without delay.

                 HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - REQUESTS FOR DISCLOSURE


I return the file of correspondence which you forwarded to me together
with your minute of 3 October 1991• You will see that each item has
been numbered and the history of the correspondence is set out at the
front of each. For example, HD1 refers to a request made on
20 December 1989 which was denied by West Midlands Police on
3 January 1990. HD/2 is a request dated 14 December 1989 which was
denied by West Midlands Police on 5 January 1990. And so on.

It is a matter for your decision as to whether you wish to resurrect
interest by writing further updates in response to such requests.
Do you intend to write say every three months?

Your minute of 3 October 1991 implies that you will write acknowledging
receipt. I was led to believe your letter would express policy. It
was not envisaged that further attention would be given by me other
than filing the requests with the other Hillsborough papers. What
further attention do you have in mind? Do you wish the actual requested
material to be searched out and copied? Do you wish the question of
'property' to be researched?

Please indicate those areas that you decide require further action
and the necessary action will be taken. I would point out this will
inevitably delay the work of this team, but this other work can easily
be done if required.

                      I refer to our recent discussions concerning the above subject and
                      as agreed at the Management Meeting I am to respond from my office
                      to all future requests for disclosure. A register will be maintained
                      within the Department and Acting Chief Inspector Brentnall will oversee
                      that. Once an acknowledgement is made correspondence will be forwarded
                      for your attention.

                       In the meantime, I am aware that previous letters have been responded
                       to and some may require further update. Having considered the position
                       I am of the view that the question of the identification of such
                       matters, which will require further attention, is something that can
                       be best dealt with by means of your team and I would ask that previous
                       requests are now looked at and any matters requiring further action
                       be drawn to my attention in order that I may respond quickly and bring
                       the file up-to-date. This, of course, will be a one-off exercise

Thank you for your letter of 30 September 1991, a copy of which I have
forwarded to Mr Sleightholme.

I am mindful of the need to seek to make arrangements as to the date and
venue of the tribunal, but as I recounted to you in our telephone
conversation last week there are problems including those identified by
counsel regarding the statements and the needs of the accused officers
in preparing their cases. These problems have yet to be resolved.

It is clear to me that there are further issues that demand discussion
and I therefore propose, once Mr Slelghtholme has had the opportunity to
digest what you say, to cause to be prepared a paper setting out all the
problems.

I would hope after you have considered them you will see the value in
further discussion in order that matters can be expedited.

Brigadier J.L. Pownall, OBE,
Deputy Chairman (Discipline),
Police Complaints Authority,
10 Great George Street,
LONDON SW1P 3AE


Dear Brigadier Pownall,

        in my earlier letter to you dated 18th May, I
made reference to a report Z have of a telephone con­
versation between you and Chief Superintendent Young
on 9th May. Some parts of that conversation as reported
to me indicate you may be presuming to yourself certain
responsibilities which Z feel you do not have* It is
important we resolve those differences. Other parts
of the conversation caused offence to the Chief
Superintendent and annoyance to me.

        Zt is important that I first of all refer to
my correspondence with Mr. Marsh. If you care to
examine the correspondence you will see our business
was conducted scrupulously correctly on both sides end
with proper speed* Zt is equally important to say the
Tribunal was held without undue delay and so far as I
am aware with due courtesy and consideration to your
two Members. Zt is against that background that I am
obliged,.unfortunately, to write this letter.

        Z received the direction under Section 93(3) in
a letter dated 16th March. On 20th March Z personally
appointed Chief Superintendent Young, M.Sc, BA, to be
Presenting Officer* This was done by way of an internal
minute which gave him directions on how to proceed. He
was specially selected as a former member of my
Complaints Staff; an experienced Presenting Officer;
and the Presenting Officer in the only other Tribunal
held in this Force* The Chief Superintendent identified
a provisional date for the hearing as 15th May and this
was notified to Mr. Marsh* The date;was later confirmed


                                  continued * • • . .
                            2



as suitable to the Authority. Op to that point I had
fulfilled my responsibilities under the Act (Section
93(5)) and followed the advice in the Home Office
Guidance (Section 9.16).

       You are well aware of the need for an adjourn­
ment but I am not sure whether you have been given the
reason. The Police Authority in the process of select­
ing a new Chief Constable chose 15th May as one of the
days for interviews, and required Mr. Payne's attend­
ance. They w>re on a tight schedule with quite
different considerations and factors to be taken into
account and made their decision without reference to
the Chief Constable's availability. I would be sur­
prised if anyone would give precedence to a Tribunal
over the appointment of a new Chief Constable.

       Despite those problems we were able to re-arrange
the hearing within three weeks, once again after proper
consultation with the Authority.
        I am as conscious as the Authority over delays
and if your enquiry on 9th May had been confined to the
circumstances of the adjournment this letter would not
be necessary. However, you went beyond that and I
consider questions about which Chief Constable should
hear the case; the number of witnessesi and the use of
written statements are not matters for you.
         In making that assertion I rely on the follow­
ing* -
         Section 93(5) of P.A.C.E. places the respons­
         ibility for preferring and proceeding with
         the charge on me and the Authority are not
         mentioned.

         Section 9.2 of the Guidance places the
         responsibility for the preparation of the
         case on me. The Section goes on to specify
         within that overall responsibility the
         admissibility of evidence, the editing of
         statements, the burden of proof and measures
         to ensure fairness to the accused. Section
         9.1 reminds me the Guidance is issued under
         statutory authority. Again the P.C.A. are
         not mentioned.

       The only reference in the Guidance to the
Authority in this context is in paragraph 9.16.



                                     continued
                           3 ■■



However, unlike paragraphs 9(1) and (2), paragraph
9.16 deals only with arrangements for the hearing
and not the preparation for, or conduct of, the
case.

        I now seek confirmation from the Authority
that my view In these matters is correct.

       To turn now to the remainder of the conversation,
it is my view you were unwise as Deputy Chairman of the
Authority to engage in any conversation on the case
with the Presenting Officer. Furthermore, it was
highly improper of you to attempt to discuss the conduct
of the defence with the Presenting Officer. Your
suggestions to replace Mr. Payne as Chairman of the
Tribunal with either his successor or another Chief
Constable under Regulation 14 can only be described
as fatuous.

        You should clearly understand chief
Superintendent Young strongly resents your comments
on the conduct of presentation cases elsewhere and
views your remarks as a slur of his professional
integrity. I would like you to clearly understand
I strongly resent your interference in this matter.
        I derive no pleasure from writing this letter.
I write in the hope the problems as I see them will
be resolved which is why I am prepared, for the moment,
to deal with it on a private basis.

                   Yours sincerely,

Thank you for your letter of 19 June about various matters arising from the setting up
of the tribunal to hear the case arising from the complaint made by Mr K            I
am sorry that we seem to have become involved in a rather acrimonious discussion and
it may help if I explained the situation as seen from this end.

The first problem arose over the cancellation of the date that had been arranged for the
tribunal. The Authority try in all cases to meet the dates requested by Forces.
However, one hopes that having arranged the date it will be adhered to. I admit that I
was somewhat irritated when I was told that a message had been received at staff level
informing us, without any consultation, that the hearing had been cancelled. You will
appreciate that the members involved had made all their administrative arrangements by
then and the message, as passed to me, was just a unilateral cancellation. I personally
telephoned your office to discuss the matter but you were away, which was a pity
because no doubt we could have sorted the matter out between us* The Authority did,
of course, conform to the new dates you set, even though we were not consulted.

As far as the rest of my conversation with Chief Superintendent Young is concerned, as
I recall it, a new date had not at that time been fixed. It is often the case that
postponement can mean further lengthy delay before the case is heard and that is unfair
to both the officer and the complainant. I therefore made various suggestions which
might have helped to bring the case to a hearing as soon as possible. I well recognise
that the Authority have no standing in such matters but, as you know, we deal with
forty eight different Forces, and many of them welcome our suggestions and advice and
indeed, many seek it over disciplinary cases in which we are involved. I think this was •
the first case in which we have directed charges in your Force and perhaps it was
unwise of me to stray beyond our strict remit on these matters. I shall know in future
that Cleveland, unlike some Forces, do not wish to have such discussions. However, we
are required by the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 to give the reasons for any
directions we may make. Therefore it would be in order to include anything which
contributes to clarifying our reasons to the Force. For example the Authority may, and
sometimes does, include an indication as to which witnesses are the most important to
prove the case.                  /;
•I hope this clarifies the matter and that any future cases may proceed more smoothly.

highly improper of you to attempt to discuss the conduct
of the defence with the Presenting Officer. Your
suggestions to replace Mr. Payne as Chairman of the
Tribunal with either his successor or another Chief
Constable under Regulation 14 can only be described
as fatuous.
        You should clearly understand Chief
Superintendent Young strongly resents your comments
on the conduct of presentation.cases elsewhere and
views your remarks as a slur of his professional
integrity. I would like you to clearly understand
I strongly resent your Interference in this matter.
        I derive no pleasure from writing this letter.
I write in the hope the problems as Z see them will
be resolved which is why Z am prepared, for the moment,
to deal with it on a private basis.
                   Yours sincerely,




                Deputy Chief Constable
I hope this clarifies the matter and that any future cases may proceed more smoothly.

 Thank you for your letter of 19 3une about various matters arising from the setting up
 of the tribunal to hear the case arising from the complaint made by Mr K|          | I
 am sorry that we seem to have become involved in a rather acrimonious discussion and
 it may help if I explained the situation as seen from this end.
                                            •

 The first problem arose over the cancellation of the date that had been arranged for the
 tribunal. The Authority try in all cases to m eet the dates requested by Forces.
 However, one hopes that having arranged the date it will be adhered to. I admit that I
 was somewhat irritated when I was told that a message had been received at staff level
 informing us, without any consultation, that the hearing had been cancelled. You will
 appreciate that the members involved had made all their administrative arrangements by
 then and the message, as passed to me, was just a unilateral cancellation. I personally
 telephoned your office to discuss the matter but you were away, which was a pity
 because no doubt we could have sorted the matter out between us. The Authority did,
 of course, conform to the new dates you set, even though we were not consulted.

 As far as the rest of my conversation with Chief Superintendent Young is concerned, as
 I recall it, a new date had not at that time been fixed. It is often the case that
 postponement can mean further lengthy delay before the case is heard and that is unfair
 to both the officer and the complainant. I therefore made various suggestions which
 might have helped to bring the case to a hearing as soon as possible. I well recognise
 that the Authority have no standing in such matters but, as you know, we deal with
 forty eight different Forces, and many of them welcom e our suggestions and advice and
 indeed, many seek it over disciplinary cases in which we are involved. I think this was •
 the first case in which we have directed charges in your Force and perhaps it was
 unwise of me to stray beyond our strict remit on these matters. I shall know in future *
 that Cleveland, unlike some Forces, do not wish to have such discussions. However, we
 are required by the Police and Criminal Evidence A ct 1984 to give the reasons for any
 directions we may make. Therefore it would be in order to include anything which
 contributes to clarifying our reasons to the Force. For example the Authority may, and
 sometimes does, include an indication as to which witnesses are the most important to
 prove the case.
NOTE FOR FILE

RE: HILLSBOROUGH TRIBUNAL

I have today discussed with Mr Jack Ord, Deputy Chief Constable, Cleveland,
the position with regard to setting of a date for tribunal and with a view
to identifying any previous precedent. At a discussion it was suggested
that we should not set a date for tribunal until such   time as chargeshad
been formulated. Once formulated and whether or notservice can beachieved
or not a tribunal date can be set. If, as the date approaches, it is not
possible to proceed then an adjournment can be sought before the tribunal
by the defending counsel setting out the reasons for the request. That
request may be based upon the fact that charges cannot be served due to
the medical condition of the officer involved or perhaps sufficient time
has not been given for considering the evidence etc.

The point made is that once formulated a date can be   fixed and then
adjournments can follow if necessary.

                      Enclosed herewith are copies of the letter of 26 September 1991 from
                      Brigadier Pownall with the copy letters to the complainants which
                      you forwarded for my attention. I have retained the originals.

                      I have noted the comments to Mr Jones and Mr Hicks and I recommend
                      that it would be precedent for all conversations that you or Chief
                      Superintendent Mole may have with the Police Complaints Authority
                      regarding Hillsborough should be made subject of written record and
                      a copy forwarded to me for inclusion in our records.

                      Normal procedure now would be for the 'complainants letters' each
                      to go on the relevant complaint file and necessary administration,
                      including preparation of statistics take place.

                      In the particular circumstances you would wish to consider whether
                      South Yorkshire Police should correspond with the complainants
                      individually.

                      One might expect a reaction from individual complainants and a
                      sympathetic letter might pre-empt the charge of lack of care. One
                      might expect a referral to the media that needs monitoring and perhaps
                      our response predrafted. I have taken no action in these areas
                      awaiting your consideration.

                      May I show Mr Sleightholme this correspondence please?

     Following our telephone conversation of last week, I discussed with
     the Chairman your suggestion of a further meeting between presenting
     counsel and the Authority.   We gave careful consideration to your
     proposal but felt that it would, perhaps, be imposing too great an
     influence from the Authority on matters which are strictly the
     responsibility of the South Yorkshire Police.

     As an alternative way of guiding counsel on the case,as we see it, I
     enclose a note which the Chairman has drafted.   It is very much in
     note form but we hope it will provide some helpful guidance to
     counsel.

     I very much hope that you will soon be in a position to notify us of
     the dates of the tribunal so that we can nominate the Authority
     members.   I would be grateful if you would continue to keep me
     informed if any other difficulties arise.

                                      HILLSBOROUGH

The    charges which the Police Complaints Authority have directed

against Chief Superintendent Dukenfield are very simple and easy to

understand.      This Authority appreciate that the overall enquiry gave
rise    to   a   vast   amount   of    paper-work.    The   case   against   Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield is concerned with a limited area namely his

failure to prevent over-crowding in Pens 3 and 4 and thereby to avert
the ghastly tragedy which resulted.           The charges which this Authority

have specified are deliberately framed so as to point to this failure
at three distinct stages, namely Charge 1. - to the time before the

crowds started to arrive;         Charge 2. - to the time between the first

arrival of the fans and the opening of Gate C;              and Charge 3. - the

time after Gate C was opened.           The charges are specified so as to keep

the issues within manageable limits.            They are in no way intended to
suggest that no-one else was responsible for the tragedy.



Charges 1,       2 and 3 are framed under Regulation 4 of the Police

(Discipline) Regulations 1985.           In order to prove any one of the three

charges (and, indeed the separate charge against Superintendent Murray

which mirrors charge 3 against Chief Superintendent Duckenfield) the

presenter of the charges must prove, beyond reasonable doubt, that the
officer charged:-



       (i)   was a member of a police force;         and



       (ii) that he was under a duty as a police officer to attend to

       or carry out certain things, namely in this case those things
     necessary for the proper control and safety of those members of

     the public who attended the match;          and



   (iii)    that, he neglected or omitted to carry out such

            things with due promptitude or diligence.


Proof of good and sufficient cause,          however,   lies on the officer

charged on the balance of probabilities.         Of these essential elements
in each charge (i) and (ii) apply to all three equally.

(i) is unlikely to be the subject of dispute.



(ii) May not be contested.



If it is, brief evidence may need to be called as to the fact that not

only had the police accepted responsibility for crowd control and
safety     on   behalf   of   the   Club   but   that   Chief   Superintendent

Duckenfield, who was in charge of the police,           knew this full well -
and accepted this.



Evidence:-      Operational Order

                The pre-match briefings



Evidence from Club - and if necessary, senior officers, if this is

disputed.



NB. Case of Harris v South Yorkshire Police which is referred to in
Taylor's report at page 29.
Duckenfield's evidence before the Coroner with regard to safety at
page 41, 43, 71, 82 at which he said:-



     On page 41 re pre-match briefing to Inspectors:


          (E)    "We (the police) must ensure the safety o f

          the public inside and outside the                ground."


          (F)    "I     cannot    stress     too    highly    the     word

                 'safety'".



          (G)    "Our     (the     police)    job     is     to   ensure     the
                 safety of spectators".



     On page    43 "Safetyof supporters in this             ground is paramount":



          (D -G) rebriefingto officers - same format.


     On page    71:              (D) See passage.



     On page    82:              (C)   "Certainly not        so much in      the

                              pens, but the whole ground, monitoring of

                              safety and levels was crucial".



In view of these answers and of the fact that police 'controlled' the

crowd, which must imply a responsibility for safety, in common-sense,

there may not be any dispute but that he was in charge of a police

operation which was concerned with the safety of spectators.
Hereafter references to his evidence before the Coroner which was

given on oath,    under caution and after warnings that he was not

obliged to answer will be by reference to the transcript with a page
number.



(iii)    In respect   of the three   charges which the Authority have

directed and specified - the particulars will differ because the

charges deal with different stages.     Particulars may be sought.   If

they are it is for Counsel to draft them.       The basic charge will
stand.    The charge must be proved but this does not necessitate the
proof of all particulars (cf Machent v Quinn 1970 AER 255) but it does

mean that each member of the Tribunal must be agreed as to the proof

of a particular before it can convict of the charge (cf R v Brown 1983

79 CR App R 115).



If particulars are not sought Counsel will have to decide whether to

deliver them or provide the defence with a copy of his opening.


I have set out particulars which illustrate the case as the Authority

would wish it presented.    Where appropriate I have put page numbers

in brackets indicating references to the transcript.   Where the number

has a (2) after it this means it is in the second sequence of numbers

dealing with evidence on 13 March 1991.    It is for Counsel to decide

what particulars he relies on.



Charge No l



Chief Superintendent Duckenfield neglected or omitted to carry out his

duty as a police officer as alleged in that he:-
(a)   took   over as       operational        commander           (47C)      in

      overall        command         (67G)      without             adequate

      preparation;


(b)   signed       the   operational         order         without        first

      visiting the ground;



(c)   relied    on an      operational        order        drawn     up      by
      someone else without further enquiry and accepted
      it as 'tried and tested' on the basis that it has
      been     operated     satisfactorily            on    two     previous

      occasions;



(d)   failed to brief himself adequately or to prepare

      for emergencies;



(e)   failed to acquaint himself with the layout of and

      facilities at the ground so as to be able to deal
      with     emergencies       (68C,       89(2),        90(2))    and        in

      particular:-



             (i)     did not know of association between

             turnstiles A-G and Leppings Lane Terrace

             (74C);



             (ii)    did   not      know where         Gate       "C"     was        (53C)   and

                     (25 (2) B) ;
             (iii) did not acquaint himself with the sign-posting
             (68D);



             (iv) did not acquaint himself with Club requirement or
                    know of print-out which the Club were able to

                    provide (50 B);


             (v)    did not know of the 'penning' in Leppings Lane

                    Terrace (44B and C), (but cf 72 D or ignored it

                        79 ) ;



(f)   failed to appreciate the lay out of Leppings Lane

      Terrace and in particular of the effect of the
      radial fences between Pens 3 and 4 and Pens 1 and

      2 and 5, 6 and 7 and the absence of any proper

      exits in case of emergency, thereby making over­

      crowding      a    very    dangerous   circumstance    which

      required special consideration.           Many references.


(g)   accepted "find your own level" on the Lepping

      Lane Terrace when even a cursory glance would

      have   made       it   clear   that    such   a   policy   was

      unworkable (44B).



(h)   failed to provide any contingency plan if these

      pens became overcrowded (90D-E).



(i)   failed to enquire and did not know whether the

      police or the Club were to act as stewards, in
particular    in   relation   to   the   Leppings   Lane

Terrace and made no such enquiries (68E and 77,

78, 92C);



failed to provide any police stewarding at the
entrance to the Tunnel to Pens 3 and 4;


failed to provide for crowd numbers in Pens 3 and

4 to be monitored (77C and 77G,          78A);



failed to read, or, if he read, to take any steps
to apply the recommendations on the Green Book as
to crowd density (71);



failed   to   heed   the   ACPO    recommendation   with

regard to the drawing up of a schedule as to

police and Club crowd management or to ensure

that such a schedule was drawn up, or to enquire
as to whether this was done (68, 69);



failed to make any or any adequate enquiries as

to police intelligence about the football clubs

concerned;



failed to make any plan to encourage the even

distribution of spectators on the Leppings Lane
Terrace (91);
     (p)   failed to meet Club officials prior to 15 April

           1989 or to rearrange a meeting with them (38).

Charge No 2



This charge   is concerned with Chief   Superintendent Duckenfield's

neglect or omission during the period between the first arrivals of

spectators and the opening of Gate C.



Suggested particulars:-



     (a)   failed to monitor crowd security in Pens 3 and 4

           and to observe the build up of spectators in

           those pens (60, 31(2));



     (b)   failed to get print out of numbers of spectators

           who had entered the ground (49H);
     (c)   gave an order to a police constable to ask people

           to move forward and spread out but failed to

           ensure that this was carried out (52B);



     (d)   prior to the opening of Gate C failed to observe

           or to take action consequent upon the obvious

           over-filling of Pens 3 and 4 and the under use of

           Pens 1, 2, 6, and 7 or to draw the conclusion
           from this that the spectators on the Leppings

           Lane Terrace were not, and could not, find their
           own level (4(2));



     (e)   failed to control further entry by spectators

           into Pens 3 and 4 by placing police officers at

           the entry to the Tunnel.


Evidence. Plans, photos, videos, Duckenfield's evidence to Coroner.


Charge 3



This charge is concerned with the failure of Chief Superintendent

Duckenfield and Superintendent Murray to provide for the control and

stewarding of spectators coming through Gate C when it was opened.



Suggested particulars



     (a)   failed   to   provide   any   control   over   spectators   coming

           through Gate C.
failed    to   appreciate      that these     spectators       would   be

likely to go to the Tunnel.


failed to      observe that Pens             3 and       4 were already,    a

obviously,     overcrowded       -    and     that,      if      further

spectators     were     to   enter   these   Pens,    there would      be

danger of injury and death (3(2) C and D);


failed to take any steps to monitor or control

entry in Pens 3 and 4 (5(2), 6 and 7);



failed    to   inform    Superintendent      Greenwood    in

whose sector Gate C the concourse behind Leppings

Lane   Terrace    and    the   terrace   were   situated.

(1 2 (2 ));


failed to inform the Club, or anyone else, of the

opening of Gate "C" (13 D, E);



failed to observe a surge of spectators in Pens

3 and 4 (22(2)F - 23(2)C);



failed to observe overcrowding in Pens 3 and 4 or

disparity between these pens and Pens 1, 2, 6 and

7 or that anything was wrong before spectators

came from Pens 3 and 4 onto the pitch (31(2)) ; or

to take any action whether by relaying a message

or otherwise (21(2) and 22(2));
     (i)   failed to exercise those reasonable qualities of

           command expected of an 'overall commander' in the

           emergency.      [This was, the PCA believe, largely

           because    of    his   lack     of   preparation   and
           forethought, as particularised in Charge 1.]

    Mr

                                                  Our Ref:   COM 91/131/35

    J L iv e rp o o l,                                a(. September,      1991




    You will recall that we wrote to you on 3 July 1990 and again on 11
    July 1991 after receiving the report of the investigation into your
    complaints about the conduct of officers of the South Yorkshire Police
    at Hillsborough in April 1989.      As you know, the Authority have
    considered the disciplinary aspects of the case and I enclose another
    copy of the note which explains the independent role of the Authority
    in the complaints procedure and some of the factors which are taken
    into account before a decision is reached.

    The aim of this letter is to explain to you the outcome of your
    specific complaints.

    The investigation has shown that the officer patrolling the perimeter
    track about whom you complained has regularly policed football matches
    at Hillsborough and is familiar with the problems associated with
    capacity crowds.

   On 15 April 1989 this officer was not briefed specifically about
   potential overcrowding but was conscious of orders that the perimeter
   gates should only be opened under strictly controlled circumstances
   and on the command of a senior officer. He was relieved from his post
   on the track from 13.45 hours until his return at 14.50 hours when he
   says that Pens 3 and 4 had filled considerably. He did not consider
   supporters to be in any distress or to be affected by overcrowding at
   the time and describes the normal swaying movements of supporters.
   However, as the swaying and pushing became more marked and he heard
   cries of distress he attempted to contact the Police Control Room via
   his personal radio but when he was unable to hear any acknowledgement
   he opened the gate on his own initiative and assisted people onto the
   perimeter track.
The officer denied swearing at you or anyone else and there is no
evidence from any other source to support this allegation.
It is likely that due to the urgency of the situation your removal
from the actual playing area was carried out hastily and not with the
care which the police would normally take. However, we think it is
unlikely that the police action caused you other than minor discomfort
as the investigation has shown that you refused treatment for your
injury until the match had been abandoned.

The Authority note that you have been unable to identify the two
officers involved from the video recording which you have been shown
and exhaustive enquiries have failed to identify positively either
officer.

The Authority have noted that the Crown Prosecution Service have
already informed you that they do not consider the evidence sufficient
to justify criminal charges against any police officer.; The Assistant
Chief Constable has written to the Authority proposing that no
disciplinary action be taken against any officer because, in his
opinion, there is insufficient evidence on which to base any charge
and because the officers cannot be identified.

The Authority have carefully studied all the papers contained in the
report of the investigation and have concluded that disciplinary
action cannot be taken as a result of your complaints, although, as
I told you in my letter of 11 August 1991 two officers are to face
disciplinary charges arising from other complaints.

A copy of this letter has been sent to the Assistant Chief Constable
and to your solicitor.

    CHESHIRE,




    You will recall that we wrote to you on 18 September 1990 regarding
    your complaints against officers of the South Yorkshire Police and I
    promised to write further concerning the actions of officers inside
    the stadium.  I enclose another copy of the note which explains the
    independent role of the Authority in the complaints procedure and some
    of the factors which are taken into account before a decision is
    reached.

   We have carefully considered your statement concerning the treatment
   of the man you describe as being bundled off the pitch on to the track
   beside the grass. The Crown Prosecution Service have already decided
   that they do not consider the evidence sufficient to justify criminal
   charges against any police officer and this decision has been conveyed
   to the person involved, who complained in his own right about the
   incident.

   Exhaustive enquiries have been undertaken into everything that
   occurred at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989. They show that while the
   incident you witnessed on the playing area was carried out with some
   haste, the circumstances were such that the police could not be as
   careful as they would normally be.    However, the investigation has
   been unable to establish the identity of either of the officers
   involved. The Assistant Chief Constable has written to the Authority
   to say that disciplinary action cannot, therefore, be taken.

   The Authority have carefully studied all the papers contained in the
   report of the investigation and have concluded that no disciplinary
   action can be taken.
I am sorry that it has taken some time to conclude this part of your
complaint, but there is a statutory procedure laid down and we had to
await the outcome of the inquest before we could consider the matter
ourselves.

A copy of this letter has been sent to the Assistant Chief Constable.

    You will recall that we wrote to you on 15 August 1990 and again on
    11 July 1991 after receiving the report of the investigation into your
    complaints about the conduct of officers of the South Yorkshire Police
    at Hillsborough in April 1989.      As you know, the Authority have
    considered the disciplinary aspects of the case and I enclose another
    copy of the note which explains the independent role of the Authority
    in the complaints procedure and some of the factors which are taken
    into account before a decision is reached.

    May I first of all express the Authority's very sincere sympathy at
    the tragic loss of your son John.

    The aim of this letter is to explain to you the outcome of your
    specific complaints and how that relates to the disciplinary hearings
    which the Authority have directed.

    Your first complaint was that Superintendent Marshall failed to
    prevent the build-up of fans in Leppings Lane and that he should not
    have requested the opening of the gates.

   In giving his account of the situation, Superintendent Marshall said
   that at 14.15 hours the fans were moving along Leppings Lane in a
   controlled manner and he had no reason at that time to suppose that
   they would not get safely into the ground before kick-off. However,
   only two minutes later there was a sudden surge in the number of
   supporters and at 14.17 hours he requested that the road be closed to
   traffic.  There was some delay in achieving this, but the road was
   eventually closed at about 14.30 hours. Even at that time the officer
   said that the crowd remained in good humour with no signs of panic.
   However, the mood changed abruptly some fourteen minutes later to one
   of impatience and hostility and, despite broadcast requests, the
   police were unable to regain co-operation from the supporters in that
   area.
Superintendent Marshall, who had no means of knowing the situation
inside the ground, was faced with the probability of fatalities in the
turnstile area, unless the pressure could be relieved.      As he was
unable to turn the crowd back, he had no alternative but to request
the opening of the gate in order to allow them to move forward. The
Authority considered that from his perspective it was not unreasonable
for Superintendent Marshall to request Gate 'C' to be opened. It is
the Authority's view that before granting permission to open that gate
the implications of doing so should have been considered and steps
taken to deal with the rush of fans which would ensue. Once authority
had been given for Gate 'C' to be opened and the supporters had moved
into the stadium they had gone out of Superintendent Marshall's sight
and his area of command.
The Authority have carefully studied all the available evidence
concerning the tragic events at Hillsborough, and have concluded that
no disciplinary action should be taken against Superintendent
Marshall.                                          :
You also complained that Chief Superintendent Duckenfield should not
have authorised the opening of the gate under any circumstances.
However, the Authority take the view that this decision was not in
itself necessarily wrong but that before granting permission to open
that gate the implications of doing so should have been considered and
steps taken to deal with the rush of fans that would ensue. This is
the basis of the charges being preferred against Chief Superintendent
Duckenfield, who was in overall charge of the policing arrangements,
and which I referred to in my letter of 11 July, 1991 rather than the
specific point about which you complained.
A copy of this letter has been sent to the Assistant Chief Constable.

                  M   .


    You will recall that we wrote to you on 15 August 1990 and again on
    11 July 1991 after receiving the report of the investigation into your
    complaint about the conduct of an officer of the South Yorkshire
    Police at Hillsborough in April 1989.

    As you know, the Authority have considered the disciplinary aspects
    of the case and I enclose another copy of the note which explains the
    independent role of the Authority in the complaints procedure and some
    of the factors which are taken into account before a decision is
    reached.

    The aim of this letter is to explain to you the outcome of the
    specific complaint which you made.

    The investigation has shown that the officer you complained about has
    regularly patrolled football matches at Hillsborough over the past
    seven years and is, therefore, familiar with the problems associated
    with capacity crowds. Indeed, it is clear that on previous occasions
    he has dealt with minor over-crowding problems on his own initiative
    by transferring spectators from the central pens to less crowded areas
    of the terraces.

    On 15 April 1989 the officer was not briefed specifically regarding
    potential over-crowding but was conscious of orders that the perimeter
    gates should only be opened under strictly controlled circumstances
    and on the command of a senior officer.

   He was relieved from his post on the perimeter track from 13.45 hours
   until his return at 14.50 hours when he says that Pens 3 and 4 had
   filled considerably. He did not, at that time, consider the fans to
   be in any distress nor to be affected by over-crowding. The officer
   described how, when the teams came out, the surge of the crowd caused
   a gate to come open but no one attempted to leave the pen and he was
   able to close the gate. He said that it was only when the gate was
forced open a second time and had to be held closed that he heard
cries of distress and noticed that people were pressed against the
perimeter fence. He attempted to contact the Police Control Room via
his personal radio but when his message was not acknowledged he gave
instructions, on his own initiative, to other officers to open the
gate and allow people onto the perimeter track. Following the opening
of the gate the pressure of so many people attempting to escape
prevented an orderly exit and the officer stood on the advertising
hoardings where he shouted and signalled for the crowd to move back.
In the light of the officer's explanation it is likely that what you
saw was him pushing people back, not to prevent their escape, but to
try to free those who had fallen to the ground at the front of the
terrace and who were therefore delaying access to the track.

I am not sure whether you are aware that there are a number of
witnesses who have commended the officer for his prompt action once
he realised the serious nature of the situation. The Authority are
of the opinion that there was nothing more he could have done in the
circumstances.
The Authority have noted that the Crown Prosecution Service have
already informed you that they do not consider the evidence sufficient
to justify criminal charges against any police officer. The Assistant
Chief Constable has written to the Authority proposing that no
disciplinary action be taken against the officer because, in his
opinion, there is insufficient evidence on which to base any charge.

The Authority have carefully studied all the papers contained in the
report of the investigation into your complaint and have concluded
that disciplinary action would not be justified.    The disciplinary
charges I referred to in my letter of 11 July concern two of the
senior officers who had overall responsibility for the policing
arrangements.
A copy of this letter has been sent to the Assistant Chief Constable.

    You will recall that we wrote to you on 15 August 1990 and again on
    11 July 1991 after receiving the report of the investigation into your
    complaint about the conduct of an officer of the South Yorkshire
    Police at Hillsborough in April 1989. As you know, the Authority have
    considered the disciplinary aspects of the case and I enclose another
    copy of the note which explains the independent role of the Authority
    in the complaints procedure and some of the factors which are taken
    into account before a decision is reached.

    The aim of this letter is to explain the outcome of your specific
    complaint.

    Firstly, I would like to express the condolences and sympathy over the
    tragic loss of your son, Adam, not only on behalf of myself, but also
    on behalf of the Authority.

   The investigation has shown that PC Illingworth has regularly policed
   football matches at Hillsborough and is consequently familiar with the
   problems associated with capacity crowds.

   On 15 April 1989 he was not briefed specifically regarding potential
   over-crowding but was conscious of orders that the perimeter gates
   should only be opened under controlled circumstances and on the
   command of a senior officer.    PC Illingworth was relieved from his
   post on the track from 13.45 hours until his return at 14.50 hours and
   during that time he says that Pens 3 and 4 had filled considerably.
   He did not consider supporters to be in any distress or to be affected
   by over-crowding and describes the normal swaying movements of
   supporters. However, as the swaying and pushing became more marked
   and when he heard cries of distress the officer attempted to contact
   the Police Control Room but being unable to hear any acknowledgement
   he opened the gate on his own initiative and assisted people onto the
   perimeter track.

                     DISCLOSURE OF 'HILLSBOROUGH MATERIAL'


Forwarded herewith is a copy of an advice from R C Johnston concerning
the disclosure of Hillsborough material.

We spoke on Thursday respecting the maintenance of this policy of
non-disclosure that remitted from this advice and you stated that
it was your intention to stay with this policey.

Letters are from time to time being received asking for copies of
items of material and presently they are forwarded to me here at
Hammerton Road. I recommend that they be acknowledged at your office
on receipt and that acknowledgement should be in the form of one or
more standard letters drafted to your personal satisfaction. The
letter with copy correspondence should then be sent to me for filing
in our papers.

Obviously I might draft such letters, but it represents a diversion
from my present occupation and not desirable.  I do not have immediate
typing power at my disposal, nor are you and I easily able to confer
as to the wording of the different letters involved.  I wonder if
you would care to discuss with Chief Superintendent Mole your policy
so that perhaps he would sign letters on your behalf in this area.

TELEPHONE CONVERSATION WITH BRIGADIER POWNALL, PCA
ON WEDNESDAY 25 SEPTEMBER 1991




Mr Moore           "I promised to ring you when I got back from holiday.      I just
                   wanted to let you know the ... an update really."



Brig Pownall       "Yes, how do we stand?"



Mr Moore           "Well, I had a meeting with Sleightholme on Monday and really
                   he's brought a few issues forward which caused me quite a
                   bit of concern.         I think its ... if I can just run through
                   them briefly.         He is concerned that ... he started to read
                   the material ... he came back on September 25th from his
                   holidays and I think as you agreed it would probably take
                   about three months to read through the material before he
                   prepared the charges.        Was that the result of your meeting -
                   I d o n 11 k n o w ."



Brig Pownall       "No, I mean, if he'd listened to what the Chairman told him
                   at great length and several times, too, its not necessary.
                   He's just making heavy weather of it.      We spent, I should
                   think,  two hours with him briefing him and he said he
                   understood the situation and he's just making heavy weather
                   of it, and if he still doesn't understand I suggest he comes
                   down here again and we'll try again to put him in the picture.
                   It's a simple matter and we'll actually give him the doc ...
                   list the documents, if that's the problem, for him to read."



Mr Moore           "Well, having read some of the documents he's found that some
                   of the key statements are unsigned and undated, and that what
                   is purported to be evidence are merely recollections or answers
                   to questionnaires.    He finds that much of the content of
                   statements is irrelevant to the discipline charges.     He also
                   found that many witnesses who obviously can give material
                   evidence have not been asked for their evidence, for example,
                   many of the people present in the Boardroom, Charge 5, have
                   not apparently been approached to give evidence.    He suggests
                   that witnesses who give some evidence, for example Mackrell,
                   do not expand on the relevant points.    He also suggests that
                   many of the statements do not contain material that the
                   witnesses gave to Lord Justice Taylor Enquiry or the Inquest.
                   He also says that until it's established what the witnesses
                   will say it's impractical to formulate charges and establish
                   who are the best witnesses to prove the case and fulfil the
                   duty to make it plain to the accused on what evidence the
                   charge relies so that the accused can prepare his defence.
                   He also says that statements are needed ..... "



Brig Pownall       "Well look, don't go on, I mean
                                                           II

Mr Moore       "I think ... he is expressing a great deal of concern."



Brig Pownall   "Yes, well, all I can say is the Chairman, who is a very
               considerably more experienced Barrister and Judge than he,
               has been through these papers; he's heard cases galore as
               a Judge and as a practising Barrister of some distinction,
               and he doesn't see all these problems and he can see it all
               from a legal point of view, so I'm afraid I don't ..., you
               know ..., my immediate reaction ..., I mean I think he'd better
               come down here, Mr Sleightholme, and we'll ... I mean I can
               answer quite a lot of them and certainly the Chairman can
               answer all these points if he's not clear on what is required."



Mr Moore       "Do you think it might be      useful if, in order to get a ...
               you see I'm concerned.    I    get the impression that you feel
               that we're not doing our      job properly here, because in our
               last conversation you said    that you thought we might be trying
               to delay the matters, which    I don't think is fair, and ... "



Brig Pownall   "But we do want to get on with it."



Mr Moore       "Absolutely, but I ... would it be helpful, do you think,
               if Judge Petre and yourself perhaps came to look at where
               we're doing our work on    the Hillsborough matter? - saw the
               material that we're preparing and the team, and had a meeting
               there, because I think that would re-assure Sleightholme and
               it might be helpful to Judge Petre and yourself just to see,
               in situ, the ... to discuss it with the material around and
               see what we're doing, because I'd feel re-assured and I would
               like to show you that we are actually putting an awful lot
               of effort into it."



Brig Pownall   "I'm sure.   You know I think    you're putting it, if I may say
               so, more seriously than    is    needed.  I mean the issues are
               really comparatively simple."



Mr Moore       "I wish they were but all the advice I'm getting is that they
               a r e n 't ."



Brig Pownall   "I know, I know you are. I'm afraid     to say that ..., I mean
               I've seen this in many cases that we    deal with, and you know
               even much much lesser things than this - it's a sort of tactic.
               I mean, I don't mean it offensively or rudely, but I can see
               no other reason."
                                  - 3 -




Mr Moore       "But you can see the position I'm in - really, having engaged
               Counsel, it really ..., I can't really say that .... "


Brig Pownall   "I know, I realise that, I mean .... "



Mr Moore       "I really think it would be useful if, particularly Judge
               Petre and yourself ..., they can talk law together can't they."



Brig Pownall   "Yes, I think he is ... you know, I wouldn't ..., but certainly
               the Chairman has and he's got it absolutely clear in his mind,
               you know, what we have in mind, and he expresses it, I think,
               extremely well when you hear him in conference round the
               table."



Mr Moore       "Yes, and perhaps it would be Sleightholme and he would be
               able to have a much better dialogue now that Sleightholme
               has got a grip of the material."



Brig Pownall   "Yes, it may be that     our last discussion was   sort of   a   bit
               early, before he'd had   a chance to look."



Mr Moore       "I think he feels that he was operating in a bit of a vacuum."



Brig Pownall   "He can't possibly present every witness and    every case and
               that's why the Chairman suggested that the very most he should
               be able to present his case within a week, ie five sort of
               sitting days."



Mr Moore       "Yes."



Brig Pownall   "And, of course, he's got to be selective, he can't possibly
               produce every witness and all these statements to be made
               at every different thing.    He's got to be selective.  What
               he's got to do is put the case clearly based on 'x' number
               of witnesses and statements which are there."



Mr Moore       "A problem he's raised, though, which does concern me is that
               certain of the key statements which we would want to use or
               he suggests we would want to use are incomplete or .... "



Brig Pownall   "Yes, that may be a point.   I'd like to see which ones."
                                          - 4 -


Mr Moore       "Yes, and     it   needs    to     be   a   detailed   discussion   doesn't     it,
               really?"



Brig Pownall   "Yes, absolutely, I mean I don't know which ones he's referring
               to but it may be that he's got a point on some of them.       I
               just wouldn't know.    Perhaps we ought to look at them.      I
               think what I'd better do is ... I will talk to the Chairman
               and, as you suggest, I think I will try and persuade him that
               the right thing to do is for us to come up and have a talk
               with you on site."



Mr Moore       "I think it will be really helpful because I think also what
               it might give is an impression of the mass of material - I
               know you are aware of that."



Brig Pownall   "I realise that, and Mr Sleightholme described to us,                           you
               know, the room, but I think you've got to cut through                           all
               that and just look at the essentials.        This is what                       the
               Chairman kept on trying to put over to him."



Mr Moore       "As we discussed before, I'm happy to be advised on this."



Brig Pownall   "Yes, of course, I well realise that but                   I think    if   we   get
               Barrister talking to Barrister then .... "



Mr Moore       "I think we can observe them, can't we?"



Brig Pownall   "Yes, I'll come back to you later this morning, Mr Moore,
               and hopefully with a date. Now I would like to think it might
               even be tomorrow or the next day - or early next week.    Are
               there any days that are particularly unsatisfactory from your
               point of view?"



Mr Moore       "Well, Sleightholme is available ... he prefers Thursday or
               Friday next week - I think he is in Court on Monday, Tuesday
               and Wednesday."



Brig Pownall   "And not before then?"



Mr Moore       "It would be difficult for me to .... "



Brig Pownall   "Yes.  Look, let me see the Chairman, Mr Moore, and I'll come
               back to you, but next week only Thursday and Friday?"



Mr Moore       "Yes.   OK.    Bye bye."

                   (Discipline & Complaints)


                  SUBJECT:         THE HILLSBOROUGH DISCIPLINE PRESENTATION


                   At the conclusion of your discussions today with Mr Sleightholme you
                   asked me to set out briefly the problems identified with a view to
                   your contacting Brigadier Pownall and inviting him and Judge Petre
                   to come to Sheffield to see the material and discuss the issues.

                   The problems need to be addressed and an agreed method of solving
                   them formulated now so that:-

                   a.   it can be made manifest that South Yorkshire Police are anxious
                        to ensure a thorough and proper presentation;

                   b.   the grounds for any future appeal from the Tribunal's decisions
                        can be avoided;

                   c.   delay is minimised, and;

                   d.   the Tribunal runs smoothly because the problems have been
                        previously ironed out.

                   The problems identified are:-

                   1.   The West Midlands Police enquiry did not produce witness
                        statements that can be conveniently used for service under
                        Regulation 10 or for Regulation 19 procedures.

                           a.   Many of the 'statements' are unsigned and undated
                                recollections or answers to questionnaires.  For example,
                                Kelly.

                        b.      Much of the content of 'statements' is irrelevant to the
                                discipline charges.

                        c.      Many witnesses who obviously can give material evidence
                                have not been asked for their evidence. For example, many
                                of the people present in the Board Room (Charge 5) have
                                not apparently been approached to give evidence.

                        d.      Witnesses who give some evidence, for example Mackrell,
                                do not expand the relevant points.

                        e.      Many of the 'statements' do not contain material that the
                                witnesses gave to the Lord Justice Taylor enquiry and the
                                Inquest.




   GEN/2
2.      Until it is established what the witnesses will say it is
         impractical to formulate charges and establish who are the best
        witnesses to prove the case and fulfil the duty to make it plain
         to the accused on what evidence the charge relies so that the
         accused can prepare his defence.

3.      Statements are needed to provide technical proof of what the
         accused officers said to Lord Justice Taylor Enquiry or to the
         Inquest.

4.      Statements are needed to provide technical proof of plans,
         photographs, documents etc to be used in presentation.

5.      The question of who is to obtain the testimony statements and
         the non contentious formal statements.

6   .   It may be that West Midlands Police should be asked to complete
         this work, but that raises questions concerning West Midlands,
         Mr Sharp and the Police Complaints Authority supervision.

7.      The service under Regulation 10 problem:-

        a.   Evidence in support of charges needs to be determined so
              that service occurs at the time or shortly after the service
              of disciplinary form. Unrealistic to consider 21 days -
              the accused will need considerable time.

        b.   Other statements.  Difficult to    comply with Regulation 10,
              so we rely on goodwill of Chief   Superintendent Duckenfield.

8   .   Assistant Chief Constable Jackson obviously can give his account
        of the conversation in the police control box and the later
        conversation in the Board Room and perhaps other evidence relating
        to other charges. He has yet to make a statement. Who should
        take it?

   To   :   Chief Superintendent Mole                         Date :            5 September 1991




            SUBJECT:    Hillsborough    —'

            The present position respecting the disciplinary proceedings arising
            from the Hillsborough disaster is that with the knowledge and approval
            of PCA (which came from a telephone conversation) no disciplinary
            charges have been served and no arrangements have been made for the
            Tribunal. Mr John Newing, Chief Constable of Derbyshire Constabulary
            has agreed to chair the Tribunal and has been consulted (by telephone)
            on tribunal arrangements.

            The responsibility for organising the Tribunal rests with South
            Yorkshire Police Authority which will foot the bill. The arrangements
            will be done via Stephen Walker.  No arrangements can be set in motion
            until there is a date organised and a notion of the timescale,
            witnesses, technical needs of the Tribunal etc. Presently the thinking
            is to use a local authority building (e.g Sheffield Town Hall) and
            engage Messrs Harpham's for transcript requirements. The dates will
            need to fit in with Mr Newing's timetable, PCA members' timetable,
            Counsels' timetable and of course witnesses to be called by either
            side.

            Stephen Walker has engaged Mr Sleightholme of Counsel to advise on
            the wording of the charges and prepare the case and, probably, present
            the case. Mr Sleightholme has been to London and conferred with PCA.
            They accepted at the time that he could not advise on the charges until
            he had read the evidence to support the charges and this would take
            at least three months.  The timetable thus is dependent on that. He
            will not begin really until he returns from his holiday in USA on
            25 September 1991 and may be delayed by his other commitments.
            Assuming the best scenario we should be in a position to serve charges
            three months from 25 September 1991-   I suggest a working date of say
            2 January 1992. One would expect in the exceptional circumstances
            of the case that the accused officers' representatives would seek to
            have three months to consider the position (albeit outside the
            requirements of Regulations) so that firm decisions as to the date,
            duration and conduct of the Tribunal, or tribunals could be made say
            2 April 1992. The case to be presented would by then hopefully have
            been prepared.

            There would need to be further time to prepare the cases for the
            accused officers, say three months, so that an anticipated date for
            the Tribunal actually to sit I would see as not before 2 July 1992,
            with obviously further allowance for slippage.

            The question of service of discipline forms on officers who are off
            duty sick is one that is decided on the circumstances of any particular
            case. The welfare of the officer would seem paramount and providence ■ i
            indicates medical opinion in cases of doubt should prevail.            *

            I see nothing to say that the date of the Tribunal should not be fixed
            forthwith provided it was to a date beyond the wildest dreams of delay.
            A more sensible course in my view, however, would be to await an
            opinion from Mr Sleightholme, who might be able to liaise with other
            counsel and counsel arrive at an estimate on which to base action.

GEN/2
There is a possibility that Mr Sleightholme might advance a view on
the efficacy of the charges that might prevail on PCA to reconsider
the position. There is a possibility that the medical condition of
Chief Superintendent Duckenfield would in the future prevail on PCA
to reconsider the position.  If a Tribunal date is pre-set this would
pre-empt any decision respecting Superintendent Murray. Once set it
is hard to envisage abandonment.  Once set it is hard to bring forward.

Perhaps it is the Murray hearing that has caused the push by PCA for
a date while they know Mr Sleightholme is in America.

            On Thursday 29 August 1991 Assistant Chief Constable Mr Moore received
            a telephone call from Brigadier Pownall at the PCA enquiring as to
            the delay in setting the date for the Tribunal.

            Suggestions were made that the Tribunal date should be set without
            charges having been preferred and papers served and that every effort
            should be made to progress the enquiry in this manner.

            As a consequence of the conversation will you please provide an up
            to date report setting out the position with regard to your preparation
            of papers and liaison with Counsel.

            In addition I would appreciate your views concerning the propriety
            of setting a tribunal date without charges being served and any
            precedent for such a course of conduct.

            A further aspect concerns the service of any papers upon an individual
            on sick leave, particularly in the circumstances of Chief
            Superintendent Duckenfield and any information as to precedent in this
            direction would also be of value.

            In view of the attitude of the PCA there is some urgency in this matter
            but it has been agreed that we will not respond until Mr Moore returns
            from annual leave on the 23 September 1991• In view of this can you
            please prepare your comments as above for my attention by 13 September

HILLSBOROUGH


At 4.00 pm on     Thursday 29 August, 1991, Brigadier Pownall   telephoned as       he
was  concerned    about  the  delay  in setting  a date   for   the tribunal        re
Hillsborough.

He made the reasonable suggestion that a tribunal date     should be set without
the charges having been served on Duckenfield or Murray.

I expressed surprise at this and said that I thought it would amount to
oppressive conduct as Chief Superintendent Duckenfield was sick with stress
and had been told  not to deal with any issue at all relating to Hillsborough.

Brigadier Pownall   then went on at length as to how the public was fed up with
police officers using this method of 'getting away with it' ....   et al.

I agreed to contact the Brigadier after my holiday, on 24 September.

I told him (after he had hinted that we might be criticised for the delay)
that I would consider such criticism unfair as we had engaged Counsel and had
a full-time team preparing papers to support charges.

There might be a time - not yet - when unnecessary delay may be argued, but
that would only be when all charges were prepared and papers were ready to
serve under Regulation 10.

Not a friendly telephone conversation.

I told Brigadier    Pownall that I would be unhappy following this course           of
action, and that I would consider it further before discussing it with him.

             SUBJECT:      SEPARATE TRIBUNAL ISSUE


             When discipline charges are to be preferred, decisions as to the hearing
             rest with you.

             You may decide that officer A   and officer B facing charges arising from
             a single set of circumstances   may be heard together or separate.  In
             arriving at your decision you   must have regard to the practicalities
             and the need for fairness and   natural justice. You might of your
             volition decide to separate.

             When you decide not to separate, then:-

             1.   Paragraph 14 of Annex H - either of the offiors may request you
                  to grant separate hearings. You must decide whether to separate.

             2.   Even if you decide the hearing should be together after receiving
                  the request, the issue would be capable of being raised, in my
                  view, before the presiding officer (or tribunal) as it touches
                  on the fairness of the hearing, the presentation of evidence, the
                  calling of witnesses, all matters I would suppose which are the
                  responsibility of the presiding officer to ensure the fairness
                  of the hearing.

HILLSBOROUGH


I saw Maureen Oades at her office in Barnsley today (24 July), and we spoke about
a variety of issues concerning Hillsborough.     In particular, we discussed the
process of allowing our Counsel, Mr John Trevor Sleightholme,        to have the
opportunity to comment on the charges preferred by the PCA prior to serving them
on Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendent Murray.

It was agreed that she would write to Counsel and ask him:-

      a)     if he was able to comment on the charges immediately,

      b)     whether he would need a longer time-scale   to   enable   him to
             reasonably comment on the charges, and

      c)     what was the likely time-scale within which he would be able
             to comment on the charges for the benefit of the PCA.



It was agreed that until we had this information from Counsel it would not be
possible to reply to Brigadier Pownall at the PCA, and that   when a reply was
received from Mr Sleightholme, Maureen Oades would contact me  and I, inturn,
would consult with Brigadier Pownall.

    Dear Mr Moore,
    RE;HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER IS APRIL 19S9
     I write with reference to your letter dated 23 July 1991 and note that Brigadier
     Pownall wishes Counsel to look at the charges proposed.
    As I understand the Brigadier would like Counsel's response by the end of this
    week I am obliged to enquire on what basis he wishes Counsel to comment on the
    charges. If Counsel is to be asked to advise on the wording of the charges in
    relation to the available evidence, I fall to see how this can be achieved by
    the end of the week in view of the time it will take him to consider the
    evidence. In the light of this and the forthcoming Summer Vacation I consider
    that we would be exceedingly fortunate to receive such advice by the end of
    August. In the circumstances I shall be obliged if you will clarify with the
    Brigadier on what basis he wishes Counsel to consider the charges and, if the
    position is as I anticipate, acquaint him of the problems in obtaining a speedy
    response. Should you prefer it, I will speak to the Brigadier myself.
     I look forward to hearing from you.

    Dear Mr Moore,
   RE:HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER IS APRIL 19S9
    I write with reference to your letter dated 23 July 1991and note that Brigadier
    Pownall wishes Counsel tolook at the charges proposed.
    As I understand the Brigadier would like Counsel's response by the end of this
    week I am obliged to enquire on what basis he wishes Counsel to comment on the
    charges. If Counsel is to be asked to advise on the wording of the charges in
    relation to the available evidence, I fall to see how this can be achieved by
    the end of the week in view of the time it will take him to consider the
    evidence. In the light of this and the forthcoming Summer Vacation I consider
    that we would be exceedingly fortunate to receive such advice by the end of
    August. In the circumstances I shall be obliged if you will clarify with the
    Brigadier on what basis he wishes Counsel to consider the charges and, if the
    position is as I anticipate, acquaint him of the problems in obtaining a speedy
    response. Should you prefer it, I will speak to the Brigadier myself.
    I look forward to hearing from you.


    Yours sincerely,



   M . V . Oades

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER 15 APRIL 1909

You will be aware that service of disciplinary charges is about to be effected
on Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendent Murray following a
direction bar the Police Complainte Authority in accordance with procedures
laid down in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 198#. I enclose copies
of related correspondence.

The wording of the proposed disciplinary charges was laid down in the letter
of 7 May 1991 fro* Brigadier Pownall. Acting Chief Superintendent Pell need
this wording to set out the charges on the appropriate fora# which were sent
for consideration with the letter of 18 July 1991.

Yesterday I received a telephone call frost the Brigadier during which he
expressed agreement with the charges except that he felt that the substance
of paragraph 11 of his letter of 7 May 1991 should be incorporated in the
"discreditable conduct" charge. He also expressed the view that all of the
charges should be looked at by counsel and stated that in the light of
counsel's opinion the charges sight be reconsidered.

I should be grateful if you would seek an opinion froa counsel as to the
efficacy of the wording of the proposed charges the evidence in support of
which will form the substance of the presentation before the Tribunal.

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER 1$ APRIL 1*9

You will ha aware that service of dieelplinary charge, la about to be effected
an Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendent Hurray following a
d i n e U o n tgr tha Police Complaints Authority In accordance with procedures
laid down Hi tha Police and Criminal Evidence Act If##. I encloee copies
of related correspondence.

Tha wording of tha proposed disciplinary charges was laid down la tha letter
of 7 *t«r 1W1 t* m Brigadier Pownall, Acting Chief Superintendent Pall ueed
this wording to set out the charges on tha appropriate forms which were sent
fop consideration with tha latter of 10 July 1991.

Yesterday I received a telephone call from tha Brigadier daring which ha
expressed agreement with tha chargee sxeept that he fait that tha substance
of paragraph 11 of hla latter of 7 Hay 1991 should be Incorporated In the
"discreditable conduct" charge. Ha alao expreseed the view that all of tha
chargee should be looked at fey counsel and stated that In the light of
corneal'a opinion tha chargee might be reconsidered.

I should be grateful if you would seek an opinion from counsel as to the
effieaqr of tha wording of the proposed charges the evidence in support of
which will form tha substance of the presentation before the Tribunal.
10. We therefore recommend under Section 93(1) of the Police and Criminal Evidence
Act 1984 th at Superintendent Murray also be charged with:

            Neglect of Duty - contrary to paragraph 4(a) of Schedule 1 of the
            Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985 in th a t he failed to control
            the movement of supporters subsequent to the opening of G ate


11.    We have also carefully considered th e allegation th a t Chief Superintendent
Duckenfield was deceitful and misled senior police officers and members of the public.
We do not agree with th e investigating o ffic e r's conclusions th a t this m a tte r is not
substantiated. It is clear th a t Mr Kelly, Mr Kirtin and Mr Mackrell were told by Chief
Superintendent Duckenfield th a t G ate 'C ' had been forced, and th a t th ere had been an
in-rush of Liverpool supporters. While we are aw are th a t he did not wish to encourage
a hostile reaction which might imfpede rescue work we share the opinion of Lord 3ustice
Taylor th a t this did not require anyone being told a falsehood.            This misleading
explanation led to serious allegations being made against Liverpool supporters in general
causing grave offence and distress.

12 We have, therefore, decided to recom m end under Section 93(1) of the Police and
Criminal Evidence A ct 1984 th a t Chief Superintendent Duckenfield also be charged
with:

            Discreditable Conduct - con trary to paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 of
            the Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985 in th a t he acted in a
            manner likely to bring discredit on the reputation of the force or
            the police service.

13.   I would be grateful for your response to our recommendations as soon as possible.

14. If you accept the A uthority's recom m endations we shall be minded, in view of the
exceptional circum stances a ffectin g this case, to d irect th a t the charges a re heard by a
tribunal, in accordance with Section 94(2) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act
1984.

15.    I would particularly request th a t you maintain the confidentiality, of this
correspondence until such tim e as th e procedures laid down in the Act for determining
the disciplinary charge^ to be p referred have been completed. This will involve not
informing those against whom we are agreed th a t no charges should be preferred until
the whole m a tte r has been resolved betw een us.

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER


Brigadier Pownall telephoned to discuss appointment of counsel and charges
to be laid against Superintendent Murray and Chief Superintendent
Duckenfield.


I told him that a barrister had been approached from Leeds Chambers.
(John Trevor Sleightholme).


We then discussed charges.    I asked him if he had anything to add or alter
to the charges that we had referred.


He said that the only addition was to Charge 5 where he wanted the contents
and import of paragraph 11 of his letter to be reflected in the charge.


He then asked if the charges had been prepared by counsel.     I said no and
that Acting Chief Superintendent Fell had prepared them and asked if they
were to his satisfaction.


He said that he was happy with them once the changes to charge 5 had been
made but wondered if counsel should have the opportunity to comment upon
them before they were served.


He said that in the light of counsel's comments it could be that the
charges might have to be re-considered and told him that Acting Chief
Superintendent Fell had hoped to serve the discipline forms containing
the charges the following day.    Brigadier Pownall felt that we would have
difficulty doing this if counsel's opinion was to be sought.

He said that the only addition was to Charge 5 where he wanted the content#

He then asked if the charges had been prepared W counsel. I said no and
that Acting Chief Superintendent Pell had prepared the® and asked if they

NOTE FOR FILE;


HILLSBOROUGH - DISCIPLINE PROCEEDINGS


Met with Graham Moore, ACC(Staff Services), and A/Chief Superintendent Fell
to discuss the progress of the case preparation

1. The charges referred to in the PCA letters have now been correctly
   written and once agreed with the PCA will be served by A/Chief Supt
   Fell together with a letter pointing out the difficulties of serving
   supporting evidence on both Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray.  This will
   be done, if possible, with their lawyers present.


2. The Secretariat are arranging for Mr Ben Nolan to present the case.
   He is    from   the   same Chambers   as Mr Issacs who will defend
   Mr Duckenfield.    Stephen Walker assures us there is no problem in
   terms of probity, this being an issue he has specifically addressed.
   Our concern is how it will seem to the outside world accepting these
   arrangements are for the Secretariat to complete.  I agreed to raise
   this point again with Stephen Walker.


3.   We consideredthe draft Police Authority paper (attached) asking for
     financial aid towards the legal defence by these two officers.  The
     draft may be incorrect regarding the residual insurance monies of
     Superintendent Murray. I agreed to pursue this.

     Stephen Walker has agreed to examine the draft and alter, if necessary,
     and he will be consulted on this.     It is possible this can only be
     put to the Authority if the superintendents request this.    This needs
     to be checked, and if necessary, arranged - I will do.


4. A recent development    is an offer from MMI to grant the officers
   ex-gratia payments towards their defence. This is conditional on:-

            a.   they   having   spent   all   their personal   insurance
                 provision;

            b.   the Police Authority not themselves       funding        their
                 defence beyond this limit; and,

            c.   Police Authority agreement to this.

     In the circumstances this will not be progressed until it is known
     whether the Police Authority are themselves there to offer financial
     support.


 5. Regarding the queries raised by Mr Duckenfield,         to date the intention
     is:-

            a.   that the tribunal will    be in   Sheffield    - possibly
                 at the Town Hall; and,
                                    - 2 -


       b.   probable dates    are  October/November  (it is   now
            understood that Mr Issacs will be available).

  Regarding the request for Police Discipline Regulations and Home Office
  advice/interpretation ('blue book’), A/Chief Supt Fell is supplying
  these direct.

 REPORT OF THE CHIEF CONSTABLE


 FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO POLICE OFFICERS IN DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS

 1      Matter for Consideration

 1.1    The provision of financial assistance to two police officers
        involved in disciplinary proceedings arisingfrom the events at the
        Hillsborough Football Ground on 15 April 1989.

 2      Background Information

 2.1    Home Office Circular No 77/1987, published       on A December 1987
         provides guidance to Police Authorities on the exercise of their
         discretion in considering applications, on behalf of police
         officers, for financial assistance towards the cost of legal advice
         and representation arising from involvement in legal proceedings
         which result from pursuance, in good faith, of their duties or where
         the interests of the Force as a whole are involved. A copy of the
         Circular is attached.

  2.2    Exercising that discretion, members at the Police Authority Meeting
         held on 18 January 1991 decided:-

             (1)    that applications for financial assistance in
                    connection with legal proceedings from six officers
                    be approved in relation to the inquest into the
                    disaster;

              (2)   that the level of representation be left to be
                     determined by the officers, but that it should not
                     extend to Leading Counsel;

              (3)   that in relation to those officers of Superintendent
                    rank who had insurance policies covering costs of
                    this nature, the Authority should meet their costs
                    only after such insurance cover was exhausted, except
                    that they each should be allowed to retain £10,000
                    from such insurance for legal representation in
                    connection with any disciplinary proceedings. In the
                    event that Police Authority monies were required by
                    an officer for representation at the inquest the
                    whole or any part of the retained sum not used in
                    disciplinary proceedings was to be repaid to the
                    Authority to the extent that such representation had
                    been funded by the Authority.

  2.3     Subsequently,    all the applicants were legally represented at the
          inquest and       the legal costs of two of the officers, Chief
          Superintendent    Duckenfield and Superintendent Murray were such that
          only the                 they were allowed to retain for legal
          representation    in connection with any disciplinary proceedings is
          now available.
                                   -   2 -



2.A    Correspondence was received on 12 July 1991 in which the Police
       Complaints Authority indicated it’s decision to direct that
       disciplinary proceedings be instituted against Chief Superintendent
       Duckenfield and Superintendent Murray following an investigation
       carried out by Mr Leslie Sharp, the then Chief Constable of Cumbria
       Constabulary, into complaints against a number of police officers
       relating to the Hillsborough Disaster.

2.5    The hearing will be before a Tribunal made up of Mr John Newing, the
       Chief Constable of the Derbyshire Constabulary and two members of
       the Police Complaints Authority.   The two officers are entitled to
       be legally represented at the hearing and both have indicated that
       they would wish to be so represented.    It is anticipated that the
       cost of such representation may well exceed the         available to
       each officer.

3      Comment

3.1    The decision to allow the officers to retain               of their
        insurance cover to meet the cost of any disciplinary proceedings
        was, of necessity, arbitrary since the inquest was still taking
        place and at the time it was not known whether any of them would be
        charged with a criminal offence or indeed whether any disciplinary
        action would eventually be taken.

3.2    Paragraph 1 ofHome Office Circular 77/1987 advises    that the Police
        Authority has discretion to meet expenditure incurred by officers in
        all kinds of legal proceedings where the officers have acted in
        good faith in pursuance of their duties, or the interests of the
        Force as a whole are involved.        The Disciplinary Tribunal is
        required under Section 9A of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act
        198A and would appear, therefore, to be a legally constituted
        authority with legally defined powers.

3.3    In arriving at the decision to provide financialassistance to all
        six applicants at their meeting on 18 January, the Police Authority
        accepted that they were all acting in good faith in accordance with
        well established practices.    It was also accepted that the unique
        nature of the circumstances had wide implications for the Force as a
        whole. The Police Authority may now wish to consider a commitment
        to the funding of independent legal advice for the two officers
        beyond the          available to each so as to ensure that neither
        officer is out of pocket.

 3.A   Where disciplinary proceedings are concerned officers of
       Superintendent rank are at a disadvantage when compared with members
       of the Police Federation.       Members are entitled to, and are
       regularly provided with, free legal representation at Disciplinary
       Hearings.     No such facility is available to officers of
       Superintendent rank.

 A     Financial Implications

 A.l   It is not possible at this stage to assess the financial
        implications of this matter which will depend entirely on the length
        of time the Tribunal sits.    There is no specific provision in the
        Revenue Budget for this expenditure.
                                -   3 -



5     Recommendation

5.1   The Committee is recommended to approve a commitment to provide
       financial assistance for legal representation to the officers
       concerned in accordance with the main principles of Home Office
      Circular No 77/1987.

                  be approved in relation to the inquest    into the

        Dear Brigadier Pownall

        HILLSBOROUGH      1989
        In confirmation of our telephone conversation today I am forwarding, by
        fax, copies of the proposed five disciplinary charges prepared for service
        on Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and one disciplinary charge prepared
        for service on Superintendent Murray.

        The wording of the prepared charges while couched within the terms of the
        Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985 follows exactly that wording specified
        by the Authority in the direction that the charges to be preferred should
        be those set out in your letter of 7 May 1991.

        I should be grateful if you would advise me whether or not they meet with
        the approval of the Authority and shall not move to have service effected
        until I hear from you.

       Yours sincerely

                               HILLSBOROUGH TRAGEDY
                                    15 APRIL, 1989

 1. The Authority have now completed a careful and detailed examination of the report
 and the evidence relating to the individual complaints arising from the Hillsborough
 tragedy on 15 April, 19S9. We have considered Mr Anderson's memoranda, submitted to
 us in accordance with the provisions of Section 90(5) of the Police and Criminal
 Evidence Act, 1984, and his letter of 10 April, 1991. We have noted your force's
 proposals not to prefer disciplinary charges against any of the officers who are the
 subject of complaint and your reasons for these proposals. However, as I told Mr
 Anderson on the telephone, the Authority were disappointed that he did not explain
 your reasons more fully. We have also taken into account the views expressed by Mr
 Sharp, the investigating officer.

 2. Having considered the evidence relating to the complaints against Police Constable
 Smith, Police Constable Illingworth, Superintendent Marshall or Superintendent Green­
 wood we have concluded that the evidence in respect of these four officers does not
 justify disciplinary proceedings and we agree with your proposal. 4|*    i#* *’

 3.   We have also considered those complaints which have been laid against Chief
 Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendent Murray which allege that they were in
 ’neglect of duty'. These complaints raise difficult issues. In reaching our conclusions
 we have borne in mind the decisions of the Director of Public Prosecutions as one
 factor amongst others. As you are aware we do not accept that culpable misfeasance
 and neglect of duty are coterminous nor that, even if they were, we would be bound (as
 far as discipline is concerned) by the decision of the Director not to bring criminal
 prosecutions. We have, throughout, borne in mind the definition of neglect of duty set
 out in paragraph    k  of Schedule 1 of The Police (Discipline) Regulations, 1985.
U.  The incident which gave rise to the tragedy at the Hillsborough Stadium on 15
April, 1989 would not have occurred had sensible and simple steps been taken to secure
the safety of spectators in Pens 3 and 4 on the Leppings Lane Terraces. It is clear
that the basic cause of the disaster was overcrowding in these pens.         We have
concentrated on this matter.

5. In reaching our decisions we have taken into account various matters which can be
advanced as arguments for taking no disciplinary action on the grounds that to take
such action would be unfair and/or oppressive. Amongst such matters we refer briefly
to the followings

           a. the passage of time since 15 April, 1989;

           b. the various consequences arising from the earlier hearings
           before Lord Justice Tiylor and the Coroner;

           c. the e ffe c t of the extensive media coverage of the incident
           itself, matters associated with it and the hearings referred to in
           b. above;

           d. the perception that if any officer is charged he may be seen
           as a scapegoat carrying the blame for the acts or omissions of
           others;

           e. the recent promotion of Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and
           the fact that he took over the match arrangements devised by
           som eone e lse and his b e lie f th at the plan had operated
           successfully before;

           f. the anguish which both Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and
           Superintendent Murray must have experienced as the result of the
           tragic and unexpected events on 15 April, 1989, and

           g. the e ffe c t that disciplinary action against any officer would
           have on the morale and well-being of the South             Yorkshire
           Police.

6. Despite these factors it cannot be denied that the police, under the control of Chief
Superindent Duckenfield, assisted by Superintendent Murray, were de facto in control of
the ground at the relevant time and had responsibility for the safety of the spectators.
In the opinion of this Authority there is sufficient evidence to support disciplinary
charges on the following grounds:

           a. Chief Superintendent Duckenfield, as the officer in overall
           command, failed to address himself properly to the problems
           involved in, and the plans for, crowd control even before the
           spectators arrived;
                          4


           b. failed to monitor the numbers of spectators entering Pens 3
           and k',
           c. failed to take any action when Pens 3 and 4 became obviously
           overcrowded;

           d. authorised G ate 'C' to be opened and, to g eth er with
           Superintendent Murray, failed to take any steps to control the
           movement of those who entered the ground through this gate at a
           time when it was, or should have been, clear to both of them
           that Pens 3 and 4 were, or were likely to become, overcrowded.

7. In the view of this Authority responsibility for the safety of those in Pens 3 and 4
and blame for overcrowding in those pens should rest with those in the Police Control
Box from which the pens could be observed, the deployment of police manpower could
be directed and the decision to open Gate 'C' was made with its attendant responsibil­
ity for controlling those who entered through it. The Authority are conscious of the
complex circumstances which rrt§y have contributed to the tragedy, but we do not
accept that the fact that there may be others who are also in some way blameworthy,
should cause us to decide against the recommendation of charges under the Regulations
if, as here, the evidence is available to support such charges. You will appreciate the
Authority are concerned solely with the evidence in respect of the matters which are
the subject of complaint and not with mitigation which would only become relevant if a
breach of discipline were to be proved against an officer who is the subject of       a
charge.

8. For these reasons that the Authority have decided to recommend under Section
93(1) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 that the following charges be
brought against Chief Superintendent Duckenfield:

           i. Neglect of Duty - contrary to paragraph 4(a) of Schedule 1 of
           the Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985 in that he failed to
           acquaint himself with the planning and problems related to the
           control of the semi-final.

           ii. Neglect of Duty - contrary to paragraph 4(a) of Schedule 1 of
           the Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985 in that he failed to
           monitor crowd numbers in Pens 3 and 4.

           iii. Neglect of Duty - contrary to paragraph 4(a) of Schedule 1
           of the Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985 in that he failed to
           act when Pens 3 and 4 were obviously overcrowded.

           iv. Neglect of Duty - contrary to paragraph 4(a) of Schedule 1
           of the Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985 in that he failed to
           control the movement of supporters subsequent to the opening of
           Gate 'C'.

9. We have given separate attention to the degree of responsibility attributable to
Superindent Murray. We concluded that in view of Chief Superintendent Duckenfield's
very recent appointment land promotion to his position as Divisional Commander,
Superintendent Murray had a special responsibility to assist and advise Chief Super­
intendent Duckenfield particularly in view of Superintendent Murray's greater exper­
ience of policing at Hillsborough. He was aware that authority had been given to open
Gate 'C'.

                 (Discipline & Complaints)


                 S U B JE C T :    after hillsborough

                 We spoke today respecting Hillsborough and you asked me to commit to
                 paper some thoughts concerning personnel.

                 It seems to me of importance that SYP support and preparation for the
                 Tribunal should be above reproach and I therefore seek appropriate
                 quantity and quality of personnel to carry out the task of producing
                 papers for presenting counsel and two defence counsel. The work of
                 these worthies might commence from 5 August 1991-

                 (I have set in train action to equip an office at Hammerton Road from
                 which presenting officer might work and this will be alarmed.
                 Additionally a computer terminal will be installed to access the
                 material).

                 What needs to be done I feel is to set up a team consisting of Inspector
                 Barker of my Department and PC Greenway, also of my Department.  I
                 foresee an officer of higher rank eventually becoming part of that team
                 which I guess will exist until the end of the disciplinary proceedings
                 say six or nine months. The immediate problem is that Inspector Barker
                 needs to be replaced in Superintendent Stuart's investigating team.
                 May a suitable replacement be found please?

                 In the meantime these two officers will be fully engaged in sorting
                 the Hillsborough material following takeover, the logistics of preparing
                 for presenting counsel, sorting property, copying documentation,
                 addressing disclosure matters, etc, etc.

                 I have spoken with Chief Superintendent Lowe regarding an Inspector
                 to come into the Department.

             S U B JE C T :     discipline   hearings   (h i l l s b o r o u g h )


              I have prepared five disciplinary charges for Chief Superintendent
              Duckenfield and one disciplinary charge for Superintendent Murray from
              the wording of the charges that the Police Complaints Authority set out
              in their Direction. Also prepared are the accompanying discipline forms.

              Would you please formally approve the charges and the forms and I will
              then take steps to serve these documents.

              It occurs to me that you would wish to consider dicussing the wording
              with the Police Complaints Authority prior to service.

              I have also prepared memoranda for your signature to accompany the
              discipline forms. This is an unprecedented step called for by the
              exceptional circumstances.

    From :              Deputy Chief Constable                             Station / Dept: Headquarters

   To                   ACC(Staff Services)                                Date:            16    July 1991



             S U B JE C T :      DAVID G DUCKENFIELD




             By appointment I met          with   David   Duckenfield     this    date   about     the
             forthcoming tribunal.

             During our discussion I told him the broad detail of the areas of
             the charges he is likely to be facing;         that as part of our
             deliberations we had taken Counsel's opinion from Richard Payne and,
             as a result had made it clear to the Police Complaints Authority that
             we would only prepare a case on the basis of a direction.       I also
             informed him that Richard Payne is available to act for the defence
             (in the event Mr Duckenfield informed me that he will continue through
             his own counsel, Mr Issacs).

             Mr    Duckenfield   asked   for   more   information   on   the   following    points

                  a.   the likely venue;

                  b.   the likely date(s)    (he feels Mr           Issacs will not        be
                       available until November/December            but will inform        me
                       further on this point);

                  c.   when the case papers are likely to be served;

                  d.   the possibility of MMI funding some of the defence costs
                       (I will pursue this with the National Claims Manager,
                       Mr Stephen Walker).

             Additionally, he asked if it may be possible to provide him with a
             copy   of   Police   Discipline  Regulations and the   Home Office
             advice/interpretation notes - I would like to be as helpful as we
             can in this regard if this is possible.

             I should appreciate it if you could deal with Mr Duckenfield                        direct
             but please keep me informed of developments.

            (Discipline & Complaints )          ____          ______________


            S U B JE C T :            hillsborough


            You asked me to enquire of the Horae Office for any advice and guidance
            in relation to problems currently foreseen with regard to the disciplinary
            hearing arising from the Hillsborough tragedy.

             I spoke this morning to                          about these matters,
             eventually speaking to                 who is in  charge of Complaints
               Discipline at F2. Her secretary's number is                 We
             discussed:-

             1)   Two tribunals - it was felt appropriate;   I should enquire
                   whether PCA have four members.

             2)   Service by accessibility - it was felt only practical and
                   so appropriate.

             3)   Funding - suggested special circumstances might suggest special
                   approach to Police Authority - argument that if ACPO rank would
                   have costs paid and in the circumstances of Hillsborough was
                   essentially acting for the Chief (I make no comment on this
                   argument).

             4)   Possibility of Superintendents’ Association calling for special
                   collection, unknown benefactor, collection outside service voiced
                   by me.

             5)   Presentation - suggested West Midlands might assist Counsel in
                   presentation.

             6)    Costs - __________ (pointed to need to acquaint Police Authority
                   early of costs of:

                   a)   Transcripts
                   b)   Costs of Appeal from Tribunal

             7)    Only experience of similar type discipline charges she recollects
                   is recent Metro case of D/Chief Supt.Melvynn arising from the
                   Blakelock murder/5. View taken not to offer legal representation.

             8)     I offered, subject to your approval, to furnish Home Office with
                    copy correspondence between us and PCA.             vould welcome
                    that as she needs such information to give advice to Forces
                    generally. She seemed interested in idea of PCA directing offences
                    and wording charges. Her FAX goes through HMIC
                    I agreed to arrange.

Re.1    I have spoken with the Brigadier.   He has four members.

Re.8    DCC Ord was interested in this aspect.

         suggested the cost will be approximately £77.20 attendance and

        look to £1000 per day.

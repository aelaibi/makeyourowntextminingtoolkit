                I am PC       128 L y n s k e y     s t a ti on e d at Mai n St r e e t at Rotherham.                   I was     on

                d uty at the         1988 Semi          Final      betw e e n Liv e r p o o l    and N o t t i n g h a m Forest.

                F r o iti a h o u t 12 ,0 O pm    < 1200)       on that      d a y I was      involve d in the          s e a r ch in g

                and    supervising          of Li v e r p o o l     supporters         entering      through the

                t u rnstiles at         the L e p pings Lane              end of the H i l l s b o r o u g h Football

                Ground.        At    the    start       of the a f t e r n o o n      the    influx of     fans was        steady

                and we were able             to quic k l y search them.                     I remember     that    quite a lot

                o f ca nne d bee r a nd so f t d r i nks we r e 1 ef t at t.he tur ns t :i.I e gat e s w he n

                s u pporters        opted not        to drink          it.

                As    the kick       off    got     nearer       the    build up of fans            increased and          I found

                that       it was    impo s s i b l e    to search everyone                 and est a b l i s h whether        they

                had tickets          or were        drunk.         At this      the swell        of the    crowd    carried me

                along and        I felt      that       our     presence was          almost     futile.

                Polite       horses     tried       to break        the      crowds    down but only forced them

                into       tighter    spots       causing more            crushing.

                Once       inside    I can       remember        that     there were a          lot of    people    stood       in

                the    tunnel       under    the     stand and that myself and the officers                             in our

                serial       had to     push our way through                   the    crowd to get        onto    the

                terracing w h i c h was             packed tight.              We ended       up standing w i t h        our

                backs       against     a wall
                                                                                                                PAGE
                                                                                                                R55-I

 We     remained    in this        position          thro u g h o u t       the game.       I cannot       recall

 a ny of the tunnel             gates        being    blocked        off by either           police     officers

 or stewards.            A l t h o u g h there was          very     little        room to m a n o e u v r e    1 do

  not    think    that    the    t e rrac ing was            seriously         over    crowded.

 Ten minu t e s     before       the end my serial                 went       back    into the are a        in front

 of the     t urnstiles         w i t h in    the ground          to supervise           the L i v erpool       fans

  departure.        As    the    fans        came    down      the stairways there was a great

  deal    of banging        on the       c orrugated           sides.          I can also     remember         that     I

 a t t e n d e d several     locations          on the s t a irways             with other        officers after

  reports    that    fans were           u r i nating        t hr o u g h    cracks    in the walls and

  s tairwells      onto     people       below.         Several         yo u t h s were     spo k e n to

  regarding       their     behaviour.

  We then    left the gr o u n d and were                    i n v olved      in the s u p e r v i s i o n of the

  crowd onto H al i f a x R oad and onto                     the a w a i t i n g     coaches and train.

  In my opinion          I w ou ld     not     like     to     say that       the sit u a t i o n at the         1988

  Semi    Final    was any d i f ferent              from      the 1989 Semi          Final.      This     is

  fo r m e d from the videos             I have seen of the Leppings Lane turnstiles

  before    kick off.

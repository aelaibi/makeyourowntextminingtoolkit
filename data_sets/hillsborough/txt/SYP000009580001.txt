              At 8.3 0 am        <0830)      on S a t u r d a y    15 April            1989   <150489),      I came on duty

               at H a e k e n th or pe Police S ta t i o n           in relation to duties                  to be w o r k e d at

               the FA Cup Semi - F i n a l            at H il l s b o r o u g h    later      that   day.                 _ . ..

               I was    under      the direct          su pe r v i s i o n of Police Sergeant 2001                  BfyRTjfiN of

              H a c k e n t h or pe P o l i c e .

               T o g e t h e r with other           officers      I was     conveyed to H i l l s b o r o u g h via a

              Pol i c e Transit Van and,                 upon arrival             there,      I att^ilaed a briefing             in

               the N orth S t a n d .        The briefing was               taken        by <^mef Supt D U C K E N F I E L D

              and,     on conclusion of this                  briefing,           I h a / i a packed      lunch meal.

              My duty was          to pat r o 1 in the West Sytan/1 paying                        particular a t t e n t i o n

               to the     front     row in order            to prevent            persons      standing      on the      terraces

               of the Leppings Ln end from                      climbing          up into      the seated area.

               I comme nced these            duties at          11. 15 Vim        <1115)      that day after        having
                                                                                                              PAGE      2

        consumed my meal.

        Once     in the West S tand             I was a s s igned    to work at         the front       right hand/

        centre of the s t a n d , 1oo k i ng directly over Pens 2 and 3.

        I n itial ly there were               only a few fans       entering       into the ground,           these

        filtering        through from about              11.30 am    (1130).        All were good humou r e d

        and a p p e ar ed to be either middle aged or                      parents with young            children.

        F ro m talking         to the        fans as they started filling              the stand all were

        in good spirits and g e ne r a ll y pleased to be there.                            Quite a few said

        how    pleased they were               to be at H i l l s b o r o u g h again and         commented     on

        how good a ground              it was.

        Fro m midday         (1200)         onwards,    the ground gen e r a l l y started to fill and

        it was        apparent     that       the Hop end of the ground was                filling      quite

        quickly,

        By 2     pm    (~14 00)T the West Stand w as still                 only about a quarter             full

        but    I saw that the standing areas                    of the L e p pings LN end had filled

        nicely.         The Pen mar k e d 3 was           completely full          by this time w ith Pen 4

        s till    having       spaces.         Pens    1 & 2, 6 & 7 were         thinly     covered with

         eo p 1e .
»   s
        T'he b e h a v i o u r of the         fans    in Pen 3 was      g e n e r a l l y good.    They were

        s inging       songs and       larking about amongst             themselves.

        At about        this    time        I saw a youth who       I would      describe as         being white,

        male,     20 yrs,       heavy/fat        build,         tall,    wit h short,       dark,     curly h a i r ,

        wear i n g     a green o pen necked shirt.                This y o u t h was       stood on a barrier

        in P e_n3 and was gest i culat i ng to the                   rest of the          crowd     in o rrirffr to

        get    them singing          etc.       In hindsight      I believe        this    bayr-yer was       the

        one    t ha t c o l l a p s e d .

        Also     around     this     time ano ther youth w ith a red shirt and blond hair

        was    climbing on a barrier                  in this   pen and was        diving     forward      into the

        crowd.         He did this several              times   until    it a p p e a r e d that the       crowd

T hr o u g h o u t    this    period there was a lot of                       pushing and shoving w i t h i n

the Pen,           this    being     the    " n o r m a l " sway as      is found on most Hops and

standing areas at football                        matches.        Another y outh who stuck                     out was

a white male,              18 yrs,     slim build with b l o n d / p e r o x i d e / s t r a w           shoulder

length hair,              wearing a chain mail               type shirt          coloured silver/

charcoal.             This youth was           sat on a small wall                d i r ectly under            the

front        of the stand.            This wall was at                the entrance        to Pen 3 directly

at the           end of the tunnel           that allows          fans        to enter>»'fne Pens         from the

turnstile.

He was asked several                  times       by Sgt BURftftNy/Co get              down    but he      replied,

"Fuck        off," and just           b l a tantly ignored the                instruction. After          aboul

3 minutes            the youth even t u a l l y got down and then                       ’got   los^in           the

crowd * .

As     it a pp r o a c h e d 3 pm      (1500)        I saw that        both P en\s w e          to y ^ l l y

2.. 50      pm    < 1450 ? , the stand was full                with a lot of            people— congregating

at     the       front    of the stand.           Throughout          this      time    I had to tell

several           youths     to get    down from standing                on the small wall              at      the

entrance           to the tunnel           and from standing             on the dividing            fences

between Pens E/3/4.                   All    the youths         spoken to         complied straight away.

13y the          time the /game kicked o f f , all                people Jrfi the stand had                    returned

to their           seats.      I took up a position a t/the                      very front        rioht        hand

corner           of the West S t a n d next              to they/emergency exit.               I was also

j o i n e d there by POL PC 1494 NAYL\QR;

A few minutes              into the        game    I became aware             of several       youths          trying

to climb up from the                  standing area            of Pens 3/4 a nd into the seating

area.         As     it was my duty to prevent                 this      from happening           I went         to the

a rea       but,     by this    time,       several        youths     had      "es c a p e d ’ into the stand.

I returned to the em e r g e n c y exit.

The        next thing        that    I became aware of was w hen                      people were       climbing
                                                                                                            P AGE      4
                                                                                                            SS62

over     the pitch perimeter                fet^ce f/'om Pens 3/4 and onto the                   ground.

The game was           then stopped and the teams                   left       the field.

By this       time     people were          pouring onto the             pitch and total          confusion

as to what was happening was apparent.

At first        I thought          it was a bit of fighting                in the       crowd that was

causing       the disturbance and                 it was about 5-10 minutes                before     I

r ealised       that    people were             being    hurt    in the Pens        below.

Whilst      this was        happening           on the    pitch and       in the Pens        I noticed

quite a lot of fans were                    entering       the ground to the right               of the

stand     (near to the Police Room).                       As    they    passed under where           I was

standing,          several        shouted up towards me,                "IT'S A SHAME! WHAT YOU

B A S T A R D S HAVE DONE OUT THERE,                YOU S H O U L D N ’T HAVE OP E N E D THE DOORS."

Others      said that         they had either             climbed over the fences               or broken a

door    down.        O b v io u s l y    I was    in no    position to          comment    since     I had no

idea as to what             had o c c urred at the turnstiles.

As   the minutes          passed,         it became quite obvious                that    p e o p l e were    dying

on the      pitch.        Several         were alre a d y       laid out dead whilst            lots were

being     resuscitated.                 The attitude       of the       fans    became very a g g r e s s i v e

towards       us    (Police)        and we had to take a lot of verbal abuse                          since

they    d i d n ’t think we were                doing anything.           Reports       from the     radio

(BBC)     had      reached the fans              that    people were       dead and then          panic

appeared        to get      into the f a n s .           A lot w a n t e d to     leave    the ground.              Some

w a n t e d to know       if the m a t c h was           going to be       resumed.        Many were

openly      crying and saying,                  no not a gain      (reference        to Heysel).

As the events on the                    pitch    progressed more and more                people w a n t e d to

leave     the ground but                I had received a mess a g e             from Police C^p/ftrol

o rdering       that    no fans were             to be allo w e d to leave           in order      to assist

the a m b u l a n c e / f i r e    service.        When asked by fans why                they   couldn't

leave     I informed them of the                   reason.       All     complied with the           order

agreeing        it was      for the best.

                                                                                                          S862

On the       pitch    I sa» several         fans      either a s s a ^ ^ i n g      or simply        pushing

P o l i c e Off\ce/'s around,          particularly           those       officers who were

resuscitating          people.       P er s o n a l l y    I think    this ac t i o n was         due to

panic ked      people     finding      friends         etc dying and simply wanting more

done    for their        friends.

More    and more       people     tried to get             to the front       of the stand           in order

to see what was happening                  in the Pens            below.     It was apparent             that

fathers were          in the stand whilst                 their    sons were       stood     in the Pens.

Due    to this many        people      in the stand were              g e t t i m j ext r e m e l y a g i t a t e d

and    upset wanting         to get down to the               pitch       lsvel.

By    now    I had been joined           by P O L PS SURf^f'^and we decided that                         our

best    course       of ac t i o n was    to stick          together       near    to the eme r g e n c y

exit    from the stand          in order        to prevent          people    from     leaving.

As    time    passed more       people      from the back of the stand                     came    to our

position trying to             leave.       A lot were            clearly    intoxicated and we had

to suffer a 1ot of v e r b a 1 abuse.

As fans       from the     pens    below started to                leave    the ground        lots were

uri n a t i n g against      the walls.             E v e n t u a l l y , by about 4 pm < 1 & Q Q ) , the

g round was      cleared.         F ol lo w i n g    this,    together with          the    rest     of my

serial,       1 went     to the N orth Stand for                  debriefing.

I must       point out that,         throughout           this     incident,       I remained at the

front       of the West S ta n d and had no                 involvement with           the events         taking

place       on the    pitch.      I felt      it necessary           to    remain at this          point       in

order       to prevent     people      evacuating           the ground and          panicking.

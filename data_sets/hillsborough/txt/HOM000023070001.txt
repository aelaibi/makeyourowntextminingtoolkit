HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER: 20 QUESTIONS BY THE
FAMILY SUPPORT GROUP

You asked for my comments on the revised draft letter for Mr Howarth to send to the
Hillsborough Family Support Group.

2.      The letter is, of course, unlikely to satisfy the group, but I see no general legal
difficulty in sending it. I have a few points on specific parts of the letter, which are
set out below.

3.     The question that is referred to in the draft as question 5 is in fact a further
question within question 4. I suggest you start the paragraph with the words
“Question 4 also asks ...” For clarity you might like to change the closing words of
that sentence to read: “... whom he eventually saw at Mr Edwards’ own request.”
The following paragraph should then begin: “Questions 5 & 6 referred ...”

4.     In the paragraph on question 141 suggest that the fourth sentence should be
replaced by: “The decision is entirely a matter for the police authority concerned, and
the Home Secretary has no role in the matter.”

5.    I suggest that the final sentence of the paragraph on question 14 could read as
follows: “However, it would be wrong in principle and contrary to the European
Convention on Human Rights to apply these new procedures retrospectively, and it
would b e ...”.

6.     Question 17 is not really a question at all. It is simply a statement of criticism.
The opening sentence of your draft implies a question that may well have been
intended, but that is not spelt out in the Support Group’s press release. I suggest that
it would be better to end the sentence after the word “families”.

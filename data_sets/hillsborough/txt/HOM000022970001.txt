 Examinations under the scheme

 3.1 The 'competent person' (whether a body or an
     individual) should have such practical and
     theoretical knowledge and actual experience of
     the type of system which is to be examined as
     will enable defects or weaknesses, which it is
     the purpose of the examination to discover, to
     be detected and their importance in relation to
     the integrity and safety of the system to be
     assessed.

TICKET TOUTS

As you know during the hearing some suggestion has been made that ticket
touts were in abundance attempting to supply tickets, genuine or otherwise,
to fans who had attended the match. Although we have a very limited amount
of information processed on the Holmes Computer I have still had undertaken
a study of the existing statements which indicate some kind of ticket tout
activity.

The following statements refer to ticket touts.            The information contained
can be grouped in four broad headings




        (a )   Purchase of a ticket (either for author or a friend etc)


               D290                           £20/£25 for a ticket
               QSL35                          Bought ticket from a tout
               S441                           £20/£25 for a ticket
               S571                           £25 for a ticket
               S62                            £20 for a ticket
               S502                           £32 for a ticket
               S53                            £10 for a ticket
               S363                           £25 for a ticket
               S95                            £15 for a ticket
               S197                           £10 for a ticket
               S237                           £20 for a ticket
               S200                           £25 for a ticket at Anfield
               S57                            Bought a ticket
               S189                           Tried to buy
                                              Offered ticket

                                                                           Cont....

         (b)   Seeing ticket touts

               QHS135 -                       S554
               S116                           S5871
                                              S621
                                              S207
                                              S451




         (c)   Supporters seeking touts

               S854
               S919

         (d)   Touts arrested or moved on

               S1374    -              Tout arrested
               S870                    Tout arrested
               870A
               S1505    -             Tout moved on

         (e)   Miscellaneous

               QHS790   -             Tout selling in White Horse,
                                      Penistone Road
                                      Informant referring to touts and
                                      forged tickets.


No doubt when all our information is processed the list of people who have
had some involvement with ticket touts   will be significantly greaterand I
feel that it is important to draw this   to your attention now.

I intend also, as the information becomes available to undertake enquiries
into the number people who either attended without tickets or who were
approached to sell tickets, in order to show how large a problem this was
at the match. Similarly, we intend to    analyse how much alcoholplayed a
part prior to the game, again by analysing the statements.

I hope that this is of some interest.         Please do not hesitate to contact me
if I can be of further assistance.

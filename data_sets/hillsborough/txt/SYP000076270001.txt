            On Saturday 15th April           1989 <150489)          I went to Sheffield Wednesday

            Football Ground        in Hillsborough to watch the Semi Final             between
                                                            C~Ar\~ /
            Liverpool and Notts Forest.                   I am a Liverpool
                                                          fan.
                                                          O A T . <-OACtf-                          ,
            I went with friends to the match we used a Barnes Travel Coach I

            bought my ticket for the Leppings Lane standing terrace

                                                                                        of



            During the coach journey we were stopped just outside Sheffield by

            police for drink and told not to go if we hadn't got tickets also when

            we parked near Wadsley Bridge another                    policeman got on the coach and

            again told us not to go to the ground if we hadn't tickets.



            We parked about 2.15pm           <1415)        I didn't see any drunkeness on the way
                                                                                     PAGE        2
                                                                                     S2053

         to the ground.      I d i d n ’t see any fighting or disorder we got to the

         ground at about 2.30pm <1430) we got          into the queue and entered

         through the turnstiles     I gave my ticket     in I saw police outside the
s.o .e
         ground but they were not doing anything          I d i d n ’t see any stewards at

         all .



         I d i d n ’t have difficulty finding my entry point nor did        ff   have any

         problem getting     in, once I was   in I didn't see any other gates being

         opened or already open I didn't see any lads climbing into the ground

         at all.



         Once     I came Ufrough the turnstiles     I got a programme used the toilet

         then walked through the tunnel       I didn't see any policemen there or a ny

         stewards or any signs telling you where to go,           I used the tunnel        quite

         fre^dy but once at the other end I met a barrier of people               I went    into

          he left hand pen.



         I got through the crowd and stood in front of the crash barrier the

         first one up from the track fencing.           I didn't see any fighting or

         drinking     inside the ground at all,     I didn't see any barriers break nor

         was     I near any barriers when they broke.



         I was still standing with my 2 friends and the cousin when the players

         cam© out it was about 2.45pm      (1545)   or so when we got there first           it

         wasn't so bad,     but when the game started the crush was        really bad I

         couldn't breathe my head was being crushed the pressure just kept

         building up and up.



         I didn't see anyone die because       I was    let out of the gate at the front

         of the pens I sat on the pitch with my mates we all had been let out,
                                                                            PAGE     3
                                                                            S20S3

       I think   it was caused by the crowd all being let in at the same time,

       plus all the people who had been there without tickets,       I stopped on

       the pitch for about half an hour we walked down to the forest fans

       end then we were taken into the referees       room.



       We   left the ground about 4.30pm   (1430)   that day on own accord we just

       walked across the pitch from the referees       room left the ground and

       walked back to the coach,   I didn't see any criminal     offences that day

       at all.



       I think after the match there should have been a way to get the gates

       open also I think that police should have radios to know what was

       happening the police should have done a lot more.

FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL:     SAFETY ISSUES - APPEALS

I understand Ministers have decided that the Football Spectators
Bill should be amended in the way proposed by Mr Moynihan in his
letter of 16 October.    Legal Advisers here have been asked to
instruct Parliamentary Counsel accordingly - ie so as to preclude
a right of appeal under section 5 of the Safety of Sports Grounds
Act 1975 against a term or condition contained in a safety
certificate as a result of a directive of the Football Licensing
Authority.

2.      A draft reply to Mr Moynihan is attached.

                                                       (NAME OF SIGNATORY)



                   Thank you       for your letter of             16 October about appeal
                   rights        against    terms         and        conditions         in     safety
                   certificates where these arise from a requirement of the
                   Football Licensing Authority (FLA).


                   We both recognise the need for the Football Spectators
                   Bill    (the Bill)      to be clarified.                Given your strongly
                   held views on this issue we are prepared to accept that
                   the    Bill    should    be    amended       in    the    way   you       propose.
                   Instructions       are        being     sent       by     our    lawyers        to
                   Parliamentary       Counsel       to     this       effect      so    that     the
                   necessary amendments can be tabled.

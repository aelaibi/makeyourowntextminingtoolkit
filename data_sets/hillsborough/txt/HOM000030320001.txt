Can you look out for the minute in my absence, make the changes and put the revised draft letter up to
M r H. w ith a covering note (copied to the others on Linda Rushton's note) saying it has been agreed
w ith LAB. If there are any substantive points in Tim's note you can 't resolve or are unsure about then
it can w ait until M onday, but ideally it would nice to get the revised draft up for the weekend.

Thanks.

I have dictated a minute with some comments on the draft letter for George H ow arth. There are also a
fe w typos and other minor points th a t I have not mentioned in the minute.

You ought to standardise the w a y in which you refer to the questions - words or figures.   I prefer
figures, but if you choose words, the practice should be the same throughout.

In the final sentence of the paragraph on q3 "was" should be "were".

In the first sentence of the paragraph on q6 "the" is superfluous before "Lord".

In the second sentence of the paragraph on q 15 "that" is missing after "decisions".

You should receive the minute tom orrow.

         my arms were           by my side and               I could not move then because of the

         pres su re of people a r o u n d me.                    I had trou bl e b r ea th in g a n d at one

         stage       I was    even     lifted off the g ro un d for                         perhaps a m i nu t e or more

         due to the          crush.        My h u s b a n d was        by my side all              this time t el li ng me

         not    to w o r ry a nd to keep               calm.       It d i d n ’t seem to ntfe as t h ou g h a ny on e

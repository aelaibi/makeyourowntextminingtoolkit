1.   I am employed as a Qualified Ambulance man for SYMAS.



2.   My date of birth is 21st March 1956.



3.   I joined SYMAS in January 1985 as a dedicated day transport

     driver.       They are part time staff.                I went     full time in

     December 1985 and became a qualified ambulance man in 1987.

     Prior to joining SYMAS I had been a design engineer.



4.   I am based at Parkway Ambulance Station.                   On Saturday 15th

     April I was on duty from 1400 to 2200.                   I had been on duty

     from 1000 to 1800 on the previous two days.                    On 15th April I

     was on duty with Leading Ambulance man Flack in vehicle call

     sign S209.       I was driving the vehicle for the duration of

     the shift.



5.   I had takep a casualty to Northern General and radioed green
      oJj ISO '7
     semo- time a I Lei' 15. D U . I had already heard alpha call, signs

     being mentioned         in broadcasts by control/^ and            I knew that

     these   were     the     call   signs   of   the       liaison    officers    at

     Hillsborough and so I wondered if something was happening

     there, although I had not heard any ambulance being sent to

     the ground at that time,          When we radioed green we were told

     to   stand    by^       Shortly   a l i m wauls /vwe    were     instructed   to

Either Station Officer Higgins or Station Officer Eason told

me that there was a youngster in cardiac arrest on the pitch

at             theLeppings Lane end.                                      Station Officer Higgins told me

to             get               our ambulance ontothe pitch                                       and drive up towards the

Leppings Lane end.                                          I said that I thought that the entrance

to             the               pitch was a littletight but                                       Station OfficerHiggins

said              that            a      St.        John's            ambulance had                  just           gone            through

there.  I had some difficulty getting the ambulance onto the
                                        rft-K *7
pitch because of the restricted access. I When I got onto the

pitch I could see the St. John's ambulance at the far end of

the ground surrounded by people.    Mr F l a c k A had preceded me

 ^ XI.   When we arrived back at the ground we entered from Penis tone

         Road between two terraced houses.              We could not get very far

         into that entrance because of the vehicles                     in that yard.

         There     was   a    cas ua lty      aged   about      20     who    was   being
resuscitated by a fire man and some other people.                  We loaded

this patient onto the ambulance and then drove back to the

Northern General Hospital, again without police escort.



We arrived at the casualty entrance and took the patient

into    the   foyer   where    a   doctor    pronounced      him   dead    on

arrival.      We took him to the plaster room as directed.                The

casualty who we had taken in earlier was also in the plaster

room which was being used as a temporary mortuary.



We cleaned                                            the   ambulance and

radioed control/'1 We were told to go to Leppings Lane. There

were a lot of people in Leppings Lane and we were directed

by the police into the service road.              There were about three

or four ambulances there ahead of us.                We opened our back

doors   ready    to   move    down    as    the   queue     of   ambulances

gradually moved away but as soon as we did so people began

rushing towards us.          A policeman tried to load a walking

casualty onto our vehicle but we told him to put him on the

day vehicle which was behind us.              A police officer whose

rank I did not notice came up to us and said that there was

someone down at the front of the queue who was in a bad way.

Mr Flack ran down to where this casualty was waiting and I

drove the ambulance down.            The casualty was on the right

hand side at a point where the service road widens.                    This

casualty was loaded into the ambulance.               A paramedic and a

doctor travelled in the back with Mr Flack together with, a
policeman       and    possibly      someone       else.       I     drove    down      the

service      road     to   Peni stone       Road      and    drove     to    the    Royal

Hallamshire Hospital              because    the      second    time    that       we   had

visited the Northern General I heard a doctor tell Mr Flack

to take any more casualties to the Royal Hallamshire.                                    Mr

Flack radioed control and told them where we were going.                                 We

picked up a police escort about half a mile or so away from
the hospital. Ti-c-                         4a/v^ (
       ■^”'3 CK~ -^TO<W *^32-'          ,



We arrived at the Royal Hallamshire where there were already

other    ambulances.             The hospital      were      ready    for us.           The

patient was taken straight to the resuscitation room.                                   We

waited for a short while for the paramedic to rejoin us and

it is possible that the same doctor came back with us to the

ground as well.



As we left Mr Flack radioed control and we were told to go

to Penistone Road.           We parked up in a queue of ambulances in

Penistone Road but we were about 6 to 10 from the front of

the queue.        An ambulance man came along the line and asked

for our body bag.          We gave it to him and I told the vehicles

behind us to give up their body bags as well.                          Before we got

to the front of the queue we were told by Mr Jones to go to

the Herries Road Bus Garage and wait.                       Station Officer Eason

was there and he told us where to park.                      Mr Eason later told

us to go back to the gym entrance of Penistone Road where we

entered between the terraced houses.                        We were now able to
        get right in through that entrance and park behind the gym.

        Mr Jones came over and asked the various crews what shifts

        they were on and told the afternoon men to go back to their

        stations.       That   included     us    and on    our way   back   to   the

        station we went to the Northern General Hospital to take up

        some clothing     from one of the patients whom we had taken

        there earlier.



^4.| "7We arrived back at base at 1840 and remained on emergency

        duty until 2200.



                      hour or so during which the emergency was taking

        place   at    Hillsborough     we   had    some    difficulties    with   our

        radio   but    remained   on    ERC      channel.      I   think   that   the

        difficulties were caused by the amount of radio traffic.

POLICE CONSTABLE 242 CHILDS




HILLSBOROUGH SEMI-FINAL

LIVERPOOL FOOTBALL CLUB -v- NOTTINGHAM FOREST - 15 APRIL 1989




At 0830 on the morning of Saturday the 15th of April 1989, I began duties at

’El'    where        serials      were       formed      before     transportation            to   Hillsborough

football       ground.        On this date I was seconded to Serial Four                           (4) that was

under    the    jurisdiction           of Sergeant        Jacques.      Our duties        that day were         to

patrol the players entrance and the general area at the rear of South Stand,

Hillsborough,          that      was    to    be   occupied        by   Nottingham       Forest      Supporters

throughout       the     game.         Our brief was       to control         crowds    around the players

entrance       and also the          turnstiles       at the rear of that              stand.      Part of our

duty    was    also to prevent            fans of the opposing               teams   from clashing        in the

relatively small car park that exists behind the stand.                                   On transportation

to the ground a meal and briefing was undertaken before our posts were to be

manned at approximately 11.30 a.m.

At 11-30 a.m.          that day, myself and the other Serial Four officers, made our

way    to the        rear of the South Stand where myself and another officer were

deputed to man the players entrance.                        The other officers spread out in the

area    of     the    car   park       awaiting    the    crowds.       At    this     time    there were       few

supporters at the ground as the turnstiles were not due to be opened until

12 n o o n .

On the opening of gates there was then a steady stream of people arriving,

mainly    families with young children who were extremely                               jovial,      and it was

obvious were arriving early to ensure a good vantage point for the game and

also to avoid rushing with children later.

The     team    coaches       were      due   to   arrive     at     approximately        1330-1400       and    so

beforehand       quite      a large       crowd of       supporters      gathered       around      the   players

entrance to get a glimpse at their heroes.                          Although the crowd was sizeable
they were       at     this    time     no trouble           and were       in a happy mood             - many being

parents with young children who obviously only wanted to obtain autographs

etc.     On the arrival of the coaches there was some pushing, but this swell

was    natural       and was     controlled adequately by a Police horse that assisted

our serial        in that way.              On    the    teams      leaving the          coaches, many fans now

dispersed and went away from the area presumably to find their seats.                                                Some

however, had obviously not got tickets and were hanging around in the hope

of seeing a tout or someone wishing to sell.                                 Although this area behind the

stand was supposed to be Nottingham supporters only, there were a number of

Liverpool supporters who had eluded the officers at the gate, near the road

of Penistone Road end of the South Stand and were waiting to buy tickets or

so    meander     their       way     to    the    Leppings         Lane    end    where        their   tickets       were

allocated.

Although     the       fans    were        mixing,      at    this       point    there was       no    trouble      - no

scuffles that I saw in this area.                             During this time I was in company with

another Serial Four officer,                      stood one either side of the players entrance

door.     During this time there was a small crowd who remained throughout who

the majority were Liverpudlians - I knew this because of their scarves and

also by the accents from their idle banter.                                  It was obvious that they were

waiting     for      the      players       to    come       out    to    them.     Apparently          it    is    common

practice     for       players        and    executives            or    team     representatives            to    deposit

tickets at the door with the doorman/steward who hand them over to fans who

produced evidence             that    they were          the       person the sender had written on the

envelope.         If    proof       was     given       usually         orally,    the    envelopes      were       handed

over.      Many       people     who        claimed      tickets         this     way    were    family       and    close

relatives of the players and dignitaries that had entered earlier, but some

were just casual acquaintances.                         Indeed some Liverpool fans tried more than

once in vain to receive tickets, whether to keep for themselves or to sell
                                                                        -   3   -




    to    other        fans.         The          players          of       both           teams     made    their     way       to     the

    tunnel/players entrance and I saw some Liverpool and Nottingham players hand

    out some          tickets to fans whom they knew by their first names or they knew

    casually          and give       out tickets.                  I must stress that the numbers of tickets

    were    unknown,          all    I know            is       that    some          people were       given       by the player’s

    tickets       whilst        I    was          stood         there.               At     this     point    the    time       would    be

    approximately 1430-1440 same day.

    As     one        would     imagine           at        a    semi-final                the     crowds    at     this     time       were

    considerable, however most were jovial and good humoured, some obviously had

#   been     drinking but were no trouble.                                          It was    seen that many Liverpool                  fans

    were making their way from my left towards the Leppings Lane end.                                                           Many were

    stood        in    groups       of     four to six,                 apparently going nowhere.                     Many remained

     beside       the    players          entrance              awaiting            last minute       hands out       - I know this

     because they were continually asking myself if there were any spare tickets

     available or had been deposited at the door and had not been claimed.                                                            I did

     not   hand over any of the unclaimed tickets, neither did the gentleman who

     was the steward that day.                          The time would be around 1450 same day.

     The    crowds around the turnstiles were now very heavy although there was no

0    trouble          whatsoever          with         the      Nottingham                Forest    supporters      who     were      piling

     into the South Stand.                        It was evident that there was still a large amount of

     fans,       I cannot say what team’s supporters were making their way behind the

     South Stand towards the Leppings Lane end.

     At    approximately                 14 5 5    a    steward,            name          unknown,     told    me    that       there     was

     trouble          and     bad    crushing            at       the       Leppings          Lane    end    and    that    a    gate     had

     somehow been opened and that                                the Liverpool                fans were surging inwards,                  the

     officers were unable to cope.                                 This was backed up at that time by a large

     number of Police horses being moved from Penistone Road to the Leppings Lane

     end, via the rear of the South Stand.                                           These were the only details of the
incident that I received by anyone - as I did not have a personal radio - my

Serial Sergeant           had,       but he was having to control all of his officers the

length of the South Stand.                  The roar of the crowd at this time, nearly kick

off was       enormous, making communication by word of mouth difficult.                                     I was

aware    the     game     had        commenced     by     the    noise    etc.        At   this     point    I was

approached by Sergeant                 Jacques who was aware of problems at Leppings Lane

and although we were detailed to                     meal at 1500, instructed us to stand where

we    were in case we were needed.                   This we did.          I was unaware what was going

on    inside the ground and was not even aware that the game had stopped until

my    own inquisitiveness made me take a look down a turnstile where I saw the

now     too    familiar         sight     with     fans       overspilling       onto      the    pitch,     Police

Officers tending to injured fans etc.,                            My first inclination was to believe

that there was a serious public order situation on-going.                                    It was naturally

impossible          for   me    at    a   glimpse       to    believe    anything       otherwise,      as   I was

totally unaware what had just happened minutes earlier at Leppings Lane.                                          I

reported       back to my position where                     to my surprise several ambulances were

already making their way towards the troubled end via the rear of the South

Stand.         As    more      ambulances        were        anticipated,      Serial      Four     diversed    all

energies       in providing a route                from Penistone Road,               behind the South Stand

and     onto     Leppings         Lane.       As     the        seriousness      of    the       situation    grew,

information was limited and was mainly attained from Forest Supporters who

were already beginning to leave disgusted at the scenes they had witnessed

whilst in their seats.                 We continued to usher ambulances and other emergency

vehicles       towards         that   end   of   the     ground.         The   time,    I would put         time at

approximately 15 ^ 0 .

Many fans were by now leaving the ground, wanting information as to whether

the game would be abandoned or n o t .                        Very few tannoy announcements could be

heard.        The mood of the crowd was still well behaved, but it was obvious
some were very disgruntled,               some crying openly and expressing their horror

and anger to myself, some verbally abused me for not doing enough and for my

colleagues       for not being         able    to prevent     the loss of life            that had taken

place.     For many         of them had heard        that people were dead by listening to

their local radio station or pocket wirelesses.

The ambulances were arriving in great numbers and so we continued to clear a

path    through the        crowd   for access.        Twice more        I peered     through gates to

view     the     scene     and   was    astounded    to   see    what    was      there.     The    tannoy

announced that the game was abandoned and the crowds began to leave.                                 Many

were    shocked and many were             angry    - many oppenly criticised the               'Scousers'

and openly lay the blame with them stating that it was always the Liverpool

who caused the problems etc.                  Although feelings were running high, I did not

feel    threatened by the crowd at this point.                       I could see from my position

behind     the    gates     at   the    Penistone    Road     that   officers      were    struggling   to

contain        fans who     because     they were    leaving were blocking the path of the

Services vehicles, so I made my way and attempted to assist them if I could.

The majority of the people who were there in that area behind the Spion Kop

and South Stand were Forest Supporters                    and were not causing real problems

just weight of numbers.                There were, however, clashes of trouble mainly due

to mobile        hot dog sellers attempting to set up shop to the homeward bound

fans.          No trouble is worthy of note as they made their way home - I was in

no mood to arrest, there was too much to do etc.

The crowds filtered away - afterwards we re-grouped at the rear of the South

Stand in the Serial and made our way across the front of the Kop and sat in

the North Stand where we were instructed to wait.                           At no time did I handle

any bodies or assist in their disposal.

After     some     time,     approximately        1930,   a   hot    meal   was    served     at   Niagara

(Claywheels Lane).

At 2000 we were conveyed to El where we were logged off duty at 2030 that

same day.

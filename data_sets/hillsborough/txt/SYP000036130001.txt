                                                        28 April 1989

Dear Sir,

The media reporting of the recent tragedy at Hillsborough stadium, Sheffield,
has given considerable coverage to the opening of the gate by the police. This
aspect of the tragedy will obviously be investigated by the appropriate
authorities. However, I feel that before any conclusions are drawn as to what
procedures should be adopted in future crowd control assignments (on the
outside of football stadia) it might be helpful to bring to the appropriate
authorities' attention that there is a precedent to this case. I know because
I was there.

The tickets for the Scotland v England game scheduled for May 1952, went on
sale to the general public some weeks before the event. I can’t remember the
exact date, but it was a weekday during March or April of 1952.

The tickets were to be sold at Hampden Park, Glasgow. In those days, crowds of
100,000 were not considered to be exceptional. Therefore when I went to
purchase my ticket early in the morning, I was not surprised to see a queue of
several hundreds in front of me. Because of the large number of people in the
queue, the police controlling us, formed the queue in a snake fashion,
approximately four abreast.

The people near the front of the queue were parallel to, and up against a high
boundary wall. At the front of the queue, the police, and possibly stewards,
controlled a gate. Small numbers in the queue were allowed entry through the
gate intermittently. Those allowed through the gate then walked approximately
100 yards to the ticket sales office to purchase their tickets.

When I arrived, and for approximately one hour after that, the crowd was well
behaved, orderly, and there was no hint of trouble. However, within seconds a
riot had erupted. A small number of men, in the order of 12, jumped off a
lorry and ran towards the front of the queue. Instead of keeping their place
in the queue, and allowing the police to deal with the culprits, large numbers
of the crowd broke ranks and rushed towards the gate. Innocent people at the
front of the queue were crushed against the wall or trampled on. Many people
struggled in vain to get away from the crush, and there were many casualties.
Some of the people who had rushed on impulse towards the gate, were themselves
trapped by further waves of people rushing forward. There was absolute chaos.

Because I was not near the front of the queue, I was able to come away
unharmed. However, I still remember the feeling of despair and helplessness
which came over me. The whole episode was so unnecessary. Unlike Sheffield,
the kick-off was weeks away. There had been plenty of time for everyone to get
a ticket, but instead many people were seriously injured. I am ashamed to
admit that I do not recall how many, if any, people were killed at Hampden
that day.
     At that time, the main source of information was the newspapers. The local
     national papers gave the tragedy front page coverage. The archives of the
     Glasgow Evening Times, Glasgow Herald, and Daily Record will contain reports
     of it. I am sure that the Strathclyde Police Department will also have a
     record of the events of that day. I am enclosing sketches of the area b<
     and during the tragedy.                                                                                                ,




      I hope you do not consider this letter to be intrusive.


     Yours sincerely

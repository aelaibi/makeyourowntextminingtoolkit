possibly          one P o l i c e       Officer             to      every       turnstile.             I cannot             remember

seeing         any     Stewards         whatsoever.                  As       I am    familiar             with       the    ground          to a

certain         degree,        I did            not      require          any       direction          to       the     g r o un d .

I went         through        turnstile               ’B ’ , for w h i c h            my       ticket       wa s      marked       up,       I

handed my            ticket       over          and      in t u r n wa s            given       the    retaining             slip.       As      I

                        turnstile               I noticed a

                       there w a s          a     line      of      the                                                                          the

sear c m n g         etc.     I personally                  did      nc                                                                          and

whilst         I was       waiting          for       him,       I sa                                                                            was

orange         flash       jacket.          I only watched                     these       four       or    five        persons         and

then      carried          on w h e n       my     friend           had       finished          being       searched.             We    then

went      to    th e    gents       toilet,              w h i c h was         to    the       left    of       the     tunnel         and

afterwards             made    our      way        into        the     ground         vi a      the    t un n e l .        I was       not

aware      of     any      directional                signs         for       the    terraces,             I normally             find a

match      viewing          p o in t    behind            the       goal,       so    even       if    I ha d         of    been       familiar

The    crowd           i n c r e a s e d as        time went             on,     and went       from a          p o int       where       you

could        physically move                      to w h e r e      you wanted           to    go.       After      being          here        for

some     f iv e        minutes          even       through          it w as       packed^       I was       able         to    bend

forward           to    do m y         shoe         lace up.        By a bo ^t^twenty               to t h re e     (1440)               it w a s

packed           to    capacity             so      m u c h so      thaj/we       all    started          to chant,

No more           room."          You       could       feel      4!he p r e s s u r e    building           up     behind          you        so

that     it       became          uncomfortable.                  You were         being       moved       by     the      crowd,          I

then     became             pinned against                 one      of     the    barrier,          I was       literally

crushed against                       it.    This       would       have       been     just    after        twenty           to    three

( 1 440).         I can          only       compare        the      surge        with    that       of    if L i v e r p o o l       had

s c o r e d a goal,               then you           get     a surge           forward        but    then you            normally              fall

back     again.             My    left       arm     got     trapped           between        people,        so m u c h        so    that           I

had    to w r e n c h            it    out w i t h       some       force.        I somehow managed                   to      extracate

on e   of rny legs                in a n         effort      to     t ry a n d     climb       over       the     barrier,           when           I

eventually              did,          and    tried       pushing           against       the    people          in f r o n t ,       as        I

then     h ad         the    barrier             against       my    back,        other       poeple       were       coming         over

the    barrier              b e h i n d me          so     Ie v e n t u a l l y   got    free        of   it      by v i r t u e      of the

fact     that          you were             being       moved       forward        by the      crowd.           Whilst         it

dreadfully              uncomfortable                   I o n l y e x p e r i strife d a s h o r t a g e            of     breath          for

some     thirty             seconds.

There        were       obviously                people      c^imibing           over    the    perimeter             fence         and also

going        up       into       the    stand,          I^Taw       the     security          gate       being      opened,          and

after        a    p e r i o d a f ew m i / m t e s ,              there        became     space          behind       us a n d       the

pressure              lessened.             We    climbed         ba c k    under       the    crash       barrier            after        t h is

there were              two       lads       I no ticed who                very    very^Xvery white                   in the         face,

one    of        them       collapsed             and    I helped           to           y him       back       through            the

tunnel,           with       the       assistance            of a P o l i c e          Officer.          I would         say       the

s h ir t ,       he    seemed          to    be    in a b a d way,               but    I did       not    see      h im a g a i n .           I

stayed           on    the       terraces          for     s o me    fifteen           minutes,          trying       to      help and

                 young        lad.    He w as      certainly            in a        bad

                 We    also     witnessed          persons          in the          t^rffnel,         possibly about                te n   to     fifteen

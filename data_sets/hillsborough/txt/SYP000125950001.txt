MY SON WAS WITH HIS FRIEND, AND THEY WERE BOTH RIGHT BEHIND THE GOAL. I
THOUGHT, THANK GOD I'M NOT IN THERE, THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THERE,
THEY WERE GETTING EXCITED AND CHANTING. THEN ABOUT 2.55 I WENT UP TO MY SEAT
AND THE MATCH STARTED, AND EVERYTHING WAS GREAT, WE WERE JUST WATCHING THE
MATCH. THEN AFTER ABOUT 5 MINUTES I SAW SOME LADS JUMPING OVER THE FENCE
ONTO THE PITCH BEHIND THE GOAL, FROM THE TERRACES, AND THERE WERE 4 OR 5 THAT
DATHIS.       I THOUGHT THERE WAS SOME TROUBLE, THEN THERE WERE MORE JUMPED
Ov I r , AND THE POLICE GOT HOLD OF THEM. THERE WERE A COUPLE OF GATES LEADING
FROM THE TERRACES TO THE PITCH , I DON'T THINK THE POLIC REALISED WHAT WAS
HAPPENING. I DIDN'T, I DON'T THINK ANYONE DID.
THE GATES WERE OPENED, THE POLICE WERE PUSHING THE LADS BACK INTO THE
TERRACES, THEY MUST HAVE THOUGHT THEY WERE CAUSING TROUBLE. I STILL COULDN'T
SEE WHAT THE TROUBLE WAS. THEN THEY SHUT THE GATES, BUT THERE WAS MORE FANS
GOING OVER THE TOP, BUT EVEN THEN PEOPLE IN THE STAND DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS
HAPPENING.
THE POLICE AND STEWARDS WERE TELLING THE PEOPLE AT THE FRONT TO PUSH BACK,
BUT THEY COULDN'T. THEN IT WAS CHAOS, NO-ONE WAS IN CONTROL. EVERYONE WAS
RUNNING ABOUT, THE POLICE, ST JOHN AMBULANCE, EVERYONE. THERE WERE HUNDREDS
OF PEOPLE CLIMBING OVER THE FENCE.
THERE WERE PEOPLE BEING PASSED OVER THE FENCE, DEAD OR UNCONSCIOUS. THERE
WERE PEOPLE ON THE PITCH, SOME INJURED, SOME GIVING CARDIAC MASSAGE OR MOUTH
TO MOUTH. THEN I SAW PRESS COMING FROM EVERYWHERE, RUNNING ABOUT EVERYWHERE,
JUST TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS, I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT, THEY DIDN'T TRY TO HELP.
I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE MY SON WAS, I DIDN'T SEE HIM FOR ABOUT AN HOUR, I HAD TO
COME OUT, I COULDN'T WATCH ANY MORE, SO I WENT DOWNSTAIRS TO THE TUNNEL TO
GET TO THE TERRACES TO LOOK FOR MY SON BUT THE POLICE HAD SEALED Iff"OFF.
WHEN I SAW MY SON HE WAS A BIT BRUISED AND SORE, BUT OK.           < [y
I WENT TO THE MATCH WITH:

                THE TERRACES, THERE WERE ONLY ABOUT 10 PEOPLE IN FRONT OF US.
                JUST BEFORE WE WENT IN THERE WAS A POLICEMAN SEARCHING PEOPLE.
                THE ATMOSPHERE WAS GOOD. AT ABOUT 1445HRS I NOTICED THAT THERE
                WERE NO STEWARDS BY THE TUNNEL, THERE WERE NO VISABLE SIGHS. WE

GO INTO THE CENTRE AND THEN MOVE TO THE SIDES. WHEN WE GOT ONTO THE MAIN 2
MIDDLE PEN SIT WAS ABSOLUTELY PACKED SOLID. WE TRIED TO MOVE TO THE RIGHT BUT
WERE UNABLE TO AS WE WERE STOPPED BY THE SIDE FENCING. THE FENCE WAS ABOUT
4FT HIGH WITH SPIKES ON THE TOP. I THEN SAW PEOPLE CLIMBING OVER THE FENCES
TO GET INTO THE SIDE PENS, THIS WAS ABOUT 1455HRS. I WANTED TO CLIMB OVER
MYSELF BUT I COULDN'T EVEN TRY AS THE CRUSH WAS SO BAD. THERE WAS A RUMOUR
THAT THE MATCH HAD BEEN DELAYED. THEN I SAW THE PLAYERS COME OUT WHICH SEEMED
TO EXCITE THE CROWD EVEN MORE. THEN THERE WAS 8UDDENLEY A BIG PUSH FORWARD, A
FE^PEOPLE TO THE LEFT OF ME WERE PUSHED FORWARD, & I JUST SEEMED TO GET
PIMPED FURTHER TO THE RIGHT, HARDER AGAINST THE FENCE I WAS UP AGAINST. AT
THAT STAGE I JUST MANAGED TO CLIMB UP THE FENCE SLIGHTLY ONTO A LITTLE LEDGE.
I THEN HEARD PEOPLE SHOUTING TO THE POLICE ON THE PITCH , I HEARD KIDS AND
MENS SCREAMING. THE POLICE WERE SHOUTING FOR THE CROWD TO PUSH BACKWARDS. I
SAW THE PRESS TAKING PHOTOS. THE FRONT GATE WAS NOT OPEN AT THIS STAGE.
PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO CLIMB OVER THE FENCE BUT THE POLICE WERE TELLING THEM
TO GET BACK. AFTER ABOUT 3 MINS THEY OPENED THE FRONT GATE. BECAUSE OF THE
SIZE GATE IT WAS TOO SMALL TO GET MORE THAN ONE PERSON THROUGH AT A TIME &
THEY STILL AND TO BE PULLED THROUGH. BECAUSE I WAS ON THE LEDGE I SAW MOST OF
WHAT HAPPENED. I COULD SEE PEOPLE BEING PULLED INTO THE UPPER STAND. AFTER
ABOUT 15MIN A FAN APPROACHED ME AND SAID "GET YOURSELF OVER" I JUST COULDN'T
MOVE. IT GOT DOWN ON HIS HANDS AND KNEES AND WITH HIS HANDS THROUGH THE
RAILINGS HE MANAGED TO PULL ME UP, 2 OTHER FANS GRABBED ME AND I WENT OVER
THE FENCE BACKWARDS. THEY PUT ME INTO THE EMPTIER PEN AND CONTINUED TO PULL
FANS OVER.
I WENT TO THE MATCH WITH 4 OTHER PEOPLE.

WAS SERIOUS TROUBLE. I OBSERVED PEOPLE FROM PEN 5 TRYING TO DRAG PEOPLE OUT
OF PEN 4 AND 3 AND SO WERE THE POLICE AT THIS TIME. TWO SETS OF RAILINGS
THAT RAN FROM THE WEST STAND TO THE PITCH WERE THE MAIN REASONS FOR THE
DEATHS. THE REVERSE OF THE TICKETS REQUESTS PEOPLE TOP TAKE UP THEIR

PEOPLE THEN I'M NOT SURPRISED THAT THESE SITUATIONS OCCUR.

WHICH PART OF THE TICKET HE WANTED. HE TOLD ME "NEVER MIND THAT, HURRY UP ".I VE
STILL GOT MY TICKET.A LOT OF THE INCIDENTS WERE CAUSED BY FRUSTRATION OF
PEOPLE TRYING TO GET IN TO GROUND,AND BEING CRUSHED.THE GATE OFFICIAL WAS A
MAN ABOUT 45YEARS OLD,WEARING GLASSES AND A BROWN LEATHER JACKET.WE WERE AT
THE FRONT OF THE STAND NEAR TO PEN THREE,AND THE PAIN WAS APPARENT ON FACES
EVEN BEFORE THE MATCH BECAUSE OF THE CROWDS BEING CRAMMED INTO THE TERRACES.
A POLICMAN RAN TO THE REFEREE AND STOPPED THE GAME.INITIALLY I WAS NOSEY AS I
HONESTLY THOUGHT THEY WERE FIGHTING AND THEN WHEN I SAW THE DEAD BODIES I
REALISED WHAT WAS HAPPENING.I RAN WITH A BODY TOWARDS THE MAKESHIFT MORTUARY
A Nf pA S VERY UPSET BECAUSE A POLICEMAN SAID "STOP RUNNING,HE'S DEAD".I
STARTED TO CRY AND INSIDE THE MORTUARY IT R1ALLY HIT ME.EVEN POLICEMEN WERE
CRYING.IT REALLY BROUGHT IT ALL HOME,THE FACES OF THE DECEASED WERE DREADFUL.
ALL BLUE AND PURPLE AND THEIR EYES WERE HALF OPEN.ITS HAUNTING ME.I RESENT
THE MEDIA COVERAGE BECAUSE INSIDE THE MORTUARY THE POLICE COULDN'T DO ENOUGH.
I FELT GUILTY BECAUSE I REFUSED TO HELP CARRY THE BODY OF A 14 YEAR OLD BOY
TO THE MORTUARY BECAUSE I WAS TOO UPSET.THE POLICEMAN TOLD ME NOT TO WORRY AS
HE UNDERSTOOD.I WAS AT HEYSEL STADIUM BUT I NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE
THIS.THERE WAS FAULTS ON BOTH SIDES.THE START OF THE MATCH SHOULD HAVE BEEN
DELAYED,ITS BEEN DONE BEFORE.                                   ________

INFO      » I WENT TO THE MATCH WITH THE DEESIDE LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS CLUB.
            WE DID NOT GET THERE UNTIL ABOUT 2.50PM AND WHEN WE GOT TO THE
            LEPPINGS LANE GATES THE SCENES WERE INCREDIABLE. PEOPLE WERE
            CRUSHED AGAINST EACH OTHER AND THERE WERE ONLY A FEW HORSES
            OUTSIDE TO ASSIST WITH THE CROWD CONTROL. MY FRIEND         HAD A
            ASTHMA ATTACK AND YET NOBODY HELPED HIM AND THE POLICE THOUGHT HE
            WAS PLAYING UP.

HE WAS EVENTUALLY DRAGGED ASIDE BY ANOTHER FAN. PEOPLE WERE CLIMBING OVER
THE WALL AND GETTING INTO THE GROUND AND YET NOBODY WAS STOPPING THEM. THE
GATES WAS THEN OPENED AND I MADE MY WAY THROUGH AND THE GATE WAS CLOSED
AGAIN.        WAS LEFT OUTSIDE. I MADE MY WAY THROUGH THE TUNNEL UNASSISTED
BY ANY STEWARDS BECAUSE THERE WERE NONE. THE PEN WAS QUITE PACKED THEN AND I
MANAGED TO MAKE MY WAY TO THE FRONT ABOUT A FEW YARDS FROM THE FRONT. THERE
WAS A SUDDEN SURGE FORWARD AND WE SHOUTED AT A POLICE WOMAN AT THE FRONT AND
ASKED HER TO OPEN THE GATES BUT SHE SAID SHE COULD NOT BECAUSE SHE DID NOT
m m A KEY. IT WAS OPENED ABOUT A MINUTE LATER, DURING THAT TIME PEOPLE WERE
CnHBING OVER YET WHEN WE MADE OUR WAY ONTO THE PITCH THE POLICE TRIED TO
DIRECT US TO ANOTHER SECTION. THE POLICE THNE LINED UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
PITCH UNAWARE OF WHAT WAS GOING ON. TOGETHER WITH A CROWD OF FANS I MADE MY
WAY UP TO THE NOTTS END TO GET THE ADVERTISING HOARDINGS AND THE NOTTS CROWD
BEGAN TO JEER AT US AND BE ABUSIVE. A LOAD OF OF LIVERPOOL FANS THEN MADE
THERE WAY TO THE KOP END TO TRY AND SORT THEM OUT AND THE POLICE HAD TO STOP
THEM. I HELPED PEOPLE GET OUT OF THE CRUSH AND ONE MANS ANKLE ACTUALLY BROKE
INFRONT OF ME. I HELPED ONE YOUNG LAD OUT BUT HE DIED. SEVERAL POLICE THEN
TRIED TO HELP OUT. THERE APPEARED TO BE A TOTAL LACK OF COMMUNICATION AS TO
WHAT WAS GOING ON. WHEN IT ALL BEGAN TO CLEAR I TRIED TO LOOK FOR JOHN AND
WE LATER FOUND OUT THEY HE HAD BEEN IDENTIFIED AS DEAD BY THE CLUB MANAGER
FOR A GROUP                  AND            ].
NOBODY KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON AND THERE WAS LACK OF SUPERVISION.

 AT ABOUT 1505HRS A LARGE CRUSH DEVELOPED IN THE PEN BEHIND THE GOAL AT THE
 WEST STAND END. THERE WERE NO GATES AT THE FRONT OF THE TERRACES OPEN AT THIS
 POINT. 1510HRS THE GATE WAS OPENED AND FANS THAT HAD ALREADY CLIMBED OVER THE
 FENCE AND WERE ON THE PITCH TRIED TO RIP DOWN THE GATES IN ORDER TO HELP THE
 OTHER FANS OUT THAT WERE   BEING CRUSHED. BY 1530HRS   THE FIRST INJURED FANS
 WERE BEING CARRIED OUT OF THE GROUND. THIS WAS BEING DONE BY OTHER LIVERPOOL
 FANS.WELL AFTER 1430HRS THE FIRST AUDIBLE TANNOY MESSAGE WAS HEARD.AT NO
 STAGE DID I WITNESS ANY ASSAULTS ON ANY RESCUE SERVICES,OR LOOTING OF THE
 DBAD AND INJURED PEOPLE.   I DID NOT SEE ONE STEWARD   DURING THE MATCH, ONCEIN
 TIP GROUND THERE WERE NO   DIRECTIONAL SIGNS TELLING   FANS WHERE TO GO,OR
 STEWARDS. AT THE TIME I ARRIVED WHICH WAS 1330HRS THE POLICE HAD THE CROWD
 OUTSIDE UNDER CONTROL BUT I GOT THERE EARLY AND IT WAS FAIRLY CLEAR AT THIS
 TIME. THERE WAS A TOTAL LACK OF COMMUNICATION INSIDE THE GROUND. THERE WERE
 PEOPLE PASSING OUT ALL AROUND ME. WELL AFTER THE CRUSH I WENT ONTO THE PITCH
 TO LOOK FOR A FRIEND I HAD LOST DURING THE CRUSH. THERE WERE DEAD AND INJURED
 PEOPLE ALL AROUND ME ALL ON THE PITCH.

INFO      »      I GOT TO THE CAR PARK AT 2:40. I ATTENDED LAST YEAR AND PARKED IN
                 A SCHOOL YARD AND WENT DOWN A DUAL CARRIAGEWAY. LAST YEAR THERE
                 WERE MOBILE VIDEO VANS BEING USED BY THE POLICE THIS YEAR THERE
                 WERE NONE. IT WAS NORMAL ON THE WAY TO THE GROUND. ABOUT
                 200YARDS TO ENTRANCE C THERE WAS JUST A MASS OF PEOPLE THERE WAS
                 NO SEGREGATION AT THE TURNSTYL1S. I MANAGED TO GET TO THE
                 TURNSTYLE, ABOUT 30 FT

AWAY FROM THE TURNSTYLE THERE WAS A SMALL WALL A POLICEMAN WAS STANDING ON
THE WALL AND WAS HELPING TO GET THE FANS OVER INTO THE GROUND . THEY DID NOT
GO THROUGH THE TURNSTYLE. THIS WAS ABOUT 2s50PM.
IT WAS ABOUT 3i05 WHEN OFFICERS ON THE PITCH OPENED THE GATE TO LET FANS
ONTO THE PITCH. A FEW MOMENTS LATER THIS GATE WAS THEN CLOSED. THERE WAS
STILL PEOPLE TRAPPED IN THE PEN BELOW. I SAW PEOPLE BEING PASSED OVER AND
CLIMBING OVER THE BLUE FENCE TO GET OUT OF THE CRUSH. I DIDNT REALISE WHAT
WAS HAPPENING. SOMETHING WAS BEING SAID OVER THE TANNOY BUT I DONT KNOW WHAT.
WAS BEING SAID.
W   POLICE WERE JUST STANDING IN FRONT OF THE FENCE THEY SEEMED TO BE
SBvENTING THE FANS GETTING ONTO THE PITCH. A BOBBY DID THEN RUN ONTO THE
PITCH AND STOPPED THE MATCH.
I DID SEE PEOPLE RECEIVING FIRST AID ON THE PITCH.
I LEFT THE GROUND AT ABOUT 4 t30PM THERE WERE LOTS OF AMBULANCES OUTSIDE.
I SAW LOTS OF DOCTORS AND FIRE CREWS. IT WAS CHAOS.

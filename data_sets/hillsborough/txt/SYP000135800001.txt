  Mr. J. Glover.


  L iv e r p o o l


  Dear Mr. Glover,

  Thank you for your letter of the 15th of October. I am sure that the loss of
  a son. or brother must be a very terrible experience and X am very sorry
  indeed to read your descriptions


  It is of course impossible to replace your son and in that sense X suppose
  the loss will always be with you, but I do hope that                       ~|
                     may enable allof you to come to terns with the situation
  and at least to tind a measure of peace.

  I am also sorry to                read that you found the format of the Inquest frustrating
  and intimidating.                 I and my staff had gone to considerable lengths to try and
  avoid this as far                asit is possible to do so in the context of a coronal
  Judicial Inquiry.                 X am obviously sorry that we appear not to have succeeded
  in your case.

 If I now turn to the points which you have raised, (I will use the same
 numbered paragraphs as you have) t -

           1- With very great respect the transcript   of the hearing does not bear
               out your description. I do not know whether you have seen acopy of
               the transcript, but it might well assist if you have a look at it.
               I am satisfied that sufficient evidence was taken at the Inquest and
               that no further explanation o£ this point is required-

          2.     The three issues which you mention are clearly outside the
                  parameters of an Inquest whichever way one looks at it and
                  in the circumstances, it is not practical or possible for me
                  to look into the matters which you mention.

                 I note what you say regarding the official complaint.  I have no
                 knowledge of this and no doubt if you wish to pursue it you should
                 do so directly with the South Yorkshire Police, assuming that your
                 complaint was made to th e m .
& 31'JO   90   11:38     ©1609                     MEDICO LGL CNTER                        ©002


                                               -     2   -




                    In the circumstances, I do not think that I can take this matter any
                    further.

               4.   With very great respect your- description does not accord with the
                    transcript of the Inquest. I also have to point out to you that the
                    only evidence which was- put to the court was what is in the
                    transcript. X think that i£ you would study it, you would see
                    that your concern is not justified.

      In the light of what I have said I do not think it appropriate to recall the
      pathologist nor do I intend to allow evidence to be re-opened in. respect o£
      matters which have already been adequately dealt with.

      With regard to the calling of witnesses, I am presently considering this and
      Joe is certainly on the list as a potential witness, though as I have already
      indicated, and in order to make it quite clear I would not be prepared to
      listen to evidence which is not gennaine.

      I am sending a copy of this letter to your solicitors as they sent me
      what looks like a photocopy; but is not in fact an entirely identical
      letter.

On the     inside      of the       ground       there was          space      in the       terrace,      there was

space    on the       inside       of   the turns t i l e s         in concourse,            and    room to ease

the    situation,

If the gates were             o p e n e d there may be              crushing and            injury on the

inside     but     the m e s a a g e     I was     receiving         from the outside was                 that

unless     I opened the            gates and eased the                  pressure          people w ould      be

.seriously       injured      or killed.

Superintendent            MARSHALL        is a very e x p e r i e n c e d           police    officer      and    if

he w a n t e d the gates           o p e n e d , which       is not      normally a consideration,

then    the    s i t u a t i o n must . b e     vary serious            indeed.

Whilst     I am co n s i d e r i n g      the    position and            considering          the    options

Superintendent MURRAY                   said to me,

"Mr DUCKESMFI ELD,           are yo u going            to open the            gates?”

I remember         s t a nding     there and           saying my thoughts a loud                   so that

others,       if they I”!eard it, w ould                   realise      it was a cons i d e r e d



"If    there's       likely to be           serious         injury      or aeath          i ’ve no option but

About    this      time    I h eard a n o t h e r ra d i o nie s sage               from s one one who        said

w a r d s t o t h e e f f e c:1,

"It does       not matter          whether       you       open   the    gates       or    not,    this   gate's

g oi n g i n a nyway".

that    it was      in f l a n g e r o f c o 1 1a p s 1 n g and         people       being    injured.

My    immediate       r e a ction       to that was          that    if a gate            collapsed due to

crowd    pressure         those     im m e d i a t e l y    in front      of the gate w o u l d           fall and

no doubt      be    injured,            In addition,          those      faliing may be t r a m p 1ed u p o n .

had    been a serious               incident              and a large           number        of    casualties.

the    game w ould have               to       be    postponed but              that        I did   not want          this

The    reasons          for    this were             that       they may        create an a d ditional                 public

with     this ~ and            it was          essential           that all           the    casualties and dead

were     removed from the area                           before any a n n o u n c e m e n t s           were made.

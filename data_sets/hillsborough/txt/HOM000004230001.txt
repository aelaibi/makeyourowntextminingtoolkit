    HOME AFFAIRS SELECT COMMITTEE INQUIRY INTO POLICING FOOTBALL
    HOOLIGANISM

*   I was grateful to you for your assistance with the drafting
    of/' the Home Office memorandum of evidence. The memorandum
    has now been submitted to the Committee.


    2.   The Home Office has been asked to give oral evidence on
    28 November and we have started preparing a briefing package,
    probably for Lord Ferrers' use. I should be grateful for a
    line to take and short background note by 7 November on the
    role of attendance centres in dealing with football hooligans.

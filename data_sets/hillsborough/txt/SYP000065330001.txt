             I saw a few P o l i c e m e n                      before       the      turnstiles         but after          entering        1 saw

             some mo re and                     in fact         I was       searched.           1 also        saw some       stewards,           they

             were          standing             by   the      entrance          to tne West            stand.

             1 purchased a                      programme          and      then went        into       the    tunnel       in front        of t h e

             turnstiles.                      I had no trouble                  walking      through the               tunnel     but when        I

    pm.        It looked full and              I tried to get             in but          c o u l d n ’t do so.       In

    view of this             1 turned        around and wa l k e d back               o u t , I did this wit h no

    difficulty,              I    remembered        from       last year       that       I could get a r o u n d the

    other       side,,       I recalled        seeing          one sign to the             right    of the       tunnel

    looking at             it from the        turnstiles.              I h a d n ’t seen this s             i    m   y      way

    i nto      the t u n n e 1 .

    1 then went            around     the     side and          into    pens*one and/fwo and walked
                                                                               v            x                    v

    towards          the   front     of this        pen.        I took    up               i t i o n about      three      steps

    back and alongside                the     fence       to    pen three.

    I d i d n ’t notice a n y thing                in particular at                this    time    but about         10,

    mi nutes         before      ki ck-of f I saw people                climbing          from    pen IhpB'e into

^   the   pen     I was      in.     From this        time more and more                   people       began to jump

    into       the    oen 1 was      js n          also        some were       spilling          onto    the    pitch

    itself.           At about J ,            pm a person jumped                   into    our    pen and he hurt               his

    ankle as he landed.  He was about 20 years old he was average build

    and was wearing a T Shirt arid jeans. Someone had gone to help him and

    I joined this                person and we        took       him towards          the       front    gate w h i c h was

    now open and            the game        had     finished.

    we then          helped      this man onto            the    pitch area and             I recall       that      it was

    d ifficult         to get from the              pen to the          pitch as there were                no steps.             1

^   in fact       grazed my knee and was a s s isted by a Police                                  woman.

    I got       onto the          pitch and was           told by the Police                to go to the side,

    w ni c n    I did.           1 stood at the           side    of the       pitch on the opposite                  side       to

    my    pen.        I saw some Police              come       onto    the    touchline          from    inside.          At

    this       time    I saw some           ball    boys       running    to the S p i o n Kop and               puli      off

    some advert i s i n g           boards,        this    then happened all                the way around            the

    ground.           I also       joined     in and with some                others       I carried a board down

    to the goal            mouth     in front        of    pens    three and four.

    A man was          then       1 iftea onto       the       board.     The man was about 35 years,

I have received your faxed further submissions dated 11 December 1997.


Perhaps you would care to explain why these submissions are delivered at such a late stage of
my Scrutiny. At our meeting on 30 September 19971 made it perfectly plain what aspects of
your submissions then caused me concern and I asked for references that supported your
submissions. I understood that these were supplied in a note sent by Miss Adlington in her
letter of 17 October.


I am considering your latest submissions. But all the points you now make could and should
have been made at a much earlier stage.

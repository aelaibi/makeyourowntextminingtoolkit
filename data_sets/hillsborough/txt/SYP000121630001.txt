                Prior to the game starting                    I was engaged in duties outside the. ground

                Up until 2 . 30pm          (1430)      the crowd,     although great        in numbers,         entered

                perimeter-

                After 2.30pm          (1430)      however a large         influx of supporters           on foot and

                in coac:hes eaused the area around Le ppings Lane to be                               e y & Y $ ^V

                trying to push their way into the turnstiles.

                During the following 45 minutes a number of Liverpool                               supi        --

            When     the      majority        of    supporters              had      entered         the      ground           PC    Beardsai1

            and    myself       were       directed         to       Police         the      pens    3 and          4    of    the       Leppings

            Lane.

            By    pushing       our     way     into       the       pen    we      were     able        to    stand          at    the      rear     of

            the    st a n d , albeit          for       only     five       minutes          where        upon          the    sheer        number

            of    supporters           caused       us     to    be     pi n n e d     up     against          the       rear       of    the      pen.

            We    then     again      forced        our     way       out      of    the      pen    and       into          the    yard      on    the

            opposite          side    of    the     tunnel           which       leads        to    pens       3,       7,    4.

            I have       no    knowledge           of    any     gates         being         opened       d u r i ng         the    game      but      I

            am    aware       that     during       the     match          the      tunnel         was    extremely                crowded         with

            several        supporters          unable           to    even       get      into      the       front          past    the      gates.

      i f you are dying" w r i t t e n by Fiona McDonald was published in the e d i t i o n of
      the Sun newspaper dated the 16th June 1989. The a r t i c l e i s drawn to
      members a t t e n t i o n in order t h a t they may consid er whether they wish to take
      any ac tio n in r e s p e c t of the a r t i c l e as i t i s considered t h a t i t i s an
      unwarranted attem pt to hold F i r e Service procedures and the a c tio n s of
      Miss Davies, a F i r e Service Control o p era to r to r i d i c u l e .

2.    The a r t i c l e was published t h r e e days a f t e r Miss Davies had given evidence
      to the Hillsborough Inquiry on how a re q u e s t made to the F ire Service by
      South Yorkshire Police for c u t t i n g equipment to be d e liv ered to the
      Hillsborough F ootbal1 Ground was d e a l t with. A t r a n s c r i p t of the actual

      hopes t h a t when h i s r e p o r t i s w r i t t e n everything will be published in
      c o n te x t. He a lso suggested t h a t the m atter could be r e f e r r e d to the Press
      Council. This course of ac tio n i s considered to be an a p p ro p riate course
      which the Authority may wish to adopt in the circumstances.

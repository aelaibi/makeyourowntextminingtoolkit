Kevin       was             getting             himself          ready,          I know             that                       father             was    going

to    take          them          to       the       coach       in    his       car.           That          was    the       last          time       I saw

Kevin       alive.                    On    a    weekend             I do    some          voluntary                work       with          maladjusted

children                in R u n c o r n .                I had       returned             to       the       office          at    about          3pm       (1500)

and    was          listening                   to    the       radio.           I heard             that       there          was       a    crowd

problem             at          Hillsborough                but       never       really             thought          anything                of       it.        It

was    about                3.30pm          (1530)          that       I switched                   on    the       television                and       saw       the

full       extent                of    what          was    happening.                 I       rang       my    wife          at    her       mothers             but

she    was          out          shopping.                 She       rang    me       back          at    about       3.45pm             (1545)          and       was

very       concerned.                       I went          back       to    my       house          and       my    wife          was       already

there.              By          this       time       the       emergency             telephone                number          had       been          displayed

on    the       television.                          We    kept       ringing          and          ringing          but       c o u l d n ’t          get

did    start                worrying             and       panicking.

We    were          still             trying          to    get       through          on       t he      emergency                line       but       couldn'

rang       them       but     there       was        no    news       of       Kevin.

At    about       8pm        (EOOO)                       and       Steve          came     to     my    house             and    explained

that       Kevin       h a d n ’t    come        back          to    the       coach        and     that          they       were       all

together          at     the    Lappings              Lane          end       during        the     crush.                 They    got

separated             and     didn't        see       Kevin          again.              I was      panic          stricken             at    this

time.        I    rang        Runcorn           Police          Station             and     they        told       me       there       was

nothing          they        could     do       and       advised             me    to    keep      ringing                the    emergency

phone       number.

My    wife       and     I my       b r o t h e r , _________                 then       left      in    his       car       and    travelled

to    Sheffield.               We    met        up    with                            two     brother             in       laws    I don't          know

their       names,           they    had        been       touring             the       hospitals            looking             for

Kevin.

We    went       to    the     Northern              General          and          they     took        us    to       a    large       room

upstairs          and        went    through              the       casualty             lists.          Kevins             name    wasn't          on

there.           One     of    the     staff          then          told       me      that      they        had 3          young       lads       in

intensive             care     that       they        hadn't          identified.                   1 w e n t up            and     viewed         them

but       Kevin       w a s n ’t a m o n g s t        them.

The       male    nurse        then       told        us       that       the        only     alternative                   was    to    r e t u r n to

Hillsborough.                  He    advised              us    to    leave           the     car       there          and       introduced             us

to    a    social        services           counsellor                who          drove      us    to       HillsM/ough.

We    parked          the     car    up     and       then          queued          for     about        an       hour       to    get       in.        I

told       one    of     the    Police           Officers             who          I was      looking             for       and    they       took

the       description           of     Kevin          and       the       clothing           he     was       wearing.              I was

eventually             shown        some        polaroid             photographs                 and     after             studying          them       at

length,          for     3    times       I picked              out       a    photograph               that       looked          like       Kevin.

The       Policeman           then     went          away,          came       back       and      confirmed                that    Kevin          was

amongst          the     dead.

I then       went        and    formally              identified                   tj'fe b o d y    of       my    son       to    Police

I have       a    number        of     criticisms                   and       observations               which             I wish       to    bring

             with    the    exception          of    a    pair    of    white         trainers.      They     are   size      7 and

                    the    letters       M.B.       on    them.        The    only      other    thing    missing       is    his

was      not      our    Son.




On a second              viewing          of    the       photographs,                 there       was        a    person          with a

black       T shirt           who   we     thought          maybe        Kevin          but       we    di d       not       think        t hat       it

However,           when       the P o l i c e        Officer           went       to    check,          he        came       ba ck       and    said

that       our     Bon       was    in    the       mortuary           and    I asked             why       they        had       n ot

them       to     do    this.




I cannot           understand             why       we    were     put       to    such       suffering                 in    not        knowing

that       ou r    Son       had    died       in    the       tragedy        and       having           to       go    through           ail

of    the       agony        when    it    is       clear        that    the       Police          knew           that       our       son     had

been       killed        and       presumably             were     aware          of    this       from           when       trie o o a y       was

brought           to    the       mortuary          which        was    likely          to    be       in     the       late       afternoon.




There        was       oniy       1 telephone             in     the    pi-ace a n d          this          was        not    tor        use    far

the       Public        and       accordingly,             we     could       not       notify           anyone             bacK       home.




There        are       other       matters          about        which        I wish         to    make           a    statement             bu t,      as

these          relate        to    the    actions           of    West       h i d lands          Police,              1 will           piace        It iein

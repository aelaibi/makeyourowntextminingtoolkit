I am writing on behalf of Lord Justice Taylor to thank you for
your letter to him of 29 November. Lord Justice Taylor is, as I
am sure you can imagine, under considerable pressure of time to
complete his Final Report. He therefore regrets very much that
he will not be able to see you himself, but has asked me to see
you on his behalf to take note of any further points you might
like to make to him. The Inquiry is, as you know, based at the
Home Office here, so I am inviting you to come to see me here if
you would wish to do so. Perhaps you would be kind enough to
contact my secretary, Mrs Humphries, to make arrangements for a
meeting.

      Dear Lord Justice Taylor

      Re:     Police Federation Article

      I attach for your interest a copy of a recent article which has
      appeared in the November edition of Police magazine.

      Needless to say, our Group find this article grossly offensive,
      highly provocative and yet a further example of insensitivity.

      We will obviously make our feelings known elsewhere but we
      especially wanted you to know that it is our opinion that your
      initial Report is a much truer representation of what happened on
      the day than this scurrilous article.

      We note that you are to receive a deputation from the Police
      Authority and this spurred me to ask whether we might be granted
      the opportunity to meet you so that we can verbally reinforce the
      submissions we have made to you.

      Perhaps you would be so kind as to indicate your decision and any
      suggested dates to the undersigned.

      Yours faithfully

 placed the bulk of the blame squarely on
 the shoulders of South Yorkshire Police.

 bitterly disputed by rank and file officers

     Room is equally baffled about Taylor's dis­
     counting of the alcohol factor. "We had lots
     of calls from members of the public about
     people buying drink," he recalls.
        Officers speak of pub landlords who sold
     drink indiscriminately. "Some were selling
     out of the back of their pubs which were
     supposed to be shut. One landlord went
     to a cash and carry with a van and came
     back and sold the lot on his car park."


     Heavy drinking
     LORD Taylor was concerned with the drink
     outlets close to the ground. Police point
     out that heavy drinking was taking place
     at pubs some miles away from Hills­
     borough.
        "They know this town, they've been so
     often," said one officer. "They came in the'
     morning but they knew a 40p ‘bus ride
     would get them out of town to a pub, and
     they knew where to go. We went to a call

         Dear Lord Justice Taylor

        Re:      Police Federation Article

         I attach for your interest a copy of a recent article which has
         appeared in the November edition of Police magazine.

        Needless to say, our Group find this article grossly offensive,
        highly provocative and yet a further example of insensitivity.

        We will obviously make our feelings known elsewhere but we
        especially wanted you to know that it is our opinion, that your
        initial Report is a much truer representation of what happened on
        the day than this scurrilous article.

        We note that you are to receive a deputation from the Police
        Authority and this spurred me to ask whether we might be granted
        the opportunity to meet you so that we can verbally reinforce the
        submissions we have made to you.

        Perhaps you would be so kind as to indicate your decision and any
        suggested dates to the undersigned.

        Yours faithfully

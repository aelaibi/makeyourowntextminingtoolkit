there were        too many of           tnese around.

as   the   influx       of   patients a p p e a r e d        to have        ceased.            At ar o u n d    that

time we had          received a p p r o x i m a t e l y six          patients          from     the N o r t h e r n

The Disa ster         Plan was         not    called     into effect             as    far as      I Know,          but

                     R. M. Whalley Esq.,
                     Secretary to the Inquiry,
                     Hillsborough Stadium Disaster,
                     50 Queen Anne's Gate,
                     London,
                     SW1H 9AT

                     Dear Mr. Whalley,

                     Thank you for your letter of the 23rd of May inviting
                     us to make a written Submission to Lord Justice Taylor
                     for consideration by the Inquiry.

                     You will note from your records that my colleague,
                     Ian Todd, has already had correspondence with your
                     Office (your reply of the 3rd of May) and as the Portfolio
                     Holder responsible he is at present co-ordinating
                     information from Member Clubs.

                     We would, however, prefer to delay our Submission until
                     the 3rd week of June as we have our Conference scheduled
                     for the 16th and,as you can well imagine, the Hillsborough
                     Disaster will occupy not only our minds, but a
                     considerable amount of debate.

                     I trust this delay will not prove too inconvenient, but I
                     would welcome your assurances that our Report, and if
                     required verbal evidence, will receive suitable consideration.

I*                   Kind regards,

                     Yours sincerely,
  C.   l i lAfi




                     A. M. Kershaw
                     Chairman.

                 It    had       been       anticipated              that      Liverpool                  supporters              would       enter             the

                 for       them.        This        assumption               proved          correct          and       by    3    p.m.       about             500

                L i ve r poo I         supporters                were    in    the       area          under       c 1ose         Po 1 ice

                obtained              tickets          from       friends          in    Nottingham,                   others        said         from          touts

                Drink        in       excess        was     evident           in    a    cpnsidsrable                   number          of    supporters,

                ooth       Liverpool              and     Notts         Forest.              This         included           those       in       a    drunken

                condition              and     in      possession             of    drink.             The        extent          was    such          that          I    gave

                instructions                 that       only       those       in       an    extreme             state      would           be       arrested             in

            From       1979       to     late      1987     I was       responsible              for    liaison and              in

            organisation                 of     (in c o n s u l t a t i o n w i t h       senior        officers)           police

            functions             at     Sheffield          Wednesday          Football           Club.           Prior     to    this          the

            task       was       undertaken           on a n ad         hoc    b as i s ,    usually          by a s h i f t          inspector

            or    sub       divisional             chief        inspector.           Following              the    publication              of    the

            Standing             Instructions              on    policing       football            matches         I took        over          the

            duty       of    liaison            officer.

            During          this        period       it    became      apparent           that      despite         stewards           bein g

            employed             by     th e    club many were            failing           to    do a n y t h i n g      other        than

            attend          at    the      ground and            disappear          if    problems           arose       - many        failed          to

            wear       their          tabbards        and       others    were       physically              incapable           of    carrying

            out       their       dut y.         It w a s       also   apparent           that ma n y         of    the     stewards             had

            no    real       idea w hat            they     should       do.        One     of    the       problems        on m a t c h         days

            was       that       th e    club      had     no    overall       management              of    their       stewards.

            In A u g u s t        1981         I remember         that    I received a memorandum                           from       then

            Chief       Superintendent                    Herold       concerning           the     ineffectiveness                   of

            stewards             at     Sheffield          Wednesday          Football           C l ub.

            I    brought          Mr H e r o l d ' s       comments,          and    further           views       of m y     own,         to    the

            attention             of     all     stewards         at   a briefing            held       at S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y

            Football             Club      on 2 S A u g u s t      1981.        I have           continued          to    stress           t h es e
points        in all         th e      informal          and     formal         discussions                   I h a ve     held with

Stewards          and     the       club         since      t hat       time.

The     situation            improved with                  the a p p o i n t m e n t          of Mr L o c k          as      security

officer          (in     1985       I th in k )         who     on m a t c h        days       a c t e d as       the      c l u b ’s      ’link

man     for      their       stewards             and    th e    subsequent                adoption            of a      personal

radio       system        to m a i n t a i n         contact            with    their          c h i ef       stewards         in v a r i o u s

areas       of    th e    ground.

Over      the     period          I was          liaison        officer         1     had      frequent           and      various

contact          with     club         officials            - the        secretaries                usually,          when         I pointed

out     problems          with         stewards          - t h is        included             the    c lubs       responsibilities

f or    spectators             on      the       terraces        as      well       as     in the         stands.             I am aware

this      theme        was     frequently               repeated          by    senior             officers        both        to     the

secretaries              and      the       club's       security             officer          on s e v e r a l

occasions.               I gained            the     impression               that       the       club       believed         that

because,          out     of      necessity,             the     police         occasionally                   performed

the     function          of      crowd          packing,        they         had     no      need       to s h o w      interest

or     r e s p o n s b i 1 ity      for      the     standing            cro w d s .

For     several          years         to    1987       I attended             th e      annual          meeting         of    the

stewards,             usually          shortly          before          the    start          of    the       season.          During        the

course        of m y      presentation                  I outlined             what        the      police        f un ct io n and

responsibilities                    were,         what      their        duties          were       in    relation            to    the

crowd       (including              on      the     terraces)            and    what          the    safety         procedures              were

                years       on a regular       basis-      I have known Peter McDONfiELL for the                         past

                five years and            have a t t e n d e d Liverpool          matches        wit h him for    the     past

                two       seasons,     but he very       rarely a tt e n d e d L iv erpool           F.C.    awa y fixtures.

               able        to get    it because     he    is a member         of the Liverpool              supporters

                club.        I went and      picked my ticket            up on the evening             of / r i d a y   14th

               April        1989    (140489)    I paid six        pounds      for     the ticket w h ic h        is its face

                value.        All    that   I can remember about              the ticket           is that    it was     for

               the West Terrace.

the    c ou rtyard and began          to      look a ro u n d for the         lads because            I had       lost

sight     of eve ry bo dy whe n       I had gone         through the first             gate.          The    crowds

 iade my way up to the steps                   to the s t a n d .      There was a policeman and a

  teward      checking      tickets      to the stand as we approached,                     the       lad    in

  ront was able to walk             past without          getting         his ticket       checked.           I got

  topped and was           told to go back            down onto       the terracing.             I turned to

 o     back    down and at the           same time a lad tried to run past the stewards

 ;ho g r a bb ed him,       because      of    this    I was able         to slip past and make my

someone       shouted my nickname and                 I made my way         to the back          of the stand

I was     unsure what was          hjyyffenirtg until        I saw        people on the          pitch

c lutching         their   chests and others            being    given the kiss            of    life.        We

of the number          involved.         We were just w at ch in g           unable     to do anything

we    left   the ground at about 3 . 4 5 p m             (1545)       and went back to the                  cars.

P eter M c D Q N N E L L was     the only one that was m i s s i n g.                We tried to             look

              to our      cars and made       our way back           to Liverpool.     We got back       into

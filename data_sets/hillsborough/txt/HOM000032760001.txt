           Dear Mr Pyne

           Thank you for your letter of 18 February 1998 and the copy of the report by Lord
           Justice Stuart-Smith (Scrutiny of Evidence on the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster),
           that was most thoughtful of you. My experts will now go through the report most
           carefully.

           Thank you.

           Yours sincerely

this area who were               shouting    verbal abuse at officers with                comments      of

"It's your       black     bastards        fault" and other          comments.

A long with other          officers        I a t t e mp te d to move   some   of the ^ S e c t a t o r s

order    to gain access.             Thro ug ho ut    this    time   spectators were          shouting

verbal abuse whilst we were                  doing    so.

I wa Ik ed through the             tunnel    into the area of enclosure 3 of the West

stand directly behind the goal mouth.

On enter i ng the enclosure                I could not see a ny thing         for the        large

numbe r of spectators who were standi ng                      in the enclosure.           I then

pushed through the spectators                   towards X h e / r o n t    of the enclosure where

I saw a m ound of bodies              e ntangled t^gethervSll the front                of the

W it h    other    officers      I pulled one of the          bodies      free and we           i m m e d i a t 1ey

carried him t h rough the t u n nel .-to the rear of the West

D uring      this a s^ectyior           came H^npino^flp shouting,             " I ’m a nurse what

can      I do."     I took hold of him and             told him to tend to some of the

casualties         lying     on the ground.

I then went         back     into the area behind the                goal m o ut h known as

e nclosure 3 and           commenced with other          officers        to   pull    other      bodies

free      from the m ound of bodies            still    remaining at the front                  of the

enclosure.          I assisted      in carrying        sevjrl^al                         the   enclosure

g round for first aid to be ajimi mastered.                        Throu gh ou t     this we had to

c o nt i nu al ly shout       to other spectators          to move so that we               could      carry

out      these tasks.

I could not say how              long    it was   before     the      bodies were        cleared from

the enclosure          nor how man y bodies          it was     that     I a ss i s t e d   in carrying

We    remained on the          playing area of the ground for some                       considerable

time      before    the ground had almost            cleared,         and then I was d ep loyed

     Dear Mr Whalley,

     I am w r i t i n g to you on b e h a l f of the Police Superintendents'
     A s s o c i a t i o n of England and Wales in response to the invitation
     in paragraph 19 of the Interim Report.

     First of all may I make it clear that as an Association we are
     committed to preventing a repetition of Hillsborough.

     The p u b l i c a t i o n of your Interim Report has had a considerable
     im pact on the members of this Association who are in the main
     operational commanders at football stadia across the country.

     The evidence upon which you based your Report was in respect of
     one match, on one day, at one l o c a t i o n and a l t h o u g h it had
     se r iou s c o n s e q u e n c e s it does not portray the overall national
     situation with regards to policing football grounds.

     We accept there may be justified criticism in respect of some of
     the s h o r t c o m i n g s of the p o l i c i n g arrangements and operations,
     but we feel that the criticism was biased and due emphasis was
     not a c c o r d e d to the shortcomings and failures of other parties
     who also contributed to the tragedy.

     One of our m a j o r co nce rn s is that the responsibility for the
     safety of spectators within the ground, which per the green guide
     (1986) following the Popplewell Report was clearly placed on the
     m a n a g e m e n t of the cl u b, h a s in y o u r i n t e r i m r e p o r t been
     transferred onto the police.



                      Secretary: Chief Superintendent T. G. H ew itt
                  Assistant Secretary: Chief Superintendent P. G. Wall
                                               -   2   -




   As previously stated the recommendations in your Interim Report
   arise from the events of one semi-final match, on one day, at one
   location.         We accept they have merit as a safety blue-print for
   that type of match, at that ground, however, they are too rigid
   f o r n a t i o n a l a p p l i c a t i o n and there is a need to al lo w for
   professional discretion to take account of local factors.

^ H n c o n s i d e r i n g the way forward, I should point out there is a
   strong ground swell of opinion amongst our members that football
   is a b u s i n e s s and as such those responsible for public safety
   inside the g r o u n d must be the club directors.                       Equally we are
   c o n c e r n e d that in policing football matches, we are obliged to
   allocate a disproportionate amount of our resources to policing
   football to the detriment of our responsibility to the community
   at large.         However, we are realistic and recognise that wherever
   l a r g e n u m b e r s g a t h e r t o g e t h e r for pu bl ic e n t e r t a i n m e n t , we
   inevitably have a responsibility for public order.

   As you highlighted in your Interim Report the role of the police
   is far from clear at such e ve nt s and we look to you in your
   F i n a l R e p o r t to m a k e r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s about the status and
   responsibility of the police.                What concerns us at the moment is
   that particularly at football matches, police officers on special
   duty have a dual function.              If they are exercising their powers
   under the criminal law they are constables, but in other respects
   for example, when they are ejecting somebody at the behest of the
   club, they become quasi - ste wards; we believe this is a far from
   satisfactory state of affairs.                 When police officers are on duty
   at a football match, whether they are being paid by the club or
   not, their sole status should be that of a constable.

   Our m e m b e r s fill the role of po li ce c o m m a n d e r s at fo otb al l
   matches.          Today they are increasingly required to enter into the
   fie ld of what is d e s c r i b e d as risk m a n a g e m e n t . The police
   c o m m a n d e r will not have sufficient resources to police to the
   ideal.          All police resources used at football matches are taken
   from e l s e w h e r e c re a t i n g risk in oth er places, yet the police
   commander does not have authority to require football matches to
   be planned and arranged so that these can be policed adequately.
   He cannot apply to any authority for matches to be banned or r e ­
   scheduled.          These omissions need to be addressed and in the short
   term we seek the same power as is available to the fire service
   and the local authority under section 10 of the Safety at Sports
   Grounds Act, 1975-

   In the long term we be l i e v e there should be sufficient legal
   sanctions to ensure that your recommendations 13 to 17 are fully
   implemented and not allowed to lapse.
                                              -   3   -




    We are d i s a p p o i n t e d to note that you did not include in your
    recommendations requirements for seated accommodation only at all
    grounds.        We feel this must be given priority consideration, you
    clearly recognise that overcrowding was the primary cause of the
    d i s a s t e r and all se at er st ad ia w o u l d reduce the problem.                   In
    a d d i t i o n we su pp or t your r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s in c o n n e c t i o n with
    emergency exits, sign posting for spectators and information on
    t ic k e t s ( r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s 7, 22, 23, 24), but for those to be
A f u l l y effective, there should be a common nationwide standard of
    colour and design.

   For far too long f o o tb al l m a n a g e m e n t have been substantially
   subsidised from police budgets and not required to meet the full
   f i n a n c i a l implications of providing adequate police cover.      We
   r e c o m m e n d they s ho ul d meet the total cost of implementing the
   operational order for each and every match.

   W h e n c o n s i d e r i n g the l i a b i l i t y of se ni o r o f f i c e r s there is
   p r o v i s i o n for ACPO ranks to be suppo rte d by legal advice and
   r e p r e s e n t a t i o n as a m a t t e r of right from public funds.              That
   a u t o m a t i c right does not extend to members of this Association
   who, as your R epo rt make s p e r f e c t l y clear, are exposed to a
   g r e a t e r risk but must rely upo n a di sc re tio nar y provision in
   accordance with Home Office Circular 77/87*                      We would ask you to
   support our contention that we should enjoy the same entitlement
   as members of ACPO.

   There are s h o r t c o m i n g s in police training and we as a Service
   are a d d r e s s i n g these issues.             Your Report recommends training
   also for stewards.             Police at many football grounds are required
   to undertake stewarding duties by default of the club concerned.
   The experience of our members is that there have been few serious
   a t t e m p t s by clubs to appoint and train stewards of a suitable
   calibre.           We h a v e e x p e r i e n c e of f u l l - t i m e p r o f e s s i o n a l
   stewardship at other sporting and commercial events and make the
   p o i n t t h a t p r o f e s s i o n a l s t e w a r d i n g of a good s t a n d a r d is
   available for those who are willing to pay for it.

   In the Luton Sc heme there are a tt ra ct i on s, especially in the
   i m p r o v e m e n t of the q u a l i t y of the l o c a l e n v i r o n m e n t and
   substantial savings of police resources, by removing the regular
   invasion of unruly away supporters.                 However, we do not believe
   it is r e a l i s t i c to attempt to impose such restrictions on all
   le agu e clubs.          Whe re there is a p a t t e r n of s u s t a i n e d unruly
   b e h a v i o u r , we r e c o m m e n d the Public Safety Committee should be
   empowered to impose such restrictions on away supporters as they
   see fit.

   In our letter to you of the 14th June, we set out a number of
   items of concern which we hope you will address during the second
   part of your Inquiry.

           Finally we are concerned about the resource implications of the
           r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s set out in y o u r I n t e r i m Report and their
           application to other sporting arenas as indicated in Home Office
           Circular 68/8 9 , paragraph 4.

           We would welcome the opportunity to give oral evidence before you
           complete your Final Report.

   ^Secretary to the Inquiry into the Hillsborough
     Stadium Disaster
    50 Queen Anne's Gate
    London
    SW1H 9AT


      Dear Mr Whalley,


      HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY


      I am sorry that the need to consult our membership has delayed this response
      but I can now tell you that this Association is not able to give any
      evidence in respect of the first stage of your inquiry, that is in respect
      of the events that took place at Hillsborough on the 15th April last.
      However, we do feel we can conment on matters effecting the second stage of
      the inquiry.

      1.   We consider there is a clear need for the establishment of a centrally
      funded National Football Intelligence Unit. Information should be collated
      and recorded, so that profiles of activity, behaviour pattern of fans and
      changes in activity and behaviour are available to all affected forces for
      planning purposes.

      2.   We are firmly of the opinion that stricter controls are necessary over
      the sale and purchase of tickets, to overcome the effect that ticket touts
      have in encouraging supporters to travel to grounds on the day of the match,
      on the chance of obtaining a ticket. We believe there should be a designated
      area, clearly signed, near the precincts of a football ground, where the
      purchase and sale of tickets on the day of the match is prohibited and a
      power of arrest should be created for this offence. Consideration should
      also be given to make drunkenness within the same designated area an
      aggravated offence, also with a power of arrest. We consider further control
      should be exercised over public transport operators, who organise transport
      for supporters. In the case of all ticket matches, they should not be
      allowed to convey passengers who cannot produce a ticket of admission to the
      ground. Police should be empowered to stop and turn back vehicles infringing
      these rules at any point between departure and destination.




                                                      1
3.   We are of the opinion that the present local authorised safety
certificate, should follow a standard pattern - although local factors will
of course need to be included.

4.   Communications are absolutely essential to effective policing and crowd
control. Yet, after many large scale incidents, it is often established
that communications proved inadequate. We therefore reconmend that research
be carried out to improve present systems and that in particular each
football ground has the following: (i) a dedicated ground radio channel
(ii) a seperate command channel for key personnel (iii) listening devices
only for police and stewards (other than key personnel) (iv) strategic
telephone posts or points (v) loud hailer provisions and a police override
to the tannoy system.

5. We believe that each stadium should have installed, electronic equipment
to register numbers entering pens and terraces. Where possible there should
be outer and inner turnstiles to filter crowds into the ground according to
pressure. Closed circuit television should be strategically sited for
overall and close-up surveillance.

6. The provision of greenfield sites, car parking facilities and seating
only stadia must be the ultimate aim for the future.

7. We believe football contingency plans should be regularly reviewed
and updated in the light of intelligence reports. All emergency services
and club officials should be involved in the preparation of plans. Plans
should ensure that emergency access routes are available and kept clear.

8. Stewards and club officials should undergo regular training in emergency
and evacuation procedures in conjunction with police, fire and ambulance.
St. John's Ambulance and Red Cross posts should be properly equipped and
clearly identified.

9. The immediate removal of barriers to prevent pitch invasions needs
careful evaluation. Some form of barrier may still be an essential safety
factor to prevent widescale disorder, whilst obviously, a release mechanism
to allow crowds a quick exit would be of value.

10. Wherever possible the same local officers and stewards should be used
for football matches. They should then become familar with all the factors
that need to be addressed at a particular ground. Where outside officers
are used as assistance, they should be supervised and under the conmand of
local police officers.

The above points are a collated precis of the views of a number of
Superintendents and Chief Superintendents with experience in conmand in
the football match situation. I hope you will find than of assistance.


Yours sincerely,




P.G. Wall
Assistant Secretary

      I AM CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT TREVOR DAVEY OF THE WEST YORKSHIRE POLICE AND

 I AM CURRENTLY THE PRESIDENT OF THE POLICE SUPERINTENDENTS' ASSOCIATION OF

 ENGLAND AND WALES - WHICH IS AN ANNUAL APPOINTMENT.      ACCOMPANYING ME TODAY

 ARE CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT PETER WALL OF THE HAMPSHIRE CONSTABULARY, THE FULL

 TIME ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE ASSOCIATION,        CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT DAVID

(^LARKSON OF THE WEST YORKSHIRE POLICE WHO HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR ELLAND

 ROAD, THE HOME GROUND OF LEEDS UNITED FOOTBALL CLUB, FOR THE PAST 2 YEARS,

 CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT ROY MELLER OF THE WEST MIDLANDS POLICE WHO, UNTIL

 QUITE RECENTLY, WAS THE DIVISIONAL OFFICER WITH RESPONSIBILITY FOR VILLA

 PARK FOR 3 YEARS AND CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT           BERNARD LUCKHURST OF THE

 METROPOLITAN   POLICE WHO HAS BEEN CLOSELY INVOLVED WITH ARRANGEMENTS AT

 WEMBLEY STADIUM.



      BETWEEN US WE HAVE 150 YEARS POLICE SERVICE, 45 IN THE SUPERINTENDING

 RANKS.



      FIRST OF ALL,    I WOULD    LIKE TO THANK YOU SIR FOR GIVING US THE

 OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU BEFORE YOU FINALISE YOUR REPORT INTO THE

 HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER.



       FOR YOUR INFORMATION, OUR ASSOCIATION HAS A MEMBERSHIP OF APPROXIMATELY

  2,100 SUPERINTENDENTS AND CHIEF SUPERINTENDENTS THROUGHOUT ENGLAND AND

 WALES.    ITS OBJECTIVES INCLUDE AMONGST OTHER THINGS - TO MAINTAIN AND

  IMPROVE THE PROFESSIONAL STATUS OF THE RANK AND TO CONSTITUTIONALLY ENJOY

  THE RIGHTS OF CONSULTATION ON ALL MATTERS RELATING TO OUR DUTIES AND

  RESPONSIBILITIES.   IT WAS WITH THESE OBJECTIVES IN MIND AND IN RESPONSE TO


                                       1
 PARAGRAPH   19 OF YOUR INTERIM REPORT THAT WE WROTE TO MR WHALLEY, YOUR

 SECRETARY, SEEKING THE OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE ORAL EVIDENCE AT THIS INQUIRY.



      AS OUR MEMBERS FILL THE ROLE OF OPERATIONAL COMMANDERS AT FOOTBALL

 GROUNDS THROUGHOUT ENGLAND AND WALES AND HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE OVER THE

 YEARS FOR DEALING    SUCCESSFULLY WITH ESCALATING VIOLENCE AND DISORDERLY

 BEHAVIOUR ASSOCIATED WITH FOOTBALL FANS, WE HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF EXPERIENCE

 IN CROWD CONTROL AND WE URGE YOU, SIR, TO CONSIDER OUR OPINIONS WHEN MAKING

^p)UR FINAL AND LONG TERM RECOMMENDATIONS.



      SINCE THE PUBLICATION OF YOUR INTERIM REPORT IT HAS BEEN THOROUGHLY

 DEBATED IN THE 43 BRANCHES OF OUR ASSOCIATION.      IN ADDITION, AT OUR ANNUAL

 CONFERENCE THIS YEAR,    THE EVENTS AT HILLSBOROUGH, THE REPORT AND YOUR

 RECOMMENDATIONS FEATURED HIGHLY ON THE AGENDA.



      AS YOU WILL BE AWARE, WE HAVE WRITTEN TWO LETTERS TO THE INQUIRY AND

 OUR PURPOSE HERE TODAY IS TO ENLARGE UPON THE COMMENTS WE MADE.



      WE HOPE YOUR FINAL REPORT WILL SET A BLUEPRINT FOR FOOTBALL COMMAND

 AND CONTROL FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.     THE SERVICE AS A WHOLE HAS TAKEN TO

 HEART,   AND ADOPTED THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN YOUR INTERIM REPORT AND THE

 SUPERINTENDENTS' ASSOCIATION IS COMMITTED TO PREVENTING FUTURE TRAGEDIES.



      FOLLOWING MATURE REFLECTION, OUR MEMBERS BELIEVE THAT IMPROVEMENT IN

 PUBLIC SAFETY WILL ONLY BE BROUGHT ABOUT IF ALL AGENCIES INVOLVED WITH

 FOOTBALL ACCEPT THE NEED FOR CHANGE AND ALSO GIVE THEIR FULL AND WHOLE

 HEARTED COMMITMENT TO PREVENTING FUTURE TRAGEDY.




                                      2
       IN OUR OPINION, YOUR INTERIM REPORT HAS DISPROPORTIONATELY ATTRIBUTED

THE BLAME ON THE POLICE SERVICE.          IT IS PLEASING TO SEE THAT YOU QUOTE FROM

DOCTOR       JOHN   HABGOOD WHO SAID AT THE HILLSBOROUGH MEMORIAL SERVICE THAT

"EVENTS OF THE MAGNITUDE OF HILLSBOROUGH DON'T USUALLY HAPPEN JUST FOR ONE

SINGLE REASON, NOR IS IT USUALLY POSSIBLE TO PIN THE BLAME ON ONE SINGLE

SCAPEGOAT".         WE TRUST YOUR FINAL REPORT WILL REFLECT THAT PHILOSOPHY AND

REDRESS THE IMBALANCE.



^      WE ACCEPT OUR ROLE.      WE ACCEPT OUR RESPONSIBILITIES, BUT THE DANGER WE

SEE IS THAT TO PLACE THE MAIN BLAME UPON ONE AGENCY WILL GIVE OPPORTUNITY

FOR OTHERS TO AVOID THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES.         FOR EXAMPLE, THE CAPACITY OF A

GROUND OR OF A PEN OR TERRACE DEPENDS NOT UPON THE NATURE OF THAT AREA, BUT

UPON   THE     CAPABILITY OF THE TURNSTILES TO ADMIT CUSTOMERS WITHIN A SET

PERIOD.      WHILST THE POLICE OPERATIONAL ORDER DID NOT ADEQUATELY PLAN TO COPE

WITH THE MASS OF LATE COMERS,           NEITHER WAS THE GROUND CAPABLE OF DEALING

WITH THEM.      IT WAS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE LICENSING AUTHORITY, THE SAFETY

TEAM AND THE CLUB TO ENSURE THAT THIS REQUIREMENT WAS MET.



       THE    GREEN GUIDE,   AS AMENDED FOLLOWING THE POPPLEWELL INQUIRY,          SAID

TURNSTILES      SHOULD BE OF SUCH NUMBERS AS TO ADMIT SPECTATORS AT A RATE

WHEREBY NO UNDULY LARGE CROWDS ARE KEPT WAITING FOR ADMISSION.          HILLSBOROUGH

AND OTHER       GROUNDS CANNOT MEET THAT CRITERIA BOTH DUE TO THE NUMBER OF

TURNSTILES AND THEIR OPERATION BY INEPT STAFF.             PERHAPS,   THEREFORE,   THE

OVERRIDING      CONSIDERATION    WHEN    DETERMINING   CROWD   CAPACITIES SHOULD BE

TURNSTILE THROUGHPUT.




                                            3
         WE WERE UNHAPPY TOO ABOUT THE REPORT PLAYING DOWN THE CONTRIBUTORY

 FACTOR OF THE DEMEANOUR OF THE FANS, PARTICULARLY IN RELATION TO ALCOHOL.

 THE BLOOD ALCOHOL LEVELS FOUND IN THE VICTIMS COULD BE TAKEN TO INDICATE

 THAT THE MAJORITY WERE IN DRINK.



 MAXIMUM CAPACITIES FOR TERRACES



         WHILST WE AGREE WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS 1 TO 3, THE

REALITY      OF THE SITUATION IS THAT ACTION TAKEN IN AN ATTEMPT TO REDUCE

 DENSITY IN FACT HAS NOT DONE SO. FANS STILL CONGREGATE IN HIGH DENSITIES IN

 CENTRAL AREAS LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE, BEHIND THE GOALS,         LEAVING FRINGE AREAS

 UNOCCUPIED,     EVEN THOUGH THE CROWD CAPACITY HAS BEEN REDUCED.         ANOTHER

 RESULT OF THIS CHANGE HAS BEEN TO LOCK OUT FANS FROM THE SECTIONS OF THE

 GROUND WHICH ARE THEORETICALLY FULL.       MANY DO NOT GAIN ACCESS AT ALL.   MANY

 BECOME ENRAGED THAT THEY CANNOT GAIN ACCESS TO THE PART OF THE GROUND THAT

 THEY WISH TO,      YET THEY CAN SEE FREE SPACE THERE.        EQUALLY MEMBERS OF

 SUPPORTERS CLUBS WHO HAVE GAINED ADMISSION BECOME AGITATED THAT THEIR CO­

 MEMBERS CANNOT JOIN THEM WHEN THEY CAN SEE WHAT APPEARS TO BE FREE SPACE.



 FILLING AND MONITORING TERRACES



         WHILST WE ACCEPT THAT THE WRITTEN AGREEMENT SPECIFIED MAY NOT BE A

 CONTRACT,    NEVERTHELESS IT DOES IDENTIFY AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY AND

 ACCOUNTABILITY WHICH ANY LITIGANT MAY SEIZE UPON.         EXTREME DIFFICULTY IS

 BEING EXPERIENCED BY LAWYERS REPRESENTING POLICE AUTHORITIES, FOOTBALL CLUBS

 AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES      IN ARRIVING AT A MUTUALLY AGREED         DIVISION OF

 RESPONSIBILITY.    AS FOOTBALL IS A COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISE, OUR VIEW IS THAT

 THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR FILLING AND MONITORING TERRACES MUST LIE WITH THE

 CLUB.    REASONABLE- DISTRIBUTION OF TICKETS BY THE CLUB IS ESSENTIAL.   WE HAVE

                    L-
                                        4
REPORTS OF TICKET SALES RESULTING IN HOME AND AWAY FANS BEING ALLOCATED TO

THE SAME AREA.



FENCES AND GATES



     THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST AND CONFUSION WE HAVE NOTED BETWEEN A POLICE

OFFICER ACTING SOMETIMES AS SUCH AND SOMETIMES AS A STEWARD OF THE CLUB, IS

ILLUSTRATED BY THE REQUIRED ROLES OF THOSE WHO MANAGE CROWD DYNAMICS AND MAN

pERIMETER GATES.       THE CONFUSION, IN THE MINDS OF BOTH POLICE AND FANS, IS

EXACERBATED BY THE LACK OF COMMON STANDARDS IN POLICE AND STEWARDING

PRACTICES THROUGHOUT THE 92 CLUBS IN THE FOOTBALL LEAGUE.



     SHOULD A POLICE OFFICER ALLOCATED THE RESPONSIBILITY ENVISAGED IN

RECOMMENDATION 9 EXERCISE THE POWERS OF A CONSTABLE, FOR EXAMPLE BY MAKING

AN ARREST, HE WOULD NEED TO BE RE-PLACED.      WE ADVOCATE THAT THIS IS AGAIN A

ROLE FOR A STEWARD.



     CONSTANTLY WE ARE TOLD THAT STEWARDS CANNOT MEET THE STANDARDS REQUIRED

TO ENSURE SAFETY.     WE ARE TOLD THEY CANNOT MONITOR OR MANAGE CROWDS, CANNOT

USE CUTTING EQUIPMENT ETC.      IT IS UP TO THE CLUBS TO RECRUIT SUITABLE STAFF

AND PAY PROPER REMUNERATION INSTEAD OF RELYING ON ELDERLY OR YOUNG

SUPPORTERS.



     SO FAR AS RECOMMENDATION 10 IS CONCERNED,        POLICE OFFICERS ARE NOT

TRAINED IN THE OPERATION OF CUTTING EQUIPMENT, WHEREAS MEMBERS OF THE FIRE

SERVICE ARE.       HOWEVER,   OUR CENTRAL POINT REMAINS THAT THE PROVISION OF

TRAINED STAFF TO ENABLE THE CLUB TO MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS FOR THE SAFETY OF

PERSONS ATTENDING MATCHES SHOULD NOT FALL TO THE EMERGENCY SERVICES BY

DEFAULT OF THE CLUB.


                                        5
CRUSH BARRIERS



       WE ENTIRELY AGREE WITH YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS.



SAFETY CERTIFICATES



        WHILST WE ACCEPT THAT DIFFERENT GROUNDS POSE DIFFERENT PROBLEMS AND

SOME LOCAL FLEXIBILITY MUST REMAIN, WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT COMMON STANDARDS

AND ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE LOCAL AUTHORITY.                                 IN SOME CASES THE LOCAL

A u t h o r i t y w i l l b e t h e o w n e r of t h e g r o u n d ,   pressure   can   be   brought   upon

COUNCIL OFFICERS BY COUNCILLORS WHO MAY ALSO BE DIRECTORS OF THE CLUB.

THERE IS CLEAR NEED FOR SOME MEANS OF INDEPENDENT SCRUTINY AND ENFORCEMENT

OF COMMON STANDARDS TO ENSURE PUBLIC SAFETY.



        WHILST WE SUPPORT THE CONCEPT OF CONSULTATION IN RECOMMENDATION 17, IN

STADIA OWNED, LICENSED AND ADMINISTERED BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES, FOR EXAMPLE,

LEEDS UNITED, THE APPOINTMENT OF AN ADVISORY GROUP UNDER THE CHAIRMANSHIP OF

THAT SAME LOCAL AUTHORITY, MAKES MATTERS EVEN WORSE.



DUTIES OF EACH FOOTBALL CLUB



        WE SUPPORT RECOMMENDATIONS 18 - 25, HOWEVER, THERE ARE INSTANCES OF

DOUBLE BOOKING AND TURNSTILE FRAUD WHICH CREATE OVER CROWDING.                               THESE CAN BE

REGULAR FEATURES AT SOME CLUBS AND LEAD TO                                DISPARITY BETWEEN POLICE

PERCEPTION OF CROWD DENSITY AND COMPUTER FIGURES. SOME INDEPENDENT AUDIT

SYSTEM IS REQUIRED.             SO FAR AS RECOMMENDATION 22 IS CONCERNED, WE WOULD URGE

COMMON STANDARDS OF COLOUR AND DESIGN THROUGHOUT FOOTBALL LEAGUE CLUBS.




                                                        6
POLICE PLANNING



     WHILST WE SUPPORT RECOMMENDATIONS 26 - 30 WE ARE CONCERNED THAT BLANKET

DOCTRINE LEADS TO THE WASTAGE OF POLICE RESOURCES, ESPECIALLY AT SMALLER

CLUBS (WHICH ARE THE MAJORITY IN THE FOOTBALL LEAGUE).         THE NEED FOR A

RESERVE IN THOSE CASES IS DOUBTFUL.

     WE FULLY SUPPORT THE NECESSITY FOR AN UNCOMMITTED RESERVE AT THE LARGER

CLUBS.   HOWEVER, THOSE OFFICERS HAVE ONLY BEEN OBTAINED TO THE DETRIMENT OF

 iLICING ELSEWHERE AND/AT NO EXPENSE TO THE CLUB.



     WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE RECOMMENDATION 29 STRENGTHENED BY REPLACING THE

WORD "SHOULD" IN THE FIRST SENTENCE WITH "SHALL".      FURTHERMORE, WE NEED THE

AUTHORITY IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES TO BAN A MATCH BECAUSE OF THE RESOURCE

IMPLICATIONS     DUE TO OTHER    PRE PLANNED EVENTS.     THIS IS PARTICULARLY

NECESSARY IN THE EVENT OF RE-PLAYS.



COMMUNICATIONS



     WE WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORT THE RECOMMENDATIONS, HOWEVER THE REALITY IS

FAR FROM THE EXPECTATION.       POLICE CONTROL ROOMS IN MANY CASES ARE TOTALLY

INADEQUATE FOR EXISTING DEMANDS.     THERE IS WIDE VARIANCE IN THE STANDARD OF

EQUIPMENT.



CO-ORDINATION OF EMERGENCY SERVICES



     WE ENDORSE YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS 35 - 38.




                                        7
 FIRST AID MEDICAL FACILITIES AND AMBULANCES



      WE SUPPORT RECOMMENDATIONS 3 9 - 4 3 .



 PHILOSOPHY OF COMMAND



      ONE SENTENCE IN PARAGRAPH 282 OF YOUR REPORT HAS CAUSED CONSIDERABLE

 CONCERN AMONGST OUR MEMBERS.    OUR TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE CLEARLY SHOWS THAT

^^IE OFFICER IN COMMAND OF AN INCIDENT MUST NOT LEAVE THE CONTROL ROOM.     HIS

 ROLE IS CO-ORDINATION AND CONTROL OF THE WHOLE INCIDENT.    HAD MR DUCKENFIELD

 LEFT HIS CONTROL ROOM TO "SEE FOR HIMSELF", THE CO-ORDINATION WOULD HAVE

 BEEN EVEN MORE DIFFICULT.    HAD MR JACKSON ACCEPTED COMMAND, MR DUCKENFIELD'S

 ROLE WOULD HAVE CHANGED.



 FOOTBALL SPECTATORS ACT



      WE SUPPORT THE PRINCIPLE SET OUT IN THE ACT, HOWEVER, MANY OF OUR

 MEMBERS ARE LESS THAN CONVINCED THAT THIS NEW LAW WILL BE EFFECTIVE.

 GREATER PROBLEMS STILL MAY BE CAUSED BY ITS INTRODUCTION.     THE REALITY MAY

 BE THAT ADDITIONAL TURNSTILE DIFFICULTIES AND CROWD PROBLEMS OUTSIDE THE

 GROUND WILL OCCUR.   TO EFFECTIVELY POLICE THE SCHEME AND DEAL WITH OFFENDERS

 MAY NEED MORE NOT LESS POLICEMEN.       IN ADDITION WE ARE CONCERNED THAT ANY

 PROPOSED FOOTBALL MEMBERSHIP AUTHORITY SHOULD BE COMPOSED AS AN INDEPENDENT

 LICENSING AUTHORITY AND NOT CONSIST WHOLLY OR MAINLY OF THOSE WITH A VESTED

 INTEREST IN THE SPORT.



      IN THE LONG TERM SERIOUS ATTENTION MUST BE PAID TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF

  INTERNATIONAL OR EUROPEAN BODIES WHICH REGULATE THE SPORT.        WE HAVE NO

  FACTUAL INFORMATION ON WHICH TO BASE OUR VIEW, BUT FEEL THAT FUNDAMENTAL


                                         8
CHANGES MUST BE MADE.   THE NATURE AND STRUCTURE OF THE SPORT IN THIS COUNTRY

AND THE GROUNDS AT WHICH IT IS BASED WILL, WE FEEL, MAKE THEM QUITE

UNSUITABLE AS BASES FOR INTERNATIONAL OR EUROPEAN SPORT.



REPRESENTATIONS MADE BY LETTER



     IN OUR LETTER OF THE 14TH JUNE WE MADE REFERENCE TO THE CLEAR NEED FOR

THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A CENTRALLY FUNDED FOOTBALL INTELLIGENCE UNIT.    WE ARE

^flSED TO SEE THAT PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE.    HOWEVER, WE WISH THAT THAT UNIT

SHOULD BECOME NOT JUST A CLEARING HOUSE FOR INFORMATION CONCERNING THE

BEHAVIOUR AND STRATEGY OF FANS, BUT A REPOSITORY OF POLICE GOOD AND BAD

PRACTICE, SUCCESSES AND FAILURES SO THAT FORCES MAY BENEFIT FROM THE TOTAL

EXPERIENCE OF OTHERS.



     WHETHER OR NOT OUR PRECISE SUGGESTIONS ABOUT TICKET TOUTS ARE SEEN AS

ACHIEVABLE, THERE IS A REAL NEED FOR ACTION AND AUTHORITY TO REDUCE THE

NUMBER OF FANS WITHOUT TICKETS WHO ATTEND ALL-TICKET MATCHES IN THE HOPE OF

GAINING ENTRANCE.



     THE ALCOHOL FACTOR IS ALSO OF CONCERN.   THE SPORTING EVENTS (CONTROL OF

ALCOHOL)   ACT,   I985 HAS REDUCED THE BRINGING OF ALCOHOL TO MATCHES AND

CONTROLLED ITS SALE AT GROUNDS.     THIS HAS HAD THE EFFECT OF ENCOURAGING

GREATER CONSUMPTION OF ALCOHOL BEFORE ARRIVAL.    THE BEHAVIOUR OF CROWDS OF

WHOM A LARGE NUMBER WHILST NOT DRUNK, HAVE TAKEN DRINK, IS VOLATILE AND THEY

ARE LESS PATIENT AND LESS EASILY MANAGED.      PUBLIC NUISANCE AND DISORDERS

HAVE LED TO THE INTRODUCTION OF AREAS IN SOME TOWNS WHERE PUBLIC CONSUMPTION

OF ALCOHOL IN THE STREET IS BANNED.        CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO

CREATING MORE SUCH AREAS, ESPECIALLY IN THE VICINITY OF SPORTS GROUNDS AND

OF ENCOURAGING THE IMPOSITION OF MEANINGFUL PENALTIES.


                                      9
          WE MAKE A BRIEF REFERENCE TO "GREEN FIELD SITES".                                    THIS IS A LONGER

  TERM ISSUE, BUT IF ENGLISH FOOTBALL IS TO TAKE ITS PLACE UPON THE EUROPEAN

  STAGE, THEN LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND THE CLUBS MUST SERIOUSLY ADDRESS IT.                                            WHEN

  OPPORTUNITY OCCURS FOR REDEVELOPMENT, THEN SPORTING FACILITIES WITH PROPER

  ACCESS AND PARKING SHOULD BE A PRIORITY.



          IN OUR SECOND LETTER,                   THAT OF THE 19TH OCTOBER,                    I ENDEAVOURED TO

  PRESENT A SUMMARY OF THE REPRESENTATIONS MADE TO US.                                    THE SINGLE OVERRIDING

  FACTOR THAT HAS BEEN STRESSED AGAIN AND AGAIN IS THE ENORMOUS COST OF

P o l i c i n g f o o t b a l l and t h a t o t h e r p u bl i c e n t e r t a i n m e n t s a r e n o t r e ga r d e d in

  THIS SPECIAL WAY.               FOOTBALL IS POLICED TO THE DETRIMENT OF SERVICE TO THE

  PUBLIC IN GENERAL.              POLICE OFFICERS HAVE BEEN DRAWN IN TO FILL A NEED, HENCE

  LEGAL OPINIONS WHICH LEAVE CONSTABLES UNSURE AS TO WHETHER THEY CAN ACT WITH

  THE AUTHORITY OF THEIR OFFICE OR WHETHER THEY ARE AGENTS OF THE CLUB.



          AGAIN WE LOOK TO COMMON STANDARDS, FOR EXAMPLE, IF IT IS DECIDED THAT

  INSIDE A GROUND IS TO BE POLICE RESPONSIBILITY SOME COMMON FORMULA SHOULD BE
                                                                                      I


  DEVISED FOR RECOMMENDED MANPOWER LEVELS, ACCORDING TO A PREDICTED CROWD-

  THERE SHOULD ALSO BE A COMMON CHARGING SCALE, FAR TOO MANY CLUBS RECEIVE

  POLICING ON THE CHEAP AND OTHERS EXPECT THE SAME BENEFITS.



          POLICE DIVISIONAL COMMANDERS ARE REQUIRED TO WORK TO FINITE BUDGETS AND

  WITH SPECIFIED RESOURCES.                  THE ARRANGEMENT OF MATCHES AT PARTICULAR TIMES OR

  ON PARTICULAR DAYS, CAN HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THOSE BUDGETS.                                        POLICE CAN

  ONLY EXPRESS THEIR CONCERN IN AN INDIRECT WAY.                               THE LOCAL AUTHORITY CAN USE

  THE SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT, 1975.                            THE FIRE BRIGADE CAN USE THE FIRE

  SAFETY AND SAFETY OF PLACES OF SPORTS ACT, 1977 TO BAN MATCHES.                                         BOTH HAVE,

  THEREFORE, GREATER AUTHORITY IN SAFETY MATTERS THAN THE POLICE.




                                                            10
      THE   ROLE   OF   A POLICE   SUPERINTENDENT   OR   CHIEF   SUPERINTENDENT IS

DEMANDING AND RIGHTLY SO, BUT ANOTHER CONCERN OFTEN EXPRESSED IS THE LACK OF

STATUTORY LEGAL COVER.      VERY STRONG COMMERCIAL PRESSURES CAN BE BROUGHT TO

BEAR FOR MATCHES TO BE PLAYED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE WISHES OF THE CLUB AND

THE MEDIA.    TO DELAY A KICK-OFF, OR TO HOLD A MATCH AT A PARTICULAR TIME ON

A   PARTICULAR     DAY CAN AFFECT CLUB REVENUE TO A SUBSTANTIAL       DEGREE.   AN

OFFICER EXERCISING THE AUTHORITIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES WE BOTH CONSIDER HE

SHOULD, HAS THE RIGHT TO EXPECT THAT IF PROCEEDINGS ARE BROUGHT AGAINST HIM

|pR PERFORMING HIS PUBLIC DUTY, HIS LEGAL REPRESENTATION WILL BE PROVIDED

FROM PUBLIC FUNDS.

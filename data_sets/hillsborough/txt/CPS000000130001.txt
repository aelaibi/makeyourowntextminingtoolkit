                           in his Lordship's judgment, Ms
                        Baxendak’s argument on section
                        1H(I) was wrong. The scheme of
                        the 1006 Act involved the distribu­
                        tion of responsibilities between the
                        chief constable, the secretary of

                           A consideration of those three in­
                        terlocking roles led to the conclu- ■
                        sion that Parliament could not
                        have intended that the police au­
                        thority should only be empowered
                        to incur expenditure in support of
                        those duties and ancillary powers
                        specifically conferred upon it.
                           Section 111(1) must, in that con­
                        text. allow the polio: authority to
                        support what its express powers
                        and dudes also supported, namely
                        its general function conferred by
                        section 6(1). That was enough to dis­
                        pose of the case in the applicants'
                        favour.
                           His Lordship also went on to
                        consider Ms Bajtttulalc’s argu­
                        ment on section 6(1). She supported
                        her argument with reference to sec­
                        tion 88(4) of the 1006 Act which con­
                        ferred an express power on police
                        authorities to fund police officers*
                        costs in tort proceedings, but made
                        no mention of funding other kinds :
                        of proceedings.
                           In his Lordship's judgment, sec­
                        tion 88(4) was self standing and
                        had no implications for the general
                        reach of a police authority’s func­
                        tions. In his Lordship’s view, sec­
                        tion 6(1) enabled a police authority
                        to do things which reasonably sup­
                        ported the function conferred by
                        section 6(1),
                           His Lordship noted that any de­
                        cision taken under section lli(l)
                        would be subject to the principles

                    brother and sister.                    I have been a Liverpool/supporter all my life,

                   On Saturday,               15 April      1989 (150489)           I travelled to Sheffield with the
                    C/Vr                 C-*_A2jS>—
                   Harrogate & JoistrT/t Supporters Club by coach, my t ravel 1i ng companion

                   was my t*a yne r                  We left                    at about      11 am.

                    I was already in possession of a £6 ticket for the Leppings Ln

                   standing area.                    We hawi no problems getting to Sheffield and arrived at

                    the main coach oterto/about 1.15 (1315) - 1.20 <1320).                                 Present     in the

                    car park were police and stewards directing us to the ground.                                          We

                   walked straight to the ground arriving at                                 1.30 pm (1330).        I am

                   familiar with the ground and therefore had no problems                                   in finding the

S.o.fi.            ground or our entrance                      point.       There were no quewres at the turnstiles

    u . c     •    of any sort just a regular flow of people goinrfg through,                                     there were

some mounted police officers and foot of/icers at this point-                           I do

not recollect which turnstile that I V e n t                 through but I went through

with ease.     There was no person^ an the other side of jA le turnstiles

to direct you either way to the standing area but h jf personnal                        habit

I always stand behind the goal mouth and therefo/e headed for the

tunnel even if there were directions verbal l y o r otherwise I would
                                C A T   TO/A/fct            l A j ^ S T <5 T 7W l >
have gone through the tunnel.  We had a f s 4 e p a s s a g e along the tunnel
                                                            ---------------------
and at the bottom I went to the left ofl/tiyi fence, mv father had left

me prior to the tunnel as his ticket was for the N Stand.

At about two o ’clock              (1400)    the terrace was jfetill filling up at about

half    past two    (1430)     the centre section j/T s        full there was nowhere

you couldn't even clap your hands                   lejralone move,   if the crowd moved,

you moved with the crowd.                   At abarfft a qua r ter to three   (1445)   it

became hard to breathe beckussr of the pressure from the volume of

people that was building uprbehind me and there were still                        people

coming onto the terraces.                   I recolledr the teams     coming onto the pitch,

just as the game was about to kici^aff a massive surge came as we were

towards the back            I went over s^feways on to the man standing next to

me,    I managed to straighten \(^) before the game was two minutes old

people down the front started to climb the perimeter fence to get onto

the track a few of them were                  pushed back by the police.       Because of

where    I was standing            in the ground I couldn't see exactly what was

going on.I    stood whe re I was for about twenty m^fiutes people we re

standing on my head and shoulders trying to^/get up into the s t a n d .                        I

finally managed to push through the cr o^ g and left the terrace via the

tunnel.     As I walked through the tunffel I saw police officers trying

to resuscitate a Liverpool                  fan but/in vain, all    in all    I saw about

twlevepeople that were all dea d/                   I was unable to assist as it was too

late. After trying to f i ndxuy'f athe r I eventually left the ground at

about ten minutes after the annoucement to say the game was abandoned,

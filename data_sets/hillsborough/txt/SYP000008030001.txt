              I am a Police Constable                  in the South Yorkshire Police, .currently
                           -

              stationed at Attercl if fe Police Station,                   Sheffield.

              At 3.10pm             (1510)    on Saturd ay   15th April   1989    (15Q489) as a result of a

              message           received      (Operation Support),       I attended at Hillsborough at

              the Penistone Rd entrance to the grouqdy

              After        1ias i on with Senior Officers,            together with other officers,         I

              was        informed to stand behind scenes and await further                   instruction.

              It could be seen at this                  point that bodies    carried on advertisement

              boardings were being                recovered by both Police Officers and fans to the

              gymnas i urn.

              It was           plainly obvious that the majority of casualties were infact

              dead,

              After a period of some 5 minutes had elapsed,                        I was   instructed to go
                                                                            PAGE      2
                                                                            S707

onto    pitch and "DO WHAT YOU CAN".

Together with POL PC6 P A S H L E Y ,yt ran on to the pitch and made my way

down to the Leppings Ln end of the ground.

It could be seen that the        pitch was full    of supporters who had

obviously spilled out from the Leppings Ln e n c M s u r s
                                                 -------
The atmosphere was very tense and it could be seen that many fans were

grieving.      The number of bodies whi ch I could see were strewn at the

perimeter track.

I attended at the      rear of the goalmouth and assisted a number of fans

to c a r r y the body Xqf the gymnaylum.    ^

As we ran past the canti1 ever stand,           I could hear the fans   in that

stand h u r 1i ng abuse at the off i cers at the top end of the g r o u n d . The

body was      removed from the advertising      boarding and carried by

myself and other officers        into the gymnasium.

Once    in the gymnasium,   I was told by an Inspector to stay with the

body.                               Z'

I was then joined by a you^ng man obv i ous ly from Liver pool and informed

me that he was a d o c t o r .   This man then performed mouth to mouth

resuscitation whilst      I carried out heart massage.

After a period of some 5 to 10 minutes            it could be seen that the

t reatment being administered was hav i ng no e f f e c t .    The doctor then

moved onto new arrivals and my body was           covered by a white    pap^r sheet
                                                      pf 5(s>i (tf ' 1
At 4.05pm (1605) the same d a y , I was joined by a Dr BYRNE yf 10 examined
                                                     -----
the body and pronounced all        signs of life extinct.        v'

I then proceeded to collect the deceaseds            property and place it in a

bag.    The   procedure according to the forms GEN 18 was then instigated

and as much de t ai 1 as passible was      placed on the form.

I then remained with the body in the gymnas i urn whi ch was a designated

mortuary.

A period of time elapsed after which we were told to clean up the
                                                                                            PAGE      3
                                                                                            S707

           faces of the deceased to enable S-0--C officers to take polaroid

           photos for       identification p u r p o s e ^ ^ I then remained in the gymnasium,

           At    1.35am   (0135)   on Sunday            i 1 1969   (16Q469),    the b o ^ o f

           Nicholas JOYNEEB was identified to me by his mother Joy.csr

            JOYNES.        v




            The      only additional       information 1 can give       is that approximately            15.

            SOhrs Saturday            15 April   1989 I made my way into the ground via the

            Pennistone Rd entrance and underneath the C a n t e 1evar stand and

            subsequently onto the pitch.                The instruction I r e ce i v e d xonce on the

           pitch was along with other officers/was to form a.(condon/across the
                                                                       QSVidoM 7
           width of the pitch then making aiSarrier between the Nottingham Foresl

            supporters and the Liver poo 1 s u p p o r t e r s .       We were   less      than a minute

            engaged on this task and, wejj^e further instructed to stand down to the

            C a n t e 1evar stand and we V e n t , to the        tear of it.
                                                                               PAGE          i
                                                                               S707B

After a short time we were        instructed to assist and to do i^fiatever was

possible on the pitch.        I ran onto the pitch with FQL &C6 P A S H L E Y , 1

ran across to the Leppings Ln end.             POL PC PASHLEY sVfopped to assist

persons elsewhere and      I carried on towards          the goal mouth.



As you look at the goal mouth I went to the               right of it and to the

rear,    I recollect the net of the goal had been taken down.                I saw

several    fans assisting a white male w ho ^ap pe ar ed to be in a co1 lapsed

state onto a piece of advertising ihparding a wild guess would be about

5 to 10 yards away from the goal           posts.      I immediately went to assist

these fans.     1 went to the       right hand side of the boarding and to

the    centre which was supporting the lower half of the torso.                There

was    no time to render first aid assistance,             our aim was to get him

away    into an ambulance.     I recollect that the youth on the boarding,

whom      I now know has been identified as that of Nicholas JOYNES             was

wearing a red Fred Perry        type shirt and a pair of denim jeans. I also

recollect he was wearing a brown and what appea
                                           r r re d to be suede. /f I
cannot    recollect anything else about ttfe deceased.            We subsequently

carried the body to the temporary jrtortuary within the gymnasium at the

rear of the North stand.



Once      the body was   in the gymnasium I was       instructed to remain with        the

body.     The procedure following       I have described in my initial

statement of 8 May 1989.

The    procedure      carried out was once the ambulance was unloaded the

deceased was stripped of all             personnal     property by two officers who                I

believe were AKERS & _____            a record was made       in a register which was

being      compiled by D C __________      this   consisted of the      list of property,

the d e c e a s e d ’s name and the name of the officer transporting the

body   ,    I believe WDC                 was assisting with the tagging of the

deceased persons.          After this     procedure was      carried out I then

accompanied the body and all             paperwork across to DC WEIGOLD where                  I

identified the body to him.              The whole     p r o c e d u r u 1d have taken

about half an hour from arrival at the centre.                   Once    I completed all

the relevant         paperwork    I left the M.L.C.      and eventually was down from

duty at 03.30 hrs Sunday            16 April   1989.

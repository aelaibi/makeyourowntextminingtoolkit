                           _


I was born on the                                                  I am employed as a
           by                                                 in Sheffield.


I started working for Sheffield Wednesday Football Club about
24 years ago on a part time basis in the stile room,                                             or gate
room     organising            the        turnstile        operators       and        checking          the
takings.        I am still responsible for the stile room,                                       and for
about     the     last.        15       to    18    years    I     have     been       referred          to
unofficially as the senior or head steward.


This    title     is. due           in part         to my     being       one    of    the       longest
serving      stewards,              but       principally        because        of    my        role     in
supervising the stile room,                         and in recent, years              by assisting
Doug Lock, the Club's Security Officer.


My principal duties are to take charge of the stile room and to
ensure     that    the         established working                 procedures         are       complied
with by turnstile operators.                         I am responsible for the movement
of   money      and        for      League         games    sums    in     excess          of     £35,000
are involved.          It is right to say that I am directly concerned
with    the security implications for the safety                                     of this money
and the staff who are responsible for taking the money.                                                This
is   of paramount importance with regard to League                                     games.            Of
course     for an FA Cup match which is all ticket,                                    no money          is
taken,     but     again            I    am    still       concerned       with       th6        security
implications as tickets perhaps to the value of £500,000 have
been     sold    and       I do have            responsibility           for    those           turnstile
operators        who       take         those       tickets,       and    who        may        encounter
problems.


My role involves the following

1.    Supervision            and responsibility             for the      stile      room.      The
      stile room is responsible for issuing floats to turnstile
      operators,         issuing money to the Chief Stewards to enable
      them       to    pay     their       stewards,    checking         the      takings      from
      turnstile operators and from programme sellers, or tickets
      where appropriate.


2.    Making my own notes as to the number of turnstiles in use
      and available for the various areas of the ground, based
      upon       the         information        provided       to      me      by     the      Club
      administration, so that I could give instructions to those
      employed          in    the    stile     room to       prepare the            sheets      for
      issuing to each turnstile operator.


3.    Inspecting         the    turnstiles          before    each       match,      to    ensure
      that        the        correct        signs     are     properly            displayed      in
      accordance             with    the     tickets issued         to      spectators,         and
      again           based     on     information           supplied          by     the      Club
      administration.


4.    Carrying          out     further        inspections          of       turnstiles         at
          intervals around the ground, and dealing with any problems
          that may arise.            For     example, suspected forged tickets or
          insufficient         float         money,    or     where         (on     very       rare
          occasions) a turnstile jams.


5.    Preparing         the    paperwork        to    record     the      expenses        of   the
          referee,      linesmen, reserve officials, and paying the same
          (usually the expenses are agreed about 30 minutes before
          kick off and the officials are paid after the match).


I    am    not    responsible          for    the     stewards      in      the     terraces     or
stands.       Nor am I responsible for the training and recruitment
of stewards.

On    match    days,       I     am responsible          for   preparing        the    list    of
turnstiles,       noting any instructions given by ____________ \ the
Administration Manager,                 as to the number to be made available
and     the    type        of     ticket     to       accept     through     a       particular
turnstile.           I     am     not    concerned        with     the      allocation         of
turnstiles      as       I comply with the instructions                   given to me          by
                      I understand that the allocation of turnstiles is
a matter to be agreed between senior Club                            officials         and the
Police, and                             simply provides me with instructions. I
normally prepare this list the night before a match.                                  From this
list,     those      working        in     the    stile    room     allocate          turnstile
operators to the turnstiles as and when they arrive and in the
event of a League game, those turnstile operators are provided
with    floats.


A turnstile operator is not allocated to a particular turnstile
at every match and therefore could be deployed at any turnstile
around the ground. However, where there may be difficulties in
taking    money          owing    to the variety          of     tickets,       or    different
amounts of cash being handed over, we normally arrange for an
experienced turnstile operator to work that turnstile.                                  Shortly
after the kick off, the turnstile operators close down their
turnstiles and then attend the stile room to hand over their
takings.


A    new turnstile operator is normally put with                            an experienced
turnstile       operator          in     that     they    work    side     by    side.        The
turnstile      operator does             not need direct training as                   it is    a
very simple matter to operate the turnstile itself.                                  Up to 1985
I was rarely involved with any duties outside the stile room.


In    1985 Doug Lock was appointed as Security Officer.                                 He has
overall       responsibility            for security which of course                   involves
the     financial         implications           of   security     with     regard      to    the
turnstiles, which is my specific area of responsibility.                                     I do
have a Club radio.               Prior to a match I normally walk around the

ground and pay attention to the turnstiles and deal with                                 any
problems that might arise.               Doug Lock if he becomes aware of a
problem    can        contact    me     by     radio    and     direct      me     to    the
turnstiles.       Other than this, I do not have any responsibility
for security as Doug Lock is in charge. He is able to keep in
contact    with       the     chief     stewards       by    radio,   and        also    has
information provided by the computer count and the TV screens
located in the Club's control room.                    However, if I witnessed a
security problem, say by spectator violence, I would of course
contact Doug Lock or any nearby Police.


I now turn to my involvement in the events which took place on
the 15th April 1989.


I arrived at the ground at 8.30 am.                         I made an inspection of
the    turnstiles       at    the     ground    shortly       after   my    arrival.        I
started my inspection at the Leppings Lane end.                       I checked that
the   correct     signs were          displayed    outside the        turnstiles         and
found that everything was in order.


The   ground     is    sign posted A-0          in that above         each       turnstile
there is a form of entrance lettering, and the entrance letter
should match the             entrance   letter     referred to on the ticket.
The turnstiles are numbered 1-88 which includes A-G turnstiles
at the Leppings Lane end.               At the Leppings Lane end turnstiles
1-16 and A-G are located.               It was agreed for the match that A-G
turnstiles would be used for the Leppings Lane end standing,                               1-
10    for the North stand seating and 11-16 for the West                                stand
seating.    The lettering above the turnstiles was "A" for 1-10,
"C" for 11-16, and "B" for A-G.


I checked the entrance lettering against the instructions given
by                          It was important to check that the entrance
lettering was correct as 1-8 turnstiles are normally used for
the North stand, but on this occasion 2 extra turnstiles were
provided as 12 turnstiles normally used for the North stand at

the Penistone Road end were not available.


My primary concern was with the entrance lettering, but there
is also another form of sign posting in that signs about 10-12
inches square denote that particular area of the ground served
by    a turnstile.           At the Leppings Lane                 end,    there were          signs
denoting       the     North       stand,     West      stand,          and    Leppings       Lane
standing.        I do not specifically remember checking the signs on
this     occasion, but I would have done so as a matter of course,
and the signs were displayed.


I then prepared the turnstile operator's sheets by noting down
the turnstiles for each area, and the type of ticket for each
turnstile by reference to the entrance lettering.                                     I provided
the    lists     to     the    men    working     in        the    stile       room    who    then
proceeded        to    allocate       turnstile        operators         to    the     available
turnstiles.


I     regarded    the       sign     posting     outside          the    turnstiles          to    be
adequate as the ticket clearly shows the entrance letter,                                         and
this    can be matched up with the                     entrance         letter outside            the
turnstiles.           The     other    type      of    signing          is    also     adequate.
However,    I am aware at the match that in effect the entrance
lettering        ran        A-C-B.     With      hindsight          it        may     have     been
preferable to have the entrance lettering in sequential order
A-B-C, and this sequential order now operates for the 1989/1990
season.


I made a second inspection of the turnstiles at about 11.30 am
just     after        the     turnstiles       opened.            The     purpose       of     this
inspection was to ensure that all the turnstiles were open and
working     properly.           Whilst      at        the    Leppings          Lane     end       the
turnstile operators to turnstiles 8 and 9 drew my attention to
a barrier dividing those turnstiles. The lettering above those
turnstiles       matched       the    tickets,         ie    entrance         letter    "A"       was
displayed.

Those turnstile operators had told me that Stuart Thorpe, Chief
Steward for the West stand,              had drawn their attention to                      the
barrier.     At     the   back   of      the     Leppings      Lane    turnstiles,           I
noticed the dividing rails behind those turnstiles separated 8
and 9 turnstile. It had of course been agreed in advance to use
1-10   turnstiles     for the North            stand and       11-16     for       the   West
stand. As the gate was left dividing 8 and 9, I radioed Doug
Lock and we agreed that the dividing rail should be unlocked
and with the use of a hand rail to create a barrier between
turnstiles 10 and 11.          Doug Lock also stated that two stewards
be deployed on the barrier.


Stuart     Thorpe    confirmed      to    me     that    two    stewards           would    be
deployed to deter any fan from climbing over the barrier and he
would also see that the barrier was put in place.                                  I did    in
fact witness the barrier being put in place, and I confirmed to
Doug Lock what had been done.                  The operation was completed in
minutes.      I    noticed   that     the      barrier   was     in    place        from    my
position outside the turnstiles.


Whilst outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles I recall two minor
incidents which occurred at about midday.                      The first involved a
young couple, both Liverpool fans, who were seeking permission
to enter     the Leppings Lane end with tickets purchased                            for the
Kop end.     The     tickets had been purchased on the blackmarket.
(Both complained that they had paid in excess of the face value
for the tickets).           The couple explained that the Police would
not    let them go round to the                Kop   end as they         were        clearly
dressed as Liverpool supporters.                  I had no authority to allow
the fans to gain entry at the Leppings Lane end, but I asked a
senior Police Officer at the Leppings Lane                       end if these two
fans could go in at that end.               He was a senior officer and said
that     the two     fans    could not be         allowed       entry.         I     do not
remember     what I was told, save that the reason or one of                               the
reasons given was to control numbers.                     I informed the couple

                                           - 7 -


who then went away.            I accepted and always have accepted that
the Police have the right to say yes or no on such matters.                                 I
was obliged to accept the Police direction as they had control
over fans entering the turnstiles.


The    second     incident     occurred      when     a    Police     Sergeant,         again
outside the turnstiles, showed me some tickets which the Police
suspected were forgeries.             The Police Sergeant told me that the
tickets     had       been   found    in    the     possession       of    a     Liverpool
supporter.        I do not remember my conversation in detail with
the Police Officer, save that I was informed that the Liverpool
supporter       had    in    his   possession        an    unreasonable        number      of
tickets.       The Police Sergeant said half a dozen.                      The Sergeant
also told me that the Liverpool supporter had been taken to the
Police room.          I was not informed of the background to how this
supporter had been stopped and taken to the Police room.


I was     asked to identify whether the tickets were                           genuine     or
not.     The    tickets were         for the North          stand.     I took two          or
three     to examine them.            I could not tell whether                   they    were
forgeries or not.            I am of course aware of the type of ticket
that is issued.          They looked genuine, but I thought it right to
refer the matter to                                as she was able to check the
water mark which is invisible except under a certain type                                  of
light.     I      decided     to take the tickets to                                whom I
met    on my way to the main reception area.                         I showed her the
tickets     and       she assured     me    that     the     tickets      were    genuine.
I went back to the Police Sergeant at the Leppings Lane end to
inform him what I had been told, and I heard no more about the
matter.


I then returned to the stile room.                        I did not go back to the
Leppings       Lane end again that day.                   Between about midday            and
1.30 pm I did try to walk up the lane from the car park area
outside the South stand to the Leppings Lane end on one or two
occasions but was told by the Police that they preferred me not

to walk up the        lane as   they were         attempting to deter other
people from doing the same, ie fans, and it would not look good
if I walked through.       I was of course dressed in a suit.                   The
purpose of the intended visit was to ensure that the turnstiles
were open and working properly.              If the turnstile does jam or
there    is   some other problem,       it   is    likely to     occur at      some
point    shortly after the turnstiles open.                However,   I was     not
too concerned by not being able to gain access to the Leppings
Lane    end as the Club has       its    own camera        system which       shows
pictures of the area behind the turnstiles.                 If   there had been
any    problems,    I would have been        contacted      by   radio by     Doug
Lock. In carrying out this type of inspection I was responsible
for the South stand and the Leppings Lane end.


In the stile room I had a cup of tea and prepared the paperwork
to pay the referee and other match officials.                 I was in or near
the stile room for about an hour and in this period I had some
lunch.    I left the stile room at about 1.15 pm to 1.30 pm.


Between about 1.30 pm to kick off at 3.00 pm, I was positioned
in or near the players tunnel.           During this period I did go to
the    club control     room on perhaps       6 or     7   occasions.       Police
Constable Guest       and Roger Houldsworth          are based in the Club
control room.        On some occasions Doug Lbck was present in the
room, but I cannot remember who was present on each occasion.


I went to the Club control room to keep myself informed of the
overall numbers entering the ground. It was not something I was
told to do.        I remember that Roger gave me a figure on those
occasions. I cannot recall any figures given, nor any comments
made on those figures.          I may have spoken to Doug Lock on one
of those occasions, but cannot remember.


At about 2.15 to 2.30 pm I agreed the expenses with the referee
and    other match officials.       I was in the referee's              room.     I
took the figures back to the stile room and arranged for one of

the stile men to make up the expenses to provide to the match
officials after the match.


Normally,        at League games I am preoccupied with dealing with
any problems that may arise in the taking of money by turnstile
operators.        For an FA Cup match where no money is involved and
simply      tickets,      there      is    not    the     same    need    for    me    to    be
positioned near the turnstiles and it is more appropriate for
me to be located near the Club control room so that I can be
directed at any moment by Doug Lock to a particular turnstile
area.       I     do    not   have    any      specific     duties       in   relation        to
security        other     than    those        mentioned         with    regard       to    the
financial        implications        of     moving money         in     and     around      the
ground.         Whilst at the pitch end of the tunnel I did notice the
ground filling up but I did not notice any crowd problems.                                  The
players tunnel is of course part of the South stand which is a
seated area.           I was too far away to tell whether there were any
crowd problems on the terraces at the Kop end or the Leppings
Lane end.


Between     2.30       and 3.00 pm I would have had occasion to                            speak
with Doug Lock on more than one occasion, as we would normally
find that        our paths       crossed before           a big game when we were
attending        to     our respective           tasks.     I     cannot      specifically
remember details and timings of those conversations,                              but I do
recall on one occasion mentioning that the centre pens at the
Leppings        Lane    end appeared to be pretty                 full, but there was
still plenty of room in the wing pens.                       I was not concerned as
it   is quite normal for the centre pens to                           fill more       quickly
than the wing pens.            Many fans like to stand behind the goal.                        I
could not tell how full the centre pens were from my position,
and certainly I did not see any signs of distress.


I also remember a further conversation with Doug Lock when he
came up to me and said that he had just received a report                                   that
a    gate       had    been opened        at     the Leppings         Lane     end.         This

conversation took place at the pitch end of the tunnel.                              I do
not remember whether this was before or after the players came
onto the pitch.           Doug Lock said that he was going back to the
Club control room. We were both very surprised but I assumed
that the situation was under Police control.


I also         remember that on one of the two               occasions when I did
have    a      conversation with        Doug Lock that        he    said there       were
2,000    to     3,000    fans   still   outside,    but there was         sufficient
room in the wing pens to take them.                   Whilst       I remember this
comment       being made,       I cannot remember whether           it was      on    the
occasion of the first or the second conversation.


As the game started, I noticed fans climbing onto the perimeter
track.        I pointed out to a Police Sergeant the number of fans
getting        onto the perimeter track, but he said that the Police
at that        end could deal with any problems.             I made my way to the
Club control room, but met Doug Lock coming towards me in the
tunnel.        I told him that people were            coming       over the     safety
fence.      I next remember the referee leading the players off the
pitch.


More    and more        fans were    coming    over the      safety     fence and a
large number were running across the pitch.                        I tried to keep
the fans out of the tunnel.               Some wanted to follow the players
down     the    tunnel.     The Police       initially were        trying      to    keep
people off the pitch.             There was a certain amount of taunting
from the Nottingham Forest supporters who obviously were                              not
aware of what had happened.                 For that matter, nor was I aware
of what had happened at the Leppings Lane terraces.


I then received word of mouth reports stating that a number of
people      had   been    injured,      this was    followed       by   reports      that
there were a number dead.               I could not believe it. I overheard
requests        for   stretchers     from    fans   on the    pitch.       I   believe
these requests may have been made to the ground staff who were

in    the    tunnel.        I    remember     fans     stripping   the     advertising
hoarding around the pitch.


Although I had the Club radio, there was far too much noise and
it was not possible to hear any message relayed over the radio.
From there the situation got more and more chaotic.                           There were
hundreds of people on the pitch.                       It was total confusion.            I
witnessed the scene from the player's tunnel.


I was at the pitch end of the tunnel until about 3.20 pm. After
that     I    retreated         to   the    top   of    the   tunnel    and     assisted
spectators as best I could.                  For example, many wanted access to
telephones.          I was      also    responsible      for turning      people       away
from the players room and referees room. Between about 3.20 to
3.45   pm I may well have gone to the Club control                         room again
although       I     cannot      remember      with     any   certainty.        This     is
important as I do recall someone saying that a gate had been
broken       down,    but    upon      checking the      TV   screens    in     the    Club
control room I could not find any gate having been broken down.
I cannot remember who told me this, nor do I remember the time,
but it is likely that this occurred after 3.20 pm.


Doug Lock came up to me at about 3.45 pm and told me that if
the    game was abandoned we had to ensure that the                        exit       gates
were manned and opened.                    Doug sent me to the         South    stand to
ensure       that the exit gates were all manned and opened.                           Most
of the spectators were still inside the ground.                           I knew from
Doug Lock that both the Kop end and the Leppings Lane end exit
gates were open and manned.                  The announcement at that stage had
still not been made to abandon the game.


As    I went off to ensure that those exit gates were opened,                             I
noticed a fireman behind the Police control room in the                                lane
and    near the car park attempting to administer                        some    form of
resuscitation to someone lying in the road and an ambulance was
called from the bottom of the car park in the South stand, and

the injured person was put in that ambulance and taken away.                          I
was shocked by the sight of a Liverpool fan who must have been
taken through the uncovered seated area in the South stand to
the lane.


The   abandon message was announced at 4.10 pm.                      It was     still
total    confusion.      I   did    not    really    know what       had     happened
although I had of course heard reports of fatalities.


I called home to reassure my wife that
were okay.        I walked about in or near the player's tunnel and
stile    room trying to keep fans away from the tunnel                       and the
official    areas.      I was also checking to ensure the                  turnstile
operators    had returned.         I was listening to their               stories    of
what had happened at the Leppings Lane end.                   Towards the end of
the     afternoon    I was     detailed     together      with     four    others    to
collect     the    programme    money      which    had     been    stored    in    the
gymnasium.        The   programme    money     is    normally       stored    in    the
gymnasium.        I do not remember who asked me to do this task.                    It
was not a pleasant task as we discovered that the other end of
the   gym was      being used as      a mortuary.           I believe that this
happened at about        5.00 pm.         We collected the money             from the
head programme salesman.            The money was in bags and consisted
mostly of coins.        About 20,000 - 30,000 programmes are sold per
match.     I then went back to the stile room and was in the stile
room until about 7.00 pm when I went home.


Doug Lock did tell me on the day that he had received a report
from Police that one turnstile operator was seen taking money.
That was the only incident of this nature to my knowledge.


This statement is given to the best of my knowledge and belief.

        I,                     of                                          Sheffield                        WILL
        SAY AS FOLLOWS


        I was born on the                                               I am employed as a
                   by                                              in Sheffield.


        I started working for Sheffield Wednesday Football Club about
        24 years ago on a part time basis in the stile room,                                          or gate
        room     organising         the        turnstile        operators       and        checking          the
        takings.        I am still responsible for the stile room,                                    and    for
        about     the     last      15       to    18    years    I     have     been       referred          to
        unofficially as the senior or head steward.


        This    title     is     due     in part         to my     being       one    of    the       longest
        serving        stewards,         but       principally        because        of    my        role     in
        supervising the stile room,                      and in recent years               by assisting
        Doug Lock, the Club's Security Officer.


        My principal duties are to take charge of the stile room and to
        ensure     that    the      established working                 procedures         are       complied
        with by turnstile operators.                      I am responsible for the movement
        of     money    and    for       League         games    sums    in     excess          of     £35,000
        are involved.          It is right to say that I am directly concerned
        with    the security implications for the safety                                  of this money
        and the staff who are responsible for taking the money.                                             This
        is   of paramount importance with regard to League                                  games.            Of
        course     for an FA Cup match which is all ticket,                                 no money          is
        taken,     but     again         I    am    still       concerned       with       the        security
        implications as tickets perhaps to the value of £500,000 have
        been     sold    and     I do have           responsibility            for   those           turnstile
        operators        who     take        those       tickets,       and    who        may        encounter
        problems.


        My role Involves the fol owing :-

1.    Supervision and responsibility                   for the          stile       room.   The
      stile room is responsible for issuing floats to turnstile
      operators,         issuing money to the Chief Stewards to enable
      them       to   pay       their    stewards,    checking          the    takings      from
      turnstile operators and from programme sellers, or tickets
      where appropriate.


2.    Preparing the paperwork to record the number of turnstiles
          in use and to be made available for certain areas of the
          ground      based      upon     information       provided           by    the    Club
      administration and giving instructions to those                                  employed
          in the stile room to prepare the sheets to be issued to
          each turnstile operator.


3.    Inspecting the turnstiles before each match to ensure that
          the correct signs are properly displayed, and to check the
          allocation of turnstiles against the information provided
          by the Club administration.


4.    Carrying         out       further       inspections         of     turnstiles          at
          intervals around the ground, and dealing with any problems
          that may arise.          For example, suspected forged tickets or
          insufficient          float     money,      or     where        (on       very    rare
          occasions) a turnstile jams.


5.    Preparing        the      paperwork      to   record     the      expenses       of   the
          referee,     linesmen, reserve officials, and paying the same
          (usually the expenses are agreed about 30 minutes before
          kick off and the officials are paid after the match).


I    am    not     responsible          for   the   stewards       in    the    terraces      or
stands.       Nor am I responsible for the training and recruitment
of stewards.


On   match       days,      I   am responsible        for    preparing          the    list   of

turnstiles,       noting any instructions given by                                            the
Administration Manager,                as to the number to be made available
and     the    type        of    ticket      to      accept      through     a       particular
turnstile.           I     am    not    concerned         with     the      allocation            of
turnstiles      as       I comply with the instructions                   given to me             by
                      I understand that the allocation of turnstiles is
a matter to be agreed between senior Club officials                                    and the
Police, and                            simply provides me with instructions. I
normally prepare this list the night before a match.                                  From this
list,     those      working       in     the     stile    room     allocate          turnstile
operators to the turnstiles as and when they arrive and in the
event of a League game, those turnstile operators are provided
with    floats.


A turnstile operator is not allocated to a particular turnstile
at every match and therefore could be deployed at any turnstile
around the ground. However, where there may be difficulties in
taking    money          owing   to the variety           of     tickets,       or    different
amounts of cash being handed over, we normally arrange for an
experienced turnstile operator to work that turnstile.                                  Shortly
after the kick off, the turnstile operators close                                    down their
turnstiles and then attend the stile room to hand over their
takings.


A   new turnstile operator is normally put with                             an experienced
turnstile       operator         in     that      they    work    side     by    side.        The
turnstile      operator does            not need direct training as                    it    is    a
very simple matter to operate the turnstile itself.                                  Up to 1985
I was rarely involved with any duties outside the stile room.


In 1985 Doug Lock was appointed as Security Officer.                                    He has
overall       responsibility           for   security which         of course          involves
the     financial         implications          of   security      with     regard      to    the
turnstiles, which is my specific area of responsibility.                                     I do
have a Club radio.               Prior to a match I normally walk around the
ground and pay attention to the turnstiles and deal with                                      any

problems that might arise.              Doug Lock if he becomes aware of a
problem     can    contact      me     by     radio    and     direct       me    to     the
turnstiles.        Other than this, I do not have any responsibility
for security as Doug Lock is in charge. He is able to keep in
contact     with    the      chief    stewards        by    radio,      and      also    has
information provided by the computer count and the TV screens
located in the Club's control room.                   However, if I witnessed a
security problem, say by spectator violence,                      I would of course
contact Doug Lock or any nearby Police.


I now turn to my involvement in the events which took place on
the 15th April 1989.


I arrived at the ground at 8.30 am.                        I made an inspection of
the    turnstiles       at   the     ground    shortly       after   my       arrival.     I
started my inspection at the Leppings Lane end.                         I checked that
the   correct      signs were        displayed outside the              turnstiles       and
found that everything was in order.


The ground is signposted A-0 in that above each turnstile there
is a form of entrance lettering, and the entrance letter should
match     the    entrance     letter    referred       to    on   the     ticket.        The
turnstiles are numbered 1-88 which includes A-G turnstiles at
the Leppings Lane end. ‘ At the Leppings Lane end turnstiles 1-
16 and A-G are located.              It was agreed for the match that A-G
turnstiles would be used for the Leppings Lane end standing,                               1-
10    for the North stand seating and 11-16 for the West                                stand
seating.        The lettering above the turnstiles was "A" for 1-10,
HC ” for 11-16, and "B” for A-G.


I checked the entrance lettering against the instructions given
by                  .     It was important to check that the                      entrance
lettering was correct as 1-8 turnstiles are normally used for
the North stand, but on this occasion 2 extra turnstiles were
provided as 12 turnstiles normally used for the North stand at
the Penistone Road end were not available.

                                                                        /id/\/eu~bd'
                                          - 5 -



My primary concern was with the entrance lettering,                                but there
is also another form of signposting in that signs about 10-12
inches square denote that particular area of the ground served
by    a turnstile.          At the Leppings Lane               end,     there were         signs
denoting       the    North     stand,       West     stand,         and    Leppings           Lane
standing.       I do not specifically remember checking this form of
signposting, but these signs were displayed.


I then prepared the turnstile operator's sheets by noting down
the turnstiles for each area, and the type of ticket for each
turnstile by reference to the entrance lettering.                                  I provided
the    lists     to    the    men    working     in      the    stile       room     who       then
proceeded      to     allocate       turnstile      operators          to    the     available
turnstiles.


I     regarded       the    signposting       outside          the    turnstiles          to     be
adequate as the ticket clearly shows the entrance letter,                                       and
this    can be matched up with the                  entrance          letter outside            the
turnstiles.           The    other    type     of     signing         is    also     adequate.
However,    I am aware at the match that in effect the entrance
lettering ran A-C-B.            It would have been preferable to have the
entrance lettering in proper order A-B-C.                            This in fact has now
been put into operation,for the 1989/1990 season.


I made a second inspection of the turnstiles at about 11.30 am
just     after       the     turnstiles      opened.           The     purpose       of        this
inspection was to ensure that all the turnstiles were open and
working properly.            Whilst outside at the Leppings Lane end the
turnstile operators to turnstiles 8 and 9 drew my attention to
a barrier dividing those turnstiles. The lettering above those
turnstiles       matched      the    tickets,       ie    entrance          letter    "A"       was
displayed.


Those turnstile operators had told me that Stuart Thorpe, Chief
Steward for the West stand,                  had drawn their attention to the
                                         - 6 -


barrier.     At     the   back   of      the     Leppings     Lane    turnstiles,       I
noticed the dividing rails behind those turnstiles separated 8
and 9 turnstile. It had of course been agreed in advance to use
1-10   turnstiles     for the North            stand and      11-16    for    the    West
stand. As the gate was* left dividing 8 and 9, I radioed Doug
Lock and we agreed that the dividing rail should be unlocked
and with the use of a hand rail to create a barrier between
turnstiles 10 and 11.         Doug Lock also stated that two stewards
be deployed on the barrier.


Stuart     Thorpe    confirmed      to    me     that   two    stewards       would    be
deployed to deter any fan from climbing over the barrier and he
would also see that the barrier was put in place.                             I did    in
fact witness the barrier being put in place, and I confirmed to
Doug Lock what had been done.                  The operation was completed in
minutes.      I    noticed   that     the barrier       was     in    place    from    my
position outside the turnstiles.


Whilst outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles I recall two minor
incidents which occurred at about midday.                     The first involved a
young couple, both Liverpool fans, who were seeking permission
to enter     the Leppings Lane end with tickets                  purchased for the
Kop end.     The     tickets had been purchased on              the black market.
(Both complained that they had paid in excess of the face value
for the tickets).         T h e ‘couple explained that the Police would
not    let   them go round to            the Kop    end as      they    were clearly
dressed as Liverpool supporters.                   I had no authority to allow
the fans to gain entry at the Leppings Lane end, but I asked a
senior Police Officer at the Leppings Lane                      end if these          two
fans could go in at that end.              He was a senior officer and said
that     the two      fans   could       not be    allowed      entry.        I do    not
remember what I was told, save that the reason or one of the
reasons given was to control numbers.                    I informed the couple
who then went away.          I accepted and always have accepted that
the Police have the right to say yes or no on such matters.                                 I
was obliged to accept the Police direction as they had control

over fans entering the turnstiles.


The    second     incident      occurred      when     a    Police     Sergeant,         again
outside the turnstiles, showed me some tickets which the Police
suspected were forgeries.              The Police Sergeant told me that the
tickets     had       been    found    in    the     possession       of    a     Liverpool
supporter.        I do not remember my conversation in detail with
the Police Officer, save that I was informed that the Liverpool
supporter       had    in    his     possession       an    unreasonable        number      of
tickets.       The Police Sergeant said half a dozen.                       The Sergeant
also told me that the Liverpool supporter had been taken to the
Police room.          I was not informed of the background to how this
supporter had been stopped and taken to the Police room.


I was     asked to identify whether the                     tickets were        genuine     or
not.     The    tickets were          for the North          stand.     I took two          or
three     to examine         them.     I could not tell whether                   they    were
forgeries or not.             I am of course aware of the type of ticket
that is issued.          They looked genuine, but I thought it right to
refer the matter to                                 as she was able to check the
water mark which is invisible except under a certain type                                   of
light.     I     decided       to take the tickets to                                whom I
met    on my way to the main reception area.                          I showed her the
tickets     and       she assured      me    that     the     tickets      were    genuine.
I went back to the Poli,ce Sergeant at the Leppings Lane end to
inform him what I had been told, and I heard no more about the
matter.


I then returned to the stile room.                         I did not go back to the
Leppings       Lane    end again that day.                 Between about midday            and
1.30    pm I did try to walk up the lane from the car park area
outside the South stand to the Leppings Lane end on one or two
occasions but was told by the Police that they preferred me not
to walk up the           lane as       they were       attempting to deter other
people from doing the same, ie fans, and it would not look good
if I walked through.               I was of course dressed in a suit.                      The

purpose of the intended visit was to ensure that the turnstiles
were open and working properly.              If the turnstile does jam or
there    is   some other problem,       it   is   likely to occur      at    some
point    shortly after the turnstiles open.               However,   I was    not
too concerned by not being able to gain access to the Leppings
Lane    end as the Club     has   its    own camera       system which      shows
pictures of the area behind the turnstiles.                 If there had been
any    problems,    I would have been contacted by radio               by    Doug
Lock. In carrying out this type of inspection I was responsible
for the South stand and the Leppings Lane end.


In the stile room I had a cup of tea and prepared the paperwork
to pay the referee and other match officials.                I was in or near
the stile room for about an hour and in this period I had some
lunch.     I left the stile room at about 1.15 pm to 1.30 pm.


Between about 1.30 pm to kick off at 3.00 pm, I was positioned
in or near the players tunnel.           During this period I did go to
the     club control    room on perhaps        6 or   7 occasions.       Police
Constable     Guest and Roger Houldsworth are based in the                   Club
control room.        On some occasions Doug Lock was present in the
room, but I cannot remember who was present on each occasion.


I went to the Club control room to keep myself informed of the
overall numbers entering the ground. It was not something I was
told to do.        I remember that Roger gave me a figure             on those
occasions. I cannot recall any figures given, nor any comments
made on those figures.        I may have spoken to Doug Lock on one
of those occasions, but cannot remember.


At about 2.15 to 2.30 pm I agreed the expenses with the referee
and     other match officials.      I was in the referee's            room.     I
took the figures back to the stile room and arranged for one of
the     stile men to make up the expenses to provide to the match
officials after the match.

Normally,      at League games I am preoccupied with dealing with
any problems that may arise in the taking of money by turnstile
operators.      For an FA Cup match where no money is involved and
simply    tickets,      there       is   not    the      same    need    for     me    to    be
positioned near the turnstiles and it is more appropriate for
me to be located near the Club control room so that I can be
directed at any moment by Doug Lock to a particular turnstile
area.     I     do    not    have    any    specific       duties       in    relation        to
security      other     than       those    mentioned           with    regard        to     the
financial      implications         of     moving      money     in     and    around        the
ground.       Whilst at the pitch end of the tunnel I did notice the
ground filling up but I did not notice any crowd problems.                                   The
players tunnel is of course part of the South stand which is a
seated area.         I was too far away to tell whether there were any
crowd problems on the terraces at the Kop end or the Leppings
Lane end.       I    should add that I am not instructed by Doug Lock
to keep a visual check on whether certain parts of the ground
are filling up.


Between 2.30 and 3.00 pm I had a number of conversations with
Doug Lock.          I must confess that I cannot be certain as to the
timings of these conversations as my memory of events is vague
and I can only explain this by reference to the horrific events
that     took place at Hillsborough as I was                      deeply effected             by
what     happened      at    the    ground,     with      so    many    people       dead and
injured.       On one of those occasions, I remember discussing with
Doug     Lock that     the     centre      pens     at    the     Leppings       Lane        end
appeared to be full but there                  was ample room in the wing pens.
I was not concerned as it is quite normal for the centre pens
to   fill more quickly than the wing pens.                         Many       fans    like    to
stand behind the goal.               I could not tell how full the centre
pens     were from my position,            and certainly I did not                    see    any
signs of distress.


I also remember a further conversation with Doug Lock when he
came up to me and said that he had just received a report that

a   gate       had    been     opened      at    the     Leppings    Lane      end.        This
conversation took place at the pitch end of the tunnel.                                   I do
not remember whether this was before or after the players came
onto the pitch.              Doug Lock said that he was going back to the
Club control room. We were both very surprised but I assumed
that    the situation was under Police control.


I also         remember that on one of the two occasions when                             I did
have    a      conversation with Doug Lock that                     he    said       there    were
2,000    to     3,000       fans   still    outside,      but there was          sufficient
room in the wing pens to take them.                         Whilst       I remember this
comment       being made,          I cannot remember whether              it was      on the
occasion of the first or the second conversation.


As the game started, I noticed fans climbing onto the perimeter
track.        I pointed out to a Police Sergeant the number of fans
getting        onto the perimeter track, but he said that the                          Police
at that        end could deal with any problems. I made my way                         to the
Club control room, but met Doug Lock coming towards me in the
tunnel.        I told him that people were                  coming over the            safety
fence.      I next remember the referee leading the players off the
pitch.


More    and more        fans were       coming over the           safety      fence and        a
large number were running across the pitch.                              I tried to keep
the fans out of the tunnel.                     Some wanted to follow the players
down     the    tunnel.        The    Police         initially were      trying      to    keep
people off the pitch.                There was a certain amount of taunting
from the Nottingham Forest supporters who obviously were                                     not
aware of what had happened.                     For that matter, nor was I aware
of what had happened at the Leppings Lane terraces.


I then received word of mouth reports stating that a number of
people      had      been    injured,      this was       followed       by   reports      that
there were a number dead.                  I could not believe it. I overheard
requests        for    stretchers       from fans        on the     pitch.       I    believe

these requests may have been made to the ground staff who were
in    the    tunnel.        I    remember    fans       stripping       the     advertising
hoarding around the pitch.


Although I had the Club radio, there was far too much noise and
it was not possible to hear any message relayed over the radio.
From there the situation got more and more chaotic.                             There were
hundreds of people on the                 pitch.        It was totalconfusion.                I
witnessed the scene from the player's tunnel.


I was at the pitch              end of the tunnel until about             3.20 pm. After
that     I    retreated         to the      top    of    the     tunnel       and    assisted
spectators as best              I could.For example, many wanted                    access to
telephones.          I was      also responsible          for turning          people       away
from the players room and referees room. Between about 3.20 to
3.45    pm I may well have gone to the Club control                             room again
although       I     cannot      remember     with      any    certainty.            This     is
important as I do               recall someone saying that a gate                    had been
broken       down,    but       upon * checking the        TV screens      in        the Club
control room I could not find any gate having been broken down.
I cannot remember who told me this, nor do I remember the time,
but it is likely that this occurred after 3.20 pm.


Doug Lock came up to me at about 3.45 pm and told me that if
the    game was abandoned we had to ensure that the                             exit gates
were manned and opened.                  Doug sent me to the South                   stand to
ensure       that the exit gates were all manned and opened.                                Most
of the spectators were still inside the ground.                                I knew from
Doug Lock that both the Kop end and the Leppings Lane end exit
gates were open and manned.                 The announcement at that stage had
still not been made to abandon the game.


As I went off to                ensure that those exit                gates wereopened,            I
noticed a fireman               behind the Police control room in the lane
and    near the car park attempting to administer                             some   form of
resuscitation to someone lying in the road and an ambulance was

called from the bottom of the car park in the South stand, and
the injured person was put in that ambulance and taken away.                             I
was shocked by the sight of a Liverpool fan who must have been
taken through the uncovered seated area in the South stand to
the lane.


The   abandon message was announced at 4.10                     pm.     It was     still
total    confusion.        I    did    not    really    know what        had    happened
although I had of course heard reports of fatalities.


I called home to reassure my wife that
were okay.        I walked about in or near the player's tunnel and
stile    room trying to keep fans away from the tunnel                          and the
official    areas.       I was also checking to ensure                  the    turnstile
operators    had returned.            I was listening to their                stories    of
what had happened at theLeppings Lane end.                      Towards the end          of
the     afternoon       I was    detailed      together with          four    others     to
collect     the    programme         money    which    had     been    stored    in     the
gymnasium.        The    progra.mme      money   is     normally       stored    in     the
gymnasium.        I do not remember who asked me to do this task.                        It
was     not a pleasant task as we discovered that the other end of
the     gym was     being used         as a mortuary. I believe              that this
happened at about          5.00 pm.          We collected the money             from the
head programme salesman.               The money was in bags and consisted
mostly of coins.          About 20,000 - 30,000 programmes are sold per
match.     I then went back to the stile room and was in the stile
room until about 7.00 pm when I went home.


Doug Lock did tell me on the day that he had received a report
from Police that one turnstile operator was seen taking money.
That was the only incident of this nature to my knowledge.


This statement is given to the best of my knowledge and belief.

   l^jO n 20 March 1989, the Football Association (the FA) requested that their Cup semi-final between
Liverpool and Nottingham Forest be held on IS April at Hillsborough Football Stadium, The corresponding

  3 -.j The Hillsborough Stadium is some 2i4 miles to the north-west of central Sheffield in the district of
Owlerton. The ground was opened in 1899 on what was then a greenfield site by the river Don. The pitch tics
roughly east to west. /                                                     -sdix !.

     j The west end, with which this Inquiry is principally concerned, is known as the Leppings Lane end. The
east end abuts on Penistone Road, the A 61. To the south is the river Don and to the north a residential street,
Vere Road, which runs between Leppings Lane and Penistone Road North.

 y j f -(Alongside the river is a private roadway giving access to the south stand, to the Directors’ and players’
entrances, and to the administrative block under the stand. The roadway gives both vehicular and pedestrian
access between Penistone Road and Leppings Lane, but there are gates which can shut it off at each end. There
is some car parking along this roadway principally for Directors, players and employees of the Club. The south
stand dates from 1914 and is the oldest at the ground. It is all seating with places for 8,800.5,500 of those are
roofed over and 3,300 are uncovered.

Cjfc} The north stand is also all seating and accommodates about 9,700. Behind it is a gymnasium or sports
hall. There are also a first aid room and police room close by.

 CVQ The east end is all terracing and is known as the Spion Kop. It was enlaced and roofed over in 1986 and
now accommodates some 21,000 standing spectators. There are crush barriers in the Kop running parallel to
the goal line but no dividing fences to prevent free movement from side to side.

        At the west or Leppings Lane end of the ground there is terracing close to the pitch. Behind it is the west
stand which provides covered seating and was built in 1965 for World Cup matches, some of which were held
at Hillsborough in 1966. The covered stand accommodates 4,456 seated spectators. The terracing in front o f it
extends higher in the comers between the stands and its total capacity was stated to be 10,100. At both the Kop
end and the west end access to the pitch is barred by perimeter fencing. The fencing is about eight feet high
mounted upon the low wall at the foot of the terracing. At the top of the fencing the wire returns back at a sharp
angle for some 15 inches to make it difficult for anyone to climb over towards the pitch. There are ptes at
intervals along the perimeter fencing to afford access between terrace and pitch. These gates are less than a
metre wide and were designed to be opened only from the pitch side for police purposes or in an emergency.
They are marked and numbered on the plan Appendix 1.

        J
       Unlike the Kop end, the west terracing has nqtonly crush barriers parallel with the goal line but radial
fences at right angles to it, dividing the area into pens.This division was begun after an FA Cup semi-final in
1981 when crushing occurred due to overcrowding and gates had to be opened. It proceeded in stages, the final
arrangement being shown on the plan Appendix 1. The first section of the west terracing moving south to north
contains gates 1 and 2 and is known as pens 1 and 2 although in fact constituting' only one pen. Next is pen 3
with one gate; next pen 4 with one gate; pen 5, which is extremely narrow, was intended as a sterile area to
divide pen 4 from pen 6. This was to isolate home and away fans op occasions <^hen both might be
accommodated on the west terracing in separate pens. Finally there is pen 7 at the north-west corner. Pens 5,6
and 7 each have a perimeter gate. At the back of the pens, under the front of the west stand, there is a gate in
                                                               2.

    each radial fence. When those gates are open, the back row of the terracing is intended to permit access from
    pen to pen along the whole west side. In practice, when substantial numbers are present, those gateways are not
    readily visible or accessible..TJie                                                           esh^si
                                   Tjie present layout of the pens, fences, crush barriers and gates h^s resulted from a
    series of piecemeal changes.jj            — :r\ of iho:

L
       t& j Because of the housing in Vere Road there is no access from the north side of the ground. Along
    Pemstone Road North there are some 46 turnstiles which usually give access both to the Kop and to the east
    end of the north stand. They are marked 43 to 88 inclusive on the plan. The 12 numbered 77 to 88 are designed
    to feed the north stand but were not used for that purpose on 15 April in order to segregate supporters of the
    two teams as appears later. Two of them, 77 and 78, were however used for access to the Kop.
     r       .
         At the south side of the ground there were 24 turnstiles (numbered 19 to 42 on the plan). Those
    numbered 37 to 42 led to the Kop and the rest to the south stand.

          In summary, the south and east sides of the ground accommodated some 29,800 whose access on the
    day was through 60 turnstiles.
    S'f J jT h e other two sides of the ground, north and west, with a capacity of 24,256 were fed solely from the
    lieppmgs Lane entrance where there were only 23 turnstiles.

                       arrivalsfirom Liverpool would be from the north and west; arrivals from Nottingham
    would be from the south and east.




                                                                   Jefore the 1988 semi-final the police decided
     that sections of the Hillsborough Stadium should be allocated so as to achieve efficient segregation of
     Liverpool and Nottingham Forest fans. The section to be granted to each was determined by the direction
     whence each predominantly approached. Thus, Liverpool were allotted the north and west sides o f the ground
     for which access was from Leppings Lane. Nottingham Forest were allotted the south and east sides with access
     from PpmstSne Road.

                                                                        iverpool were allotted   24,2 56 places
      i against 29,800 for Nottingham Forest. This, although average attendance of supporters at ome matches
     was substantially higher at Liverpool than at Nottingham. Moreover, with standing tickets; 6 and seats at
     £12, Nottingham Forest had 21,000 standing places \o m pared with Liverpool’s 10, lOOi
                                              he approach to the west turnstiles is across a narrow neck or forecourt at
      a ben (Tin Leppings Lane where, coming from the north, it turns to the south-west and crosses a bridge over the
      river Don. Parking areas for the Liverpool supporters had been arranged north and west of the ground. They
      were therefore expected to arrive on foot along both limbs of Leppings Lane and would converge on the
      forecourt at the bend. In an arc across that forecourt is a line of railings with six sets of double gates. Inside
      those perimeter gates is the short approach to the turnstiles.
      latter are in two sections divided by a fence. The northern section consists of turnstiles 1 to 16. Numbers 1to
       10 gave access to the north stand. Thus there were 10 turnstiles for the 9,700 with north stand seats. Their
      tickets were marked “Entrance A” and were colour-coded brown. Turnstiles 1 to 10 correspondingly had the
      letter A above them and brown boards on the wall.

1$     §g[jTurnstiles 11 to 16 were for those with seats in tti !west stand. Thus 4^456 were served by six turnstiles.

I <? ^ Q O n the other side of the dividing fence in the approach area, there were only seven turnstiles to serve
     10,1 Ou with tickets for the west terracing. Those seven turnstiles were labelled A to G. This was because there
    had originally been 18 turnstiles at Leppings Lane and the sequential numbering continued from 19 upwards
    on the south side of the ground. When the number at Leppings Lane was brought up to 23 the present
    arrangements of 1to 1-6, A to G and then 19 upwards was adopted to avoid re-numbering all round theground.
    However, above the lettering A to G was a large letter B. “Entrance B” also ap g ^red on tickets for the west
    terrace. Thus, the three blocks of turnstiles encountered by a ticket holder at theTeppings Lane end read from
    left to right A, C, B. The colour-code for west terrace tickets and the boards beside turnstiles A to G was mauve.
    To the right of turnstile G is a tubular steel barrier, to divide the queue for that turnstile from the roadway to the
    south stand.                     " ;                                   ..... ■


%0         Turnstiles 1to 10 gave access to a passageway leading to the north stand. There is an exit gate (marked A
      on Appendix l ) between tu m stilej and the adjacent housing.

xi     ms    Inside turnstiles! to 16 is a concourse leading to pens 6 and 7 and the steps to the west stand. There is a
      wail dividing this area from that inside turnstiles A to G. It had been built to segregate home and away fans at a
      time when the Club intended they should share the west terrace. That idea was not pursued but the wall
      remained. There was, however, a gateway in the wall which did permit access between the two areas. An exit
      gatev -                        vwas provided from the area inside turnstiles 11 to 16.             f ....

      m entione^m d on the right by the wall of the private roadway coming from the south stand to Leppings Lane.
      There was an exit gate in the latter wall (             ^   v ’ just inside turnstile G.

  3             three exit gates, A, B and C, were of concertina design. They could be opened only from the inside
      and Were not intended for entry of spectators into the ground.

       (Jb Q Those entering through turnstiles A to G had three options once inside the ground. They could by
      moving to the right go round the south end of the west stand and gain entry into pens 1 and 2. They could go
      through the gap in the dividing wall towards the concourse behind turnstiles 11 to 16 and then round the north
      end of the west stand into pens 6 or 7. However, there were no conspicuous signs inviting them to take either of I
      those courses. The obvious way in was straight ahead of the turnstiles where a tunnel under the middle of the 11
      west stand gave access to pens 3 and 4. Above its entrance in large letters was the word “Standing” and a large
      letter “B”. Thus B ticket holders were drawn towards the tunnel.

      * W B ^ Jh e length of the tunnel is some 23 metres. It^ises slightly at first then levels off but finally descends
       towarafcthe terraces at a gradient of 1 in 6. As it emerges onto the terrace, the way ahead is bisected by the rad iaWt
       fence between pen 3 on the right and pen 4 on the left. A short spur of brick wall projects forward from each^ide
       of the tunnel at its mouth. Those emerging are thus guided straight forward rather than to either s id tj jm j            ?
                                             _ the configuration of the Leppings Lane turnstiles and the areas insid^
      them was effected by a series of piecemeal changes/j^H
2 7 i r t A< the 1988 semi-final, policing had been under the control of Chief Superintendent Mole, then
   Commander of F Division within whose area Hillsborough lies. He was still in post on 20 March 1989 when
   the FA broached the 1989 semi-final, but he was due to hand over command of F Division on 27 March to
   Superintendent Duckenfield on the Iatter’s promotion to Chief Superintendent. Both were present at an initial
   meeting on 22 March, but on 27 March Mr Mole bowed out and Mr Duckenfield took over. Under him were
   Sector Commanders, all Superintendents with much experience of policing football matches at Hillsborough
   and elsewhere. In particular, Superintendent Marshall was in charge of the area outside the Leppings Lane
   entrance and the approaches to it. Superintendent Greenwood was in command inside the ground, but this
   included the area between the turnstiles and the perimeter fence. They thereby swapped roles from the
   previous year. Under Mr Duckenfield’s overall command were some 801 officers and men on duty at the
   ground plus traffic officers and others from D Division to deal with the influx of supporters into the city centre.
   In all, therefore, some 1,122 police were deployed for this match amounting to about 38 per cent of the total
   South Yorkshire force. Included in the mounted section of 34 were officers from Liverpool and Nottingham to
   assist respectively in marshalling their home supporters. The total at the ground was divided into serials
   consisting usually of eight to ten Constables plus a Sergeant and an Inspector. The serials were posted to duties
   at various stations in and around the ground in three phases: before, during and after the match. All of this
   was provided for in an Operational Order which followed closely the Order drawn up for the 1988 semi-final
   and took into account the force’s “Standing Instructions for the Policing of Football Grounds”. The Order
   described the duties of each serial at each phase. It was supplemented by oral briefings before and on the day of
   the match.


     §§ JT he Club provided 376 stewards, gatemen and turnstile operators for duty on 15 April. The stewards
   werdoriefed as to their duties on the morning of the match by police Inspectors and were allocated round the
   ground. They wore yellow tabards. The Club’s control room, situated below the south stand, could i 7
   communicate by VHF radio with the stewards. Closed circuit television was installed by the Club with
   screens in their control room showing all the turnstiles round the ground. A computerised counting system was
   incorporated in the turnstiles. This flashed onto a screen in the Club control room the running total of
   spectators passing through the turnstiles section by section. Thus, at the Leppings Lane end, there would be
   separate running totals for turnstiles 1 to 10 (north stand), turnstiles 11 to 16 (west stand), and turnstiles A to G
   (west terraces). When the total for any section was within 15 per cent of its permitted capacity a warning pulse
   showed on the screen. For the west terracing that warning would occur when the numbers were within 15 per
   cent o f the total terrace capacity of 10,100. What the system could not do was monitor the distribution of fans
   on the terracing, pen by pen. It could give no warning therefore if one pen was full beyond its safe capacity.


JfigroundKThe nerve centre for police control is the control room or box situated at the south-west comer of the
           between the south stand and pen 1 of the west terracing. The box is elevated and reached by a number
    o f steps. It has windows commanding views across the pitch and straight along the line o f the west perimeter
    fence. The box is very small and has seats for only three officers. Superintendent Murray was in control of it
    and was advisor to Mr Duckenfield as he had been to Mr Mole the year before. Next to him sat Sergeant
    Goddard who operated the radios. The third seat was for Police Constable Ryan who operated the telephone
    and public address systems. At the back of the box stood Police Constable Bichard who was in control of the
    police closed circuit television system operated by a row of consoles on a bench in front of him and behind the
    three seated officers.

 3 «>[mil   There were five television screens showing views of five roving cameras fixed at high points on the
    stands and directed both inside and outside the ground. There was also a master screen which flicked in
    rotation from one camera view to another and which made a video recording. The cameras have a zoom
    facility to close in on any point of interest. Specifically, there were good camera views of the west terracing, o f
    the Leppings Lane turnstiles and beyond them of Leppings Lane itself.

 3 l . ^ f i T h e Tannoy public address system was relayed through speakers fixed at vantage points inside the
     ground and outside the turnstiles. It was used by a disc jockey, housed under the police control box, to relay
     music before the match, but it could be overridden by the police. Messages could be relayed through all
     speakers or if appropriate to one area only.

    stand-by station under the operator’s bench. Hand sets were issued to all ranks of Sergeant and above.
    Community Constables on duty would already have their own. Other Constables had no radio.
    Communication was on “talk through” i.e. any message from any source would be heard by everyone tuned in
    and if more than one source spoke messages could become garbled. Ear pieces were issued to some officers in
    an attempt to overcome the loud crowd noise which made receipt of signals very difficult. There were other
     radio channels open to Sergeant Goddard: VHF to police Headquarters at Snig Hill, channel 35 to FI
     Sub-divisional Headquarters at Hammerton Road and channel 19 used by C1D. There was also a set tuned to
     Sheffield Wednesday’s radio system between its control room and the stewards.

0           15 April 1989 was a warm sunny spring Saturday. The match was a sell-out, so 54,000 ticket holders
     were Expected. Others would come without tickets hoping to acquire them or even to gain access otherwise.
     The following account concentrates, as did the evidence, on the western approaches and the Liverpool
     supporters since the disaster occurred at their end. They began to arrive in the Hillsborough area quite early in
     small numbers. Somef%                        -

     mixed shopping and residential area. Local residents saw groups o f Liverpool supporters keen to find a public
     house Qr off-licence. Many were asking for tickets or “spares’*. There were a few touts selling t hem at inflated
                                                                                                       As the
     wore on, numbers increased. Requests for t i c            k    e    t s *          ncreasec^- Still the prevailing
     mood was one of carnival, good humour and expectation.


          [There were some 74 shops with off-licences in and around Sheffield. In general, they opened at 8 am.
     Livefpool supporters did visit them but the evidence did not suggest a great amount of alcoholic drink was
     bought there.

3i    j j ^ Opening time at public houses was in general 11 am. Some remained closed all day. Of the others, some
     72, mostly in the city, were frequented by local patrons only. Some 23 public houses, however, served ovgr a
     hundred Liverpool supporters each. Another 51 served more than 20 each. Little trouble was re p o rte d jj0



       flP^Towards the end of the morning, fans gathered on and around the bridge near the Leppings Lane
     entrance. They seemed reluctant to enter the ground early. All turnstiles were open at 12 noon and one or two
     as early as 11.30 am. Some 53 police had been deployed to operate outside the turnstiles and in the Leppings
     Lane area. They enquired at random whether fans had tickets. Those who had not were advised to go away;
     nevertheless, many returned more than once. Those who had tickets were guided in the right direction. The
     police tried to persuade them to enter the ground early. Officers, male and female, had been posted outside
     each turnstile with the duty of searching entrants for weapons, drink or drugs. Once through the turnstile, an
     entrant was liable to be searched again by one of a serial of officers positioned just inside.

U (j B H ai about 12 noon Chief Inspector Creaser asked Superintendent Murray whether the pens on the west
     terraca were to be filled one by one successively, but was told that they should all be available from the start and
     the fans should find their own level.

SS             2 pm it was apparent to those inside the ground and those monitoring events in the police and Club
     control rooms that the number of Nottingham fans in their places greatly outnumbered those from Liverpool.
     The Kop and the south stand were filling up steadily, but the north and west stands were half empty. It was
     noted about that time that the turnstile figures showed only 12,000 had entered as against 20,000 at the same
     time the previous year. On the west terraces, although pens 3 and 4 were filling, the wing pens 1,2,6 and 7 were
     nearly empty. At 2 ! 5 pm a Tannoy message asked fans in pens 3 and 4 to move forward and make room for
     others.

      ^U p T h ere had been three special trains from Liverpool in 1988. This time, there was only one. It arrived
     early, just before 2 pm, at Wadsley Bridge station. The 350 passengers were met by both mounted and foot
     police officers who escorted them in a crocodile down‘Leppings Lane. They were orderly and passed through
     the turnstiles into the ground by about 2.20 pm without incident.

 Hxi mb- By X *3-Oprihe police Traffic Division reported that the Liverpool routes were clear, so the majority of
    Liverpool fans were in the Sheffield area. The numbers converging on the Leppings Lane entrance were
    increasing rapidly. Between the perimeter gates and the turnstiles the crowd became congested. There was no
    longer a separate queue at each turnstile but a single phalanx filling the whole approach area. The foot officers
    outside the turnstiles were no longer able to search everyone and had difficulty in searching even selectively.

Mounted officers in and outside the turnstile area were having difficulty manoeuvring in such a dense crowd.
The police were beset by fans bemused by the ticket and turnstile labelling asking for d ire c tio n ^ M m lB t
                     to and just after 2.30 pm the mood remained good.

       Superintendent Marshall was on foot amongst the crowd. He became anxious about the numbers
coming down Leppings Lane and spilling out onto the roadway where buses and cars were moving. At 2.17
pm he radioed to control to have motor traffic in Leppings Lane stopped. This was eventually done at about
2.30 pm. Up to this time, despite the large mass outside the turnstiles and the numbers still approaching, there
was still no panic in the crowd; no perception of crisis by the police. In the control room Mr Murray, who could
see Leppings Lane on the video, advised Mr Duckenfield that they would get everyone in by 3 pm. Mr
Duckenfield reaffirmed to him the policy about a delayed kick-off. It would be ordered only if there was some
major external factor such as fog on the Pennines or delay on the motorway: not if spectators merely turned up
late even in large numbers.

              und. In pens 3 and 4 there was a steady increase in pressure as rirore fans came through the tunnel to the
      favoured area behind the goal. By 2.S0 pm these pens were already full to a degree which caused serious
      discomfort to many well used to enduring pressure on terraces. The numbers at that time were clearly in excess
      of the maximum density stated by the HomejDffice Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (1986 Edn) (the Green
      Guide) i.e. 34 persons per 10 square

      ample room and bare patcflesST^on5fS!Were visible.

<*3          Meanwhile, the crowd grew at the Leppings Lane entrance. As more arrived at the back the crush at the
            grew worse. Entry to the turnstiles beoune more difficult. Their efficiency was impaired and their rate
      reduced. Arrivals at the back exceeded deliveries through the turnstiles, so the build-up increased. The foot
      officers outside were unable to function and in danger themselves so they went through the turnstiles and out
      again through gate C where they did what they could to relieve pressure by the tubular barrier. The mounted
      officers were surrounded by the dense mass of people and became ineffective. Superintendent Marshall wasjn
      the midst of the turmoil. He extricated himself and stood on a parapet of the bridge to get a clear v ie v [0

                  Jthe menace came from the massive numbers single-mmdedly determined 16 W iWIAi1lhe kick-off
      with time'ninning out. At the back of the crowd fans were frustrated by the lack of progress as 3 o’clock
      approached.                                                            10 Push and force their way forward. At
      the front, people were jammed togetne^uJdagainstthe turnstile walls. Some panicked as the pressure
      intensified. Some youngsters and women were fainting and in distress. They were helped out through the
      tubular barrier by turnstile G or were passed over the turnstiles elsewhere. Fans climbed up and over the
      turnstile building or on to the dividing fence. This was to escape the crush rather than to gain free entry since
      most of them had tickets.

      pushing and for a vehicle with loudspeaker equipment to come and request the sam e£jH H M j|M |t about 2.40
      pm, radio communication on channel 25 became defective. For a period of two or three minutes the control
      room lost contact. A communications officer came promptly and switched to the standby station. With the use
      of a handset at control, contact was restored. Despite this hiatus, two of Mr Marshall’s requests were received.
      The Tannoy was used but with little effect. Reinforcements, including mounted officers from Penistone Road,
      were sent. The third request, for a Landrover, was received direct by its driver PC Buxton who arrived at 2.46
      pm and urged the crowd by loudspeaker not to push. This was no more effective than the Tannoy. The
      mounted officers besieged near the turnstiles came outside the perimeter gates. An attempt was made to shut
      them against the crowd outside, to enable the throng inside to be dispersed or at least thinned through the
      turnstiles. The pressure from without, however, opened the gates again. Mounted officers, now reinforced to
      greater numbers, formed a cordon across the elbow of Leppings Lane from the sweet shop to the bridge, again
      with the object of reducing pressure inside the gates. They were successful in this for some minuted"'




        •rjB etw een 2.40 pm and 2.43 pm the crowd inside and outside the turnstile approach had swelled to
      over 5,000. At the head of the phalanx conditions had become intolerable. Those who got through were short
      of breath and sweating profusely. Many complained to police officers on the concourse inside the turnstiles
      and asked them in forceful terms to do something. Exit gates A and B were being shaken. It was clear the crowd
      could not pass through the tumstiies by 3 pm. Police Constable Buxton radioed from the Landrover to control
      asking that kick-off be postponed. The suggestion was acknowledged but rejected.

       6*   Superintendent Marshall realised the crowd had become unmanageable. Although loth to do so, since it
      was contrary to basic police strategy, he decided to request the exit gates be opened to relieve the pressure.
      Otherwise, he feared fatalities would occur. Other senior officers outside the ground agreed. At 2.47 pm he
      radioed control to permit the gates to be opened. At 2.48 pm, whilst Mr Duckenfield was considering the
      request, gate C opened to eject a youth who had climbed in with no ticket. Immediately, fans outside took
      advantage and about 1SO managed to get in before a mounted officer enabled the gate to be closed again. Mr
      Marshall repeated his request. Still no response from control. He repeated it a third time, adding that if the



                                                                iv
      gates were not opened someone was going to be killed. In the control room, Mr Duckenfleld had not made a
      decision. Mr Murray asked him “Are you going to open the gates?”. Mr Duckenfield gave the order and Sgt
      Goddard radioed to Mr Marshall “Open the gates”. Neither the Club control room nor any police officers
      inside the turnstiles were told of this order before or after it was given or of any action it would require.

H-7           2.52 pm, gate C was opened wide. Fans behind turnstiles A to G and from the concourse beyond
      came'round to flow through it in large numbers.

  8 G PO About two minutes later the pressure outside gate A led Sgt Higgins to radio, despite the gateman’s
      objection, for it to be opened. If it was not, he said, “It’ll go and someone will get killed”. Permission was given,
      but this time reserve serials were alerted to monitor the inrush towards the north stand. Gate B was also briefly
      opened against the gateman’s wishes and about 200 of those pressed at turnstiles A to G gained entry to their
      left.

   The majority had tickets for the terraces. Of these, some found their way either right to pens 1 and 2 or left
   through the dividing wall to 6 and 7. But a large proportion headed straight for the tunnel in front of them.
                                                               1°

        their progress. Upon reaching the crowded pens, some wished to go back but were unable to do so. The new
        arrivals found themselves pushed forward aryj the pressure became intense. At 2.54 pm, shortly after this
        influx began, the teams came onto the p itc h ^ jm ^ D th is was greeted by a surge forward. Many were now
        acutely uncomfortable and some were in distress. The mass seethed about but voluntary movement by any
        individual was difficult; hands down could not be raised and some fans found it hard to breathe. Still the flow
        continued through the tunnel causing further surges forward. There were shouts for help and for the gates to be
        opened to the pitch. Police officers on the perimeter track did not immediately react. In the deafening noise
        from chanting and shouting they did not at first recognise the problem. Realisation came at different moments
        to different officers in different places.

51       i ^ G a t e 3 sprang open under the intense pressure from within. An officer quickly closed it. Shortly
        afterwards, it sprang again; officers tried to shut it. Those seeking to escape were urged and pushed back. Gate
        4 was opened by a policeman who noticed the crushing. People began to spill out through it and were directed
        to the wing pens where there was still ample room. Meanwhile, gate 4 was closed again and then re-opened. At
        gate 3, a Constable, now alive to the crisis, followed strictly his written orders and radioed for permission to
        open that gate. Receiving no reply, he took it upon himself to open it.

 of2-      J ust before 3 pm, the match kicked off. At the same tim e, gate C, which had been closed at 2.57 pm,
     was reopened and a steady trickle continued to enter through the tunnel.
S ' i { j ^ T o escape the crush, fans began climbing the radial fences out of pens 3 and 4 into pens 2 and 5. Others
      tried to get over the front perimeter fence but were at first turned back by police who feared a pitch invasion.
      Near the front, fans, mostly youngsters, were weakened to the point of collapse and in some instances death but
      they were held upright by pressure all round. Further back, m ost were so preoccupied with the pain of being
      pressed against barriers and with breathing problems that they saw nothing of the game. But at the rear there
      were many who, although cramped, were watching the football unaware of the distress at the front.

               At 3.04 pm, Beardsley for Liverpool struck the crossbar at the Kop end. There was a roar from the
        Liverpool fans and at the same time a powerful surge forwards in pen 3. The several surges which occurred after
        the influx from gate C carried the pressure down the pens towards the pjtch. The force became such as to twist
        and break two spans of a crush barrier towards the front o f pen
                                                 it was triggered by the surge a t 3 ^ p m lJ^ B B ^ B R to cc u rre d alter
        the influx from gate C so greatly increased the pressure in the pen. When the bamer broke tKose whom it had
        supported were projected towards the perimeter fence. Mapy fell and the involuntary rush of those behind
        pressed them down. The crushing force was transmitted and dispersed so that all along the front of pen 3 fans
        were pressed hard up against the low wall and the wire mesh o f the fence above it.
               In pen 4 no barrier broke. Nevertheless those at the front were crushed against wall and fence. Further
        back, two barriers were bowed and some individuals succumbed to the pressure around them.
 ^ (o          Surges on terraces are common. Usually, they go forward, then recede. Here, with the weight of
        numtrers, there was no receding. The pressure stayed and for those crushed breathless by it, standing or prone,
        life was ebbing away. If no relief came in four minutes there would be irreversible brain damage; if longer,
        death.

                n the control room no-one noticed the overcrowding or anything amiss in pens 3 and 4 until the first
        fans spilt out onto the perimeter track just before kick-off. Then, the officers in command assumed that there
        was an attempted pitch invasion. They called up reserve serials waiting in the gymnasium and all available
        officers elsewhere to go to the pitch. A request was made.to HQ for dog handlers.
s i     O p t) Superintendent Greenwood, the Ground Commander, was by the players’ tunnel at the kick-off. He
        notiled fans on the track and went to the west end behind the goal. As he approached, he did not think the pens
        overcrowded until he was very close and saw those pressed against the fence. Even then, he thought the
        situation “retrievable” if those higher up the pen relieved the pressure. He climbed on the wall below the fence
        and signalled with both hands to those behind to move back. Other officers joined him. It was impossible.
        Those fans who would have wished to comply were powerless to do so. Behind them, there were still many
unaware of the crisis, watching the game. The football continued to joyous shouting and singing round the rest
of the ground while those crushed and trapped slowly expired.

    I     w hen Mr Greenwood’s signals to move back proved fruitless, he tried to radio for the match to be
stbppea. At first, his message was not received by control, so he signalled with his arms towards the control
box. Mr Duckenfield sent Mr Murray down from the box to have the match stopped via the linesman, the
agreed emergency drill. Before he could do so, Mr Greenwood ran over the pitch to the referee who stopped the
game. It was 5ft minutes past 3.

60     « ■ From 3 o’clock, gates 3 and 4 had been open and remained so. At first, fans had walked or staggered out
     winded and faint. But the final surge at 3.04 pm, and the struggle to reach the open gates, caused a horrendous
     blockage of bodies. The dead, the dying and the desperate became interwoven in the sump at the front of the
     pens, especially by the gates. Those with strength left clambered over others submerged in the human heap and
     tried to climb out over the fence. They were now helped by police and other fans who hauled them up and over.
     Numbers of fans were climbing over the radial fences into adjacent pens. At the back, many were hauled up
     into the west stand to relieve the pressure.

6 ( j^ ^ T h e steps from the sump at gateways 3 and 4 were so congested with bodies live and dead that each had
     to be prised from the pile by the police. Initially, no officer took effective charge. A number of individual
     officers and fans worked frantically to free those trapped but the gateways were so narrow that only two or three
     could get at the entwined bodies Willing hands got in one another’s way. More officers arrived from the
     gymnasium and elsewhere in the ground. Many used their own initiative to help those laid out on the pitch, to
     assist in getting others over the fencing and to comfort the distressed. But some stood in groups near the
     perimeter fence not knowing what to do. They had been summoned in response to what was thought to be a
     threat to public order. What they found was a horrific scene of carnage and some young officers were shocked
     into impotence by what they saw.

            It was truly gruesome. The victims were blue, cyanotic, incontinent; their mouths open, vomiting; their
     eyes-staring. A pile of dead bodies lay and grew outside gate 3. Extending further and further on to the pitch, the
     injured were laid down and attempts made to revive them. More and more walking survivors flooded out on to
     the pitch as the players left. The scene was emotive and chaotic as well as gruesome^




            At about 3.12 pm, Chief Superintendent Nesbit, Commander of the Traffic Division, arrived on the
     pitch. He took charge at gate 3 and organised a chain of officers to simplify and expedite the extraction o f
     casualties from the pen. In the absence of any mechanical means, police and fans together pulled and worked
     at the wire mesh with their bare hands and their feet to breach the fencing. They succeeded in both pens,
     enabling officers to get in and fans to be got out.

                now, some officers of their own initiative went round from the pitch to the tunnel where they met
     other officers from the turnstile^and the west stand. Together, they tried to persuade fans at the rear of the pens
     to go back through the tu n n e l.^ p m B ^ jm ^ B H H H r tH iM iM H H B H ljlita iH I H R ^ - a s u a ltie s
     were brought out through the tunnel, and as the pressure in the pens was relieved, officers were able to get
     further in and bring out more casualties, dead and alive. They were laid on the ground in the concourse outside
     the tunnel and attempts were made to revive them.

                                          [4 team of pathologists headed by Professor Usher completed
post-mortem examinations on all the deceased within 48 hours. They found that §&of the victims were male
and seven female. Thirty-eight were under 20 years of age, 39 were between 20 and 2f*flBfs and only three were
over SO. In virtually every case the cause of death was crush asphyxia due to compression of the chest wall
against other bodies or fixed structures so as to prevent inhalation. In all but nine cases that was the sole cause.
In one, pressure on the chest had been so great as to rupture the aorta; in six cases there were also injuries to the
head, neck or chest; in the remaining two cases, natural disease was a contributory factor. In 18 cases bones
were fractured. Thirteen of those were rib fractures. However, one was a fractured femur, one a fractured
radius and the remaining three involved fractures of bones or cartilages round the voice box. These injuries
suggest the victims may have been trodden while on the ground.

       Although the great majority of those who died were in pen 3, at least five were in pen 4. Most deaths
occulted at the front of the pens but there were a few fatalities further back.

        In all, some 730 people complained of being injured inside the ground and 36 outside it. Of the 730,
about 30% are thought to have entered through gate C after 2.52 pm. The largest category of injury was
bruising, especially to the ribs and chest.

      grossly overcrowded. They were uncomfortably overcrowded by 2.50 pm at least to a degree which required
      that they should be closed to further arrivals. Even the numbers coming through the turnstiles in the last 10
      minutes would have increased the pressure beyond danger point and there would have been injuries if not
      fatalities. As it was, the influx through gate C after 2.52 pm so increased the pressure in the two pens as to
      cause fatal crushing.

              The overcrowding up to 2.52 pm was due to a number of factor!

         (i) The layout at the Leppings Lane end.
        (ii) Lack of fixed capacities for the pens.
       (iii) Lack of effective monitoring of the terraces.

74'           Before 1965, the Leppings Lane end consisted entirely of terracing like the Kop. In that year, the west
      stand tos built and the terraces remaining in front of it were truncated to their present depth, front to back. As
      to width, they consisted of a single standing area with no dividing fences. During the early 1970’s, hooliganism
      and pitch invasions made it necessary to prevent access to the playing area and the perimeter fences were
      therefore erected in 1977.

7jT M W Section 1 cif the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 empowered the Secretary of State to designate a
   sports'itadium having, in his opinion, accommodation for more than 10,000 as a stadium requiring a
   certificate from the local authority. Hillsborough was so designated with effect from 1 January 1979 by SI
   1978/1091. In anticipation of that date, Sheffield Wednesday instructed Eastwood and Partners, a firm of
   consulting engineers, to act on their behalf especially in their dealings with the local authority. Dr Eastwood,
   the principal of the firm, is a highly experienced civil and structural engineer and has advised several major
   football clubs. He recommended that a number of additional crush barriers should be added since those
   already in place were insufficient to comply with the Green Guide (1976 edition). That work was approved
   and carried out during 1979.

7(,            The relevant local authority at the time was the South Yorkshire County Council. It set up an Officer
      Woncmg Party consisting of representatives of the police, the fire service, its own building surveyor’s division
      and its own legal and administration department. The Working Party made inspections and consulted with the
      Club and Dr Eastwood. A Safety Certificate was issued on 21 December 1979 for an indefinite period. It has
      remained in force ever since and has not been amended.

•77           Schedule 3 of the certificate sets out the maximum crowd capacity for various areas in the ground. The
      figure'ror the west terrace is 7,200 and for the north-west terrace 2,900. These figures were intended to be in
      accordance with the Green Guide (1976). Paragraph 15.4 provided for a maximum “packing density” of
      between 54 and 27 persons per 10 square metres depending on the condition of the terrace. Dr Eastwood had
      calculated 8,000 for the west terrace on the basis of 54 per 10 square metres. He thought this a justified starting
      figure in view of his improved system of barriers. However, he reduced it to 7,200 because there were no
      gangways on the terrace and he did not think it feasible to provide any. So, the total figure for the Leppings Lane
      terraces was and is 10, 100.


                                      ijjfh ere wascrushing at the Cup semi-final in 1981. The match was between
       Tottenham Hotspur and Wolverhampton Wanderers. The police debriefing minutes after the incident
                 Irefer,

        “to the late arrival of a large number of spectators who were still waiting to enter the Leppings Lane
        enclosure when the match started. The flash point occurred when Tottenham scored” (at the Kop end) “after
        only three minutes. The spectators just entering pushed forward to see what was happening and caused a
        crush, which resulted in the injuries”.

       ( £ ^ .] Those being, crushed called for the perimeter Kites to be opened onto the track. There was no
      immediate r       e     a     c     t    i     b     u     t                   a P°^ce Inspector gave instructions
      and the gates were then opened. About 250 came out onto the track. There were brpjken arms, legs and ribs and
      38 were treated either in hospital or by the St John Ambulance Brigade. It is c le a r H B H B B p H B B ^ th a t
      the turnstile readings showed the capacity figure of 10,100 had been exceeded by over 4 0 0 j||th a t the police
      shut off further access to the terraces because of crushing, a n d t f the police view after the event was that the
      capacity figure of 10,100 in the Safety Certificate was too high. This latter view was communicated to the Club
      by the Chief Superintendent then in command of F Division but it was not pursued.

[*
%0          After this incident in April 1981 the police requested that the ter      should be divided into sections.
     The oBject was to improve crowd control by reducing sideways movement




      ( jH y T h is proposal was agreed by the Q ub and the Officer Working Party and was approved by the local
     authority. Two radial fences were accordingly fitted in November 1981. They are the fence now separating pens
     2 and 3 and that now separating 5 and 6 . The result was to divide the whole terrace into three pens. Access from
     the concourse to the middle pen was through the tunnel and to the wing pens round the sides of the west stand.
     D r Eastwood suggested and illustrated an altered layout which would have provided separate access through
     separate banks of turnstiles to the north stand, to each end of the west stand, and to each of the three pens.
     Whilst the main object of this was segregation, such a layout would have enabled each of those areas to be
     monitored numerically via the turnstiles so as to ensure its maximum capacity was not exceeded. The plan was
     not adopted. The maximum capacity for the new centre pen was calculated at 2,200, but no alteration was
     made to the Safety Certificate so to limit it nor was there any means mechanically of counting the numbers
     going into that pen.


&(               1985, Sheffield Wednesday had been promoted to the First Division and was drawing larger
     crowds. The improvement of the Leppings Lane end was raised again by the Club and Dr Eastwood prepared a
     number of drawings. These illustrated various schemes for achieving segregation by providing more turnstiles
     in separate banks and divisions of the concourse. The police wanted further divisions of the terrace itself,
     again to improve control and segregation. There was much discussion of these schemes which included
     suggestions of 29 and even 34 turnstiles in total. In the result, the following alterations were carried out in
      1985.


       flB ^ O n the terraces, two more radial fences were fitted. One divided the existing central pen into the
     present pens 3 and 4. Gates were fitted at the mouth of the tunnel to enable each of those pens to be closetf off.
     The second fence was placed in the new pen 4 so as to create the narrow pen 5 intended to be a sterile area. Until
     those two fences were added there existed only perimeter gates 1,2,4,5 and 6. The creation of pen 3 required a
     new gate 3 to be fitted which was done.


    ^M v T h e lines of the new radial fences ran across existing crush barriers so that without modification those
 ■mbarriers
      3 ?t
            would have run through the fencing. The police considered the barriers would be used by fans as
     convenient mounting points to scale the new fences, thereby defeating their object. They therefore wished
     spans to be removed from the barriers. Had their wishes been met in full the result would have been an
     unimpeded run in pen 3 from the mouth of the tunnel dowp,the south side of the new fence to the perimeter. Dr
     Eastwood dug his heels in against that proposal which he^M g^regarded as dangerous. He did however agree
     to some modification to the middle row of barriers in the newly created pen 3, chiefly to facilitate access.
     Likewise in the new pen 5. The 1985 modifications to the pens are shown on the plan Appendix 4.


S’ 4-        ^ t t^ie entrance, modification but no increase in number was made at the turnstiles. The bank 1 to 16
    was divided from A to G by the metal fence now in place and that division was projected across the concourse
    inside the turnstiles in the form o f a brick wall. A personnel gate was provided for access through that wall but
    was enlarged to its present size at the request of the police. Those alterations were made in the interests of
    segregation. The more elaborate divisions which Dr Eastwood had suggested, giving separate access to each
    sub-division of the accommodation, were not pursued for financial reasons. In May 1985 the Bradford
    disaster occurred. The south stand at Hillsborough had wooden decking and the Club realised it would have to
    undertake expensive remedial works there. The cantilever roof of the same stand was also discovered to„
    require expensive repairs.

       ttH H H R iS h o rtly after the new dividing fence and wall had been built at the Leppings Lane entrance and
     concourse, the Club, by agreement with Chief Superintendent Mole, ccased to accommodate home supporters
     at the Leppings Lane end. There was therefore no longer any need for segregation at that end, but the wall
     remained.

                1985, electronic counting equipment was installed at all turnstiles. This conveyed the running
count for each bank of turnstiles, for example A to G, to a television screen in the Club control room where the
figures were displayed. In 1986, an electronic eye was installed in each turnstile booth to catch and record
anyone who climbed over the turnstile.


               ie 1986, the police requested that the crush barrier nearest to the tunnel at the entrance to pens 3
               sc removed to assist the flow of fans into the pens. They found it caused obstruction because it
was in a good viewing position and spectators liked to stand against it in numbers thereby blocking access by
others further into the pens. The police also suggested it might hamper effective evacuation through the tunnel
esneciallv in an emergency. Dr Eastwood considered the pros and cons of this proposal and accepted the police
                                                                            ^ August 1986 on site^ Authority was
given then and there by Mr Bownesor^enalfmtheSheffield City Council which had taken over responsibility
for the Safety Certificate from South Yorkshire County Council on 1April 1986. Two spans of the barrier were
therefore removed, leaving only one span in pen 4 as shown on Appendix 4. t..


                      f these changes was to divide the terrace into a number of small areas without providing
any computerised or mechanical means of limiting entry numerically into any one area if all areas were open
for choice. Before the fences and pens had divided the terrace, the overall figure of 10,100 could be monitored
via the turnstiles and in theory the crowd could even itself out laterally. Even then, it was not possible strictly to
ensure compliance with Schedule 3 Part 1 of the Safety Certificate which prescribed a maximum o f2,900 for
the north-west terrace and 7,200 for the west terrace. Paragraph 3 of Schedule 2 of the Safety Certificate
provides:

 ..“The number of spectators admitted to the Stadium and to the several areas of spectator accommodation
   yvithin the Stadium shall not exceed the figures specified in Part 1 of Schedule 3”.

  The Club had to rely upon visual monitoring.

  ( ^ ^ \ r h e situation became worse however with the division of the west terrace into pens. Not only were
there more and smaller discrete areas but some were likely to attract more than their appropriate share of the
 10,100 total. It is well recognised that the area behind the goal is very popular. Moreover, the position of the
tunnel vis-a-vis the turnstiles A to G, its labelling and the absence of signposts advertising the wing pens would
draw to it those with terrace tickets. It was therefore highly likely that pens 3 and 4 would fill to capacity and
indeed exceed it unless preventive steps were taken. Had Dr Eastwood’s plan for separate turnstile access to
separate sections with separate toilet and refreshment facilities been implemented, total computerised control
could have been kept.




                                                         *
Q O ^ § 0 0 In 1981, when the terrace was divided into three areas, Dr Eastwood gave the Qub the figure of 2,200
    capacity for the centre pen. He based this on the Green Guide, making such allowances as he thought right. No
    doubt the numbers could have been counted in via the turnstiles if only that pen was in use or if such pens as
    were in use were filled sequentially, but not otherwise.
     m i     After the 1985 changes, Dr Eastwood did not himself give any figures for the new pens 3 and 4 .
     Someone on his staff however split the figure 2,200 into 1,200 for pen 3 and 1,000 for pen 4. Those figures did
     not even take account of the fact that pen 5 had been carved out of pen 4 which was bound to have a reducing
     effect on capacity. Nevertheless, the figures of 1,200 and 1,000 were put on a drawing emanating from
     Eastwopd and Partners and th^figures have been notionally regarded since as applicable by the Q ub and the
     police.

                              figures for pens 3 and 4 respectively would be 1,015 anc 1,036 if the strength and
     spacing of the crush barriers had complied with the Green Guide. But they did not.


       f l | . ( l n pen 3, four out of five gaps in the lines of crush barriers do not conform with paragraph 115 of the
     GreerTGuide (1986). In pen 4, nine out of ten do not conform. In particular, the spans taken out of the barriers
     in pen 3 in 1985 left gaps well in excessof the maximum of 1.4 metres prescribed. One gap was 57% wider than
     the Green Guide maximum. Moreover, that gap was in direct diagonal line from the mouth of the tunnel to the
     barrier which collapsed)

        _______________________________________ two further departures from the Green Guide. If, as was
     the case, the pSHWeleTgates were not regarded as exits, some 40% of those in pens 3 and 4 were more than 12
     metres from an exit (and there was no gangway) contrary to the aim of paragraph 96. Four out of five of the
     crush barriers in pen 3 and six out of nine in pen 4 were below the height prescribed in paragraph 110. These
     were the old barriers which had been repaired and plated where their bases had corroded and fresh concrete
     had been applied, raising the level of the steps.& £ 0 ^ ^ ^ ^ f g ^ ^ g j g g g ^ j L i the event, many fans were

     Guide are taken into account, the maximum capacity for pen 3 should have been 822 and for pen 4,871.

              Section 2(1) of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 provides (so far as is relevant):
       “A Safety Certificate shall contain such terms and conditions as the local authority consider necessary or
       expedient to secure reasonable safety at the stadium when it is in use. . . ”
        Section 2(2) provided (so far as is relevant):
        “Without prejudice to sub-section (1) above, a Safety Certificate-
        (a) shall specify the maximum number of spectators to be admitted to the stadium;
        (b) may specify the maximum number to be admitted to different parts of it;
        (c) shall include terms and conditions-
        ... (iii) as to the number, strength and situation of any crush barriers.”

       Scction 2(2) was repealed by the Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987, section 19, which
       gave power to the Secretary of State to lay down, by order, terms and conditions. No order has yet been
       made and guidance from the Home Office has recommended local authorities to approach their
       function under section 2(1) in accordance with the criteria in the repealed section 2(2). (See Home
       Office Circular 71/1987 dated 25 November 1987, Annex A, paragraph 6.)

C\<{                                      certificate was first issued the South Yorkshire County Council went
       further than simply to fix the maximum numbers for the whole Stadium. They prescribed figures for
       each part of the ground not merely by the four points of the compass but by specified sections.

Uno ^ 5. Section 8(1) of the 1975 Act requires the holder o f the certificate before carrying out any
   proposals to alter or extend the stadium or any of its installations while a Safety Certificate is in
   operation to give notice of those proposals to the local authority. That obligation is specifically
   repeated in Sheffield Wednesday’s certificate at Schedule 2 Paragraph 5(2). The Q ub complied with
   the requirement. Having received notice of the alterations to the pens and tfie barriers, the local
I® ' ^ ^ T H e Safety Certificate contained no maximum figures for individual pens. There was therefore no
   sanction or provision focussing attention as to the need to limit entry to the pens by numbers. The layout at
    Leppings Lane as it evolved made electronic or mechanical control over numbers entering individual pens
   impracticable if all pens were to be available. Given an important match and a capacity attendance, fans were
   likely to crowd into popular sections like pens 3 and 4. Those pens were likely to become overfull well before
   warning came from the turnstiles that numbers were approaching the terrace maximum of 10,100. Control

        P ] A t League matches at HillsboroflghTthe police practice was to decide in advance how many and which
       pens would be used. If a modest crowd was anticipated only one or two pens might be needed. It was better to
       confine the fans to limited spaces (a) to prevent them running about and (b) to reduce the number of police
       required. The practice was then to fill the pens one by one. This involved making a judgement as to when a pen
       was full. There would then be a police decision to close that pen and fill another. It was regarded as impractical
       and unsafe for police officers (just like stewards) to go onto the Leppings Lane terraces with away supporters.
       This meant that monitoring the numbers in any pen had to be done from vantage points outside it. Here, the
       police were much better placed than the stewards. There was a good view from the control box and the
       television screens there. There were officers on the perimeter track. No stewards were placed there because
       having both police and stewards interfered with the viewing. There were also police in the west stand who
       could look down on the pens. Intelligence from all these sources could give the police a good appreciation of
       the state of the terraces. When it was necessary to shut off access to the pens officers on the concourse could be
       informed by radio and could take the necessary steps.


t° *               At Cup semi-finals, a different approachwas adopted. All the pens were opened from the start and the
       policy'was “to let the fans find their own level”
       ^ ^ ■ ■ ■ l A W h a t it meant was that no specifTcclirection was given to fans entering through the turnstiles.
       They were "free to go wherever they wished on the terraces. If they became uncomfortable or wished for any
       other reason to move their position, then theoretically they could move elsewhere. In this way it was hoped that
       the fans on the terraces would level themselves out and that distribution would be achieved without police
       intervention. On these occasions, the gates at the top of the radial fences were locked in the open positioi^A

•       M R The effect of this policy was that whereas at League matches the police had to make a positivedecision
       wnen-to close one pen and open another, at semi-finals, where overcrowding was much more likely, the police
       left it to the fans themselves to “find their own level”. Effectively, they were left to monitor their own comfort
       and safety so as to avoid overcrowding. The police would only intervene when there was some overt sign that an
       area was “full”.

(0 $                   the years, spectators on terraces have come to accept conditions which are often very
        uncomfortable and not infrequently downright dangerous. They are subjected to buffeting and squeezing to
        get in and out of the terraces. They are packed tightly and exposed to surging and swaying during the match.
        They put up with these conditions because they are devoted to the game and because there is little they can do
        about them. They believe the discomfort will pass and nothing very untoward will happen. Usually that is the
        case and they are reassured by it. Most clubs have not, until very recently, consulted their supporters as to their
        grievances or suggestions. The practice has been to pack them in on the assumption that if they are prepared to
        put up with it the conditions must be tolerable. Although crowd figures at football grounds have been reduced
        in recent years, this has been due principally to the increased proportion of seating as against standing
        accommodation. Terraces have still been packed.

                 t is said that many fans enjoy these features of terrace viewing. Clearly close proximity, shared
        disconifort, weathering sways and surges together and chanting the same songs and slogans en masse do evoke
        good humour and have produced a spirit or cult of the terraces which many enjoy. Equally there are many who
        simply endure these things for the football, for a cheap ticket or indeed for the chance of getting in at all. And
        before Hillsborough most fans on the terraces, even if they enjoy the hurly-burly, had not realised the narrow
        margin of safety between an uncomfortable crush and a fatal one.

•) O [ m i The Green Guide sought to improve safety and comfort by laying down criteria for maximum
     capacity, ie defining what is “full”. The standard set was 54 f^sons per 10 square metres in favourable
     conditions but fewer, down to 27, in less favourable conditions./
                                                                                    l^^^TReTigures consideredappropriate

       ‘There have been frequent occasions when the packing on terraces, not only at Hillsborough, has caus*ed
         discomfort and sometimes, for brief periods, fear. Usually the surge recedes, the sway returns, the pressure
                                                                                                                        &
         eases and the incident passes unrecorded.

               After the crushing at the 1981 semi-final, Hillsborough was not chosen again by the FA until 1987.
                                   central pens were uncomfortably overcrowded on that occasion and again at the
        1988 Cup semi-final, although entry to the tunnel was blocked off by police shortly before kick-off in 1988
        because the pens were deemed to be “full”.


Ili             {Over the last few years, hooliganism at and associated with football matches has strongly influenced
        the strategy of the police^Jn their plans and management they have concentrated on averting or containing
        threats to public                                                                   ^ has led to an imbalance
        between the need to quell a minority of troublemakers and the need to secur^Tne safety and comfort of. the
        majority. In the police Operational Order, the emphasis was upon prevention of disorder and in particular
        prevention of access to the field of play. There was no express requirement that officers on the perimeter track
     or in the west stand should keep watch for any possible overcrowding on the terrac




              Although the police had accepted de facto responsibility for monitoring the pens, their policy on the
     day WSs to leave fans to “find their own level” and to concentrate their own attention on possible disorder.
     Whilst in theory, the police would intervene if a pen became “full”, in practice they permitted the test of
     fullness to be what the fans would tolerate.

nl   ( W . By 2.52_pm when gate C was opened, pens 3 and 4 were over-full even by this test. Many were
     uncom fortable

Mg                The decision to open gate C, and subsequently gates A and B too, was forced on to the police by the
          crowd conditions which developed outside the turnstiles. The crush was so severe that injuries were being
          suffered and deaths were feared unless the pressure could be swiftly r e lie v e d iv f lH H H H I lH H H H I V t




              Tstone Road and at many other grounds, turnstiles are in a straight line, adequately spaced and wim        !&<a
          sufficient waiting area for queues to form. Not so at Leppings Lane. The building line, the bridge over the Don
          and the bend in the road, left a wedge-shaped approach to perimeter gates set in an arc, and across a short
          forecourt, to turnstiles also set in an arc. The pairs of turnstiles were close together and the forecourt, especially
          as divided by the metal fence, provided little space for a waiting crowd.


1^0         f l g ) The decision to All the whole of the north stand from the Leppings Lane end required the 23 turnstiles
          there to admit 24,236 spectators. O f those, the seven turnstiles (A to G) serving the terraces had to admit
          10,100, ie an average of just under 1,450 through each turnstile. At the Penistone Road end, 29,800 were
          served by 60 turnstiles, or just under 500 per turnstile.

          ( f » T h e Green Guide recognises (paragraph 47) that the rate at which spectators can pass through
       acrnstiles depends on a variety of local circumstances but states “in general based on observation and
       .‘experience, it is unlikely that the maximum notional rate per turnstile would exceed 750 per hour”. Since the
        .semi-final was an all ticket match requiring no cash transactions, the Gub considered that a higher rate o f
         about 1,000 per hour per turnstile could be expected. Even at this higher rate, which assumes the turnstiles
         working at maximum efficiency non-stop, it would have taken nearly 1'hhours to admit all those with terrace
         tickets. At 750 per hour, it would have taken nearly two hours.

1          j ^ f c ^ h e Green Guide provides (paragraph 44):-

            “Turnstiles should be of such numbers as to admit spectators at a rate whereby no unduly large crowds are
            kept waiting for admission..

                 The Officer Working Party had discussed in 198 5 the.need, and Dr Eastwood's various schemes, for

      turnstile area and its very density hampered its passage through the turnstiles.                       '

      had no control over their movements at all.




IIS      ^ W T h e labelling of the turnstiles in the order A, C, B was confusing. A fan with a B ticket who went by
       mistalte to the wrong side of the metal fence would have had the greatest difficulty in getting back and round to
       the correct side. The colour coding was inefficient because the coloured wooden panels were affixed to the
       turnstile walls so low that they were not easily visible through a crowd. The information on the ticket printed
       Sheffield Wednesday Football Club was misleading and its layout u n h e lp f u Q 0 H H ^ |g ||f g g |j||g 0 g g ^ |

I       <JSBR V h e result was that in the early stages, police officers were pestered by fans for help as to where they
       skoiild-go. Later, as the crowd became more dense* fans were presenting their tickets at the wrong turnstiles.
       There were also Liverpool supporters who had acquired tickets for the Kop end but sought entry at Leppings
       Lane. They caused delays in the turnstile operation when entry was refused and after a while the police
       instructed the operators to let them through. There was further delay because the crush made it difficult for
       fans to get into the turnstile entrances. Once there, the pressure from behind was such as, on occasions, to jam
       them in the doorway or against the paddle of the turnstile. Finally, there were fans without tickets who sought
       to enter by offering payment, by seeking to go over or under the paddle or by sliding through with a ticket
       holder. All of these activities slowed down the turnstile rate which at the worst period was only about 600 per
       hour per turnstile. The waiting crowd therefore expanded and as the minutes passed frustration grew. Visitors

     who had paid for tickets and travelled from afar realised they were making little forward progress. Frustration
     increased pressure and induced panic at the front. Determination to get into the match was intensified by
     determination to get out of the crush.


t *>o m Wfi It has become a fact o f football life that fans do turn up at all-ticket matches without tickets. U isnot
     possible to give an accurate figure or even a reliable estimate of the number without tickets on 1S A p r i|j^ b e




                                                                     fnside the grouncjjj^g^he Liverpool end was at
     a late stage well below capacity save for pens 3 and 4. The noiTnstand still had many empty seats and the wing
     pens were sparse. The match being a sell-out, there were clearly many ticket holders to come and they could
     account for the large crowd still outside the turnstiles^

     10,100 for which tickets had been sold. The Club’s record showed 7,038 passed through turnstiles A to G.
     However, the counting mechanism on turnstile G was defective, so the HSE did a study using the video film
     and projecting figures from the other turnstiles. This gave an assessment of 7,494, with a maximum of 7,644
     passing through A to G. Again, using the video, the HSE assessed the number who entered the ground whilst
     gate C was open at 2,240 with a maximum of 2,480. Accordingly, the HSE’s hpst estimate of the total entering
     through gate C and turnstiles A to G was 9,734 with a maximum of 10,1

               The Operational Order for 15 April followed closely that laid down for the 1988 semi-final. The
       empnasis was on maintaining law and order. Side roads were to be blocked off to prevent damage in residential
       areas. Pairs of officers were to patrol streets to prevent “clash of rival supporters”. Officers were to watch public
       houses, shops and supermarkets “where looting could take place”. Outside the turnstiles, officers were to ensure
       supporters entering did not have banners, weapons, missiles or alcohol.

   *                                                                                     only
       aimed at effecting controlled entry to the turnstiles was one enjoining officers “to ensure orderly queues are
       formed”. There was no provision for controlling the entry of the crowd into the turnstile area.

                As long ago as 1924, the Departmental Committee on Crowds stated:-

         “The control of crowds should begin at a point some considerable distance from the. entrance to the ground.
         The advantages of an arrangement of this kind are... in preventing congestion at the entrances to grounds.”

       This was particularly important at Leppings Lane where the turnstile area was so small and awkwardly laid
       out. If a large crowd was permitted uncontrolled entry through the perimeter gates, the forming ofqueues at the
       turnstiles and control by officers, whether on foot or mounted, would become impracticable. Those waiting at
       the turnstiles would become a single growing mass. Once that happened, it would be difficult to retrieve the
       situation.

        ( jljtjw h e th e r steps were taken and what steps to avoid this happening was left to oral briefing and ad hoc
       instructions on the day.



1*8 T h e only two previous occasions when the Leppings Lane terraces had been used to till the whole of the north
       and west sides of the ground were at the two semi-finals, in 1987and 1988. In 1987, the match was on a Sunday,
       scheduled for 12 noon, and kick-off was postponed for a quarter of an hour because of late arrivals.


        _ fl^ A sto 1988,                                                               W^)on the day, the police in

      Sheffield City Council Advisory Group, with police present, on 23 March 1988. The minute reads:-
        “ As far as the turnstile question was concerned, a pattern has developed of people arriving some 15 minutes
        before the start of the game hoping to gain admission. This trend may be due to the banning of alcohol at
        sports grounds which could lead to people going elsewhere for refreshment prior to the football match. As
        the available turnstiles operated quite effectively for the majority of the time, and that the late arrival
        problem could perhaps only be dealt with by education of the spectators” (sic).

        p n ^ n e n Mr Murray told Mr Duckenfield they would “get thern all in by 3 o’clock” he seems not to have
        appreciated that in addition to those visible at the turnstiles there were many more still to come.
        Marshall outside the turnstiles was not told and coukl not otherwise have known that there were still many
        Liverpool ticket holders to arrive.


                          __________________                                           IMr Marshall was in charge of the
        serials outside the perimeter gates in the Leppings Lane area and in the roads beyond. In practice he operated
        inside and just outside the turnstile area. Mr Greenwood’s area as Ground Commander extended from liic
        pitch to the perimeter gates. He in fact stationed himself near the players’ tunnel. He was wholly unaware of the
        growing problems at the turnstiles and was in no position to exercise control over his officers who were under
        pressure there. No-one in the control room thought to tell him.


J                In the result, the large concentration of arrivals from 2.30 pm to 2.40 pm pressed unrestrained into
        the turnstile area through the perimeter gates which were fully open. When that apsa was full, later arrivals
        swelled the crowd out to the forecourt and even into the ro a d .(M B H ^ ^ M B M B y th e foot officers at the
        turnstiles became trapped and endangered and retired through tEe tu rn stn es^ i^ n o u n ted officers could not
        operate amidst such a dense crowd in a confined space. They came out of the turnstile area. There were then
        the belated attempts to close the perimeter gates and prevent more fans joining the mass until it had a chance to
        diminish through the turnstiles; still later the attempt to put a cordon of horses across the entrance.

I        (jfl^SQDespite knowledge of the difficult layout, the very large number of fans to be got through so few
        turnstiles and the tendency of fans to arrive in the last half hour, no contingency plans were made to avoid a
        crush such as occurred.^

                           J I f some of the perimeter gates had been closed and cordons of mounted and foot ofticers
        had been placed a little distance from those gates, the flow of fans into the turnstile area could have been
        controlled before that area became engulfed. It was the crush itself which produced the frustration and the
                                                                                 Earlier control of entry would

                It should moreover have been obvious by 2.40 pm, if not earlier, that a large part of the crowd could
        not be admitted until well after 3 pm. Had a decision to postpone kick-offbeen made and announced much of
        the frustration and with it the impetus crushing the crowd would have been reduced. A combination of
        controlled filtering and a postponed kick-off would probably have obviated the need to open the gates.


l"-H\
        £       At various stages in his evidence, Mr Duckenfield gave three accounts of why he thought it too late to
        postpone kick-off. Once it was that one of the teams had already come onto the pitch. Then it was that a group
        of photographers at the tunnel had wrongly led him to think that the teams were coming out. Finally, he did not
        know why he thought the teams were coming out. Theyjdid not in fact come onto the pitch until 2.54 pm, two
        minutes after gate C was opened. Police Constable Buxton had asked for a postponement of kick-off before
        gate C was opened. It should not, however, have needed a police Constable in the thick of the crowd (and there
        were others of like mind) to think of postponing the kick-off. The need should have been clear in the control
        room.

    '                                Duckenfield applied inflexibly the policy he had discussed with Mr Murray.
        Kick-off would not be postponed unless there were some major cause for delayed arrivals eg a jam on the

         rejected the option of postponing kick-off, the police were faced with a serious danger o f deaths or injuries.
         They were left therefore with no alternative but to open the gates. Superintendent Marshall was right at that
         stage to ask for it and Mr Duckenfield was right to agree. But the possible effects of so dramatic a step required
         other action.




                                                                        2>=i

        Commander, was informed. From 2.47 pm when Mr Marshall made his first request until 2.52 pm when Mr
        Duckenfield acceded to it, there werejjv e minutes in which orders gould have been given as to how the influx

        would go when the gate opened. Even after it opened, when he could see the influx on the television screen, no
        order was given to steer the fans to the wing pens. Mr Duckenfield said it did not cross his mind to detail
        officers on the concourse to shut off the tunnel. Those officers could not have known from their position how
        full pens 3 and 4 were. That was a matter for the control room to monitor from its own observations and using
        intelligence from around the ground.

1 J (j^T ^S ince pens 3 and 4 were full by 2.50 pm, the tunnel should have been closed off whether gate C was to
    be opened or not. The exercise was a simple one and had been carried out in 1988. All that was necessary was
    for a few officers to act as a cordon at the entrance to the tunnel and divert fans elsewhere. Unfortunately, the
    1988 closure seems to have been unknown to the senior officers on duty at the time. It did not figure in the
    debriefing notes. It therefore had no influence on the planning for 1989.

I   'K (MB \Planning apart, however, it should have been clear in the control room where there was a view of the
      pens aim of the crowd at the turnstiles that the tunnel had to be closed. If orders had been given to that effect
      when gate C was opened, the fans could have been directed to the empty areas of the wings and this disaster
      could still have been avoided. Failure to give that order was a blunder of the first magnitude.

 i i ~ S i g n i f i c a n t l y , when permission was given to open gate A, Mr Duckenfield did order serials to go to that
       parf o f the concourse to monitor the influx towards the north stand. He did this because he feared that if fans
       went to the north stand without tickets, they would not get seats and, there being no perimeter fences at the
       north side, they might invade the pitch. This illustrates again the preoccupation with avoiding pitch invasion
       as against safety and the risks of overcrowding. Because those entering through gate C could not get onto the
       pitch, it was not thought necessary to alert officers to monitor them. The possibility of overcrowding simply
       was not considered.




                                                                    •H

structure as it came into pen 3. The pressure created was free to push fans straight down by the radial fence to
the lowest line of barriers. The pressure diagonally from the tunnel mouth down to barrier number 124a which
collapsed was unbroken by any intervening barrier. 124a was also vulnerable to pressure straight down the pen
through the gap in the barrier above it created in 1985.

       then working again and although reception was difficult due to crowd noise and possibly excessive air traffic
       on channel 25, attempts could have been made to alert officers on the perimeter track to watch for
       overcrowding and report their observations. In the event, pens 3 and 4 became more and more crowded, surges
       took place, fans were showing and signalling distress. None of this was seen or recognised in the control room.


 J foffio
      AfeVThe 20 officers detailed to the perimeter track were distributed round the pitch so that some five
      ficCTs were at the west end. Their written instructions made no reference to the avoidance or detection of
       overcrowding. The same applied to the officers in the west stand. Mr Greenwood                        jjjTjoral
       briefings also contained no mention of monitoring the pens for overcrowding.

( fc>O ^ ^ T f r h e Operational Order for 1988 had instructed officers to forbid anyone “access to the track from the
      terraceswithout the consent of a senior officer (except to receive medical attention)”. At the end of the 1988
      semi-final, there was a minor pitch invasion. Accordingly, that prohibition was emphasised in the 1989
      Operational Order by being put into capital letters. The combination of no instructions as to overcrowding and
      a strong prohibition, on opening the gates was likely to make police recognition of crushing slow and their

        as a threat to the pitch and to public order. The message calling up all available officers mentioned a pitch
        invasion. Operation Support was initiated and dog handlers were requested.
                 Until Chief Superintendent Nesbit arrived, there was no effective leadership either from control or on
        the pitch to harness and organise rescue efforts. No orders were given for officers to enter the tunnel and relieve
        pressure. Some officers did this on their own initiative. Apart from the Tannoy request to clear the pitch, no
        attempt was made to clear and mark off a casualty area where first-aid could be given without hindrance by
        fans and photographers milling about between the bodies. There was no co-ordination of the early provision of
        first-aid or of stretcher parties or of the rescue effort through gates 3 and 4. No request for help was broadcast to
        doctors and nurses in the crowd until about 3.29 pm when it was too late.^M H K 'T here was little that could
        have been achieved in most cases however soon doctors had been summoned, but there were marginal cases

      vOrder d%d not detail the duties of the mounted officers deployed at the Leppings Lane entrance, who included
        Liverpool officers to assist in marshalling their own fans. The duties of Superintendents (S e ria lly Mr

       shoppiiig areas and to emphasise in capital letters the embargo on fans having access to the pitch. Satisfaction
       with the 1988 event led to complacency. That some thought the pens overfull in 1988 and that the tunnel was
       closed off on that occasion did not figure in or influence the plan for 1989.

     might have been wiser to have left Mr Mole in charge of this operation. On the other hand, it is quite
     understandable that Mr Duckenfleld should have been expected to take command of events in his Division
     from the date of his promotion. In view of his lack of experience at Hillsborough and of a semi-final match,
     however, it was imperative that he be fully briefed and that he should also brief himself.

       terraces. He did not visit and tour the ground before approving the Operational Order. Although he attended a
       match on 2 April, there was only a small crowd present and he left control of the game to the Superintendents.

                                 {here are a number of respects in which failure by the Club contributed to this disaster.
          They were responsible as occupiers and in vitors for the layout and structure of the ground. The Leppings Lane
          end was unsatisfactory and ill-suited to admit the numbers invited, for reasons already spelt out. The Club was
          aware of these problems and discussed solving them in various ways between 1981 and 1986. In the result,
          there remained the same number of turnstiles, and the same problems outside and inside them. The plan for
          this semi-final, involving as it did the loss of \2 turnstiles for the north stand and large numbers to be fed in
          from Leppings Lane, was one agreed between the Club and the police. The Club knew best what rate of
          admission the turnstiles could manage and ought to have alerted the police to the risks of the turnstiles being
          swamped.

        allowaabe was made for them. In that re s p e c tu g p H H H H H jH B V * 16 Club should have taken a more
        positive approach. Either a scheme such as oneoTthose D r Eastwood put forward should have been adopted
        giving more turnstiles and total separation of areas or at the very least the capacity of the new pens and of the
        terraces as a whole should havejaeen treated more cautiously. The police view in 1981 that 10,100wastoohigh
        a figure was known to the C lu b M H H ilH tf ^ H iH H H H f lf lf ip tY e t, despite that and the sub-division

          onus here was on the Club as well as on the police.

       tW wing pens and over-nm ngo^ens 3 and 4. Poor signposting outside the turnstiles and the unhelpful format
       of the tickets also led to confusion aggravating the build-up in the turnstile area.

HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY - SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB


You will recall th a t a t the pre-inquiry meeting on 28th April Lord Justice Taylor
indicated th a t any body against whom any allegation was to be made would be informed
of it and the substance of the evidence supporting it.

You will appreciate th a t the task of assembling the evidence for the Inquiry is a
formidable one, and statem en ts are still being taken. However, it seemed right to let
you have what must be a preliminary indication of criticisms which may be levelled a t
the Club and its employees as soon as possible before the commencement of the
Inquiry. We suspect th a t you are already aware of the general thrust of the criticisms
which have been made and th a t what is set out in this le tte r will be no surprise to you.

The following are the main general criticisms which so far appear from the evidence
available to us:-

1.     There appear to have been a number of significant failures to follow the Green
       Guide recommendations. In particular, we refer to the following paragraphs:-

        26.     Training of stewards in carrying out their roles in natural and emergency
                situations.

        29.     There may have been breaches of the following sub-paragraphs, namely
                (v)(a) and (c), (vi), (x), (xii) and (xv).

        ^5 .     Walls could be climbed over.

        46.     There were insufficient contingency plans to deal with the e ffe c t of
                opening the gate to relieve crowd pressure outside.

        57.      There was no proper signposting in the ground.

                                                                       1.
        99.   The gangways in the terraces were not indicated.

       176.   The planning for emergency, in the light of events, was inadequate.

       194. (ii) and (iv). No steps were taken to ensure th a t the capacities of Pens 3
               and 4 were not exceeded and loud hailers were not provided for stewards
               and police to control the crowds.

       195 . (a). No stewards were available to d irect persons entering the ground to
               ensure th a t the te rra c es filled up evenly.

       200.   There is some evidence th a t the police were unable to communicate with
               the stewards.

       206.   The arrangements for access to and egress from the pens on the te rra c e s
               w e re in a d e q u a te and t h e r e w e re in s u f f ic ie n t e x its to c a t e r fo r an
              emergency.

       215.   The gates in the perim eter fence were not marked as such and th a t to
               Pen 4 was difficult to use, since there were no steps leading to it.

2.    Turnstiles A-G were insufficient to ensure ease of admission to the te rra c e s
       inside, there were inadequate directions to. the pens to the side, th ere being a
       small and insignificant sign indicating standing to the right and no sign a t all to
       the left. The result was th a t all entering were drawn to the tunnel leading to
       Pens 3 and 4, which was not of a uniform gradient and sloped steeply a t the end
       leading onto the terraces.

3.    No steps were taken to ensure th a t the pens did not get overcrowded. Stewards
      ought to have monitored the ingress of the crowd and, with police assistance if
      necessary, to have prevented spectators going down th e tunnel when Pens 3 and
      4 were full.

4.    The c o lla p s e of a b a r r i e r in Pen        3 may in d ic a te      a lack of       stre n g th .

5.    Since the gates to the perim eter fence were small and unmarked and the gates
      giving access between the pens a t the top of the terraces equally small and
      unmarked, it should have been appreciated th a t a full house might lead to
      dangerous overcrowding.         Furthermore, since Liverpool had been given an
      allocation of seats which might have been inadequate to c ater for its regular
      supporters, it was likely th a t persons would come without tickets and add to the
      pressures outside the ground. Very g re a t care should have been taken to prevent
      overcrowding and to ensure an abundance of stewards to supervise the te rra c e .

6.    The first-aid equipment may have been inadequate. In particular, there was no
      oxygen available or equipment to assist resuscitation. A rrangem ents to access
       emergency vehicles were inadequate: an ambulance could only reach the playing
      area a fte r an advertising hoarding was removed.

Should any further criticisms come to our attention, we shall of course le t you know of
them.

                          NOTICE TO ADMIT FACTS


     1.  On 20 March 1989, the Football Association (the FA) requested that
their Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest be held on 15
April at Hillsborough Football Stadium.     (a) The corresponding semi-final
between the same two teams had been held there in April 1988.

     2.   The match was fixed for 15th April at Hillsborough.

     3.   The Hillsborough Stadium is some 2 1/2 miles to the north-west of
central Sheffield in the district of Owlerton.   (a) The ground was opened in
1899 on what was then a greenfield site by the river Don.  (b) The pitch lies
roughly east to west.

     4.   The west end, with which this Inquiry is principally concerned, is
known as the Leppings Lane end.     (a) The east end abuts on Penistone Road,
the A 61.    (b) To the south is the river Don and to the north a residential
street, Vere Road, which runs between Leppings Lane and Penistone Road North.

     5.  Alongside the river is a private roadway giving access to the south
stand, to the Directors' and players' entrances, and to the administrative
block under the stand.   (a) The roadway gives both vehicular and pedestrian
access between Penistone Road and Leppings Lane, but there are gates which
can shut it off at each end.      (b) There is some car parking along this
roadway principally for Directors, players and employees of the Club.    (c)
The south stand dated from 1914 and is the oldest at the ground.   It is all
seating with places for 8,800.5,500 of those are roofed over and 3,300 are
uncovered.

     6 . The north stand is also all seating and accommodates about 9,700.
(a)Behind it is a   gymnasium or sports hall. (b) There are also a first aid
room and police room close by.

     7. The east end is all terracing and is known as the Spion Kop. (a) It
was enlarged and roofed over in 1986 and now accommodates some 21,000
standing spectators.    (b) There are crush barriers in the Kop running
parallel to the goal line but no dividing fences to prevent free movement
from side to side.

     8 . At the west or Leppings Lane end of the ground there is terracing
close to the pitch.    (a) Behind it is the west stand which provides covered
seating and was built in 1965 for World Cup matches, some of which were held
at Hillsborough in 1966.     (b) The coveted stand accommodates 4,456 seated
spectators.    (c) The terracing in front of it extend higher in the corners
between the stands and its total capacity was Stated to be 10. ,100.    (d) At
both the Kop end and the west end access to the pitch is barred by periitieter
fencing.   (e) The fencing is about eight feet high mounted upon the low wall
at the foot of the terracing.   (f) At the top of the fencing the wire returns
                                   2.

back at a sharp angle for some 15 inches to make it difficult for anyone to
climb over towards the pitch.    (g) there are gates at intervals along the
perimeter fencing to afford access between terrace and pitch.    there gates
are less than a    metre wide and were designed to be opened only form the
pitch side for police purposes or in an emergency.   (h) They are marked and
numbered on the plan Appendix 1.

      9.   Unlike the Kop end, the west terracing has not only crush barriers
parallel with the goal line but radial fences at right angles to it, dividing
the area into pens.     (a) This division was begun after an FA Cup semi-final
in 1981 when crushing occurred due to overcrowding and gates had to be
opened.    (b) It proceeded in stages, the final arrangement being show on the
plan Appendix 1.    (c) The first section of the west terracing moving south to
north contains gates 1 and 2 and is known as pens 1 and 2 although in fact
constituting only one pen.     (d) Next is pen 3 with one gate; next pen 4 with
one gate; pen 5, which is extremely narrow, was intended as a sterile area to
divide pen 4 from pen 6 .      (e) This was to isolate home and away fans on
occasions when both might be accommodated on the west terracing in separate
pens.    (f) Finally there is pen 7 at the north-west corner.   (g) Pens 5,6 and
7 each have a perimeter gate.      (h) At the back of the pens, under the front
of the west stand, there is a gate in each radial fence.          (i) When those
gates are open, the back row of the terracing is intended to permit access
from pen to pen along the whole west side.     (j) In practice, when substantial
numbers are present, those gateways are not readily visible or accessible.
The present layout of the pens, fences, crush barriers and gates has resulted
from a series of piecemeal changes.

     10.   Because of the housing in Vere Road there is not access from the
north side of the ground.   (a) Along Penistone road North there are some 46
turnstiles which usually give access both to the Kop and to the east end of
the north stand.    (b) They are marked 43 to 88 inclusive on theplan.    (c)
The 12 numbered 77 to 88 are designed to feed the north stand but were not
used for that purpose on 15 April in order to segregate supporters of the
two teams as appears later.   (d) Two of them, 77 and 78, were however used
for access to the Kop.

     11.  At the south side of the ground there were 24 turnstiles (numbered
19 to 42 on the plan).   (a) Those numbered 37 to 42 led to the Kop and the
rest to the south stand.

     12.   In summary, the south and east sides of the ground accommodated
some 29,800 whose access on the day way through 60 turnstiles.

     13.  The other two sides of the ground, north and west, with a capacity
of   24,256 were fed solely from the Leppings Lane entrance where there were
only 23 turnstiles.

     14.  Broadly arrivals from Liverpool would be from the north and west;
arrivals from Nottingham would be from the south and east.

     15.  Before the 1988 semi-final the police decided that sections of the
Hillsborough Stadium should be allocated so as to achieve efficient
segregation of Liverpool and Nottingham Forest fans. (a) The section to be
li
                                     3.

     granted to each was determined by the direction whence each predominantly
     approached.   (b) Thus, Liverpool were allotted the north and west sides or
     the ground for which access was    from Leppings Lane.  (c) Nottingham Forest
     were allotted the south and east  sides with access from Penistone Road.

          16.    Liverpool were allotted 24,256 places as against 29,800          fro
     Nottingham Forest, (a) This, although average attendance of supporters        at
     home matches was substantially higher at Liverpool than at Nottingham.       (b)
     Moreover, with standing tickets at £6 and seats at £12, Nottingham Forest    had
     21,000 standing places compared with Liverpool's 10,100.

          17.   The approach to the west turnstiles is across a narrow neck or
     forecourt at a bend in Leppings Lane where, coining from the north, it turns
     to the south-west and crosses a bridge over the river Don-   (a) Parking areas
     for the Liverpool supporters had   been arranged north and west of the ground,
     (b) They were therefore expected to      arrive on foot along both limbs of
     Leppings Lane and would converge on the forecourt at the bend.    (c) In an arc
     across that forecourt is a line of railings with six sets of double gates.
     (d) Inside those perimeter gates is the short approach to the turnstiles.
     (e) The latter are in two sections divided by a fence.(f) The northern
     section consists of turnstiles 1 to 16. Numbers        1to 10gave accessto the
     north stand.    (g) Thus there were 10 turnstiles for the 9,700 with north
     stand seats.    (h) Their tickets were marked "Entrance A" and were colour-
     coded brown.   (i) Turnstiles 1 to 10 correspondingly had the letter A above
     them and brown boards on the wall.

          18.   Turnstiles 11 to 16 were    for those with seats in the west stand-
     Thus 4,456 were served by six turnstiles.      (a) They were the next block to
     the right of those marked A.     (b) the turnstiles and the west stand tickets
     were marked C.   (c) Their colour-code on tickets and boards was red.

          19. On the other side of the dividing fence in the approach area, there
     were only seven turnstiles to serve         1 0 ,1 0 0 with tickets for the west
     terracing.    (a) Those seven turnstiles were labelled A to G. (b) This       way
     because there had originally been 18 turnstiles at Leppings Lane          and the
     sequential numbering continued from 19 upwards on the south side           of the
     ground.    (c) When the number at Leppings Lane way brought up to 23 the
     present arrangements of 1 to 16,A to G and then 19 upwards was adopted to
     avoid re-numbering all round the ground.      (d) However, above the lettering A
     to G was a large letter B.    (e) "Entrance b" also appeared on tickets for the
     west terrace.     (f) Thus, the three blocks of turnstiles encountered by a
     ticket holder at the Leppings Lane endread from left to right A,C,B.          (g)
     The colour-code for west terrace tickets and the boards beside turnstiles A
     to G was mauve.     (h) To the right of turnstile G is a tubular steel barrier
     to divide the queue for that turnsitle form the roadway to the south stand.

          20. Turnstiles 1 to 10 gave access to a passageway leading to the north
     stand.  (a) there is an exit gate (marked A on Appendix 1.) between turnstile
     1 and the adjacent housing.

                                 4 .


     21. Inside turnstiles 1 to 16     is a concourse leading to pens 6 and 7
and the steps to the west stand, (a)There is a wall dividing this area from
that inside turnstiles A to G.    (b) It had been built to segregate home and
4.
away fans at a time when the club intended they should share the west
terrace.    (c) That idea was not pursued but the wall remained.     (d) There
was, however, a gateway in the wall which did permit access between the two
areas.   (e) An exit remained.    (f) There was, however, a gateway in   the wall
which did permit access between the two areas.       An exit gate was provided
from the area inside turnstiles 11 to 16.

     22.  Anyone using turnstiles A to G entered a concourse bounded on the
left by the wall just mentioned and on the right by the wall just inside
turnstile G.

     23.  All three exit gates, A,B and C, were of concertinal design.   (a)
They could be opened only from the inside and were not intended for entry of
spectators into the ground.

     24.   Those entering through turnstiles A to G had three options once
inside the ground.   (a) They could by moving to the right go round the south
end of the west stand and gain entry into pens 1 and 2.     (b) They could go
through the gap in the dividing wall towards the concourse behind turnstiles
11 to 16 and then round the north end of the west stand into pens 6 or 7.
(c) However, there were not conspicuous signs inviting them to take either of
those courses, (d) The obvious way in was straight ahead of the turnstiles
where atunnel under the middle of the west stand gave access to pens    3 and
4.   (e) Above its entrance in large letters was the word 11 Standing" and a
large letter "b". (f) Thus B ticket holders were drawn towards the tunnel.

      25.   The length of the tunnel is some 23 metres,   (a) It rises slightly
at first then levels off but finally descends towards the terraces at a
gradient of 1 in 6 .     (b) As   it emerges onto the terrace, the way ahead is
bisected by the radial fencebetween pen 3 on the right and         pen 4 on the
left.    (c) A short spur of brick wall projects forward from each side of the
tunnel at its mouth.      (d) Those emerging are thus guided straight forward
rather than to either side.

     26.   The configuration of the Leppings Lane turnstiles and the areas
inside   them   was   effected  by   a    series  of   piecemeal  changes.


     27.         At the 1988 semi-final, policing had been under the control of
Chief Superintendent Mole, then Commander of F Division within whose area
Hillsborough lies.   (a) He was still in post on 20 March 1989 when    the FA
broached the 1989 semi-final, but he was due to hand over command of F
Division on 27 March to Superintendent Duckenfield on the latter's promotion
to Chief Superintendent.   (b) Both were present at an initial meeting on 22
March, but on 27 March Mr Mole bowed out and Mr Duckenfield took over.     (c)
Under him were Sector Commanders, all superintendents with much experience of
policing football matches at Hillsborough and elsewhere.   (d) In particular,
Superintendent Marshall was in charge of the area outside the Leppings Lane
entrance and the approaches to it.  (e) Superintendent Greenwood was in
I

                                     5.

    command inside the ground, but this included the area between the turnstiles
    and the perimeter fence.       (f) They thereby swapped roles from the previous
    year.   (g) Under Mr Duckenfield 1s overall command were some 801 officers and
    men on duty at the ground plus traffic officers and others from D Division to
    deal with the influx of supporters into the city centre.             (h) In all,
    therefore, some 1 , 1 2 2 police were deployed for this match amounting to about
    38 per cent of the total South Yorkshire force.       (i) Included in the mounted
    section of 34 were officers from Liverpool and Nottingham to               assist
    respectively in marshalling their home supporters.          (j) The total at the
    ground was divided into serials consisting usually of eight to ten Constables
    plus a Sergeant and an Inspector.       (k) The serials were posted to duties at
    various stations in and around the ground in three phases: before, during and
    after the match.      (1) All of this was provided for in an Operational Order
    which followed closely the Order drawn up for the 1988 semi-final and took
    into account the force's "Standing Instructions for the Policing of Football
    Grounds".   The order described the duties of each serial at each phase.      (m)
    It was supplemented by oral briefings before and on the day of the match.

         28. The Club provided 376 stewards, gatemen and turnstile operators for
    duty n 15 April.    (a) The stewards were briefed as to their duties on the
    morning of the match by police Inspectors and were allocated round the
    ground.  (b) They wore yellow tabards.  (c) The Club's control room, situated
    below the south stand, could communicate by VHF radio with the stewards.    (d)
    Closed circuit television was installed by the Club with screens in their
    control room showing all the turnstiles round the ground.    (e) A computerised
    counting system was incorporated in the turnstiles.    (f) This flashed onto a
    screen in the Club control room the running total of        spectators passing
    through the turnstiles section by section.     (g) Thus, at the Leppings Lane
    end, here would be separate running totals for turnstiles 1 to 10 (north
    stand), turnstiles 11 to 16 (west stand), and turnstiles A to G (west
    Terraces).   When the total for any section was within 15 per cent of its
    permitted capacity a warning pulse showed on the screen.       (h) For the west
    terracing that warning would occur when the numbers were within 15 per cent
    of the total terrace capacity of 10,100.    (i) What the system could not do
    was monitor the distribution of fans on the terracing, pen by pen.       (j) It
    could give no warning therefore if on pen was full beyond its safe capacity.

         29.   The nerve centre for police control is the control room or box
    situated at the south-west corner of the ground between the south stand and
    pen 1 of the west terracing.   (a) The box is elevated and reached by a number
    of steps.   (b) It has windows commanding views across the pitch and straight
    along the line of the west perimeter fence. The box is very small and has
    seats for only three officers.    (c) Superintendent Murray was in control of
    it and was advisor to Mr Duckenfield as he had been to Mr Mole the year
    before. Next to him sat Sergeant Goddard who operated the radios.      (d) the
    third seat was for Police Constable Ryan who operated the telephone and
    public address systems.    (e) At the back of the box stood Police Constable
    Bichard who was in control of the     police closed circuit television system
    operated by a row of consoles on a bench in front of him and behind the three
    seated officers.
                               6.

     30.       The Tannoy public address system was relayed through speakers fixed
a vantage points inside the ground and outside the turnstiles.    (a) It was
used by a disc jockey, housed under the poice control box, to relay music
before the match, but it could be overridden by the police.     (b) Messages
could be relayed through all speakers or if appropriate to one area only •


     32.        Radio contact at Hillsborough from control to serials operating
both inside and outside the ground was UHF on channel 25.     (a) There was a
WIFU portable base station in the control box and if it failed there was a
stand-by station under the operator's bench.     (b) Hand sets were issued to
all ranks of Sergeant and above.      (c) Community Constables on duty would
already have their own.         (d) Other Constables had no radio.         (e)
Communication was on "calk through" i.e. any message from any source would be
heard by everyone tuned in and if more than one source spoke messages could
become garbled.   (f) Ear pieces were issued to some officers in an attempt to
overcome the loud crowd noise which made receipt of signals very difficult,
(g) There were other radio channels open to Sergeant Goddard: VHF to police
Headquarters at Snig Hill, channel 35 to FI Sub-divisional Headquarters at
Hammerton Road and channel 19 used by CID. (h) There was also a set tuned to
Sheffield Wednesday's radio system between its control room and the stewards.
                                  7.
     33.   15 April 1989 was a warm sunny spring Saturday-    (a) The match was
a sell-out, so 54,000 ticket holders were expected.      (b) Others would come
without tickets hoping to acquire them or even to gain access otherwise.    (c)
The following account concentrates, as did the evidence, on the western
approaches and the Liverpool supporters since the disaster occurred at their
end.   (d) They began to arrive in the Hillsborough area quite early in small
numbers.   (e) Some sat about on walls and open spaces.     (f)   Leppings Lane
and its environs comprise a mixed shopping and residential area.      (g) Local
residents saw groups of Liverpool supporters keen to find a public house or
off-licence.   (h) Many were asking for tickets or "spares".   (i) There were a
few touts selling them at inflated wore on, numbers increased.     (j) Requests
for tickets also increased.       (k) Still the prevailing mood was one of
carnival, good humour and expectation.

     34. There were some 74 shops with off-licences in and around Sheffield,
(a) In general, they opened at 8 am.  (a) Liverpool supporters did visit them
but the evidence did not suggest a great amount of alcoholic drink was bought
there.

     35.   Opening time at public houses was in general 11 am.       (a) Some
remained closed all day.  (b) Of the others, some 72 Mostly in the city, were
frequented by local patrons only,  (c) Some 23 public houses, however, served
over a hundred Liverpool supporters each, (d) Another 51 serviced more than
20 each.  (e) Little trouble was reported

     36.   Towards the end of the morning, fans gathered on and around the
bridge near the Leppings Lane entrance.     (a) They seemed reluctant to enter
the ground early.   (b) All turnstiles were open at 12 noon and one or two as
early as 11.30am.    (c) Some 53 police had been deployed to operate outside
the turnstiles and in the Leppings Lane area.      (d) They enquired at randan
whether fans had tickets.   (e) Those who had not were advised to go away;
                            7.

nevertheless, many returned more than once.    (f) Those who had tickets were
guided in the right direction.     (g) The police tried to persuade them to
enter the ground early.     (h) Officers male and female, had been posted
outside each turnstile with the duty of searching entrants for weapons, drink
or drugs.    (i) Once through the turnstile, an entrant was liable to be
searched again by one of a serial of officers positioned just inside.

     37.   At about 12 noon Chief Inspector Creaser asked Superintendent
Murray whether the pens on the west terrace were to be filled one by one
successively, but was told that they should all be available from the start
and the fans should find their own level.


     38.         By 2pm it was apparent to those inside the ground and those
monitoring events in the plice and Club control rooms that the number of
Nottingham fans in their places greatly outnumbered those from Liverpool,
(a) the Kop and the south stand were filling up steadily, but the north and
west stands were half empty.    (b) It was noted about that time that the
turnstile figures showed only 12,000 had entered as against 2 0 , 0 0 0 at the
same time the previous year, (c) one the west terraces, although pens 3 and
  *




                               8.

4 were filling, the wing pens 1,2,6 ana 7 were nearly empty. (d) At 2.15pm a
Tannoy message asked fans in pens 3 and 4 to move forward and make room for
others.

       39.   There had been three special trains from Liverpool in 1988.   (a)
This time, there was only one.      (b) It arrived early, just before 2pm, at
Wadsley Bridge station.    (c) The 350 passengers were met by both mounted and
foot police officers who escorted them in crocodile down Leppings Lane.    (d)
They were orderly and passed through the turnstiles into the ground by about
2 .20 pm without incident.

      40.    By 2.20pm the police Traffic Division reported that the Liverpool
routes were clear, so the majority of Liverpool fans were in the Sheffield
area.      (a) The numbers converging on the Leppings Lane entrance were
increasing rapidly.     (b) Between the perimeter gates and the turnstiles the
crowd became congested.      (c) There was no longer  a separate queue at each
turnstile but a single phalanx filling the whole approach area,    (d) The foot
officers outside the turnstiles were not longer able to search everyone and
had difficulty in searching even selectively.         Mounted officers in and
outside the turnstile area were having difficulty manoeuvring in such a dense
crowd.    (e) The police were best by fans bemused by the ticket and turnstile
labelling asking for directions.      (f) Up to and just after 2.30pm the mood
remained good.

     41.   Superintendent Marshall was on foot amongst the crowd.       (a) He
became anxious about the numbers ccasing down Leppings Lane and spilling out
onto the roadway where buses and cars were moving.  (b) At 2.17 pm he radioed
to control to have motor traffic in Leppings Lane stopped.       (c) This was
eventually done at about 2.30pm.  (d) Op to this time, despite the large mass
outside the turnstiles and the numbers still approaching, there was still no
panic in the crowd; no perception of crisis by      the police.    (e) In the
control room Mr Murray, whose could see Leppings Lane on the video,    adivsed
Mr Duckenfield that they would get everyone in by 3 pm.    (f) Mr Duckenfield
reaffirmed to him the the policy about a delayed kick-off.    (g) It would be
ordered only if there was some major external factor such as fog on the
Pennines or delay on the motorway: not if spectators merely turned up late
even in large numbers.

                                 9.

     42.   In the 20 minutes from 2.30pm to 2.50 pm there were developments
both inside and outside the ground.    (a) In pens 3 and 4 there was a steady
increase in pressure as more fans came through the tunnel to the favoured
area behind the goal.    (b) By 2.50 pm these pens were already full to a
degree which caused serious of the maximum density stated y the Home Office
Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (1986 edn) (the Green Guide) 54 persons per
10 square metres.  (c) In the wing pens 1,2,6 and 7 there was till ample room
and bare patches of contcrete were visible.

     43.   Meanwhile, the crowd grew at the Leppings Lane entrance.        (a) As
more arrived at the back the crush at the front grew worse.      (b) Entry to the
turnstiles became more difficult.       (c) Their efficiency    was impaired and
their rate reduced.   (d) Arrivals at the back exceeded deliveries through the
turnstiles, so the build-up- increased.      (e) The foot officers outside were
unable to function and in danger themselves so they went through the
turnstiles and out again through gate C where they did what they could to
relieve pressure by the tubular barrier.          (f) The mounted officers were
surrounded by the dense mass of people and became ineffective.                 (g)
Superintendent Marshall was in the midst of the turmoil.       (h) He extricated
himself and stood on a parapet of the bridge to get a clear view the menace
came from the massive numbers single-mindedly determined to be in for the
kick-off with time running out.      (i) At the back of the crowd fans were
frustrated by the lack of progress at 3. O'clock approached.       (j) Some tried
to push and force their way forward.     (k) At the front, people were jammed
together and against the turnstile walls.      (1) Some panicked as the pressure
intensified.    (m) Some youngsters and women were fainting and in distress,
(n) They were helped out through the tubular barrier by turnstile G or were
passed over turnstiles elsewhere.   (n) Fans climbed up and over the turnstile
building or on to the dividing fence.         (o) This was to escape the crush
rather than to gain free entry since most of them had tickets.

     44.   2.44 pm Mr Marshall radioed for reinforcements, for the Tannoy to
request the crowd to stop pushing and for a vehicle with loudspeaker
equipment to come and request the same.          (a) At about 2.40pm, radio
communication on channel 25 became defective.      (b) For a period of two or
three minutes the control room lost contact.      (c) A communications officer
came promptly and switched to the standby station.      (d) With the use of a
handset at control, contact was restored.   (e) Despite this hiatus, two of Mr
Marshall's requests were received.    (f) The Tannoy was used but with little
effect.   (g) reinforcements, including mounted officers from Penistone Road,
were sent.    (h) The third request, for a Landrover, was received direct by
its drive PC Buxton who arrived at 2.46 pm and urged the crowd by loudspeaker
not to push.     (i) This was no more effective than the Tannony.      (j) The
mounted oficers besieged near the turnstiles came outside the perimeter
gates.   (k) An attempt was made to shut then against the crowd outside, to
enable the throng inside to be dispersed or at least thinned through the
turnstiles.   (1) The pressure from without, however, opened the gates again,
(m) Mounted officers, now reinforced to greater numbers, formed a cordon
across the elbow of Leppings Lane from the sweep shop to the bridge, against
with the object of reducing pressure inside the gates.          (n) They were
successful in this for some minutes.

                               10.

     45.    Between 2.40pm and 2.45pm the crowd inside and outside the
turnstile approach had swelled to over 5.000.   (a) At the head of the phalanx
conditions had become intolerable.    (b) Those who got through were short of
breath and sweating profusely.   (c) Many complained to police officers on the
concourse inside the turnstiles and asked them in forceful terms to do
something.   (d) Exit gates A and B were being shaken.    (e) It was clear the
crowd could not pass through the turnstiles by 3 pm. (f) Police Constable
Buxton radioed from the Landrover to control asking that kick-off be
postponed.   (g) The suggestion was acknowledged but rejected.

     46. Superintendent Marshall realised the crowd had become unmanageable,
(a) Although loth to do so, since it was contrary to basic police strategy,
he decided to request the exit gates be opened to relieve the pressure.     (b)
Otherwise, he feared fatalities would occur.        (c) Other senior officers
outside the ground agreed.    (d) At 2.47. p m he radioed control to permit the
gates to be opened.   (e) At 2.48pm, whilst Mr Duckenfield was considering the
request, gate C opened to eject a youth who had climbed in with no ticket,
(f) Immediately, fans outside took advantage and about 150 managed to get in
before a mounted office enabled the gate to be closed again.    (g) Mr Marshall
repeated his request.    (h) Still no response from control.    (i) He repeated
it a third time, adding that if the gates were not opened someone was going
to be killed.     (j)   In the control room, Mr Duckenfield had not made a
decision.   (k) Mr Murray asked him "Are you going to open the gates?1'.    (1)
Mr Duckenfield gave the order and Sgt Goddard radioed to Mr Marshall "Open
the gates".   (m) Neither the Club control room nor any police officers inside
the turnstiles were told of this order before or after it was given or of any
action it would require.

     47.   At 2.52 pm, gate C was opened wide.   (a) Fans behind turnstiles A
to G and   from theconcourse beyond came round   to flow through it in large
numbers.

     48. About two minutes later the pressure outside gate A led Sgt Higgins
to radio, despite the gateman's objection, for it to be opened.     (a) If it
was not, he said, "It'll go  and someone will get killed".(b) Permission was
given, but this time reserve     serials were alerted to monitor the inrush
towards the north stand.     (c) Gate B was also briefly opened against the
gateman's wishes and about   200 of those pressed at turnstiles A to G gained
entry to their left.

     49.   The largest entry was through gate C.     (a)In the five minutes it
was open about 2 , 0 0 0 fans passed through it steadily at a fast walk.   (b)
Some may have had         tickets for the stands some had no tickets at all.(c)
The majority had tickets for the terraces.      (d) Of these, some found their
way either right to pens 1 and 2 or left through the dividing wall to 6 and
7.  (But a large proportion headed straight for the tunnel in front of them.

                               11.

     50.   The initial influx through gate C, augmented by entrants via the
turnstiles, came through the tunnel with great momentum.       (a) The 1 in 6
gradient accelerated their progress.     (b) Upon reaching the crowded pens,
some wished to go back but were unable to do so.    (c) The new arrivals found
themselves pushed forward and the pressure became intense.     (d) At 2.54 pm,
shortly after this influx began, the teams came onto the pitch this was
greeted by a surge forward.   (e) Many were now acutely uncomfortable and some
were indistress, (f) The mass seethed about but voluntary movement by any
individual was difficult; hands down could not be raised and some fans found
it hard to breathe.   (g) Still the flow continued through the tunnel causing
further surges forward.   (h) There were shouts for help and for the gates to
be opened to the pitch.    (i) Police officers on the perimeter track did not
immediately react.    (j) In the deafening noise from chanting and shouting
they did not at first recognise the problem.         (K) Realisation   came at
different moments to different officers in different places.

     51.  Gate 3 sprang open under the intense pressure from within.    (a) An
officer quickly closed it.   (b) Shortly afterwards, it sprang again; officers
tried to shut it.    (c) Those seeking to escape were urged and pushed back,
(d) Gate 4 was opened by a policeman who noticed the crushing . (e) People
began to spill out through it and were directed to the wing pens where there
was still ample room.    (f) Meanwhile, gate 4 was closed again and then re­
opened.    (g) At gate 3, a Constable, now alive to the crisis,       followed
strictly his written orders and radioed for permission to open that gate,
(h) Receiving no reply, he took it upon himself to open it.

     52.   Just before 3 pm, the match kicked off. (a) At the same time, gate
C, which had been closed at 2.57 pm, was reopened and a steady       trickle
continued to enter through the tunnel.

     53.  To escape the crush, fans began climbing the radial fences out of
pens 3 and 4 into pens 2 and 5.      (a) Others tried to get over the front
perimeter fence but were at first turned back by police who feared a pitch
invasion.  (b) Near the front, fans, mostly youngsters, were weakened to the
point of collapse and in some instances death but they were held upright by
pressure all round.  (c) further back, most were so preoccupied with the pain
of being pressed against barriers and with breathing problems that they saw
nothing of the game.     (d) But at the rear there were many who, although
cramped, were watching the football unaware of the distress at the front.

     54.   At 3.04 pm, Beardsley for Liverpool struck the crossbar at the Kop
end.   (a) There was a roar from the Liverpool fans and at the same time a
powerful surge forwards in pen 3.      (b) The several surges which occurred
after the influx from gate C carried the pressure down the pens towards the
pitch.   (c) The force became such as to twist and break two spans of a crush
barrier towards the front of pen 3 it was triggered by the surge at 3.04 pm.
(d) It was triggered by the surge at 3.04 pm.     (e)   It occurred after the
influx from gate C so greatly increased the pressure in the pen.     (f) When
the barrier broke those whom it had supported were projected towards the
perimeter fence.    (g) Many fell and the involuntary rush of those behind
pressed them down.    (h) The crushing force was transmitted and dispersed so
that all along the front of pen 3 fans were pressed hard up against the low
wall and the wire mesh of the fence above it.
  *

                               12.

     55.   In pen 4 no barrier broke.    (a) Nevertheless those at the front
were crushed against wall and fence.     (b) Further back, two barriers were
bowed and some individuals succumbed to the pressure around them.

     56.   Surges on terraces are common.  (a) Usually, they go forward, then
recede.   (b) Here, with the weight of numbers, there was no receding.    (c)
The pressure stayed and for those crushed breathless by it, standing or
prone, life was ebbing away.     (d) If no relief came in four minutes there
would be irreversible brain damage; if longer, death.

     57.   In the control room no-one noticed the overcrowding or anything
amiss in pens 3 and 4 until the first fans split out onto the perimeter track
just before kick-off.   (a) Then, the officers in command assumed that there
was an attempted pitch invasion.   (b) They called up reserve serials waiting
in the gymnasium and all availalbe officers elsewhere to go to the pitch,
(c) A request was made to HQ for dog handlers.

     58.    Superintendent Greenwood, the Ground Commander, was by the players'
tunnel at    the kick-off. (a) He noticed fans on the track and went to the
west end behind the goal.     (b) As he approached, he did not think the pens
overcrowded until he was very close and saw those pressed against the fence,
(c) Even then, he thought the situation "retrievable" if those higher up the
pen relieved the pressure.     (d) He climbed on the wall below the fence and
signalled with both hands to those behind to move back.      (e) Other officers
joined him.   (f) It was impossible.    (g) Those fans who would have wished to
comply were powerless to do so.       (h) Behind them, there were still many
unaware of the crisis, watching the game.        (i) The football continued to
joyous shouting and singing round the rest of the ground while those crushed
and trapped slowly expired.

     59. When Mr Greenwood's signals to move back proved fruitless, he tried
to radio   for the match to be stopped.    (a) At first, his message was not
received by control, so he signalled with his arms towards the control box.
(b) Mr Duckenfield sent Mr Murray down from the box to have the match stopped
via the linesman, the agreed emergency drill.    (c) Before he could do so, Mr
Greenwood ran over the pitch to the referee who stopped the game.   (d) it was
5 1/2 minutes past 3.
                               13.

     60.   From 3 o'clock , gates 3 and 4 had been open and remained so.   (a)
At first, fans had walked or staggered out winded and faint.      (b) But the
final surge at 3.04 pm, and the struggle to reach the open gates, caused a
horrendous blockage of bodies.    (c) The dead, the dying and the desperate
became interwoven in the sump at the front of the pens, especially by the
gates.   (d) Those with strengh left clambered over others submerged in the
human heap and tried to climb out over the fence.    (e) They were now helped
by police and other fans who hauled them up and over.     (f) Numbers of fans
were climbing over the radial fences into adjacent pens.     (g) At the back,
many were hauled up into the west stand to relieve the pressure.

     61.  The steps from the sump at gateways 3 and 4 were so congested with
bodies live and dead that each had to be prised from the pile by the police,
(a) Initially, no officer took effective charge.   (b) A number of individual
officers and fans worked frantically to free those trapped but the gateways
were so narrow that only two or three could get at the entwined bodies
Willing hands got in one another's way.    (c) More officers arrived from the
gymnasium and elsewhere in the ground,  (d) Many used their own initiative to
help those laid out on the pitch, to assist in getting others over the
fencing and to comfort the distressed,  (e) But some stood in groups near the
perimeter fence not knowing what to do.       (f) They had been summoned in
response to what was though to be a threat to public order.     (g) What they
found was a horrific scene of carnage and some young officers were shocked
into impotence by what they saw.

     62.    It was truly gruesome.    (a) The victims were blue, cyanotic,
incontinent; their mouths open, vomiting; their eyes staring.   (b) A pile of
deaf bodies lay and grew outside gate 3.    (c) Extending further and further
on to the pitch, the injured were laid down and attempts made to revive them,
(d) More and more walking survivors flooded out on to the pitch as the
players left.  (e) The scene was emotive and chaotic as well as gruesome.

     63.   At about 3.12 pm, Chief Superintendent Nesbit, Commander of the
Traffic Division, arrived on the pitch.     (a) He took charge at gate 3 and
organised a chain of officers to simplify and expedite the extraction of
casualties from the pen.   (b) In the absence of any mechanical means, police
and fans together pulled and worked at the wire mesh with their bare hands
and their feet to breach the fencing.      (c) They succeeded in both pens,
enabling officers to get in and fans to be got out.

     64.   By now, some officers of their own initiative went round from the
pitch to the tunnel where they met other officers from the turnstiles and the
west stand.    (a) Together, they tried to persuade fans at the rear of the
pens to go back through the tunnel.   (b) Casualties were brought out through
the tunnel, and as the pressure in the pens was relieved, officers were able
to get further in and bring out more casualties, deaf and alive.     (c) They
were laid on the ground in the concourse outside the tunnel and attempts were
made to revive them.

     65.  Those spectators from pens 3 and 4 capable of survival mostly came
round of their own accord.  (a) The rest were mostly doomed before they could
be brought out and treated.
                              14.

     6 6 .At about 3.10 pm a request came from the perimeter fence to control
for bolt croppers to cut the wire mesh.     (a) Sergeant Goddard contacted the
police garage close by without success.        (b) At 3.13 pm , PC Bichard
requested Headquarters to call the fire service to bring hydraulic cutting
equipment to the Leppings Lane entrance.

     67.  At the Kop end, Leading Fireman Housley arrived with an emergency
tender and Station Officer Fletcher in another appliance, each with a crew,
(a) The emergency tender came along the roadway by the south stand but owing
to its height was unable to proceed further.  (b) It therefore backed out and
went to the Leppings Lane entrance losing some eitht minutes, (c) Mr Fletcher
and his men ran along behind the south stand carrying cutting equipment and
oxygen cylinders.   (d) When they arrived at the fence, the cutting equipment
was not required as by then the last of the dead and injured were being
removed from the pens.

     6 8 . Of the 95 who died at least 16 and probably 21 came through gate C
after it opened at 2.52 pm.

     69.     A team of pathologist headed by Professor Usher completed post­
mortem examination on all the deceased with 48 hours. (a) They found that 88
of the victims were male and seven female.     (b) Thirty-eight were under 20
years of age, 30 were between 20 and only three were over 50.            (c) In
virtually every case the cause of death was crush asphyxia due to compression
of the chest wall against other bodies or fixed structures so as to prevent
inhalation.   (d) In all but nine cases that was the sole cause.    (e) In one,
pressure on the chest had been so great as to rupture the aorta; in six cases
there were also injuries to the head nick or chest; in the remaining two
cases, natural disease was contributory factor.    (f) In 18 cases bones were
fractured.   (g) Thirteen of those were rib fractures.    (h) However, one was
fractured femur, one a fractured radius and the remaining three involved
fractures of bones or cartilages round the voice box.       (i) These injuries
suggest the victims may have been trodden while on the ground.

     70.   Although the great majority of those who died were in pen 3, at
least five were in pen 4.   (a) Most deaths occurred at the front of the pens
but there were a few fatalities further back.

     71.   In all, some 730 people complained of being injured inside the
ground and 36 outside it.   (a) The largest category of injury was bruising,
especially to the ribs and chest.
                                 15.

     72.    This disaster happened because pens 3 and 4 became grossly
overcroweded.   (a) They were uncomfortably overcrowded by 2.50 pm at least to
a degree which required that they should be closed to further arrivals.    (b)
Even the numbers coming through the turnstiles in the last 10 minutes would
have increased the pressure beyond danger point and there would have been
injuries if not fatalities.    (c) As it was, the influx through gate C after
2.52 pm so increased the pressure in the two pens as to cause fatal crushing.

     73.    The overcrowding up to 2.25 pm was due to a number of factors
     (i)    The layout at the Leppings Lane end.
     (ii)   Lack of fixed capacities for the pens.
    (iii)   Lack of effective monitoring of the terraces.

      74.   Before 1965, the Leppings Lane end consisted entirely of terracing
like the Kop.       (a) In that year, the west stand was built       and theterraces
remaining in      front of it were truncated to their present        depth,front to
back.     (b) As to width, they consisted of a single standing area with no
dividing fences.     (c) During the early 1970's hooliganism and pitch invasions
made it necessary to prevent access to the playing area and the perimeter
fences were therefore erected in 1977.

     75.   Section 1 of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 empowered the
Secretary of    State to designate a sports stadium having, in his       opinion,
accommodation for more than 1 0 , 0 0 0 as a stadium requiring a certificate from
the local authority.    (a) Hillsborough was so designated with effect from 1
January 1979    by SI 1978/1091.     (b) In anticipation of that date, Sheffield
Wednesday instructed Eastwood and Partners, a firm of consulting engineers,
to act on their behalf expecially in their dealings with the local authority.
(c) Dr Eastwood, the principal of the firm, is highly experienced civil and
structural engineer and has advised serveral major football clubs.         (d) He
recommended that a number of additional crush barriers should be added since
those already in place were insufficient to comply with the Green Guide (1976
edition).   (e) That work was approved and carried out during 1979.

     76.   The relevant local authority at the time was the south Yorkshire
County Council.    (a) It set up an Officer Working Party consisting of
representative of the police, the fire service, its own building surveyor's
division and its own legal and administration department.     (b) The Working
Party made inspections and consulted with the Club and Dr Eastwood, (c) A
Safety Certificate was issued on 21 December 1979 for an indefinite period.
(d) It had remained in force ever since and has not been amended.

     77.    Schedule 3 of the certificate sets out the maximum crowd capacity
for various areas in the ground.         (a) The figure for the west terrace is
7,200 and for the north-west terrace 2,9000. (b) These figures were intended
to be in accordance with the Green Guide (1976).      (c) Paragraph 15.4 provided
for a maximum "packing density" of between 54 and 27 persons per 10 square
metres depending on the condition of the terrace.            (d) Dr Eastwood had
calculated 8,000 for the west terrace on the basis of 54 per 10 square
metres.     (e) He thought this a justified starting figure in view of his
improved system of barriers.        (f) However, he reduced it to 7,200 because
there were no gangways on the terrace and he did not think it feasible to
provide any.        (g) So, the total figure for the Leppings Lane terraces was
and is 1 0 ,1 0 0 .

     78.   There was crushing at the Cup semi-final in 1981.   (a) The match
was between Tottenham Hotspur and Wolverhampton Wanderers, (b) The police
debriefing minutes after the incident refer, "to the late arrival of a large
number of spectators who were still waiting to enter the Leppings Lane
enclosure when the match started.        (c) The flash point occurred when
Tottenham scored" (at the Kop end) "after only three minutes.        (d) The
spectators just entering pushed forward to see what was happening and caused
a crush, which resulted in the injuries".
                                17.

     79.   Those being crushed called for the perimeter gates   to be opened
onto the track.(a) There was no immediate reaction but a police Inspector
gave instructions and the gates were then opened.     (b) About 250 came out
onto the track. (c) There were broken arms, legs and ribs        and 38 were
treated either in hospital or by the St John Ambulance Brigade.     (d) It is
clear that the turnstile readings showed the capacity figure of 1 0 ,1 0 0 had
been exceeded by over 400 that the police shut off further access to the
terraces because of crushing, and the police view after the event was that
the capacity figure of 10,100 in the Safety Certificate was too high.      (e)
This latter view was communicated to the Club by the Chief Superintendent
then in command of F Division but it was not pursued.

     80.   After this incident in April 1981 the police requested that the
terrace should be divided into sections.     (a) The object was to improve crowd
control by reducing sideways movement.      (b) This proposal was agreed by the
Club and the Officer Working Party and was approved by the local authority,
(c) Two radial fences were accordingly fitted in November 1981.     (d) They are
the fence now separating pens 2 and 3 and that now separating 5 and 6 . (e)
The result was to divide the whole terrace into three pens.      (f) Access from
the concourse to the middle pen was through the tunnel and to the wing pens
round the sides of the west stand, (g) Dr Eastwood suggested and illustrated
an altered layout which would have provided separate access through separate
banks of turnstiles to the north stand, to each end of the west stand, and to
each of the three pens.   (h) Whilst the main object of this was segregation,
such a layout would have enabled each of those areas to be monitored
numerically via the turnstiles so as to ensure its maximum capacity was not
exceeded.   (i) The plan was not adopted.      (j) The maximum capacity for the
new centre pen was calculated at 2 ,2 0 0 , but no alteration was made to the
Safety Certificate so to limit it nor was there any means mechanically or
counting the numbers going into that pen.

     81.   By 1985, Sheffield Wednesday had been promoted to the         first
Division and was drawing larger crowds.    (a) The improvement of the Leppings
Lane end was raised against by the Club and Dr Eastwood prepared a number of
drawings.   (b) These illustrated various schemes for achieving segregation by
providing more turnstiles in separate banks and divisions of the concourse,
(c) The police wanted further divisions of the terrace itself, again to
improve control and segregation.      (d) There was much discussion of these
schemes which included suggestions of 29 and even 34 turnstiles in total,
(e) in the result, the following alterations were carried out in 1985.

     82.   On the terraces, two more radial fences were fitted.        (a) One
divided the existing central pen into the present pens 3 and 4.      (b) Gates
were fitted at the mouth of the tunnel to enable each of those pens to be
closed off.  (c) The second fence was placed in the new pen 4 so as to create
the narrow pen 5 intended to be a sterile area.    (d) Until those two fences
were added there existed only perimeter gates 1,2,4,5 and 6 .          (e) The
creation of pen 3 required a new gate 3 to be fitted which was done.

     83.   The lines of the new radial fences ran across existing crush
barriers so that wihtout modification those barriers would have run through
the fencing.  (a) The plice considered the barriers would be used by fans as
  a


                               18.

covenient mounting points to scale the new fences, thereby defeating their
object.   (b) They therefore wished spans to be removed from the barriers,
(c) Had their wishes been met in full the result would have been an unimpeded
run in pen 3 from the mouth of the tunnel down the south side of the new
fence to the perimeter. Dr Eastwood dug his heels in against that proposal
which he regarded as dangerous.        (d) He did however agree to some
modification to the middle row of barriers in the newly created pen 3,
chiefly to facilitate access.   (e) Likewise in the new pen 5.   (f) The 1985
modifications to the pens are shown on the plan Appendix 4.

     84.   At the entrance , modification but no increase in number was made
at the turnstiles.   (a) The bank 1 to 16 was divided from A to G by the metal
fence now in place and that division was projected across the concourse
inside the turnstiles in the form of a brick wall.    (b) A personnel gate was
provided for access through that wall but was enlarged to its present size at
the request of the police.    (c) those alterations were made in the interest
of segregation.    (d) The more elaborate divisions which Dr Eastwood had
suggested, giving separate access to each sub-division of the accommodation.,
were not pursued for financial reasons.        (e) In May 1985 the Bradford
disaster occurred.    (f) the south stand at Hillsborough had wooden decking
and the Club realised it would have to undertake expensive remedial works
there.   (g) the cantilever roof of the same stand was also discovered to
require expensive repairs.

     85. Shortly after the new dividing fence and wall had been built at the
Leppings Lane entrance and concourse, the Club, by agreement with Chief
Superintendent Mole, ceased to accommodate home supporters at the Leppings
Lane end.  (a) There was therefore no longer any need for segregation at that
end, but the wall remained.

     86.    In 1985 electronic counting equipment was installed at all
turnstiles,  (a) This conveyed the running count for each bank of turnstiles,
for example A to G, to a television screen in the Club control room where the
figures were displayed.   (b) In 1986 , an electronic eye was installed in
each turnstile booth to catch and record anyone who climbed over the
turnstile.

     87.   In June 1986, the police requested that the crush barrier nearest
to the tunnel at the entrance to pens 3 and 4 should be removed to assist the
flow of fans into the pens.   (a) They found it caused obstruction because it
was in a good viewing position and spectators liked to stand against it in
numbers thereby blocking access by others further into the pens.      (b) The
police also suggested it might hamper effective evacuation through the tunnel
especially in an emergency.   (c) Dr Eastwood considered the pros and cons of
this proposal and accepted the police view.    (d) On 7 August 1986 on site,
(e) Authority was given then and there by Mr Bownes on behalf of the
Sheffield City Council which had taken over responsibility for the Safety
Certificate from South Yorkshire County Council on 1 April 1986.      (f) Two
spans of the barrier were therefore removed, leaving only one span in pen 4
as shown on Appendix 4.
  t




                                 19.

88.   The result of these changes was to divide the terrace into a number of
small areas without providing any computerised or mechanical means of
limiting entry numerically into any one area if all areas were open for
choice.   (a) Before the fences and pan had divided the terrece, the overall
figure of 1 0 , 1 0 0 could be monitored via the turnstiles and in theory the
crowd could even itself out laterally.       (b) Even then, it was not possible
strictly to ensure compliance with Schedule 3 part 1 of the Safety
Certificate which prescribed a maximum of 2,900 for the north-west terrace
and 7,200 for the west terrace.      (c) Paragraph 3 of Schedule 2 of the Safety
Certificate provides:

     "The number of spectators admitted to the Stadium and to the several
areas of spectator accommodation within the Stadium shall not exceed the
figures specified  in Part 1 of of Schedule 3".

      The Club had   to rely upon visual monitoring.

     89.   The situation became worse however with the division of the west
terrace into pens.   (a) Not only were there more and smaller discrete areas
but some were likely to attract more than their appropriate share of the
10,100 total.   (b) It is well recognised that the area behind the goal is
very popular.     (c) Moreover, the position of the tunnel vis-a-vis the
turnstiles A to G, its labelling and the absence of signposts advertising the
wing pens would draw to it those with terrace tickets.   (d) It was therefore
highly likely that pens 3 and 4 would fill to capacity and indeed exceed it
unless preventive steps were taken.   (f) Had Dr Eastwood's plan for separate
turnstile access to separate sections with separate toilet and refreshment
facilities been implemented, total computerised control could have been kept.

     90.   In 1981, when the terrace was divided into three area, Dr Eastwood
gave the Club thefigure of 2,200 capacity for the centre      pen. (a) He based
this on the Green    Guide, making such allowances as he thought right.   (b)No
doubt the numbers could have-been counted in via the turnstiles if only that
pen was in use or if such pens as were in use were filled sequentially, but
not otherwise.

     91.   After the 1985 changes, Dr Eastwood     did not himself give any
figures for the new pens 3 and 4. (a) Someone on his staff however split
figure 2,200 into 1,200 for pen 3 and 1,000 for pen 4.  (b) Those figures did
not even take account of the fact that pen 5 had been carved out of pen 4
which was bound to have a reducing effect on capacity.  (c) Nevertheless, the
figures of 1,200 and 1,000 were put on a drawing emanating from Eastwood and
Partners and the figures have been notionally regarded since as applicable by
the Club and the police.

     92.   The figures for pens 3 and 4 respectively would be 1,036 if the
strength and spacing of the crush barriers had complied with the Green Guide,
(a) But they did not.

     93.  In pen 3, four out of five gaps in the lines of crush barriers do
not conform with paragraph 115 of the     Green Guide(1986).(a) In pen 4, nine
out of ten do not conform.     (b) In     particular,the spans taken out of the
barriers in pen 3 in 1985 left gaps well in excess of the maximum of 1.4
9

                                           20.

    metres prescribed.   (c) One gap was 57% wider than the Green Guide maximum,
    (d) Moreover, that gap was in direct diagonal line from the mouth of the
    tunnel to the barrier which collapsed.

           94.    The removal of barrier 144 was bound to affect capacity.

         95.  They were two further departures from the Green Guide.   (a) If, as
    was the case, the perimeter gates were not regarded as exits, some 40% of
    those in pens 3 and 4 were more than 12 metres from an exit (and there was no
    gangway) contrary to the aim of paragraph 96.    (b) Four out of five of the
    crush barriers in pen 3 and 4 were below the height prescribed in paragraph
    110.   (c) These were the old barriers which had been repaired and plated
    where their bases had corroded and fresh concrete had been applied, raising
    the level of the steps.  (d) In the event, many fans were bent painfully over
    barriers under great pressure.

         96. When all relevant factors regarding the configuration and the Green
    Guide are taken into account, the maximum capacity for pen 3 should have been
    822 and for pen 4, 871.

         97.   No figures at all in respect of pens 3 and 4 were put into the
    Safety Certificate.   (a) Despite all the changes in layout of the fences and
    barriers, the two figures, 2,900 for the north-west terrace and 7,200 for the
    west terrace, have remained as the only maxima with which the Club has to
    comply.

         98.  Section 2(1) of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 provides (so
    far as is relevant):

         "A Safety Certificate shall contain such terms and conditions as the
    local authority consider necessary of expedient to secure reasonalbe safety
    as the stadium when it is in use"

           Section 2(2) provided (so far as is relevant):

         "Without prejudice to sub-section (1) above, a Safety Certificate-
         (a)   shall specify the maximum number of spectators to be admitted to
    the stadium;

            (b)   may specify the maximum number to be admitted to different parts of
    it;

            (c)   shall include terms and conditions-

          (iii)   as to the number, strength and situation of any crush barriers."

         Section 2(2) was repealed by the fire Safety and Safety of Places of
    Sport Act 1987, section 19, which gave power to the Secretary of State to lay
    down, by order, terms and conditions.    (a) No order had yet been made and
    guidance from the Home Office had recommended local authorities to approach
                                21.

their function under section 2 (1 ) in accordance with the criteria in the
repealed section 2(2).     (b) (See Home Office Circular 71/1987 dated 25
November 1987, Annex A, paragraph 6 .)

     99.        When the certificate    was first issued the South Yorshire County
Council went further than simply to     fix the maximum numbers for the whole
Stadium.  (a) They prescribed figures    for each part of the ground not merely
by the four points of the compass but   by specified sections.

    100. Section 8(1) of the 1975 Act requires     the holder of the certificate
before carrying out any proposals to alter or extend the stadium or any of
its installations while a Safety Certificate is in operation to give notice
of those proposals to the local authority.         (a) That obligation is
specifically repeated in Sheffield Wednesday's certificate at Schedule 2
Paragraph 5(2).    (b) The Club complied with the requirement.   (c) Having
received notice of the alterations to the pens and the barriers, the local
authority did not amend the certificate.

     101.   The Safety Certificate contained no maximum figures for individual
pens.    (a) There was therefore no sanction or provision focussing attention
as to the need to limit entry to the pens by numbers.        (b) The layout at
Leppings Lane as it evolved made electronic or mechanical control over
numbers entering individual pens impracticable if all pens were to be
available.    (c) Given an important match and a capacity attendance, fans were
likely to crowd into popular sections like pens 3 and 4.    (d) Those pens were
likely to become overfull well before warning came from the turnstiles that
numbers were approaching the terrace maximum of 10,100.         (e) Control over
numbers and the avoidance of .overcrowding depended entirely on visual
monitoring of the crowd.

    102.   Prior to 15 April 1989 both the interim and Full Reports of the
Popplewell inquiry into the Bradford City Fire Disaster were published and
available to the club and the Police for their consideration.
                                22.

     103.        De facto the police at Hillsborough had accepted responsibility
for control of the pens at the Leppings Lane end.

    104.   At League matches at Hillsborough, the police practice was to
decide in advance how may and which pens would ,be used.       (a) I f a modest
crowd was anticipated only one or two pens might be needed.          (b) It was
better to confine the fans to limited spaces (a) to prevent them running
about and (b) to reduce the number of police required.     (c) The practice was
then to fill the pens one by one.   (d) This involved making a judgement as to
when a pen was full.   (e) There would then be a police decision to close that
pen and fill another.     (f) It was regarded as impractical and unsafe for
police officers (just like stewards) to go onto the Leppings Lane terraces
wit away supports.   (g) This meant that monitoring the numbers in any pen had
to be done from vantage points outside it.      (h) Here, the police were much
better placed than the stewards.    (i) There was a good view from the control
box and the television screens there.        (j) there were officers on the
perimeter track.   (k) No stewards were placed there because having both

police and stewards interfered with the viewing.   (1) There were also police
in the west stand who could look down on the pens,  (m) Intelligence from all

these sources could give the police a good appreciation of the state of the
terraces.  (n) When it was necessary to shut off access to the pens officers
on the concourse could be informed by radio and could take the necessary
steps.

    105.   At cup semi-finals, a different approach was adopted.     (a) All the
pens were opened from the start and the policy was "to let the fans find
their own level".   (b) What it meant was that no specific direction was given
to fans entering through the turnstiles,.     (c) They were free to go wherever
they wished on the terraces.    (d) If they became uncomfortable or wished for
any other    reason to move their position, then theoretically they could move
elsewhere.     (e) In this way it was hoped       thatthe fans on the terraces would
level themselves out and that distribution would be achieved without police
intervention.    (f) On these occasions, the gates at the top of the radial
fences were locked in the open position.

    106.   The position and size of the gates was such that once a substantial
number of    spectators were in, the gates      wereunnoticeable and inaccessible
especially to those towards the front who might have most need of them.

    107.   The effect of this policy was that whereas at League matches the
police had to make a positive decision when to close one pen and open
another, at semi-finals, where overcrowding was much more likely, the police
left it to the fans themselves to "find their own level".    (a) Effectively,
they were left to monitor their own comfort and safety so as to avoid
overcrowding.   (b) The police would only intervene when there was some overt
sign that an area was "full".

              108.               Over the years, spectators on terraces have come to acce
conditions which are often very uncomfortable and not infrequently downright
dangerous.   (a) They are subjected to buffeting and squeezing to get in and
out of the terraces.   (b) They are packed tightly and exposed to surging and
swaying during the match, (c) They put up with these conditions because they
are devoted to the game and because there is little they can do about the.
(d) They believe the discomfort will pass and nothing very untoward will
happen.   (e) Usually that is the case and they are reassured by it. (f) Most
clubs have not, until very recently, consulted their supporters as to their
grievances or suggestions,   (g) the practice has been to pack them in on the
assumption that if they are prepared to put up with it the conditions must be
tolerable.   (h) Although crowd figures at football grounds have been reduced
in recent years, this has been due principally to the increased proportion of
seating as against standing accommodation,   (i) Terraces have still been
packed.

    109. It is said that many fans enjoy these features of terrace viewing.
(a) Clearly close proximity, shared discomfort, weathering sways and surges
together and chanting the same songs and slogans en masse do evoke good
humour and have produced a spirit or cult of the terraces which many enjoy.
(b) Equally there are many who simply endure these things for the football,
for a cheap ticket or indeed for the chance of getting in at all. (c) And
before Hillsborough most fans on the terraces, even if they enjoy the hurly-
burly, had not realised the narrow margin of safety between an uncomfortable
crush and a fatal one.

    110. The green Guide sought to improve safety and comfort by laying down
criteria for maximum capacity, ie defining what is "full".  (a) The standard
set was 54 persons per 10 square metres in favourable conditions but fewer,
down to 27, in less favourable conditions the figures considered appropriate
in pens 3 and 4 at Hillsborough were too high.

    111. Those supposed to be monitoring pens visually had and have little
idea of what 54 persons per 10 square metres look like.  (a) Mr Duckenfield's
opinion was that when a pen was full to capacity, the spectators would be
"shoulder to shoulder and cheste to back.  (b) It is much more dense than the
Green Guide maximum.

    112. The maximum density set out in the Green Guide left considerably
more room than those monitoring the terraces would have left before declaring
an area "full".

    113. The tendency has been to allow the pens to fill until the fans
complain or show signs of discomfort.   (a) If the density at the front
appeared less than at the back, the Tannoy would invite the fans to move
forward to make room for more.  (b) There have been frequent occasions when
the packing on terraces, not only at Hillsborough, has caused discomfort and
sometimes, for brief periods, fear.   (c) Usually the surge recedes, the sway
returns, the pressure eases and the incident passes unrecorded.

sometimes, for brief periods, fear.   (c) Usually the surge recedes, the sway
returns, the pressure eases and the incident passes unrecorded.

                                 24.

    114.   After the crushing at the 1981 semi-final, Hillsborough was not
chosen again by the FA until 1987.    (a) The central pens were uncomfortably
overcrowded on that occasion and again at the 1988 Cup semi-final, although
entry to the tunnel was blocked off by police shortly before kick-off in 1988
because the pens were deemed to be "full".

    115.    Over the last few years, hooliganism at and associated with
football matches has strongly influenced the strategy of the police.   (a) In
their plans and management they have concentrated on averting or containing
threats to public order.   (b) It has led to an imbalance between the need to
quell a minority of troublmakers and theneed to       secure the safety and
comfort of the majority.    (c) In the police Operational Order, the emphasis
was upon prevention of disorder and in particular prevention of access to the
field of play.    (d) There was no express requirement that officers on the
perimeter track or in the west stand should keep watch for any possible
overcrowding on the terraces.

    116.   Although the police had accepted de facto responsibility for
monitoring the pens, their policy on the day was to leave fans to "find their
own level" and to concentrate their own attention on possible disorder.   (a)
Whilst in theory thepolice would intervene       if a pen became "full", in
practice they permitted the test of fullness to be what the fans would
tolerate.

    117. By 2.52 pm when gate C was opened, pens 3 and 4 were over-full even
by this test. (a) Many were uncomfortable.

    118.  The decision to open gate C. and subsequently gates A and B too,
was forced on to the police by the crowd conditions which developed outside
the turnstiles.   (a) The crush was so servere that injuries were being
suffered and deaths were feared unless the pressure could be swiftly
relieved.

    119.   Penistone Road and at many other grounds, turnstiles are in a
straight line, adequately spaced and with a sufficient waiting area for
queues to form.    (a) Not so at Leppings Lane.    (b) The building line, the
bridge over the don and the bend in the road, left a wedge-shaped approach to
perimeter gates set in an arc, and across a short forecourt, to turnstiles
also set in an arc.    (c) The pairs of turnstiles were close together and the
forecourt, especially as divided by the metal fence, provided little space
for a waiting crowd.

    120. The decision    to fill the whole of the north stand from the Leppings
Lane end required the    23 turnstiles there to admit 24,256 spectators.     Of
those, the seven turnstiles (A to G) serving the terraces had to admit 10,100
ie an average of just under 1,450 through each turnstile.            (a) At the
Penistone Road end, 29,800 were served by 60 turnstiles, or just under 500
per turnstile.




                                  25.
    121.   The Green Guide recognises (paragraph 47) that the rate at which
spectators can pass through turnstiles depends on a variety of local
circumstances but states "in general based on observation and experience, it
is unlikely that the maximum notional rate per turnstile would exceed 750 per
hour".   (a) Since the semi-final was an all ticket match requiring no cash
transactions, the Club considered that a higher rate of about 1,000 per hour
per turnstile could be expected.   (b) Even at this higher rate which assumes
the turnstiles working at maximum efficiency non-stop, it would have taken
nearly 1 1/2 hours to admit all those with terrace tickets.    (c) At 750 per
hour, it would have taken nearly two hours.

    122.    The Green Guide provides (paragraph 44):-

    "Turnstiles should be of such numbers as to admit spectators at a rate
whereby no unduly large crowds are kept waiting for admission".

    123.   The Office Working Party had discussed in 1985 the need , and Dr
Eastwood's various schemes, for improvement of the turnstile arrangements,
(a) The mathematics are elementary.   (b) Success depended on the spectators
arriving at a steady rate from an early hour and upon the maximum turnstile
rate being maintained.   (c) In fact neither of these requirements, which are
inter-linked, was fulfilled.

    124.  Between 2.30 pm   and 2.40 pm the crowd waiting for the turnstiles
swelled to over 5,000 and became unmanageable.

    125.  The ticket simply requested its holder "to take up [his] position
15 minutes before kick-off".   (a) There was certainly a large concentration
of Liverpool fans arriving at about 2.30pm and after.

     126.   Its unlikely that traffic conditions had any significant effect on
t his.

                                  26.

    127.   At the turnstiles the crisis developed because this very large
crowd became packed into a confined turnstile area and its very density
hampered its passage through the turnstiles.  (a) In the crush most people
had no control over their movements at all.

    128.  The labelling of the turnstiles in the order A,C,B was confusing,
(a) A fan with a B ticket who went by mistake to the wrong side of the metal
fence would have had the greatest difficulty in getting back and round to the
correct side.    (b) The colour coding was inefficient because the coloured
wooden panels were affixed to the turnstile walls so low that they were not
easily visible through a crowd,  (c) The information on the ticket printed by
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club was misleading and its layout unhelpful.

    129.    The result was that in the early stages, police officers were
pestered by fans for help as to where they should go.        (a) Later, as the
crowd became more dense, fans were presenting their tickets at the wrong
turnstiles.      (b) There were also Liverpool supporters who had acquired
tickets for the Kop end but sought entry at Leppings Lane.      (c) They caused
delays in the turnstile operation when entry was refused and after a while
the police instructed the operators to let them through.         (d) There was
further delay because the crush made it difficult for fans to get into the
turnstile entrances.     (e) Once there, the pressure from behind was such as,
on occasions, to jam them in the doorway or against the paddle of the
turnstile.    (g) Finally, there were fans without tickets who sought to enter
by offering payment, by seeking to go over or under the paddle or by sliding
through with a ticket holder.      (h) All of these activities slowed down the
turnstile rate which     at the worst period was only about 600 per hour per
turnstile.     (i) the waiting crowd therefore expanded and as the minutes
passed frustration grew.    (j) Visitors who had paid for tickets and travelled
from afar realised they were making little forward progress.    (k) Frustration
increased pressure and induced panic at the front.     (1) Determination to get
into the match was intensified by determination to get out of the crush.

    130.  I has become a fact of football life that fans do turn up at all­
ticket matches without tickets.   (a) It is not possible to give an accurate
figure or even a reliable estimate of the number without tickets on 15 April.

    131.  Inside the ground the Liverpool end was at a late stage well     below
capacity save for pens 3 and 4.     (a) The north stand still had many     empty
seats and the wing pens were sparse.    (b) The match being a sell-out,    there
were clearly many ticket holders to come and they could account for the    large
crowd still outside the turnstiles.

    132. No great number entered without tickets.       (a) The number who passed
through turnstiles A to G plus those who entered through gate C roughly
equalled the terrace capacity figure of 1 0 , 1 0 0 0 for which tickets had been
sold.   (b) The Club's record showed 7,038 passed through turnstiles A to G.
(c) However, the counting mechanise on turnstile G was defective, so the HSE
did a study using the video fils and projecting figures from the other
turnstiles.   (d) This gave an assessment of 7,644 passing through A to G.
(e) Again, using the video, the HSE assessed the number who entered the
ground whilst gate C was open at 2,240 with a maximum of 2,480.
                                  27.

 (f) Accordingly, the HSE's best estimate of the total entering through gate
C and turnstiles A to G was 9,734 with a maximum of 10,124.     (g) There was
not a very significant body of ticketless fans in the crowd which built up.

    133.  The large concentration at Leppings Lane from 2.30pm to 2.50pm did
not arrive as a result of any concerted plan.

    134.   The Operational order for 15 April followed closely that laid down
for the 1988 semi-final.   (a) The emphasis was on maintaining law and order.
(b) Side roads were to be blocked off to prevent damage in residential areas.
(c) Pairs of officers were to patrol streets to prevent "clash of rival
supporters".       (d) Officers   were to watch public houses,     shops  and
supermarkets "where looting could take place".   (e) Outside the turnstiles,
officers were to ensure supporters entering did not have banners, weapons,
missiles or alcohol.

    135.   the only written provision aimed at effecting controlled entry to
the turnstiles was on enjoining officers "to ensure ordely queues are formed
".   (a) There was no provision for controlling the entry of the crowd into
the turnstile area.

    136.   As long ago as 1924, the Departmenal Committee on Crowds stated:-

    "The control of crowds should begin at a point some considerable distance
from the entrance to the ground.     (a) The advantages of an arrangement of
this kind are in preventing congestion at the entrances to grounds."

    This was particularly important at Leppings Lane where the turnstile area
was so small and awkwardly laid out.      (a) If a large crowd was permitted
uncontrolled entry through the perimeter gates, the forming of queues at the
turnstiles and control by officer, whether on foot or mounted, would become
impracticable.    (b) Those waiting at the turnstiles would become a single
growing mass.   (c) Once that happened, it would be difficult to retrieve the
situation.

    137. Whether steps were taken and what steps to avoid this happening was
left to oral briefing and ad hoc instructions on the day.

    138. The only two previous occasions when the Leppings Lane terraces had
been used to fill the whole of the north and west sides of the ground were at
the two semi-finals, in 1987 and 1988.     (a) In 1987, the match was on a
Sunday, scheduled for 12 noon, and kick-off was postponed for quarter of an
hour because of late arrivals.

    139.   As to 1988, on the day, the police in Leppings Lane conducted an
efficient filtering exercise designed to keep away those without tickets and
control the flow of fans towards the ground.

    140.   Whilst the policy may have been no different, in practice the
policing in 1988 was more efficient and was not put to the same test and
strain as a year later.     (a) There was not so large a swell in numbers
approaching the ground from 2.30pm to 2.50pm as in 1989. (b) Nevertheless,
there had been warning signs in 1988.
  0


                                 28.

    141.    The tendency of Liverpool supporters to arrive late was not
unknown.   (a) A general recent tendency topostpone arrival was noted by the
Sheffield City Council Advisory Group, with police present, on 23 March 1988.
(b) The minute reads

    "As far as the turnstile questions was concerned, a pattern has developed
of people arriving some 15 minutes before the start of the game hoping to
gain admission, (a) This trend may be due to the banning of alcohol at sports
grounds which could lead to people going elsewhere for refreshment prior to
the football match.      (b) As the available turnstiles operated quite
effectively for the majority of the time, and that the late arrival problem
could perhaps only be dealt with by education of the spectators" (sic).

    142.   In so far as Liverpool supporters' behaviour at away matches may
have been indicative of what police problems might arise on 15 April, most of
the facts should have been available at the planning stage.

    143.   The FA had   also laid down in a   memorandum issued in the 1985/6
season measurers to     be adopted by the     away club which included the
following:-

    "It is the responsibility of the away club to advise the home club of the
recent behaviour of their supporters at away matches, irrespective or whether
the behaviour had resulted in disciplinary action by the Football Association
or not".


"Information of this kind was not passed to the Sheffield Wednesday Club nor
did it play any part in the south Yorkshire Police plans.

    144.  2.30pm when Mr Murray told Mr Duckenfield they would "get them all
in by 3 o'clock" he seems not to have appreciated that in addition to those
visible at the turnstiles there were may more still to come. (a) Mr Marshall
outside the turnstiles was not told and could not otherwise have known that
there were still many Liverpool ticket holders to arrive.

    145.   Mr Marshall was in charge of the serials outside the perimeter
gates in the Leppings Lane area and in the roads beyond.    (a) In practice he
operated inside and just outside the turnstile area.  (b) Mr Greenwood's area
as Ground Commander extended from the pitch to the perimeter gates.     (c) He
in fact stationed himself near the players' tunnel.        (d) He was wholly
unaware of the growing problems at the turnstiles and was in no position to
exercise control over his officers who were under pressure there.   (e) No-one
in the control room though to tell him.

    146.   In the result, the large concentration of arrivals from 2.30pm to
2.40pm pressed unrestrained into the turnstile area through the perimeter
gates which were fully open.     (a) When the area was full, later arrivals
swelled the crowd out to the forecourt and even into the road.   (b) The foot
officers at the turnstiles became trapped and endangered and retired through
the turnstiles.    (c) The mounted officers could not operate amidst such a
dense crowd in a confined space.    (d) They came out of the turnstile area,
(e) There were then the belated attempts to close the perimeter gates and
                                  29.

prevent more fans joining the mass until it had a chance to diminish through
the turnstiles; still later the attempt to put a cordon of horses across the
entrances.

     147. Despite knowledge of the difficult layout, the very large number of
fans to be got through so few turnstiles and the tendency of fans to arrive
in the last half hour, no contingency plans were made to avoid a crush such
as occurred.   (a) If some of the perimeter gates had been closed and cordons
of mounted and foot officers had been placed a little distance from those
gates, the flow of fans into the turnstile area could have been controlled
before that area became engulfed.   (b) It was the crush itself which produced
the frustration and the panic.     (c) Earlier control of entry would have
prevented the crush and maintained the good mood which had prevailed until
2 .30pm.

    148.   It should moreover have been obvious by 2.40pm, if not earlier,
that a large part of the crowd could not be admitted until well after 3.pm.
(a) had a decision to postpone kick-off been made and announced much of the
frustration and with it the impetus crushing the crowd would have been
reduced.   (b) A combination of controlled filtering and a postponed kick-off
would probably have obviated the need to open the gates.

    149.   At various stages in his evidence, Mr Duckenfield gave three
accounts of why he thought it too late to postpone kick-off.    (a) Once it was
that one of the teams had already come onto the pitch.     (b) Then it was that
a group of photographers at the tunnel had wrongly led him to think that the
teams were coming our.   (c) Finally, he did not know why he thought the teams
were coming out.  (d) They did not in fact come onto the pitch until 2.54.pm,
two minutes after gate C was opened.     (e) Police Constable Buxton had asked
for a postponement of kick-off before were others of like mind) to think of
postponing the kick-off.    (f) The need should have been clear in the control
room.

    150.   Mr Duckenfield applied inflexibly the policy he had discussed with
Mr Murray.   (a) Kick-off would not be postponed unless there were some major
cause for delayed arrivals eg a jam on the motorway or fog.    (b) faced with a
situation which was becoming dangerous, crowd safety should have been his
paramount consideration.   (c) Kick-off should have been delayed.

     151.    The layout of the turnstiles and the number they were required to
serve left no margin of safety against an uneven flow of fans.      (a) Because
police strategy in advance and on the day did not cater for it the arrival of
a   large number of supporters between 2.30pm and 2.40pm created an
unmanageable crush.        (b) Having lost control and rejected   the option of
postponing kick-off,the police were faced with a serious danger of deaths    or
injuries.     (c) They were left therefore with no alternative but to open the
gates.    (d) Superintendent Marshall was right at      that stage toask for it and
Mr Duckenfield was       right to agree. (e) But the possible     effects of so
dramatic a step required other action.
                                  30.

    152.  The decision to order the opening of the gates was not accompanied
or followed by any other order to deal with the consequences.     (a) When gate
C was opened, a steady stream of about 2,000 fans poured through it over some
five minutes.   (b) Clearly they were going to go into the ground somewhere
and unless they were diverted their likeliest route was through the tunnel,
(c) No warning was issued from the control room that the gate was to be
opened.  (d) Serials on the concourse were not alerted.   (e) Neither the Club
control room not the Chief Steward at the Leppings Lane end was warned.     (f)
Not even Mr Greenwood, the Ground Commander, was informed.    (From 2.47pm when
Mr Marshall made his first request until 2.52. pm when Mr Duckenfield acceded
to it, there were five minutes in which orders could have been give as to how
the influx was to be absorbed.     (g) It was not done.     (h) Mr Duckenfield
conceded he had erred in this regard, (i) He said he did not consider where
the people would go when the gate opened.   (j) Even after it opened, when he
could see the influx on the television screen, no order was given to steer
the fans to the wing pens.  (k) Mr Duckenfield said it did not cross his mind
to detail officers on the concourse to shut off the tunnel.           (1) Those
officers could not have known from their position how full pens 3 and 4 were,
(m) That was a matter for the control room to monitor from its own
observations and using intelligence from around the ground.

    153. Since pens 3 and 4 were full by 2.50pm, the tunnel should have been
closed off where gate C was to be opened or not.     (a) The exercise was a
simple one and had been carried out in 1988.  (a) All that was necessary was
for a few officers to act as a cordon at the entrance to the tunnel and
divert fans elsewhere.   (b) Unfortunately, the 1988 closure seems to have
been unknown to the senior officers on duty at the time.     (c) It did not
figure in the debriefing note.    (d) It therefore had no influence on the
planning for 1989.

    154.  Planning apart, however, it should have been clear in the control
room where there was a view of the pens and of the crowd at the turnstiles
that the tunnel had to be closed.      (a) If orders had been given to that
effect when gate C was opened, the fans could have been directed to the empty
areas of the wings and this disaster could still have been avoided.       (b)
Failure to give that order was a blunder of the first magnitude.

     155.    Significantly, when permission was given to open gate A, Mr
Duckenfield did order serials to go to that part of the concourse to monitor
the influx towards the north stand.    (a) He did this because he feared that
if fans went to the north stand without tickets, they would not get seats
and, there being no perimeter fences at the north side, they might invade the
pitch.    (b) This illustrates again the preoccupation with avoiding pitch
invasion as against safety and the risks of overcrowding.    (c) Because those
entering through gate C could not get onto the pitch, it was not though
necessary to alert officers to monitor them.         (d) the possibility of
overcrowding simply was not considered.

    156.   Because of the removal of barrier 144 in 1986 the influx of fans
after 2.52pm met no retarding structure as it came into pen 3.        (a) The
pressure created was free to push fans straight down by the radial fence to
the lowest line of barriers.  (b) The pressure diagonally from the tunnel
mouth down to barrier number 124a which collapsed was unbroken by any
intervening barrier.   (c) 124a was also vulnerable to pressure straight down
the pen through the gap in the barrier above it created in 1985.
                                     32.

    157.  The effective cause of the collapse     of barriers    124a was the
excessive and unanticipated pressure to which     the barrier    was exposed.

    158.  As the stream from gate C flowed through the tunnel, the officers
in the control room had a direct view of them from an elevated position
through their window.   (a) Although they had no field-glasses, there was the
zoom facility on the TV camera.    (b) The radio was by then working again and
although reception was difficult due to crowd noise and possibly excessive
air traffic on channel 25, attempts could have been made to alert officers on
the perimeter track to watch for overcrowding and report their observations
(c) In the event, pens 3 and 4 became more and more crowded, surges took
place, fans were showing and signalling distress.    (d) None of this was seen
or recognised in the control room.

    159.   The 20 officers detailed to the perimeter track were distributed
round the pitch so that some five officers were at the west end.       (Their
written instructions made no reference to the avoidance or detection of
overcrowding.   (a) The same applied to the officers in the west stand.   (b)
Mr Greenwood oral briefings also contained no mention of monitoring the pens
for overcrowding.

    160.   The Operational Order for 1988 had instrcted officers to forbid
anyone "access to the track from the terraces without theconsent of a senior
officer (except to receive medical attention)".     (a) At the end of the 1988
semi-final, there was a      minor pitch invasion.     (b)  Accordingly, that
prohibition was emphasised in the 1989 Operational Order by being put into
capital letters.    (c) The combination of no instructions as to overcrowding
and a strong prohibition on opening the gates was likely to make police
recognition of crushing slow and their response reluctant.     (d) The growing
pressure and congestion between 2.50pm and 2.59 pm went unheeded or certainly
unremedied.   (e) Even when officers recognised there was a problem, the rule
required consent of a senior officers before a gate could be opened.

    161. "Senior officer" meant an officer of Inspector rank or higher.  (a)
The Inspector in charge of the 20 officers on the track was Mr Darling.  (b)
He stationed himself by the players' tunnel, the most central position for
supervising his men.
    162. Gates 3 and 4, having been opened, were shut again before they were
finally opened and at first those seeking to climb out over the fence were
pushed back.

    163.   There was a period during which the failure to recognise       the
problem and the inhibition against tackling it caused vital time to be lost.

    164. Even when realisation of the problem came to officers on the track,
it was some minutes before it reached the control room.    (a) When spectators
first appeared on the track, the immediate assumption in the control room was
that a pitch invasion was threatened.    (b) Those on the track made not move
towards the pitch.   (c) Until Mr Murray radioed for a fleet of ambulances,
about 3.06pm, Mr Duckenfield continued to treat the incident as a threat to
                                 33.

the pitch and to public order.      (d) The message calling up all available
officers mentioned a pitch invasion.   (f) Operation Support was initiated and
dog handlers were requested.  (g) Until Chief Superintendent Nesbit arrived,
there was no effective leadership either from control or on the pitch to
harness and organise rescue efforts.    (h) No orders were given for officers
to enter te tunnel and relieve pressure.   (i) Some officers did this on their
own initiative.   (j) apart from the tannoy request to clear the pitch, no
attempt was made to clear and mark off a casualty area where first-aid could
be given without hindrance by fans and photographers milling about between
the bodies.  (k) There was no co-ordination of the early provision of first-
aid or of stretcher parties or of the recsue effort through gates 3 and 4.
(1) Norequest for help was broadcast to doctors and nurses in the crowd until
about 3.29pm when it was too late.  (m) There was little that could have been
achieved in most cases however soon doctors had been summoned, but there were
marginal cases where earlier attention might have made a difference.

    165.   The plight of thosebehind the fencing and        the existence of
injuries were known to officers at the scene from 3pm.      (a) But the Major
disaster Plan was not started until 3.06pm at earliest when the ambulance
service was called.   (b) No request for cutting gear or for the fire brigade
was made until 3.13pm.

    166.   Many fans who escaped onto the pitch alive were in a state of
collapse or    close to it.  (a) Most of those who retained their strength
strove magnificently to assist the victims.  (b) They helped pull them clear;
they helped with first-aid; they helped carry the improvised stretchers.

    167.    The perimeter gates in the pens were not designed as exits.   (a)
They were intended to afford access by the police to cope with any local
disorder or with an emergency.     (b) The kind of emergency contemplated was
not massive      crushing but, for example, the collapse or illness    or an
individual.

    168.  The need to provide for speedy and large scale evacuation for the
front of the pens to the pitch was not anticipated.

    169.   Gate 3 was .82 metres in width; gate 4 was .79 metres in width,
(a) There were therefore clear departures from the Green Guide standard.

    170.  Even if the width of gates 3 and 4 had complied with the    present
Green Guide    standard, they would have been wholly inadequate to    relieve
pressure and release spectators swiftly on 15 April.

    171.   Once the crush occurred on    15 April gates 3 and 4 were wholly
inadequate for rescue purposes.




                                                                                 I
                                34.

    172.    The immediate cause of the gross overcrowding and hence the
disaster was the failure, when gate C was opened, to cut off access to the
central pens which were already overfull.

    173.  They were already overfull because not safe maximum capacities had
been laid down, no attempt was made to control entry to individual pens
numerically and there was no effective visual monitoring of crowd density.

    174.    The lack of vigilant monitoring caused a sluggish reaction and
response when the crush occurred.   (The small size and number of gates to the
track retarded rescue efforts.    (a) So, in the initial stages, did lack of
leadership.
                                 35.

    175.    The need to open gate C was due to dangerous congestion at the
turnstiles.    (a) That occurred because, as both Club and police should have
realised, the turnstile area could not easily cope with the large demanded of
it unless they arrived steadily over a lengthy period.     (b) The Operational
Order and police tactics on the day failed      to provide for controlling a
concentrated arrival of large        numbers     shouldthat occur in a short period,
(c) That it might so occur was foreseeable and it did.       (d)    The club's
confused and inadequate signs and ticketing aggravated the problem.

    176.   The Operational Order for 1989 left much unsaid.    (a) Apart from
the lack of any provision for late or congested arrivals, or any provision
for the avoidance of overcrowding on the terraces, there was a number of
other omissions.    (b)   For example, there was no specific deployment of
officers to man the perimeter gates.      (c)  TheOrder did not detail     the
duties of the mounted officers deployed at     theLeppings Lane entrance, who
included Liverpool officers to assist in marshalling their own fans.   (d) The
duties of Superintendents Mr Greenwood and Mr Marshall) were not defined so
as to achieve clarity and efficiency the provision requiring mobile (tango)
patrols to assist the emergency services was omitted from the text.

    177.  The 1988 Order was never substantially reviewed save to reduce the
number of officers deployed in shopping areas and to emphasise in capital
letters the embargo on fans having access to the pitch.    (a)  Satisfaction
with the 1988 event led to complacency.      (b) That some thought the pens
overfull in 1988 and that the tunnel was closed off on that occasion did not
figure in or in fluencethe plan for 1989.

    178.   He was not informed of the crushing incident in 1981 nor did he
make inquiries which would have revealed      it. (a) He   did not know the
arrangement as between club and police for monitoring the Leppings Lane
terraces.   (b) He did not visit and tour the ground before approving the
Operational Order.   (c) Although he attended a match on 2 April, there was
only a small crowd present and he left control of          the game to the
superintendents.

    179.  The South Yorkshire Policing on 15 April broke down.    (a) The main
reason for the disaster was the failure of police control.

    180.  The senior officers in command handling of problems on the day did
not show the qualities of leadership to be expected of their rank.

    181.    Mr Duckenfield leant heavily on Mr Murray's experience.       (a)
Between them the misjudged the built-up at the turnstiles and did little
about it until they received Mr Marshall's request to open the gate.      (b)
They did not, for example, check the turnstile figures available from club
control or check with Tango units as to the numbers still to come.   (c) They
did not alert Mr Greenwood to the situation at the fringe of his area of
command.   (d) They gave no instructions as to the management of the crowd at
Leppings Lane.   (e) Inflexibly they declined to postpone kick-off.

    182.  When Mr Marshall's request came, Mr Duckenfields capacity to take
decisions and give orders seemed to collapse.      (a) Having sanctioned, at
last, the opening of the gates, he failed to give necessary consequentail
                                37.

orders or to exert any control when the disaster occurred.           (b) He
misinterpreted the emergence of fans from pens 3 and 4.     (c) When he was
unsure of the problem, he sent others down to "assess the situation" rather
than descend to see for himself. (d) He gave no information to the crowd.
                                  38.

    183.    There are a number of respects in which     failure   by the Club
contributed to this disaster.    (a) They were responsible as occupiers and
invitors for the layout and structure of the ground.    (b) The Leppings Lane
end was unsatisfactory and ill-suited to admit the      numbers invited, for
reasons already spelt out.    (c) The club was aware of these problems and
discussed solving them in various ways between 1981 and 1986.      (d) In the
result, there remained the same number of turnstiles, and the same problems
outside and inside them.   (e) The plan for this semi-final, involving as it
did the loss of 12 turnstiles for the north stand and large numbers to be fed
in from Leppings Lane, was one agree between the Club and the police.     (f)
the club knew best what rate of admission the tunstiles could manage and
ought to have alerted the police to the risks of the turnstiles being
swamped.

    184.  The laterations inside the turnstiles and on the terraces clearly
affected capacity,  but no specific allowance was made for the.   (a) In that
respect.   (b) The Club should have taken a more positive approach.       (c)
Either a scheme such as one of those Dr Eastwood put forward should have been
adopted giving more turnstiles and total separation of areas or at they very
least the capacity of the new pens and of the terraces as a whole should have
been treated more cautiously.    (d) The police view in 1981 that 10,100 was
too high a figure was known to the Club.   (e) Yet, dispite that and the sub­
division into pens, the figure remained.

    185. The Clubs officials ought to have alerted the police to the grossly
uneven distribution of fans on the terraces.   (a) The Club operated and read
the closed circuit television and the computer totaliser.         (b) Liaison
between Club and police on the day failed to alert the latter to the number
of Liverpool supporters still to come.   (c) The onus here was on the Club as
well as on the police.

    186.   The removal of barrier 144 was the responsibility of the Club

    187.   Likewise, the breaches of the Green Guide were matters which the
Club should have appreciated and remedied.

    188.   The poor signposting on the concourse tended to produced uner-
filling of the wing pens and over-filling of pens 3 and 4.           (a) Poor
signposting outside the turnstiles and the unhelpful format of the tickets
also led to confusion aggravating the build-up in the turnstiles area.

      NOTICE OF DISCONTINUANCE UNDER ORDER 21 RULE 2


TAKE NOTICE t h a t :


1.     The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police,

the First Defendant, wholly discontinues (and if

necessary withdraws) the action for indemnity and

contribution and the claim made by him herein against
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC, the Second

Defendant and Eastwood & Partners Consulting

Engineers, the Fourth Defendant.


2.   This Notice has no application to any action or

claim other than that one in the particular case of

Joan Chapman.


3.   The grounds of this Notice are that:



     (i)    The proper conduct of the action by the

            First Defendant is prevented by

            concurrent procedures on the same facts

            by others namely:


            (a) the preparation of a report    to the

                 Director of Public Prosecutions by

                 Mr. Mervyn Jones, Assistant Chief

                 Constable of West Midlands Police;


            (b) the preparation of evidence    for the

                 Inquest by H.M. Coroner for South

                 Yorkshire;


            (c) the investigation by Police

                 Complaints Authority of complaints

                 made to it.


     (ii)   Until the outcome of the proceedings in

            (i) is known witnesses are unwilling to

            co-operate with the First Defendant in

            the conduct of the case.
(iii)   Conduct of this action will require

        decisions to be made and acted upon by

        the First Defendant and the Court as to

        fault, causation, liability, contribution

        and apportionment before the determination

        of the same or similar matters in other

        proceedings namely:


        (a)   if there is a criminal prosecution

              of anybody in that case;


        (b)   at the Inquest;


        (c)   by the Police Complaints Authority.


(iv)    Decisions and actions made in (iii) are

        likely to be prejudicial to:


        (a)   fair criminal investigation;


        (b)   fair criminal trial, if any;


        (c)   fair hearing at the Inquest;


        (d)   fair investigation by Police

              Complaints Authority.


(v)     H.M. Coroner and the Assistant Chief

        Constable of West Midlands Police are

        unwilling to make available to the First

        Defendant evidence in their possession

        which is material to the conduct of the

        contribution action.
      (vi)    The First Defendant has agreed to make

              payments in settlement of many claims on

              similar facts.   The full extent and

              amount of the claims is not known.     All

              such cases will be the subject of claims

              for indemnity or contribution against

              the Second and Fourth Defendants.      Until

              the extent and outcome of such claims is

              known a trial of this action will be

              wasteful.


      (vii)   Any prejudice caused by discontinuance

              to the Second or Fourth Defendants is

              outweighed by the prejudice to the First

              Defendant and to those the subject of

              the criminal and other procedures above

      NOTICE OF DISCONTINUANCE ONDER ORDER 2 1 RULE 2


TAKE NOTICE t h a t :


1.     The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police,

the First Defendant, wholly discontinues (and if

necessary withdraws) the action for indemnity and

contribution and the claim made by him herein against
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC, the Second

Defendant and Eastwood & Partners Consulting

Engineers, the Fourth Defendant.


2.   This Notice has no application to any action or

claim other than that one in the particular case of

Linda Mary Rimmer.


3.   The grounds of this Notice are that:



     (i)    The proper conduct of the action by the

            First Defendant is prevented by

            concurrent procedures on the same facts

            by others namely:


            (a) the preparation of a report    to the

                 Director of Public Prosecutions by

                 Mr. Mervyn Jones, Assistant Chief

                 Constable of West Midlands Police;


            (b) the preparation of evidence    for the

                 Inquest by H.M. Coroner for South

                 Yorkshire;


            (c) the investigation by Police

                 Complaints Authority of complaints

                 made to it.


     (ii)   Until the outcome of the proceedings in

            (i) is known witnesses are unwilling to

            co-operate with the First Defendant in

            the conduct of the case.
(iii)   Conduct of this action will require

        decisions to be made and acted upon by

        the First Defendant and the Court as to

        fault, causation, liability, contribution

        and apportionment before the determination

        of the same or similar matters in other

        proceedings namely:


        (a)   if there is a criminal prosecution

              of anybody in that case;


        (b)   at the Inquest;


        (c)   by the Police Complaints Authority.


(iv)    Decisions and actions made in (iii) are

        likely to be prejudicial to:


        (a)   fair criminal investigation;


        (b)   fair criminal trial, if any;


        (c)   fair hearing at the Inquest;


        (d)   fair investigation by Police

              Complaints Authority.


(v)     H.M. Coroner and the Assistant Chief

        Constable of West Midlands Police are

        unwilling to make available to the First

        Defendant evidence in their possession

        which is material to the conduct of the

        contribution action.
      (vi)    The First Defendant has agreed to make

              payments in settlement of many claims on

              similar facts.   The full extent and

              amount of the claims is not known.     All

              such cases will be the subject of claims

              for indemnity or contribution against

              the Second and Fourth Defendants.      Until

              the extent and outcome of such claims is

              known a trial of this action will be

              wasteful.


      (vii)   Any prejudice caused by discontinuance

              to the Second or Fourth Defendants is

              outweighed by the prejudice to the First

              Defendant and to those the subject of

              the criminal and other procedures above

              by the continuation of the action.

Dear Sirs

Chapman v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire and Sheffield
Wednesday F.C. * Ors                        '............
We thank you for your letter of the 22nd September, but most
point out an error in our Defence.        Paragraph 11 which
commences on page 4 is followed by a second paragraph 10 on
page 9, and thereafter by paragraph 12*  This error for which
we apologise does not in any way materially effect the
Defence, but we would ask you to confirm that it will not be
necessary for us to amend and reserve.  Substitute pages are
enclosed*

We look forward to hearing from you.

Yours faithfully

             given and to whom.



REPLY



        6.   Please see Paragraph 206 in the Green

             Guide.   The Fourth Defendant ought to

             have reported or advised in his annual

             Certificate



             (1)       That each sub-division of the

                        terrace should be serviced by

                        its own entrance/exit and that

                        there were not sufficient exits

                        for use in an emergency.



             (2)        That the introduction of radial

                        fences had caused a significant

                        change in the availability of

                        exits since he had reported on

                        12.1.79 that the lack of

                        gangways and excessive distance

                        to exits was "of no consequence

                        as movement along this terrace

                        will be easy and quick" the

                        Fourth Defendant ought to have

                        advised in his annual

                        Certificate that after the

                        installation of radial fences

                        the excessive distance to exits


                        -11-
                              was now unsafe and that,

                              gangways were required.



        7.        As above.



Of "(b)      Failed when their own plans for new turnstiles

had been abandoned, to advise the Second Defendants of

the necessity to remove the radial fences"



REQUEST



                   Please identify each and every fence the

                   removal of which it is alleged that the

                   Fourth Defendant should have advised.



                   Please particularise each and every fact

                   and matter to be relied upon in support

                   of the allegation that the removal of

                   each such radial fence was necessary.



REPLY



        8.        All of them until separate access/egress

                   was provided plus properly signed emergency

                   exits plus means of control of numbers.



        9.        Without separate access/egress or number

                   control the combination of radial and •

                   perimeter fences were a trap for everyone

                   except those last in.   This was dangerous


                              -12-
                 in an emergency.



Of "(c)    Accepted assurances that the Second Defendants

and the Police had agreed a system of monitoring the

numbers entering the pens at the Leppings Lane end, when

on a proper analysis, it should have been clear that no

such system could operate efficiently"



REQUEST



     10.        Please particularise precisely what the

                 use of the word "efficiently" is intended

                 to signify in the context of this

                 allegation.



     11.        Please state whether it is the

                 Plaintiff's case that the lay out of the

                 Leppings Lane end terraces with its pens

                 was such that it was incapable of being

                 policed properly and safely.    If

                 affirmative, please particularise each

                 and every fact and matter relied upon.

                 If negative;



                 (1)       Please particularise precisely

                           what allegedly should have been

                           clear upon proper analysis.



                 (2)       Please state how it is alleged

                           that the matters complained of


                           -13-
                        caused the death of the

                        Deceased.



    12 .      Please state whether it is alleged that

              the Fourth Defendants should have been

              aware of the matters particularised in

              answer to the preceding request (1) had

              they carried out a proper analysis or (2)

              in any event.    In either case, please

              provide full particulars of each and

              every fact and matter relied upon in

              support thereof.



        13.   If in answer to the previous request, it

              is alleged that the Fourth Defendants

              should have been aware of such matters

              after proper analysis:



              (1)       Please particularise all

                        matters relied upon in support

                        of the allegation that they

                        were under a duty to carry out

                        such an analysis.



              (2)       Please particularise precisely

                        what it is alleged would have

                        constituted a proper analysis.



REPLY



                        -14-
The pleading means that the system could

not work i.e. it was too difficult by

observation to make a reliable count of

numbers when there was a big crowd.



The combination of defects in the layout

of the turnstiles, pens and fences could

not be policed safely when there was a

large crowd.   The defects included too

few turnstiles, no separate access to

each sub-division of the terrace, no

practicable means of control to prevent

overcrowding, no adequate signs, no

emergency exits except at the back of the

pens, no emergency exit signs and gaps

between crush barriers too wide.   These

defects caused the overcrowding and the

death of Mr. Rimmer.



Yes the Fourth Defendant should have been

aware of all the above defects and advised

and reported accordingly at least on the

occasion of his annual Certificates.



(1)       The duty to advise on the

          defects was included in the

          duties of the Fourth Defendant

          under Paragraph 1.
                    (2)         The proper analysis was that

                                with the combination of defects

                                the monitoring system would not

                                work.



Of "(d)       Regarded the pens formed by the radial fences

as still constituting one individual terrace"



REQUEST




        14.         Please identify precisely how it is

                    alleged that such an approach affected

                    the conduct of the Fourth Defendants

                    and/or caused or contributed to the acts

                    and omissions alleged against them.



        15.         Please particularise precisely how it is

                    alleged that the Fourth Defendants should

                    have regarded these pens.



        16.         Please state how it      is alleged that this

                    alleged breach      caused the death of the

                    Deceased.



REPLY




        14.         The approach caused the Fourth Defendant

                    to make the following serious mistakes:



                    (i)         Failing to advise upon the need


                                -16-
          for amendment to the Safety

          Certif icate.


(ii)      Failing to heed the change in

          distance to exits caused by the

          introduction of radial fences.


(iii)     Failing to advise upon the

          danger of overcrowding by lack

          of separate access to separate

          pens.


(iv)      Failing to advise upon the need

          for signs.


(v)       Failing to advise on the need

          for emergency exits which could

          be opened from the inside.


(vi)      Failing to advise on the need

          for emergency exit signs.


(vii )    Failing to advise that if

          separate turnstiles were not

          provided then some other fail­

          safe means of crowd number

          control was required.


(viii)    Failing to advise properly on

          the safe numbers of spectators

          who could be admitted to each

          pen.


Dangerous traps.
    16.      Mr. Rimmer died because there was no

              emergency exit available to him, no means

              of escape, no control over numbers,

              inadequate signing, not enough turnstiles,

          Taylor Interim Report.     The people at the

          front in pens three and four are caught

          in the trap.


          The pens were a trap because (1) the

          people at the front who were being crushed

          to death could not escape (2) the place

          at the front of the pen was at the

        3 9.   Orally on 26.2.87.    The Fourth Defendant

               was asked by Sharon of the Club whether

               the capacity figure of 10,200 for

               Leppings Lane end was still correct.



        40.    Orally on 2.3.87.     The Fourth Defendant

               advised the Club to leave the capacity at

               Leppings Lane end as it was provided

               Police have gates under West Stand open

               so that people can distribute throughout

               the terrace evenly.



        41.    Orally on 28.4.87.    The Fourth Defendant

               said to the Club that he did not know of

               any amendment to the Original Safety

               Certificate dated 1979 and had not seen

               any.



               These enquiries should have caused the

               Fourth Defendant to advise the Club of

               the need for amendment to the Safety

               Certificate which would have drawn

               attention to the danger of overcrowding

               and the need for crowd control and proper

               distribution by separate access/egress,

              dates.


    44.       The overall number was safe provided

              that the crowd had been distributed

              evenly across the whole terrace.


    45.       Not applicable.


    46.       Please see 41.       The overcrowding caused

REQUEST



     1.       Please state whether it is the

               extensive than that pleaded in Paragraph

               4 of the Amended Defence.   If the answer

               is affirmative, please provide the

                "the Second Defendant's Safety

                Consultant" is intended to incorporate an

R E PLY




          6.   Please see Paragraph 206 in the Green

               Guide.   The Fourth Defendant ought to

               have reported or advised in his annual

               Certificate



               (1)       That each sub-division of the

                          terrace should be serviced by

                          its own entrance/exit and that

                          there were not sufficient exits

                          for use in an emergency.



               (2)       That the introduction of radial

                          fences had caused a significant

                          change in the availability of

                          exits since he had reported on

                          12.1.79 that the lack of

                          gangways and excessive distance

                          to exits was "of no consequence

                          as movement along this terrace

                          will be easy and quick" the

                          Fourth Defendant ought to have

                          advised in his annual

                          Certificate that after the

                          installation of radial fences

                          the excessive distance to exits


                          -11-
                          was now unsafe and that gangways

                          were required.


    7.        As above.


Of "(b)   Failed when their own plans for new turnstiles

had been abandoned, to advise the Second Defendants of

the necessity to remove the radial fences"



REQUEST


    8.        Please   identify each and every fence the

               removal of which it is alleged that the

               Fourth Defendant should have advised.


    9.        Please   particularise each and every fact

               and matter to be relied upon in support

               of the allegation that the removal of

               each such radial fence was necessary.



REPLY


    8.        All of   them until separate access/egress

               was provided plus properly signed

               emergency exits plus means of control of

               numbers.


    9.        Without separate access/egress or number

               control the combination of radial and

               perimeter fences were a trap for

               everyone except those last in.     This

               was dangerous in an emergency.



                          -12-
Of "(c)    Accepted assurances that the Second Defendants

and the Police had agreed a system of monitoring the

numbers entering the pens at the Leppings Lane end, when

on a proper analysis, it should have been clear that no

such system could operate efficiently"



REQUEST



     10.        Please particularise precisely what the

                 use of the word "efficiently" is intended

                 to signify in the context of this

                 allegation.



     11.        Please state whether it is the

                 Plaintiff's case that the lay out of the

                 Leppings Lane end terraces with its pens

                 was such that it was incapable of being

                 policed properly and safely.    If

                 affirmative, please particularise each

                 and every fact and matter relied upon.

                 If negative;



                 (1)       Please particularise precisely

                           what allegedly should have been

                           clear upon proper analysis.



                 (2)       Please state how it is alleged

                           that the matters complained of



                           -13-
                        caused the death of the.

                        Deceased.



    12.       Please state whether it is alleged that

              the Fourth Defendants should have been

              aware of the matters particularised in

              answer to the preceding request (1) had

              they carried out a proper analysis or (2)

              in any event.    In either case, please

              provide full particulars of each and

              every fact and matter relied upon in

              support thereof.



        13.   If in answer to the previous request, it

              is alleged that the Fourth Defendants

              should have been aware of such matters

              after proper analysis:



              (1)       Please particularise all

                        matters relied upon in support

                        of the allegation that they

                        were under a duty to carry out

                        such an analysis.



              (2)       Please particularise precisely

                        what it is alleged would have

                        constituted a proper analysis.



REPLY



                        -14-
The pleading means that the system could

not work i.e. it was too difficult by

observation to make a reliable count of

the numbers when there was a big crowd.



The combination of defects in the layout

of the turnstiles, pens and fences could

not be policed safely when there was a

large crowd.   The defects included too

few turnstiles, no separate access to

each sub-division of the terrace, no

practicable means of control to prevent

overcrowding, no adequate signs, no

emergency exits except at the back of the

pens, no emergency exit signs, gaps

between crush barriers too wide and

barrier 124a liable to be over-loaded.

These defects caused the overcrowding

and the death of Mr. Chapman.



Yes the Fourth Defendant should have been

aware of all the above defects and

advised and reported accordingly at least

on the occasion of his annual Certificates.



(1)        The duty to advise on the

           defects was included in the

           duties of the Fourth Defendant

           under Paragraph 1.
                    (2)         The proper analysis was that

                                with the combination of defects

                                the monitoring system would not

                                work.



Of "(d)       Regarded the pens formed by the radial fences

as still constituting one individual terrace"



REQUEST



     14 .           Please identify precisely how it is

                    alleged that such an approach affected

                    the conduct of the Fourth Defendants

                    and/or caused or contributed to the acts

                    and omissions alleged against them.



        15.         Please particularise precisely how it is

                    alleged that the Fourth Defendants should

                    have regarded these pens.



        16.         Please state how it     is alleged that this

                    alleged breach      caused the death of the

                    Deceased.



REPLY



        14.         The approach caused the Fourth Defendant

                    to make the following serious mistakes:



                    (i)         Failing to advise upon the need


                                -16-
         for amendment to the Safety

         Certificate.


(ii )    Failing to heed the change in

         distance to exits caused by

         the introduction of radial

         fences.


(iii)    Failing to advise upon the

         danger of overcrowding by lack

         of separate access to separate

         pens.


(iv)     Failing to advise upon the

         need for signs.


(v)      Failing to advise on the need

         for emergency exits which could

         be opened from the inside.


(vi)     Failing to advise on the need

         for emergency exit signs.


(vii)    Failing to advise that if

         separate turnstiles were not

         provided then some other fail­

         safe means of crowd number

         control was required.


(viii)   Failing to advise properly on

         the safe numbers of spectators

         who could be admitted to each

                             -21-
               there were not enough gates; they were

               too small i.e. Gate 3 .82 metres and Gate

               4 .79 metres instead of 1.1 metres; they

               were not signed; they could not be used

               in an emergency by the people who wanted

               to escape.



     26.       (i)          The Fourth Defendant approved

                            the gates annually i.e. advised

                            that they were safe.

               no one in the crowd was able to open the

               gate, and it was too small, and there was

               only one gate, and it was the job of the

               Fourth Defendant to think of these things

               and give advice and he had not done so.

    43 (i )    The gates in the perimeter fence were

               meant to be emergency exit gates on to

               and could not be opened from the inside

               in an emergency and so could not be used

               when needed.    This was contrary to the

                            opened easily from each side.



     46.       Yes.     This was part of the job under (1)

               above.    This was one of the reasons that

              means of escape in case of all and/or any

               and if so what emergency.       If affirmative

               please particularise in each case each

               and every fact and matter relied upon in

                  envisaged in the Green Guide.



Of " (k) Sanctioned the use of crowd enclosure which was

in fact a trap"



REQUEST



        52.       Please identify precisely what is alleged

                  to have constituted a trap.



        53.       Please identify each and every way in

                  which it is alleged that such thing

                  constituted a trap and particularise each

                  and every fact and matter to be relied

                  upon in support thereof.



        54.       Please state how it is alleged that    the

                  Fourth Defendant "sanctioned" such use.

REPLY



        52.       Please see photograph Appendix 5 in    the

                  Taylor Interim Report.     The people at the

                  front in pens three and four are caught



                            -34-
              in the trap.


    53.      The pens were a trap because (1) the

              people at the front who were being

              crushed to death could not escape (2) the

              place at the front of the pen was at the

              bottom of a slope in the nature of a sump

              or well.


    54.      The Fourth Defendant approved the design

              and layout and use of the pens every time

              he issued a Safety Certificate.


    55.      As above.

              March 1987 here referred to, stating in

              each case to whom, by whom, when and how

    58.      Please identify     the alleged enquiry in


                         -35-
April 1987 here referred to, stating in

each case to whom, by whom, when and how

each such enquiry was addressed.



Please    particularise         in r e s p e c t   of    each

such   enquiry what         consideration          it    is

alleged    that    the    Fourth Defendant              should

have   g i v e n bu t   d i d not   give.




Please    particularise         in r e s p e c t   of    e a ch

such   enquiry what         response:




(1)          it   is a l l e g e d t h a t   the   Fourth

               Defendants       did   give.

(1)          what numbers it is alleged were

               admitted;
              (2)         what numbers it is alleged

                          should have been admitted.



        63.   If the answer to Request 61 is in the

              negative, please state how the matters

              complained of in this sub-paragraph are

              alleged to have caused the death of the

REPLY



        56.   Orally on 26.2.87.     The Fourth Defendant

              was asked by one Sharon of the Club whether

              the capacity figure of 10,200 for

              Leppings Lane end was still correct.



        57.   Orally on 2.3.87.     The Fourth Defendant

              advised the Club to leave the capacity at

              Leppings Lane end as it was provided

              Police have gates under West Stand open

              so that people can distribute throughout

              the terrace evenly.



    58.       Orally on 28.4.87.    The Fourth Defendant

              said to the Club that he did not know of

              any amendment to the Original Safety

              Certificate dated 1979 and had not seen
              any.



    59.       These enquiries should have caused the



                          -37-
              Fourth Defendant to advise the Club of

              the need for amendment to the Safety

              Certificate which would have drawn

              attention to the danger of overcrowding

              and the need for crowd control and proper

              distribution by separate access/egress,

              separate turnstiles, proper signing.


    60.       As above.     See 56-58.    Please see the

              Fourth Defendant1s memorandum of those

              dates.


    61.       The overall number was safe provided that

              the crowd had been distributed evenly

              across the whole terrace.


    62.       Not applicable. ■


    63.       Please see 59.       The overcrowding caused

              the death of Mr. Chapman.

It further be recorded that the Judge made the following
observations:

(i )         that his strong    indication and hope was that the parties

             put before the Trial Judge as part of the evidence to which

             he might have regard in relation to the Inquiry's findings

             of primary fact, with liberty to each party to lead contrary

             evidence at trial on any disputed fact and (b) that the

             transcript of the proceedings of the Inquiry be admitted at

             trial as a true record of what was said at the Inquiry;

  J ■*"      the parties should be prepared to agree to submit before

             trial a list of those findings of fact contained in the

             Inquiry Report which were to be contested at trial.

(ii)         In the light of    the indication given by Plaintiff's Counsel

             that the Defendants were likely to admit that the present

             action concerned a fatality in Pen 3 and that it was the

             intention that proceedings be issued and a Statement of
        Claim be served as soon as possible in two further lead

        actions, one concerning a fatality in Pen 4 and the other

        a Plaintiff physically injured outside the Stadium, the

        provisional view of the Judge was that a stay should be

        granted in all other similar proceedings pending the

        outcome of the 3 lead actions, but that such stay should not

        take effect until close of pleadings in such actions.

(ill)   That pleadings in all actions other than the lead cases,

        could and should be in an abridged form with cross

        references to the pleadings in the lead actions.

(iv)    That he noted the intention of Counsel for the Second

        Defendant to obtain urgent instructions as to whether the

        Second Defendants intended to raise allegations against

        other parties and to produce to the Plaintiff's Counsel a

        draft of any Defence containing such allegations as soon

        as possible.

(v)     That he further noted the intention of the Plaintiff in

        the event of the Second Defendants raising such allegations

        to seek leave to amend the Writ so as to join additional

        parties and that the Plaintiff's further intention in such

        event was to withdraw the present Statement of Claim and

        serve a fresh Statement of Claim including allegations

        against all parties;

(vi)    That in the event of the Plaintiff requiring leave to amend

        the Writ for the above purpose, such leave would be granted

        by the placing before him of an agreed insertion to the

        present Minute of Order.

(vii)   That his present view was that the trials of the lead actions

        (to be tried sequentially) should be listed for the First or

        Second half of the term following Easter 1990, with an
        estimated length of 6 weeks; Final order in this regard

        should be made by Rose J. at the pre-trial review.

   Tn opening the Meeting, Mike Humphreys stated that the following numbered

   points were to be added lo the Agenda

   1,     As No. 8 - representation ai the Inquest

                  9 - machinery for dealing with claims

                 10 - Media Statements

                 11 - Interest

  1 . LIABILITY

  MH stated that the view of the Committee was that the Defendants were jointly

  responsible for the deaths and injuries on the 15th April and asked the

  Defendants to

        (a) Admit, liability or (h) agree Lo pay compensation to those who prove damage,

 .Mr, O'Callaghan on behalf of the defendants said that they would not admit liabilty.

  They saw liability as being difficult.             They had previously discussed this

  question, as Defendants.             There was no admission of liability nor would there t>e

  any such admission.           They anticipated that the Committee were likely to accent

  this, and they felt that the only sensible way of dealing with the .natter was

  to have liability tried.             There was a common interest that liability should

 be tried as soon as possible and the defendants wished to move in this

 direction by means of a test case.


 MH indicated that the lead action of Chapman had already been selected, issued

 and served.       The Committee had contacted the presiding Judge          Mr. Jur.tice Rose

 informally       and had requested that he should provide directions for the selection

 of a trial Judge arid Registrar to deal with interlocutory applications.                    *.J’w
the trial and that the parties 3 hould if neccoej%ry travel to wherever IhC

Judge was sitting rather than involve any replacement: Judge.          3S.   pointed

out to the defendants that they would see from the proceedings           that at the

moment only two Defendants were named and asked whether they intended to bring

in   any   third parties.   V.O.'C   nad said that no final decision had been taken
               but
in this respect/that the Defendants were not seeking to          needlessly broaden

the net.


It was agreed that the three parties involved at present should be the ones

to go before the Presiding Judge in the near future.


Mr. Metcalf stated that nore than one tost case may b« necessary to deal wi Ih

different categories of claim and they would be looking at proximity and

causation.      The Defendants all agree     that liability   should be tried, and will

recognise the case of Chapman as a test case (subject to its category)', othexs

should be stayed by consent or on application.


MH is to write to Mr. Justice Rose to ask that a Judge be appointed to try the

action <s) and deal with al.l. interlocutory matters.


The time scale envisaged by      V.O'C     is 12 months and Mr. Walker M.M.I. said

he spoke for both insurers in saying that their Solicitors had been

instructed that there should be no stalling tactics or procedural delays in the

progressing of the test actions.


2. FATAL CASKS

  (a)      WH asked the Defendants to increase the                iercavemcnt damages

  payable by statute .      SW, M.M.I. stated thar they saw no reason to increase

  the figure payable by statute and V.O. 'C said that Sun Alliance had the

same viewr,.


MH asked if they would approach their insured, namely Sheffield Wednesday and

the Police to ask if t'iey would         prepared to nak© an ft* gratia payment

to increase     the bereavement damages.    MH also asked that the insurers should

agree to an expansion of the categories of pecplo entitled to bereavement damages
                                          -3-


                 should be made on an ex gratia baa is.          Mr. Vincent, Sun Alli;*ncO

            *    said that the sane principles applied)that they were sticking

                 to the awards for which they would be legally liable, although

                 there was not a categorical refusal to pay an exceptional claim

                 if the insurers were notified of hardship in this r e a p e d .

                      (b)    Multiplicand - MH said that it was hoped that to expedite

                 dealing     with dependency cases a proportion of gross earnings could

                 be taken in this respect.        This became less relevant in view of the

                 denial of liability.


                 V.O. ’C said that they did not want to sit still on damages whilst

                 tho test action proceeded.        It was felt that damages should

                be investigated now rather than lead           to any delay after the

                outcome of thetest action        was known.

                 3. INTERIM PAYMENTS (Item No. 4 on the Agenda)

                BS. asked the Defendants whether they would agree to make interim payments

                in th e s e canes on th e b a s is t h a t the Committee had been ad v ise d t h a t

                     0 . 14 applications may well be successful and there could not be

                any allegations of contributory negligence.            V.O'C said that he

                did not feel that these cases were suitable for interim payment.

                BS on behalf of the Steering Committee said that multiple application;-;

                for interim payments were inevitable irrespective of any stay applied

                to the actions and the Defendants would therefore face further costs.

                BS. added that the making of interim payments may assist the Defendants

                in allowing the test case to proceed as they wir>hed*,it would be a matter

                of good public relations from the point of the insurers.               MH suggested

                that at? a gesture of good will ail interim payment should be made

                to those falling within the statutory definition of "bereaved ',1

                whether it be the full or only part of the statutory bereavement damages,

                and in the "hard cases" where the statutory definitions may not

                quite apply.     This would involve the insurers in paying a maximum

                of               in 95 cases only.     Other cases suitable for interim
l . _   '
  were those 15 cases**1?1*® brain damaged haO been identified

  and to those present pmd injured in Pens     J    and 4 or the ground.

  BS. pointed out that, the group cou.ld not    stop any Solicitor making

  an application for interim payment on behalf of his client.


  After considerable discussion it was left Ihat the Defendants wer* to

  discuss this point in depth; Sun Alliance         has to report to a group

  of co-insurers; the Defendants are to revert to the Steering

  Committee in respect of this point.



  4. DAMAGES png    PAIN AMP SUFFERING gftjOg, TO     A DEATH

  (Item No. 3 on      thoAgenda)

 MH states that       theCommittee were looking for a base line

 figure which should be increased      according to the circumstances

 of each death.       BSadded that if damages were agreed in principle

 prior to the trial of the liability issue, the Comnn ttce would want

 interest to be payable on the agreed damages         at the judgment interes t

 rate of 15%



 Mr. Walker of M.I.I. said that in principle he did not see a problem

 with this point.

 5.   NERVOUS SHOCK

Mr. Walker of M.M.I. said that he acceptcd that, anyone who hud

physical injuries was a claimant, subject to the liability igyus.

With regard to the question of nervous      shock it    was   1 Lksly that

issues of provability and causation would need to be resolved.

In principle they accept that in respect o f Pea 3 and 4              there

may be psychiatric claims even where there is no claim for physical injury

V.O'C said that there were issues of remoteness and public policy

involved; the media involvement in this case had o p e n e d a can of worms.

Mr. walker stated that it was only a minority of the crowd          at the
 It may b o necessary for follow-up test, action* to be brought with

 regard to the nervous shock causation point.           It was suggested that

 these should be tried immediately tried following the main teat action.


 BS suggested that the issues on this point could be isolated

and o handful of              test   cases selected on the      causationpoint.

 All parti.er, were agreed that      liability in these cases should follow

 the test action but then the        question of causation       be     heard separately,

 with a view to saving costs.


6 . REPRESENTATION AT THE INQUEST

BS said that     he had been in contact with the Sheffield Coron .r who

was very much in favour of having block representation for the bereaved.

He fell that it would be appropriate for there to be a genoi'ic

enquiry and brief enquiries into the 95 individual deaths and

requested "Chat the Defendants should fund the Steering Committee to

carry out representation in respect of the Generic enquiry.             Alternatively

they faced having to fund representation in *^p to 95 different cases.

?4r. Walker - M.M.I. asked about the profit ennt involved.3S yaid. !.hnt

that would obviously depend on the length of Ihe inquest but the inquest

would be prolonged if there were separate representations in rcspect

of each death.      BS. pointed out that the cost of funding the Steering

Committee would be lens than the result and increase In Couonels fees

payable by the Defendants.

The Defendants are to discuss this asaect and revert to the Committee.

7. PAYMENT FOP ’VOKK DONE 3Y STEERING COMMITTEE

MH stated that there were a host of casks for the S members of the Steer Lng

Committee to carry out and asked the Defendants to confirm that they arould

be responsible for the reasonable cost of the Steering Committee in respect

of generic issues.

V .0 1C . *33 *.d -ha1.' ho t^o’jffh'.' That the Defendants would tane a pragmatic view',

        Steering Committee have a letter stating that they would look        at any

        reasonable application for      payment of costs by the Steering Committee.

        After some points raised by BS with regard      tv   the mechanicc of payment

        it. was agreed that the Committee would pilfer to have a formal agreement with

        regard to payment of costs and that one of the Committee should        write ho the

        Defendants with delails of the type of work to be undertaken by the Committee,

        with a view to setting out the ground rules for such an agreement.


     3 . DATE OF RUNNING OF INTEREST ( It e m No. 11 on th e Agenda)

     The Committee pointed out that if a lead action waa to be taken it may prevent

     the issue of hundred of Writs but in return the Committee would expect some

     agreement as to an early date for the running <j P interest to commence.

    Sone discussion took place as to this dote and this was one of the matters

    considered by the parties separately during a later short rccess.

    After the recess it was agreed that Steering Committee provide a list

    of the clients they represented to the Defendants           by the 31st July 16(39

    and on those cases interest'should run from the date of the disaster,

    15.4.89.          Those joining the group at a later date should have interest

    running from the date of notification of a claim.

    9. MECHANISM FOR HANDLING CLAIMS

    The Steering Committee as^ed how the Defendants proposed to handle the claims,

    they indicated that they would be in contact with each other to work this ou I:

    and would contact ~S on 11,7.89 so that soie indie*-Jon of this could be piven

    to the members of the group at the meeting being held the next day.

    10. FUNDING OF DISBURSEMENTS BY INSURERS (Item No. *3 on the Agenda)

    The Committee explaned that a team of medical experts were being act up and

    advice was being given to members of the group who required it concerning

    medical evidence.         They asked the Defendants to agree to make a payment on

    account of disbursements in respect of medical fes where           reports were

    disclosed.
The Defendants indicated     Lhat they would look at this proposal;

                                             nut:
i I was not something they would turn down
                                                      but i I waa

suggested that the Committee should sot out in wriling what was

required and that letter should be faxed to both insurance companies

for consideration between themselves.


11. MEDIA AND   PRESS INVOLVEMENT (Item No. 10 on the Agenda)

The Steering Committee indicated that they intended to release the

press statement after the meeting and it was agreed that a short recess

should take place for the parties to consider this.   On reconvening

after 20 minuter, it was felt that no joint statement could be issued but

each side gave an indication of the press release they intended to make and

thene were not in any way inconsistent.   The Steering Committee requested

that the defendants should disclose the identity of the Plaintiffs in the

lead aclion.

The meeting then concluded at 5.pm.

                 DEFENCE OF THE SECOND DEFENDANTS




                               1
1.     Subject to production of the material documents paragraph

1 of the Statement of Claim is admitted.



2.     Save that not all the PoliceOfficers to whom reference is

made   in     the   Statement   of    Claim   were    members   of   the   South

Yorkshire Force but they were all acting under the control of the

First Defendant as pleaded, paragraph 2 of the Statement of Claim

is admitted and it is averred that the First Defendant was at all

material times acting in performance or purported performance of

acontract      between    himself    and      the    Second Defendant      which

provided for the policing of the ground and of the event in

question.



3.     Paragraph 3 of the Statement of Claim is admitted but it is

averred that at all material times the First Defendant was also

an occupier of the ground for the purposes of the Occupiers

Liability Act 1957, and was in control of the event and of all

members of the public admitted thereto.



4.     Paragraph 4       of the Statement of Claim is admitted.



5.     Save    that   the   only     works    which    were directed       and/or

supervised by the Third Defendants were those which were material

to their safety certificate,            paragraph 5 of the Statement of

Claim is admitted.



6.     Paragraph 6 of the Statement of claim is admitted.


                                        2
7.   Save       that the       Deceased was,        in the premises,     a lawful

visitor    of both       the    First   and Second        Defendants within the

meaning    of    the    Occupiers'      Liability Act paragraph         7 of    the

Statement of Claim is admitted.



8.   As to the matters alleged in paragraph 8 of the Statement

of Claim, the Second Defendants:

     (i)        admit that, by 3.00 p.m. at the earliest, pen three

was overcrowded and that crushing was occurring;

     (ii)       admit that the deceased was subjected to such crushing

and as a result sustained injury from which he died that day;

     (iii) admit that a barrier collapsed on the terrace but deny

that this collapse occurred before 3.00 p.m;

     (iv)        deny that the collapse of the barrier caused or

contributed to any injury or death.

     Save as aforesaid paragraph 8 of the Statement of Claim is

denied.



9.    It is admitted and averred that the First Defendant acted

negligently       and    in    breach   of       duty,   both   contractually   and

statutorily, and that his said breaches caused the death of the

deceased.       The Second Defendants will adopt and rely upon the

matters pleaded against the First Defendant under the following

sub-paragraphs of paragraph 9 of the Statement of Claim:                        (d),

(e), (h), (k), (1), (m), (n), (o), (p), (q), (r), (s), (t), and

(u)- subject to the deletion of the word "forwards" from the

penultimate line of that sub-paragraph.


                                             3
10.    The second Defendants will further rely upon the fact that

at all material times the First Defendant was in joint occupation

of the premises and accordingly owed to the Plaintiff a duty to

ensure that they were reasonably safe for the purposes for which

he had been invited to visit the same, and in so far as they were

unsafe that resulted solely from the activities which were under

the control of the First Defendants.



11.     It is denied that the Second Defendants acted negligently

or in breach of duty as alleged or at all or that any negligence

or breach of duty on their part caused or contributed to the

death of the deceased.           Without prejudice to the generality of

that denial the Second Defendants will specifically contend that:



             (a)         the turnstile facilities at the Leppings Lane

end of the ground were adequate having regard to the reasonable

expectations        of    the   Second         Defendants   and    the   policing

requirements of the First Defendants and the need sensibly to

balance the demands of segregation and public order on the one

hand and controlled entry of supporters for a semi-final match

on the other;



             (b)     the signing system within the ground to the pens,

though admittedly poor, did not cause or contribute and was not

in    any   way    relevant     to   the   death     of   the   deceased.   It   is

specifically denied that the crush which led to his death could

or would have been prevented by better sign-posting;


                                           4
            (c)      it would have been wholly impracticable and

largely pointless to attempt mechanically to monitor the entry

of numbers to the individual pens the required design of which

expressly provided for them to remain open and to allow free

lateral movement. The Second Defendants will further rely upon

the fact that whatever system had been employed to monitor the

numbers in pens 3 and 4 it would have been defeated and rendered

useless by the First Defendant's decision suddenly and without

warning to open "C" gate and thereby to allow approximately 2,000

persons directly,     rapidly and without control to enter those

pens;



            (d)    it is denied that the police at any material time

gave    any or any adequate warning        that the designated capacity

of the Terrace was too high for safety.           It is admitted and in

so far as it is not alleged it is averred that in a letter dated

5th June 1981 the police did express the view that the terrace

was "...not constructed to give maximum aid to the packing and

control of the crowd and the accepted crowd capacity is such that

there is no safety margin."         The second defendants will rely upon

the fact that following their receipt of that letter the design

of the terrace was altered in accordance with the suggestions of

the police and with the approval of the third defendants and that

the    certified   capacity   was    thereafter   retained   at   the   same

figures;




                                       5
             (e)      there    was    at       all       material   times    a   clear

understanding between police and the Second Defendants as to the

manner in which the numbers in the pens would be monitored and

controlled by the police,           who alone were occupying the only

positions from which this could effectively be done, and in this

regard the Second Defendants will particularly rely upon the fact

that the police well knew that none of the Second Defendants'

employees was or was required by them (the police) to be present

in the control     box, on the terrace or in the perimeter area;



             (f)     no representation of                any kind was made by or

with the knowledge of the Second Defendants to the City Council

concerning any agreed system of crowd control and if, which is

not admitted, any         representation was made it was made by the

First Defendants;



             (g)    if and to the extent that the configuration of

the terrace dictated a need for the crowd to be assisted in

spreading itself evenly,        the Second Defendants were entitled

reasonably    to   have    regard    to       the    fact   that    the   police   had

exclusive control of that crowd;



             (h)   they did inform the police of the estimated flow

ratethrough the turnstiles - and,                   in   doing so, in fact under­

estimated that rate.        The Second Defendants will further rely

upon the fact that their said estimation would in fact have been

exceeded if the area outside the turnstiles had been sensibly and

properly policed;


                                          6
             (i)    they were entitled to and did rely upon the fact

that the police had a position of unparrelled advantage from

which to view the state of the terrace - both from their control

room and from the perimeter, and that the police had control of,

or the means to control, the crowd thereon at all material times;



             (j)        there was at all material times a perfectly

satisfactory system for keeping police on the concourse informed

of   the   state   of   the   terrace       and   efficient   and   expensive

equipment had been installed at the request of the police by the

Second Defendants and at their expense in order to facilitate

that; and there should have been no conceivable advantage to be

derived from informing the stewards on the concourse of the state

of the terrace;



             (k)        the only reasonable means by which spectators

could effectively have been directed from pens 3 and 4 was the

closing of the tunnel. It should have been wholly unnecessary for

any steward to have been involved in that simple process. There

was a moveable barrier available for the purpose and if the

Police had, for any reason, required assistance with it, stewards

were available     in the area standing beside police officers at all

times.     If any warning of the intention to open "C" gate had been

given to those stewards and/or to those officers the tunnel would

have been closed;




                                        7
           (1)                  the Second Defendants will rely upon the fact

that they did regularly inform the police in the control box of

the numbers of spectators who had been admitted and that those

officers had a better view of the pens in question than did

anyone else and it should have been pointless and unnecessary for

anybody to inform them of what was plain for them to see but

difficult to judge from other places in the ground;




           (m)    the   gates   in   the   perimeter   fence     precisely

accorded with the requirements of the local authority (the Third

Defendants or their predecessors) who at all times licensed the

premises for the purposes of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act and

it would not have been open to the Second Defendants to alter the

dimensions of those gates in any event.           It is     specifically

denied that the size of the gates caused or contributed in any

way to the death of the deceased;



           (n)     the gates in the perimeter fence were to the

knowledge of the Second Defendants all manned at all times by

police officers and it was not only unnecessary for stewards also

to   man   them   but   would   have     been   dangerous   to    confuse

responsibility for the control of those gates the opening and

closing of which were necessarily matters for police decision and

action;




                                     8
              (o)               the Second Defendants took all reasonable steps

to ensure that the crush barriers were safe and conformed to the

requirements of the licensing          authority and it is denied that

they permitted the removal of any of them.             They retained the

services of the Fourth Defendants who were           competent experts in

that field.     The crush barriers were in fact safe in all material

respects;



              (p)    the Second Defendants took all reasonable steps

to plan for the 1989 semi-final and took account of all the

information which was available to them;



              (q)   it would not have been reasonable for the Second

Defendants to have available or, indeed, to anticipate any need

for bolt cutters because it was wholly unforeseeable that the

police would fail and/or refuse to open the perimeter gates until

a time when the crush behind them was so bad that cutters were

required;


?-
1^.   Further and/or in the alternative the Second Defendants

will contend that if, which is denied, the physical layout of the

premises or the condition of any part thereof was defective or

inadequate as is alleged in the statement of claim and, which is

also denied, that the same caused or contributed in any way to

the   death    of   the   deceased   then   that   death was   due   to   the

negligence of the Third and or Fourth Defendants.




                                      9
      PARTICULARS OF NEGLIGENCE OF THE THIRD AND FOURTH DEFENDANTS



A.    As against the Third Defendants the Second Defendants will

if necessary adopt and rely upon the allegations pleaded against

the Third Defendants under sub-paragraphs (a) - (f) inclusive of

the Statement of Claim.




B.    As against the Fourth Defendants the Second Defendants will

if necessary adopt and rely upon the allegations pleaded against

those defendants under sub-paragraphs (a), (b), (d), (e), (f),

(g), and (h) of the Statement of Claim and will further contend

that the Fourth Defendants were negligent in failing to give

adequate consideration and response to the Second Defendants7

enquiries concerning the certified capacity of the terrace in

February, March and April 1987.



1^.    It is admitted that the deceased died as a result of the

injuries which he sustained but no other admissions are made as

to any of the matters alleged under paragraph 11 of the Statement

of Claim.

                               Question 3 in the Acknowledgment of Service, that he intends to apply for a stay,
                               execution will be stayed for 14 days after his Acknowledgment, but he must,

                               desires to make for payment of the money by instalments or otherwise.

                               4. IF THE W R IT IS ISSUED OUT OF A DISTRICT REGISTRY but the
                               Defendant does not reside or carry on business within the district of the registry
                               and the writ is not indorsed with a statement that the Plaintiff's cause of action
                               arose in that district, the Defendant may, in answer to Question 4 in the
                               Acknowledgment of Service, apply for the transfer of the action to some other

    3.      As to paragraph 5 of the Amended Statement of Claim,                                      the

    Safety    Certificate         was     issued by the               South Yorkshire            County

    Council     (" SYCC"),        which       was    the       body    having       responsibility

    under the Safety of Sports Grounds Ground Act 1975 in the ar«a

    in which Hillsborough Stadium is situated until the abolition

    of SYCC as a result of local government reorganisation on 1st

    A pril     1986.          For        the        purpose            of     discharging             its

    responsibilities under the 1975 Act SYCC appointed an Officer

    Working     Party      ("the        Working       Party")          which       included      senior

    representatives          of    the       Police      and     the        Fire    Service      and    a

    Chartered     Engineer        representative               of the       Building       Surveyor's

    Department of the Third Defendants.                              It is admitted that the

    Working    Party      made     periodic         visits       to    the       stadium    (normally

    twice    a year)      and directed and approved the                            carrying out of

    works     thereto.                  On     the       abolition          of     the     SYCC,      its

    responsibilities          under          the     said      Act     passed       to     the     Third

    Defendants,      who continued to use the Working Party as before,

    except    that     the    bi-annual             inspections         were       replaced      by    an.

    annual inspection.                 It was normal for a representative of the

    Fourth    Defendants          to    be    present       at    the       bi-annual       or   annual

    inspections, but they were not members of the Working Party and

    did not otherwise attend its meetings.



    4.      Paragraph 6 of the Amended Statement of Claim is denied.

    The     Fourth   Defendants          were       initially          engaged      by     the   Second

    Defendants       to   advise        and    act       for     the    Second       Defendants        as

    Structural       Engineers          in     their        dealings         with     the     SYCC     in

    connection with the obtaining of a Safety Certificate under the
1975 Act.      After the grant of the Safety Certificate, they wexe

employed as follows:



        (1)   to carry out an annual structural inspection of the

       stands and terraces, including testing the crush barriers,

       and to report thereon to the Second Defendants;



        (2)   to attend the bi-annual or annual inspections by the

       Working Party;



        (3)   to   act        for   and    advise    the    Second   Defendants      in

       relation        to     any   other       matters    upon   which    they   were

       instructed.            Full details of such matters are contained

       in the Fourth Defendants                 files,    a list of which will be

       disclosed on discovery.



It is admitted that the Fourth Defendants also owed a duty of

care    towards    visitors         to    the   stadium    to   exercise   reasonable

skill and care in the performance of their duties to the Second

Defendants, so as not by a careless act or omission on the part

of     the    Fourth        Defendants     to    cause     or   expose    visitors   to

foreseeable injury.                 It is denied that the Fourth Defendants

owed any other or wider duty to visitors and, in particular it

is denied that their duty to visitors was wider in scope than

their duty to the Second Defendants.                       It is also denied that

the Fourth Defendants               ever had any general          retainer from the

Second Defendants to act as "Safety Consultants" in relation to

all safety matters.
5.     Paragraph 7 of the Amended Statement of Claim is admitted.



6.     Save       that    it    is   admitted     that   the    deceased            died    as   a

result of crushing due to overcrowding of spectators in Pen 3,

no    admissions         are    made   as    to   paragraph          8    of   the        Amended

Statement of Claim.



7.     The Fourth Defendants do not plead to the allegations made

against the First,             Second and Third Defendants in paragraphs 9

and 10 of the Amended Statement of Claim.



8.     It is denied that there was,                 or that the deceased's death

was caused by, negligence on the part of the Fourth Defendants,

their servants           or experts,        as alleged in paragraph 10 of the

Amended Statement of Claim or at all.                          As to the particulars

of    the     negligence         alleged,     the    Fourth      Defendants               say    as

foilows:



       (a)     Failed as the Second Defendants Safety Consultant to

       advise against the erection o f r ad i a l                    fences without the

       installation            of separate turnstiles           to each pen created




The    "Second       Defendants'        Safety      Consultant"          is    an    incorrect

description of the role of the Fourth Defendants, which was as

stated above.



At the relevant time the conventional wisdom regarding radial

fences      was    that    contained in the           Guide     to       Safety      at    Sports
Grounds       (Football),             1976       Edition             ("the    1976       Green    Guide” ).

This recommended: -



       " 18. 1. Crowd movement on terraces should be severely

       limited       in     order          to    give           the    Police          the    fullest

       opportunity for crowd control.                                   Less problems occur

       where       the     terraces            are divided             as     far      as possible

       into    sections             by the       use       of        railings       or barriers,

       both    radial           and       lateral.                   Ideally,       each      section

       should        be        serviced              by        its     own       entrance/exits,

        refreshment facilities and toilets."



Accordingly,         separate turnstiles were in no way regarded as a

pre-condition            for    the        introduction               of     radial      fences.          The

general recommendation of radial fences in the Green Guide was

reinforced in the case of Hillsborough by the Police, who urged

their     introduction              as     a    means          of     enabling them to             exercise

greater     control         over          the    terrace.                  Their introduction was

first     advocated            by     the       Police          following         the        experience    of

policing       the       1981       FA     Cup       semi-final,             during      which     crushing

occurred due (in the opinion of the Police) to their inability

to exercise sufficient control over the movement of spectators,

and was       supported             and     approved            by the Working Party.                     The

Fourth     Defendants               were       not    responsible                for    the    operational

control of the terrace.                          Both in 1981                (when the first radial

fences were introduced)                        and in 1985             (when more radial             fences

were     introduced)            the        Fourth          Defendants            recommended        schemes

which     would       have       provided            separate           turnstiles            serving     each

section       of     the       terrace.                   In    1981       the    Fourth        Defendants,
through       Mr.    John    Strange,         prepared       for and presented to the

Second     Defendants         through         its     then    Club     Secretary      Mr.     Eric

England, two alternative schemes for the installation of radial

fences     and the re-organisation of turnstiles                             at the Leppings

Lane     end,       with    separate          capacity       figures    for     the    separate

sections of terrace which would be created by the radial fences

and separate turnstiles for each section.                               In 1985 the Fourth

Defendants          proposed       further       alternative         schemes     which       would

also have provided separate turnstiles for each section of the

terrace.



       Ikl      Failed when their own plans                        for new turnstiles          had

       been     abandoned,         to     advise      the    Second Defendants           of    th_e

       necessity to remove the radial, fences.



The Fourth Defendants made plain their preference for separate

turnstiles          in preparing and presenting their plans;                                but to

term the        provision         of    separate       turnstiles       a "necessity",          df

there      were       to     be        radial        fences,        would     have     been     an

overstatement,              and        would     have        gone      beyond       either     the

recommendations of the Green Guide or the requirements of the

licensing authority through the Working Party.



         fc )   Accepted       assurances            that    the    Second    Defendants       and

        the     Police       had       agreed    a    system           monitor jpg__

        entering       the    pens       at    the    Leppings       Lane    end,     when    on a

        proper analysis,               it should have been clear that no such

        system could operate efficiently, particularly if the pens

        were not filled one bv one.
                                               7



This amounts to saying



        (i)     that    the    Leppings       Lane   end was    incapable         of    being

        safely and efficiently policed, and



        (ii) that the Fourth Defendants should have known this.



Both premises are denied.                    Pens 3 and 4 were created in 198 5.

The    Fourth       Defendants       knew,    because they were so instructed,

that the purpose of radial fences was to enable the filling of

pens    to     be   controlled       individually      and to      enable       individual

pens to be closed as and when those in charge judged it right

to     do     so.        The    Fourth        Defendants     proposed       a    different

structural          approach     (separate      turnstiles),       which        would    have

obviated the need for such monitoring.                       They were rightly not

asked to advise on how the control of the filling of the pens

was to be carried out, which was not a structural matter but a

matter        for   consultation        between      the    Police    and       the    Second

Defendants.            Such arrangements were not the responsibility of

the Fourth Defendants,               but they had no reason to suppose that

proper arrangements could not be made or that the arrangements

made    between        the    Police    and    the   Second Defendants            would be

unsatisfactory or (as happened on 15th April 1989) would not be

carried out.



        -Lfl,)- Rg.gar&sd      £h£    pens    formed   bv    the     radial      fences    as

        still constituting one individual terrace.
The   Fourth      Defendants    regarded the pens       for what they were:

sub-divisions of a terrace which were not self-contained (i.e.

having separate entrances,          toilets and refreshment facilities)

but were capable of being closed individually.



       is.I     Failed to advise against the removal of barrier 144

       and     failed   to   warn   the    Second   Defendants.   the   Officer

       Working Partv and/or the Third Defendants of tJtis -foUMr?

       thereof.



On 18th June 1986 there was a meeting between Mr. R. H. Chester,

the Second Defendants then Club Secretary,               and representatives

of    the     Police.   The matters       discussed included the possible

removal of certain crush barriers at the Leppings Lane standing

area in order to assist the flow of spectators.                   It was noted

in Mr.      Chester's minutes of the meeting that the matter "would

have to be taken up when the inspection of the Ground relative

to the issuing of the Safety Certificate takes place.".                     The

Fourth Defendants were not informed.



At the Working Party annual inspection on 7th August 1986 the

Police proposed that,          inter alia,     two sections of barrier 144

should be removed before the start of the next season.                      The

Fourth      Defendants,      who were     represented at the inspection by

Mr.    Strange,     had no prior knowledge that the matter was to be

raised.          The Working Party did not request the presence or

advice of Dr. 'Eastwood.             The reasons advanced by the Police

for the removal of barrier 144 were that in their experience it

had proved to be a vantage point close                 to the mouth of the
tunnel    for groups    of spectators,         who refused to move despite

requests by the Police to do so, thereby causing congestion and

backfilling of the tunnel with consequent risk to safety and

risk of friction and disorder.             They were also concerned about

the risk to safety if the spectators on the terrace had to be

evacuated through the tunnel in an emergency.



The Police wanted the barrier to be removed before the first

home match of the season against Everton on 25th August 198 6,

when   a particularly      large    crowd was      expected because         of the

opening of the new Spion Kop development.



Inspector    Calvert    put     forward the     Police   proposal     and    their

reasons    for it to the other members             of the Working Party as

they were    standing at the end of the tunnel                 and directly in

front of barrier 144.



Mr. Strange said that if barrier 144 were removed, the capacity

of the terrace would theoretically be affected,                 because of the

reduced number of barriers.              Inspector Calvert stated that in

his opinion,       from an operational viewpoint,           the removal of the

barrier would make the pen safer and the control of spectators

easier.      Mr.     Strange raised the possibility of extending the

barrier    immediately     in    front    of   barrier   144    to   the    radial

fence,    but Inspector Calvert was opposed to this idea.                    After

discussion     the    Working    Party    approved    the    proposal       of   the

Police that the sections of barrier should be removed and the

Third Defendants       (by their Chief Licensing Officer Mr. Bownes)
                                          10
affirmed   the     decision      that    the   two    sections    of barrier        144

should be removed.



During the whole inspection 9 items were identified where the

Working Party required work to be                 carried out by the Second

Defendants.         Mr.    Strange reported to the Second Defendants

accordingly.         Of    the    9 items,       he was      instructed     that    the

Second Defendants would themselves attend to two items                       (nos.     3

and 4 on the list of items               made by Mr.         Strange)   and he was

instructed to deal with the remainder (including barrier 144).



Mr.   Strange also reported on the inspection to Dr.                      Eastwood.

It is denied that the Fourth Defendants were under any duty to

try to obtain a reversal of the decision made in relation to

barrier 144.



In any event, Dr. Eastwood did not consider the decision of the

Working    Party    to    be   unreasonable.            To    have   left    the    two

sections of the barrier in face of the experience of, and risks

to    safety     identified        by,     the       Police    would      have     been,

irresponsible.            The risk which occurred on 15th April                    1989,

when the Police opened Gate C to allow the uncontrolled entry

of some 2000 spectators into pens 3 and 4 at a time when they

were already manifestly full,              was not a risk which the Fourth

Defendants either foresaw or ought to have foreseen at the time

of the removal of barrier 144.                   It is also expressly denied

that the removal of barrier 144 caused the injury or death of

the deceased.

     (f)         Failed   to advise       the Second Defendants               against _the

     placing         and/or      continuing        to    have     in    place       is__

     perimeter        fence      gates    which     were    too    small      to    be    exit

     gates in breach of the Green Guide and/or failed properly

     to advise the Second Defendants as to the failings of the

     gates.



The gate to pen 3 was installed in 1985.                          It was .85 metre in

width.           At that time the Green Guide               (1976 Edition) did not

recommend a minimum width for perimeter gates.                               The relevant

provisions were as foilows:



     11 7. 9       Pitch perimeter fence/wall.



     7. 9. 1          This fence         should     be     designed         to     keep

     spectators           off the pitch but gates or other access

     points         should be provided            for use    in an          emergency

     and, at those grounds where a perimeter track is used

     as      part    of    the   exit     system,       for the    departure         of

     spectators at the end of play.



         7. 9. 2    Access points        should be controlled,               so that

     immediate access to the pitch or perimeter track can

     be ensured in the event of an emergency.



         18. 3      Access to     playing        pitches    must       be    made    as

         difficult as possible in normal circumstances while,

         at the     same time,      providing the Police with proper

         access to the terraces for purposes of crowd control
                                           12

       and enabling the pitch to be used in the event of

       serious emergency. "



Gate    3 was    not part of the exit system for the departure of

spectators at the end of play and, without it, pen 3 satisfied

the evacuation time required by the Green Guide.                       The width of

perimeter       gates   had    been    considered       by    the   Working     Party,

including       the   Police   and    Fire      Service,     on various      occasions

prior to 1985.



The Green Guide         (1986 Edition) introduced (in paragraph 215) a

recommendation that the perimeter gates should have a minimum

width of 1.1 metres.              The new recommendations were considered

by     the   Working     Party,      who     reasonably       concluded      that   the

existing     perimeter gates          had in practice proved satisfactory

for their purpose and did not require to be widened.



Further,     it is denied that widening gate 3 from . 85 metre to

1. 1 metres would have averted the death of the deceased.                           The

perimeter       gates   were   neither       designed      nor    intended    for   the

evacuation of large numbers in a short time,                      and a gate of 1. 1

metre width would no more have served that purpose than a gate

of . 85 metre width.



              Failed properly to test the crush barriers in pen 3

        to ensure they were of adequate strength and/or failed to

        advise    the   Second       Defendant     of   the      weaknesses    in   the

        barrier which collapsed.
                                          13

The   barriers    in     pen    3 were     properly       tested      by    the    Fourth

Defendants in July 1988 in accordance with Annex C to the Green

Guide,    1986   Edition.          The    sections        of    barrier     124A    which

collapsed on 15th April 1989 passed the test.                         Further,      or in

the alternative,        if it be alleged that the Fourth Defendants

interpretation of Annex C was incorrect,                   the Fourth Defendants

say that



      (a)     their     interpretation         was   reasonable       and     coincided

      with that of (inter alios) the structural engineer of the

      Third Defendants, to whom the test results were sent;



      (b)     if it be contended that the section which had a 5 9%

      recovery at the first application of load, 74% recovery on

      second application and             100% on third application,                should

      thereupon have been re-tested,                 on a re-test it would have

      shown 100% recovery on each application.



Barrier      124A was    capable       of withstanding,          and did withstand,

the load for which it was designed.                   The cause of the collapse

of two sections on 15th April 1989 was that it was subjected to

substantially greater load.



      llll    Failed     to    aflvi&S    £ha    Second        Defendants     that     the

      existing     turnstile       facilities        at   the    Leppings     Lane     end

      were inadequate to accommodate a crowd of 24.000 and that

      for such facilities t o b e adequate they should include the

      matters     set     out     in     sub-paragraph          (a)   above       of   the
                                        14

       Particulars      of   Negligence      and    Breach   of    Statutory     Duty

       against the Second Defendants.



It was never part of the Fourth Defendants retainer to advise

the Second Defendants in relation to the number of persons who

could be    admitted through their turnstiles in any particular

time or what number of turnstiles they ought to provide (or use

for any particular match).



Further    and   more    specifically,        the     allegation     in   this   sub-

paragraph presumes that the Fourth Defendants knew, or ought to

have known,      that 24, 000 spectators were to be admitted to the

ground through the turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end.                          This

was not so.



The necessity to admit 24,000 spectators through the Leppings

Lane end turnstiles          arose from the decision            (about which the

Fourth    Defendants     were 'not    consulted,        since     it was    none    of

their business) to close the turnstiles in Penistone Road which

normally served the North Stand,              so diverting 6,000 spectators

from the turnstiles in Penistone Road to the Leppings Lane end.

If those 6,000 spectators had not had to use the Leppings Lane

end,   there would have been no difficulty at the Leppings Lane

turnstiles.           (At    about   2.45     p.m.     the   crowd    outside      the

Leppings Lane turnstiles numbered about 5,000).



The Green Guide,        1986 Edition,        states    (paragraph 47) that the

maximum    notional      rate   at   which     spectators       can pass    through

turnstiles will depend on a variety of factors                     (design and age
                                                   15

of equipment,       ticketing arrangements,                     etc. ) but in general is

unlikely to exceed 750 persons per hour.



Without the additional 6,000 spectators,                           there would have been

23    turnstiles         at     the    Leppings          Lane     end       to     serve       18,000

spectators.        At a rate of entry of 750 per hour, the admission

time would have been                 62. 6 minutes.              At a rate of entry of

1, 000    per    hour         (because       it    was    an    all        ticket    match),      the

admission time would have been 47 minutes.                                  By comparison the

current      recommendation made by Lord Justice Taylor                                   following

the   Hillsborough Inquiry is that the turnstiles                                   serving each

viewing area should be capable of admitting the intended number

of spectators within one hour.

       failure within the ground to sign clearly the existence of

       and the wav to pens one/two and six/seven.



Save on occasions when they received specific instructions                                        (in

particular,       to provide           certain          fire    exit       emergency      signs    at

Fourth    Defendants           had     any    involvement             or    responsibility         in

relation to signing either inside or outside the ground.                                         This

would in any event be linked with other matters,                                    such as the

turnstile       and ticketing arrangements                      and with which parts               of

The Fourth Defendants               repeat the matters pleaded in answer to

allegation           (f).     The     pens     satisfied      the    evacuation    times

required        by    the   Green     Guide.        The    only    practicable    way   of

enabling evacuation of the terraces in a significantly shorter

time would have been to remove the perimeter fence,                            so as to

enable mass exodus on to the pitch, which it was the purpose of

the   perimeter         fence   to prevent.           The    recommendations      of th.e

Green Guide in relation to perimeter fences involved a balance

between (1) the need in normal circumstances to keep spectators

in, and- (2) the need for access or egress in case of emergency.

It was       never the intention of the Green Guide that— perimete-p—

gates    should be used for a mass exodus                        on to the pitch,       for
                                           17

^hich       purpose      the     gates     recommended           would       have     been

insufficient.

The history of,         and reasons for,             the introduction of the pens

are set out in sub-paragraphs              (a) and (c) above.             The function

of   such     crowd    enclosures    was        to    limit    crowd     movement,      as

recommended       by    Paragraph    18. 1 of         the     1976   Green    Guide    and

Paragraph 206 of the 1986 Green Guide.                        It is denied that the

pens     were    intrinsically       dangerous          or    constituted        a   trap.

Danger arose       only because those responsible for filling them

caused or permitted them to become dangerously over-crowded.

This     allegation        and     its     relevance           are     denied.         The

certification of capacity was the responsibility of the local

authority.       The Fourth Defendants had pointed out to them that _

the removal of barriers should in theory lead to a reduction of

certified capacity as calculated by the Green Guide;                           it was a

matter for their decision what, if any, reduction to make.                             The

decision not to do so was not unreasonable.                          In any event,     tfie

matter is irrelevant to what happened- on the 15th April                              1989

         v        alleged, the allegation is denied) that the number of

                  spectators admitted to the terrace was excessive.                                                                                                                      At

                  the time when Gate C was opened, there was ample room

                  remaining in pens           1,        2,               6 and 7 for the spectators

                  waiting to be admitted.



9.    Save        that      it    is   admitted that the deceased's                                                                           death was

paragraph 11 of the Amended Statement of Claim.                                                                                        Further,                                    the

alleged          causation        thereof    by     negligence                                                   on   the              part                 of                     the

10.   The death of the deceased was                                           caused by the uncontrolled

influx of a large number of spectators                                                                  into pen 3 at a time

when it          was already obviously full.                                     This influx was caused                                                                                   by

the act          of opening gate C in order to admit the large number                                                                                                                      of

spectators            who were pressing outside it,                                                              without                    closing the

gates at either end of the tunnel which led to pen 3 or posting

Police Officers and/or stewards to direct spectators away from

the tunnel.                Such act was not only wholly unforeseeable at any
                                       19

time by the Fourth Defendants,              but was wholly contrary to the

basis    of the Fourth Defendants           instructions       at the time when

pen 3 was created and at all material times thereafter.                         If,

which is expressly denied, there was any negligence on the part

of    the   Fourth   Defendants,     their     servants     or agents,     in any

respect     as    alleged,   the   opening     of   gate   C    and uncontrolled

admission of a large influx of supporters into pen 3 when it

was already obviously full was a novus actus interveniens.



11.     Save as is hereinbefore expressly admitted, each and every

matter alleged in the Amended Statement of Claim is denied.

         Working     Party      ("the        Working          Party")          which        included      senior

         representatives          of    the       Police          and        the    Fire     Service      and      a

         Chartered    Engineer         representative                   of    the    Building       Surveyor7 s

         Department of the Third Defendants.                                  It is admitted that the

         Working    Party      made     periodic          visits             to the       stadium    (normally

         twice    a year)      and directed and approved the                                carrying out of

         works     thereto.                  On     the           abolition          of     the     SYCC,        its

         responsibilities          under          the     said          Act        passed    to     the     Third

         Defendants,      who continued to use the Working Party as before,

         except    that     the    bi-annual             inspections                were    replaced        by    an

         annual inspection.                 It was normal for a representative of the

         Fourth    Defendants          to    be    present          at        the    bi-annual       or   annual

         inspections, but they were not members of the Working Party and

         did not otherwise attend its meetings.



         4.      Paragraph 6 of the Amended Statement of Claim is denied.

         The     Fourth   Defendants          were        initially            engaged       by     the   Second

         Defendants       to   advise        and        act       for    the        Second    Defendants          as

         Structural       Engineers          in     their           dealings          with     the     SYCC       in

         connection with the obtaining of a Safety Certificate under the
1975 Act.      After the grant of the Safety Certificate, they were
employed as follows:



        (1)    to carry out an annual structural inspection of the

        stands and terraces,            including testing the crush barriers,

        and to report thereon to the Second Defendants;



        (2)    to attend the bi-annual or annual inspections by the

        Working Party;



        (3)    to    act     for   and    advise    the    Second   Defendants        in

        relation       to    any   other       matters    upon   which    they      were

        instructed.           Full details of such matters are contained

        in the Fourth Defendants               files,    a list of which will he

        disclosed on discovery.



It is admitted that the Fourth Defendants also owed a duty of

care    towards      visitors      to    the   stadium to      exercise   reasonable

skill and care in the performance of their duties to the Second

Defendants,         so as not by a careless act or omission on the part

of     the    Fourth       Defendants     to    cause     or   expose    visitors     to

foreseeable injury.                It is denied that the Fourth Defendants

owed any other or wider duty to visitors and, in particular it

is denied that their duty to visitors was wider in scope than

their duty to the Second Defendants.                      It is also denied that

the Fourth Defendants              ever had any general          retainer   from the

Second Defendants to act as "Safety Consultants" in relation to

all safety matters.
5.     Paragraph 7 of the Amended Statement of Claim is admitted.



6.     Save    that   it     is   admitted     that   the    deceased         died    as   a

result of crushing due to overcrowding of spectators in Pen 3,

no    admissions      are    made   as    to   paragraph       8    of   the        Amended

Statement of Claim.



7.     The Fourth Defendants do not plead to the allegations made

against the First,          Second and Third Defendants in paragraphs 9

and 10 of the Amended Statement of Claim.



8.     It is denied that there was,               or that the deceased's death

was caused by, negligence on the part of the Fourth Defendants,

their servants        or experts,        as alleged in paragraph               10 of the

Amended Statement of Claim or at all.                       As to the particulars

of    the     negligence      alleged,     the     Fourth     Defendants            say    as

follows:



       (a )    Failed as the Second Defendants Safety Consultant to

       advise against the erection of radial                      fences without the

       installation         of separate turnstiles           to each pen created

       thereby.



The    "Second     Defendants'       Safety      Consultant"        is   an    incorrect

description of the role of the Fourth Defendants,                        which was as

stated above.



At the relevant time the conventional wisdom regarding radial

fences      was   that   contained       in the    Guide     to    Safety      at    Sports
Grounds        (Football),             1976        Edition            ("the       1976    Green     Guide").

This recommended: -



        " 18. 1. Crowd movement on terraces should be severely

       limited        in     order           to    give          the    Police          the     fullest

        opportunity for crowd control.                                   Less problems occur

       where        the    terraces             are divided             as     far       as    possible

        into    sections             by     the    use          of    railings       or barriers,

        both    radial           and       lateral.                   Ideally,       each       section

        should        be        serviced              by        its     own       entrance/exits,

        refreshment facilities and toilets."



Accordingly,         separate turnstiles were in no way regarded as a

pre-condition             for    the        introduction               of     radial          fences.        The

general recommendation of radial fences in the Green Guide was

reinforced in the case of Hillsborough by the Police, who urged

their     introduction               as     a     means         of     enabling         them to         exercise

greater     control         over           the     terrace.                 Their introduction               was

first     advocated             by     the        Police         following          the       experience      of

policing       the        1981       FA     Cup       semi-final,             during which              crushing

occurred due          (in the opinion of the Police) to their inability

to exercise sufficient control over the movement of spectators,

and was        supported             and    approved             by the Working Party.                       The

Fourth     Defendants                were       not    responsible                for     the    operational

control of the terrace.                            Both in 1981               (when the first radial

fences were introduced)                         and in          1985    (when more radial                 fences

were     introduced)             the        Fourth          Defendants            recommended            schemes

which     would       have        provided            separate           turnstiles             serving     each

section        of    the     terrace.                      In    1981       the    Fourth        Defendants,

    through        Mr.    John    Strange,      prepared             for and presented to the

    Second     Defendants          through          its       then    Club       Secretary       Mr.     Eric

    England,       two alternative schemes for the installation of radial

    fences     and the re-organisation of turnstiles                                at the Leppings

    Lane     end,        with    separate       capacity             figures       for    the    separate

    sections of terrace which would be created by the radial fences

    and separate turnstiles for each section.                                     In 1985 the Fourth

    Defendants           proposed      further        alternative               schemes     which      would

    also have provided separate turnstiles for each section of the

    terrace.



            .
            (b )    Failed when their own plans                            for new turnstiles             had

           been      abandoned,         to    advise          the    Second       Defendants        of    the

           necessity to remove the radial fences.



    The Fourth Defendants made plain their preference for separate

    turnstiles           in preparing and presenting their plans;                                   but to

    term    the     provision          of    separate         turnstiles          a "necessity",           if

    there      were        to     be        radial        fences,           would        have    been      an

    overstatement,               and        would     have           gone       beyond      either        the

    recommendations of the Green Guide or the requirements of the

    licensing authority through the Working Party.



            (c )     Accepted       assurances            that       the    Second Defendants             and

            the     Police       had    agreed        a       system       of    monitoring        numbers

            entering        the pens         at the           Leppings       Lane    end,       when     on a

            proper analysis.                it should have been clear that no such

            system could operate efficiently, particularly if the pens

            were not filled one bv one.
This amounts to saying



        (i)     that    the    Leppings       Lane   end was    incapable         of    being

        safely and efficiently policed, and



        (ii) that the Fourth Defendants should have known this.



Both premises are denied.                    Pens 3 and 4 were created in 198 5.

The    Fourth       Defendants       knew,    because they were so instructed,

that the purpose of radial fences was to enable the filling of

pens    to     be   controlled       individually      and    to   enable       individual

pens to be closed as and when those in charge judged it right

to     do     so.        The     Fourth       Defendants     proposed       a    different

structural          approach     (separate      turnstiles),       which        would    ha"ve

obviated the need for such monitoring.                        They were rightly not

asked to advise on how the control of the filling of the pens

was to be carried out, which was not a structural matter but a

matter        for   consultation        between      the    Police    and       the    Second

Defendants.            Such arrangements were not the responsibility of

the Fourth Defendants,               but they had no reason to suppose that

proper arrangements could not be made or that the arrangements

made    between        the    Police    and    the   Second    Defendants         would    be

unsatisfactory or (as happened on 15th April 1989) would not be

carried out.



        (dl     Regarded       the    pens    formed   bv    the     radial      fences    as

        still constituting one individual terrace.
The   Fourth      Defendants     regarded the pens       for what    they were:

sub-divisions of a terrace which were not self-contained (i. e.

having separate entrances,           toilets and refreshment facilities)

but were capable of being closed individually.



       (e )    Failed to advise against the removal of barrier 144

       and    failed     to   warn   the    Second. Defendants.     the   Of fic er

       Working Partv and/or the Third Defendants of the dangers

       thereof.



On 18th June 1986 there was a meeting between Mr. R. H. Chester,

the Second Defendants then Club Secretary,                and representatives

of    the    Police.     The matters       discussed included the possible

removal of certain crush barriers at the Leppings Lane standing

area in order to assist the flow of spectators.                     It was noted

in Mr.      Chester's minutes of the meeting that the matter "would

have to be taken up when the inspection of the Ground relati-ve

to the issuing of the Safety Certificate takes place.".                        The

Fourth Defendants were not informed.



At the Working Party annual inspection on 7th August 1986 the

Police proposed that,           inter alia,     two sections of barrier 144

should be removed before the start of the next season.                         The

Fourth      Defendants,       who were     represented at the inspection by

Mr.    Strange,    had no prior knowledge that the matter was to be

raised.         The Working Party did not request the presence or

advice of Dr.          Eastwood.      The reasons advanced by the Police

for the removal of barrier 144 were that in their experience it

had proved to be a vantage point                 close   to the mouth of the
tunnel    for groups    of spectators,         who refused to move despite

requests by the Police to do so, thereby causing congestion and

backfilling of the tunnel with consequent risk to safety and

risk of friction and disorder.             They were also concerned about

the risk to safety if the spectators on the terrace had to be

evacuated through the tunnel in an emergency.



The Police wanted the barrier to be removed before the first

home match of the season against Everton on 25th August 1986,

when   a particularly      large    crowd was      expected because          of the

opening of the new Spion Kop development.



Inspector    Calvert    put     forward the      Police   proposal     and    their

reasons    for it to the other members             of the Working Party as

they were    standing at        the end of the tunnel           and directly in

front of barrier 144.



Mr. Strange said that if barrier 144 were removed, the capacity

of the terrace would theoretically be affected,                  because of the

reduced number of barriers.              Inspector Calvert stated that in

his opinion,       from an operational viewpoint,           the removal of the

barrier would make the pen safer and the control of spectators

easier.      Mr.     Strange raised the possibility of extending the

barrier    immediately     in    front    of    barrier   144    to   the    radial

fence,    but Inspector Calvert was opposed to this idea.                     After

discussion     the    Working    Party    approved    the    proposal        of   the

Police that the sections          of barrier should be removed and the

Third Defendants       (by their Chief Licensing Officer Mr.                Bownes)
                                           10

affirmed    the    decision       that    the    two    sections    of    barrier      144

should be removed.



During the whole inspection 9 items were identified where the

Working    Party required work to be               carried out by the Second

Defendants.         Mr.    Strange       reported to the Second Defendants

accordingly.         Of     the    9 items,       he    was    instructed       that   the

Second Defendants would themselves attend to two items                           (nos.    3

and   4 on the list        of items       made    by Mr.       Strange)    and he was

instructed to deal with the remainder (including barrier 144).



Mr.   Strange also reported on the inspection to Dr.                        Eastwood.

It is denied that the Fourth Defendants were under any duty to

try to obtain a reversal of the decision made in relation to

barrier 144.



In any event, Dr. Eastwood did not consider the decision of the

Working    Party    to    be   unreasonable.              To    have     left    the    two

sections of the barrier in face of the experience of, and risks

to    safety      identified        by,     the        Police    would      have       been

irresponsible.            The risk which occurred on 15th April                     1989,

when the Police opened Gate C to allow the uncontrolled entry

of some 2000 spectators into pens 3 and 4 at a time when they

were already manifestly full,              was not a risk which the Fourth.

Defendants either foresaw or ought to have foreseen at the time

of the removal of barrier 144.                    It is also expressly denied

that the removal of barrier 144 caused the injury or death of

the deceased.
     ■If L       Failed   to advise         the Second       Defendants     against      the

     Placing         and/or        continuing       to    have      in    place    in    the

     perimeter         fence       gates    which    were    too    small       to be    exit

     gates in breach of the Green Guide and/or failed properly

     to advise the Second Defendants as to the failings of the

     gates.



The gate to pen 3 was installed in 1985.                           It was .85 metre in

width.           At that time the Green Guide                (1976 Edition)        did not

recommend a minimum width for perimeter gates.                              The relevant

provisions were as follows:



     "7. 9        Pitch perimeter fence/wall.



     7. 9. 1         This       fence     should     be    designed        to     keep

     spectators           off     the pitch but gates            or other access

     points         should be       provided       for use    in    an emergency

     and, at those grounds where a perimeter track is used

     spectators at the end of play.



     7. 9. 2        Access points          should be controlled,            so that

         access to the terraces for purposes of crowd control

            and enabling the pitch to be used in the event of

            serious emergency. "



    Gate    3 was     not part of the exit system for the departure                       of

    spectators at the end of play and, without it, pen 3 satisfied

    the evacuation time required by the Green Guide.                        The width of

    perimeter       gates    had    been    considered       by    the   Working     Party,

    including       the   Police    and    Fire      Service,     on various      occasions

    prior to 1985.



    The Green Guide          (1986 Edition) introduced (in paragraph 215) a

    recommendation that the perimeter gates should have a minimum

    width of 1. 1 metres.              The new recommendations were considered

    by     the     Working    Party,      who     reasonably       concluded      that   the

    existing       perimeter gates         had in practice proved satisfactory

    for their purpose and did not require to be widened.



    Further,       it is denied that widening gate 3 from . 85 metre to

    1. 1 metres would have averted the death of the deceased.                            The

    perimeter       gates    were   neither       designed      nor    intended    for   the

    evacuation of large numbers in a short time,                       and a gate of 1. 1

    metre width would no more have served that purpose than a gate

    of . 85 metre width.



            la l    Failed properly to test the crush barriers in pen 3

            to ensure they were of adequate strength and/or failed to

            advise    the    Second     Defendant       of   the      weaknesses    in   the

            barrier which collapsed.
                                           13

The   barriers       in   pen     3 were properly tested                by   the    Fourth

Defendants in July 1988 in accordance with Annex C to the Green

Guide,      1986   Edition.         The    sections       of    barrier      124A    which

collapsed on 15th April           1989 passed the test.                 Further,     or in

the   alternative, if it be alleged that                   the Fourth Defendants

interpretation of Annex C was incorrect,                       the Fourth Defendants

say that



      (a)       theirinterpretation        was    reasonable           and   coincided

      with that of (inter alios) the structural                        engineer of the

      Third Defendants, to whom the test                  results were sent;



      (b)       if it be contended that the section which had a 59%

      recovery at the first application of load,                       74% recovery on

      second application and 100% on third application,                              should

      thereupon have been re-tested,               on a re-test it would have

      shown 100% recovery on each application.



Barrier        124A was   capable      of withstanding,          and did withstand,

the load for which it was designed.                   The cause of the collapse

of two sections on 15th April 1989 was that it was subjected to

substantially greater load.



         (h)    Failed to     advise      the    Second        Defendants       that     the

      existing       turnstile      facilities      at    the     Leppings      Lane     end

      were inadequate to accommodate a crowd of 24.000 and that

      for such facilities to be adequate they should include the

      matters       set     out   in      sub-paragraph          (a)    above       of   the
                                        14

       Particulars      of   Negligence      and    Breach   of    Statutory     Duty

       against the Second Defendants.



It was    never part of the Fourth Defendants retainer to advise

the Second Defendants in relation to the number of persons who

could be    admitted through their turnstiles                in any particular

time or what number of turnstiles they ought to provide (or use

for any particular match).



Further    and   more    specifically,        the     allegation     in   this   sub-

paragraph presumes that the Fourth Defendants knew, or ought to

have known,      that 24,000 spectators were to be admitted to the

ground through the turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end.                          This

was not so.



The necessity to admit 24,000 spectators through the Leppings

Lane end turnstiles          arose   from the decision            (about which the

Fourth    Defendants     were   not    consulted,       since     it was    none   of

their business) to close the turnstiles in Penistone Road which

normally served the North Stand,              so diverting 6,000 spectators

from the turnstiles in Penistone Road to the Leppings Lane end.

If those 6,000 spectators had not had to use the Leppings Lane

end,   there would have been no difficulty at the Leppings Lane

turnstiles.           (At    about    2.45    p.m.     the   crowd    outside      the

Leppings Lane turnstiles numbered about 5,000).



The Green Guide,        1986 Edition,        states    (paragraph 47) that the

maximum    notional      rate   at    which    spectators       can pass     through

turnstiles will depend on a variety of factors                     (design and age
                                                    15

of equipment,       ticketing arrangements,                      etc. ) but in general              is

unlikely to exceed 7 50 persons per hour.



Without the additional 6,000 spectators,                            there would have been

23    turnstiles         at    the       Leppings         Lane     end       to     serve       18,000

spectators.         At a rate of entry of 750 per hour, the admission

time would have been                 62. 6 minutes.               At a rate of entry of

1,000    per     hour     (because            it    was    an    all     ticket      match),       the

admission time would have been 47 minutes.                                   By comparison the

current        recommendation made by Lord Justice Taylor                                  following

the   Hillsborough Inquiry is                      that the turnstiles              serving each

viewing area should be capable of admitting the intended number

of spectators within one hour.



        (i )    Failed        to    advise         the    Second        Defendants         of    their

        failure within the ground to sign clearly the existence of

        and the wav to pens one/two and six/seven.



Save on occasions when they received specific instructions                                         (in

particular,       to provide             certain         fire    exit       emergency      signs    at

locations         requested              by    the        Fire    Service,           to     provide

advertisement            boards          for       the    restaurant          and     to     provide

direction        signs    to       the    sports         hall)    it    is    denied       that    the

Fourth     Defendants          had       any       involvement         or    responsibility         in

relation to signing either inside or outside the ground.                                          This

would in any event be linked with other matters,                                     such as the

turnstile        and ticketing arrangements                      and with which parts               of

the ground were to be used for any particular match, which were
                                               16

likewise       matters     outside      the    scope      of   the    Fourth    Defendants
retainer.

      sufficient means of escape of the crowd from the pens in

      the Football Association of the need to prQvj^a_§us^_asaiiS

        lixl     To design a sufficient means of escape as above.




The Fourth Defendants              repeat the matters pleaded in answer to

allegation          (f).     The     pens      satisfied        the    evacuation    times

required       by    the   Green    Guide.          The    only      practicable    way   of

enabling evacuation of the terraces in a significantly shorter

time would have been to remove the perimeter fence,                              so as to

enable mass exodus on to the pitch, which it was the purpose of

the   perimeter          fence   to prevent.           The     recommendations      of    the

Green Guide in relation to perimeter fences involved a balance

between (1) the need in normal circumstances to keep spectators

in, and (2) the need for access or egress in case of emergency.

11 was     never the intention of the Green Guidt* t-.hat pp.r.i-ma±A£-—

gates    should be used for a mass                  exodus         on to the pitch,       for

,which     purpose      the      gates     recommended           would       have     been

insufficient.



         (k)    Sanctioned the use of crowd enclosiirfi which was in

       fact a trap



The history of,        and reasons for,              the introduction of the pens

are set out in sub-paragraphs              (a) and (c) above.            The function

of   such      crowd   enclosures    was        to    limit    crowd     movement,     as

recommended       by   Paragraph     18. 1 of         the     1976   Green    Guide    and

Paragraph 206 of the 1986 Green Guide.                        It is denied that the

pens     were    intrinsically       dangerous          or     constituted       a   trap.

Danger     arose only because those responsible for filling them

caused or permitted them to become dangerously over-crowded.



         (1)    Failed to give adequate consideration and response to

       the Second Defendants'            enquiries concerning the certified

         capacity of the terrace in February. March and April 1987.



This      allegation       and     its     relevance           are     denied.         Th e

certification of capacity was the responsibility of the local

authority.        The Fourth Defendants had pointed_out to them that

the removal of barriers should in theory lead to a reduction of

certified capacity as calculated by the Green Guide;                             it was a

matter for their decision what, if any, reduction to make.                             The

decision not to do so was not unreasonable.                          In any event,     the

matter is irrelevant to what happened on the                           15th April     1989

^because: -

                  way         of   limiting        the        number    on    the    terrace        to    the

                  certified          figure,        whatever           that       figure     might       have
                  been;



                      (ii)     the Health and Safety Executive's best estimate

                  of         the total number who entered through turnstiles A

                  to G and Gate C was                     9734.        The Fourth Defendants do

                  not         understand      it        to         be alleged       (and,     if    it     be
                  -                      ■    —-

          v       alleged, the allegation is denied) that the number of

                  spectators admitted to the terrace was excessive.                                       At

                  the time when Gate C was opened, there was ample room

                  remaining in pens                 1,        2,   6 and 7 for the spect^t^rs

                  waiting to be admitted.



9.    Save        that        it    is   admitted that the deceased's death was

caused       by        crushing      injuries,            no       admissions       are      made    as to

paragraph 11 of the Amended Statement of Claim.                                             Further,     the

alleged       causation            thereof         by    negligence          on    the      part    of   the

Fourth Defendants, their servants or agents, is denied.



10.    The death of the deceased was                                caused by the uncontrolled

influx       of a large             number of spectators                 into pen 3 at a time

when it was already obviously full.                                  This influx was caused               by

the act of opening gate C in order                                 to admit the large number              of

spectators             who were pressing outside it,                          without closing the

gates at either end of the tunnel which led to pen 3 or posting

PoliceOfficers and/or stewards to direct                                     spectators away from

the tunnel.                  Such act was not only wholly unforeseeable at any
                                         19

time by the Fourth Defendants,                but was wholly contrary to the

basis    of the Fourth Defendants             instructions        at the time when

pen 3 was created and at all material times thereafter.                                  If,

which is expressly denied, there was any negligence on the part

of    the   Fourth   Defendants,       their     servants        or agents,    in any

respect     as    alleged,     the   opening     of   gate C and       uncontrolled

admission of a large influx of supporters into pen 3 when it

was already obviously full was a novus actus interveniens.



11.     Save as is hereinbefore expressly admitted,                  each and every

matter alleged in the^Amended^Statement of Claim is denied.

                     DEFENCE OF THE FIRST DEFENDANT




1.   Upon Discovery of the Letters of Administration Paragraph

     1 will be admitted.



2.   Paragraph   2 is admitted.                The PoliceOfficers   included

     members of the Merseyside and Nottingham Constabulary.



3.   Paragraph   3    is a d m i t t e d .




4.   Paragraph   4    is a d m i t t e d .




5.   Paragraph   5 is a d m i t t e d .
6.    Paragraph 6 is admitted.



7&8   These Paragraphs are admitted.



9.    The allegations against the First Defendant of fault and

      causation and negligence and breach of statutory duty are

      each denied.   They are made with hindsight.   The plans and

      actions of the First Defendant were reasonable in the

      circumstances.



      PLANNING CIRCUMSTANCES



      (a)   The ground was chosen as suitable by the Football

            Association.



      (b)   A Safety Certificate granted by the Third Defendant

            was in force.



      (c)   On other occasions similar Police plans had been

            successful.



      (d)   The ground was in regular use which had proved to be

            safe with variable numbers of spectators.



      (e)   No adverse comment about the safety of Policing on

            other similar occasions had been made by any of the

            Second Third or Fourth Defendants or by the Football

            Association or Liverpool Football Club or Nottingham

            Forest Football Club.



                               -   2   -
(f)    The introduction of pens after the 1981 crushing

       incident was believed by each of the Defendants and

       the Football Association to have solved the

       problem.



(g)    The system of "self-levelling" of spectators had

       been successful.



(h)    The Popplewell recommendations had been heeded.



(i)    Most spectators were expected to be good humoured

       and sensible.



(j)    The main Police function was expected to be the

       prevention of crime and control of disorder if

       necessary.



ACTION CIRCUMSTANCES



(i)    About 800 Police were deployed on the match

       operation.



(ii)   Experienced Officers were in charge.



(iii) Disorder would have been likely to result from an

       attempt to hold up the crowd at a point away from

       the ground.



(iv)   T h e d e c i s i o n to   open G a t e   C was   correct.
           (v)          The ••self-levelling" policy was expected to work

                            successfully as on previous occasions.



           (vi)         When the over-crowding emergency was recognised then

                        the crush was relieved as quickly as possible.



10.        If the First Defendant is liable (denied) then

           contribution or indemnity is claimed against the Second

           Defendant and Fourth Defendants under Civil Liability

           (Contribution) Act 1978 on the grounds pleaded in the

           Statement of Claim.



11.       The injuries loss and damage are denied.



12.       On the ground of public policy this action does not lie

           against the First Defendant for the reasons given in Hill

          v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire 1988 2 W.L.R. 1049.



13.        Except as above the facts and matters in the Statement of

          Claim are each denied.

                               DEFENCE OF THE FOURTH DEFENDANTS




1.            Subject         to     production    of    the    relevant       documents,

paragraph 1 of the Statement of Claim is admitted.



2.        Paragraphs            2,    3   and   4 of   the   Statement    of   Claim   are

admitted.
3.    As to paragraph 5 of the Statement of Claim,                           the Safety

Certificate was         issued by the South Yorkshire County Council

("SYCC"),    which was        the body having responsibility under the

Safety of Sports Grounds Ground Act 1975 in the area in which

Hillsborough Stadium is situated until the abolition of SYCC as

a result of local government reorganisation on 1st April 1986.

For the purpose of discharging its responsibilities under the

1975 Act SYCC appointed an Officer Working Party ("the Working

Party") which included senior representatives of the Police and

the Fire Service and a Chartered Engineer representative of the

Building Surveyor's Department of the Third Defendants.                              It is

admitted that         the    Working Party made periodic visits                    to the

stadium     (normally twice a year) and directed and approved the

carrying out of works thereto.                     On the abolition of the SYCC,

its   responsibilities           under the said Act passed to the Third

Defendants,      who continued to use the Working Party as before,

except    that    the       bi-annual      inspections         were   replaced      by    an

annual inspection.               It was normal for a representative of the

Fourth    Defendants        to    be     present    at    the bi-annual          or annual

inspections, but they were not members of the Working Party and

did not otherwise attend its meetings.



4.    Paragraph       6 of the          Statement of Claim is denied.                    The

Fourth      Defendants           were     initially       engaged     by    the     Second

Defendants       to   advise       and    act    for     the   Second   Defendants        as

Structural       Engineers        in     their     dealings      with      the    SYCC    in

connection with the obtaining of a Safety Certificate under the

1975 Act.     After the grant of the Safety Certificate, they were

employed as follows:
                                               3



        (1)   to carry out an annual structural inspection of the

       stands and terraces, including testing the crush barriers,

       and to report thereon to the Second Defendants;



        (2)   to attend the bi-annual or annual inspections by the

       Working Party;



        (3)   to   act        for   and   advise      the    Second   Defendants      in

       relation        to     any   other      matters      upon   which    they   were

       instructed.            Full details of such matters are contained

       in the Fourth Defendants                files,      a list of which will be

       disclosed on discovery.



It is admitted that the Fourth Defendants also owed a duty of

care    towards    visitors         to the stadium to exercise              reasonable

skill and care in the performance of their duties to the Second

Defendants, so as not by a careless act or omission on the part

of     the    Fourth        Defendants    to       cause    or   expose    visitors   to

foreseeable injury.                 It is denied that the Fourth Defendants

owed any other or wider duty to visitors and, in particular it

is denied that their duty to visitors was wider in scope than

their duty to the Second Defendants.                        It is also denied that

the Fourth Defendants               ever had any general retainer from the

Second Defendants to act as "Safety Consultants" in relation to

all safety matters.



5.      Paragraph 7 of the Statement of Claim is admitted.
6.    Save      that     it   is    admitted that       the   deceased         died    as   a

result of crushing due to overcrowding of spectators in Pen 4,

no admissions          are made as to paragraph 8 of the Statement of

Claim.



7.    The Fourth Defendants do not plead to the allegations made

against the First,            Second and Third Defendants in paragraph 9

of the Statement of Claim.



8.    It is denied that there was,                   or that the deceased's death,

was caused by, negligence on the part of the Fourth Defendants,

their servants          or experts,         as alleged in paragraph             9 of the

Statement of Claim or at all.                      As to the particulars of the

negligence alleged, the Fourth Defendants say as follows:



         fa)   Failed as the Second Defendants Safety Consultant to

      advise against the erection of radial fences without the

      installation of separate turnstiles                     to each pen created

      thereby.



The   "Second      Defendants'            Safety   Consultant"       is   an    incorrect

description of the role of the Fourth Defendants, which was as

stated above.



At the relevant time the conventional wisdom regarding radial

fences     was    that    contained in the            Guide   to Safety         at    Sports

Grounds        (Football),         1976    Edition    ("the   1976    Green      Guide").

This recommended: -
       " 18. 1. Crowd movement on terraces should be severely-

       limited       in     order          to    give        the        Police       the     fullest

       opportunity for crowd control.                                   Less problems occur

       where       the    terraces          are divided                 as    far as       possible

       into    sections             by the use              of    railings       or barriers,

       both    radial           and      lateral.                 Ideally,       each        section

        should       be        serviced           by        its     own        entrance/exits,

        refreshment facilities and toilets."



Accordingly,        separate turnstiles were in no way regarded as a

pre-condition            for    the        introduction             of       radial     fences.          The

general recommendation of radial fences in the Green Guide was

reinforced in the case of Hillsborough by the Police, who urged

their    introduction               as     a means          of     enabling them to               exercise

greater    control         over          the     terrace.                Their introduction was

first    advocated             by     the       Police       following           the       experience      of

policing      the        1981       FA     Cup    semi-final,                during which         crushing

occurred due (in the opinion of the Police) to their inability

to exercise sufficient control over the movement of spectators,

and was       supported             and approved by the Working Party.                                    The

Fourth    Defendants                were    not     responsible                for     the    operational

control of the terrace.                          Both in 1981 (when the first radial

fences were introduced)                     and in 1985                 (when more radial              fences

were     introduced)            the        Fourth       Defendants             recommended         schemes

which    would       have        provided          separate             turnstiles           serving     each

section       of    the     terrace.                   In        1981    the     Fourth       Defendants,

through    Mr.      John        Strange,          prepared for and presented to the

Second     Defendants               through       its       then        Club    Secretary        Mr.     Eric

England, two alternative schemes for the installation of radial
fences    and the re-organisation of turnstiles                       at the Leppings

Lane     end,    with    separate     capacity        figures    for     the    separate

sections of terrace which would be created by the radial fences

and separate turnstiles for each section.                        In 1985 the Fourth

Defendants       proposed       further    alternative        schemes     which    would

also have provided separate turnstiles for each section of th.e

terrace.



        (b)     Failed when their own plans              for new turnstiles            had

       been     abandoned,       to advise      the   Second Defendants           of   the

       necessity to remove the radial fences.



The Fourth Defendants made plain their preference for separate

turnstiles       in preparing and presenting their plans;                         but to

term     the    provision       of separate      turnstiles      a "necessity",         if

there      were     to     be     radial       fences,       would     have     been    an

overstatement,           and      would    have       gone      beyond       either    the

recommendations of the Green Guide or the requirements of the

licensing authority through the Working Party.



         (c)    Accepted    assurances       that the        Second    Defendants      ard

        the     Police   had     agreed    a    system     of   monitoring        numbers

        entering the pens           at the      Leppings      Lane    end,     when on a

        proper analysis,          it should have been clear that no such

        system could operate efficiently, particularly if the pens

        were not filled one bv one.



This amounts to saying
        (i)     that    the    Leppings      Lane    end was    incapable         of being

       safely and efficiently policed, and



        (ii) that the Fourth Defendants should have known this.



Both premises are denied.                    Pens 3 and 4 were created in 1985,

The    Fourth Defendants             knew,    because they were so instructed,

that the purpose of radial fences was to enable the filling of

pens    to be       controlled individually            and to enable            individual

pens to be closed as and when those in charge judged it right

to     do     so.        The    Fourth       Defendants      proposed       a    different

structural          approach    (separate       turnstiles),       which        would   have

obviated the need for such monitoring.                        They were rightly not

asked to advise on how the control of the filling of the pens

was to be carried out, which was not a structural matter but a

matter        for   consultation        between      the    Police    and       the   Second

Defendants.            Such arrangements were not the responsibility of

the Fourth Defendants,               but they had no reason to suppose that

proper arrangements could not be made or that the arrangements

made    between        the    Police    and    the   Second Defendants            would ie

unsatisfactory or (as happened on 15th April 1989) would not ie

carried out.



        (dl     Regarded       the    pens    formed   bv    the     radial      fences   as

        still constituting one individual terrace.



The    Fourth       Defendants       regarded the pens         for what they were:

sub-divisions of a terrace which were not self-contained (i. e.
having separate entrances,            toilets and refreshment facilities)

but were capable of being closed individually.



     (e)     Failed      to   advise    the     Second      Defendants         that    the

     existing      turnstile      facilities         at   the    Leppings      Lane    end

     were inadequate to accommodate a crowd of 24.000 and that

     for such facilities to be adequate they should include the

     matters       set    out    in    sub-paragraph            fa)    above    of     the

     Particulars         of   Negligence      and    Breach      of    Statutory      Duty

     against the Second Defendants.



It was never part of the Fourth Defendants retainer to advise

the Second Defendants in relation to the number of persons who

could be admitted through their turnstiles in any particular

time or what number of turnstiles they ought to provide (or use

for any particular match).



Further     and   more    specifically,        the    allegation         in this      sub­

paragraph presumes that the Fourth Defendants knew, or ought to

have known,       that 24,000 spectators were to be admitted to the

ground through the turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end.                               This

was not so.



The necessity to admit 24,000 spectators through the Leppings

Lane end turnstiles           arose from the decision                 (about which the

Fourth     Defendants     were   not    consulted,        since       it was    none    of

their business) to close the turnstiles in Penistone Road which

normally served the North Stand, so diverting 6,000 spectators

from the turnstiles in Penistone Road to the Leppings Lane end.
If those 6,000 spectators had not had to use the Leppings Lane

end,    there would have been no difficulty at the Leppings Lane

turnstiles.                (At      about   2. 45      p. m.   the     crowd     outside     the

Leppings Lane turnstiles numbered about 5,000).



The Green Guide,            1986 Edition,            states     (paragraph 47) that the

maximum         notional       rate    at   which       spectators       can pass       through

turnstiles will depend on a variety of factors                                (design and age

of equipment,         ticketing arrangements,                  etc. ) but in general is

unlikely to exceed 750 persons per hour.



Without the additional 6,000 spectators,                          there would have been

23     turnstiles         at     the    Leppings        Lane     end     to     serve      18,000

spectators.          At a rate of entry of 7 50 per hour, the admission

time would have been                  62. 6 minutes.            At a rate of entry of

1, 000     per     hour        (because     it    was    an    all     ticket    match),      the

admission time would have been 47 minutes.                               By comparison the

current         recommendation made by Lord Justice Taylor                            following

the    Hillsborough Inquiry is that the turnstiles                              serving each

viewing area should be capable of admitting the intended number

of spectators within one hour.



         (f )    Failed        to     advise     the    Second        Defendants      of    their

        failure within the around to sign clearly the existence of

        and the wav to pens one/two and six/seven.



Save on occasions when they received specific instructions (in

particular,         to provide          certain        fire    exit    emergency signs         at

locations          requested           by      the      Fire    Service,         to     provide
                                                    10

advertisement           boards           for     the       restaurant         and     to        provide

direction       signs        to    the     sports        hall)    it    is    denied       that       the

Fourth    Defendants              had    any    involvement            or    responsibility            in

relation to signing either inside or outside the ground.                                           This

would in any event be linked with other matters,                                      such as the

turnstile and ticketing arrangements                             and with which parts of

the ground were to be used for any particular match, which were

likewise      matters        outside          the   scope       of the       Fourth Defendants

retainer.



9.    Save      that     it is          admitted that the deceased's                       death was

caused    by     crushing          injuries,         no     admissions         are    made       as    to

paragraph 10 of the Statement of Claim.                                 Further, the alleged

causation       thereof           by    negligence         on    the    part    of     the       Fourth

Defendants, their servants or agents, is denied.



10.   The injury and death of the deceased was                                      caused by the

uncontrolled influx of a large number of spectators into pen 4

at a time when it was already obviously full.                                   This influx was

caused by the act of opening gate C in order to admit the large

number     of    spectators             who    were      pressing       outside       it,       without

closing     the    gates          at    either      end of the tunnel which led to

pen 4    or     posting           Police       Officers      and/or         stewards       to    direct

spectators away from the tunnel.                            Such act was not only wholly

unforeseeable           at    any time by the Fourth Defendants,                                but was

wholly        contrary            to    the     basis       of    the        Fourth     Defendants

instructions        at the             time when pen 4 was                  created and at all

material        times    thereafter.                 If,    which is         expressly denied,

there was any negligence on the part of the Fourth Defendants,
                                        11

their    servants    or    agents,   in      any    respect     as   alleged,    the

opening of gate C and uncontrolled admission of a large influx

of supporters into pen 4 when it was already obviously full was

a novus actus interveniens.



11.     Save as is hereinbefore expressly admitted, each and every

matter alleged in the Statement of Claim is denied.

                  REPLY TO DEFENCE OF FIRST DEFENDANTS




 1.     Save as in so far as the same consists of admissions, the

 Plaintiff takes issue with the First Defendants upon his Defence
herein.



2.      Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing the

Plaintiff expressly avers:




(i)     in reply to paragraph 2 of the Defence, that any such police

officers who were members of the Merseyside and Nottingham

Constabularies, were at all material times acting under the

direction and control of the First Defendant and/or under the

direction and control of the police officers who as members of the

First Defendant's Force were acting under the First Defendant's

direction and control;




(ii)      in reply to paragraphs 9(f) and (g) of the Defence, that the

introduction of radial fences and pens on the West Terrace in fact

exacerbated the problem of ensuring an even spread of spectators

throughout the Terrace so as to avoid crushing.     The Plaintiff

repeats sub-paragraphs (b) and (f) of the Particulars of Negligence

as against the First Defendant contained in paragraph 9 of her

Statement of Claim.     The Plaintiff avers that the First Defendant

and/or the police officers under his control negligently failed to

appreciate that by reason of the existence of the radial fences, the

projecting walls at the rear of pens three and four and the size and

position of the gates in the radial fences, the crowd required

assistance whether from the police and/or stewards or otherwise, to

enable an even spread to be achieved;




(iii)     that, in reply to paragraph 12 of the Defence, the reasoning

in Hill -v- Chief Constable of West Yorkshire has no application to
the Plaintiff's cause of action herein.     Hill concerns (as the

Plaintiff's action does not) the existence or otherwise of a general

duty of care owed to individual members of the public by the police

in the course of carrying out their function of controlling and

suppressing crime, to identify and apprehend an unknown criminal;

and the reason why if such duty does exist, public policy requires

that the police should not be liable to anyone who suffers injury

through the activities of a criminal whom the police in breach of

such duty have failed to apprehend.

            REQUEST FOR FURTHER AND BETTER PARTICULARS OF

                  THE DEFENCE OF THE FIRST DEFENDANT
UNDER PARAGRAPH 9 ( g )



Of       "The system of "self-levelling" of spectators had been

successful".




State:

         Whether it is alleged that a system of self-levelling had

been in operation during the 1981 F.A. Cup Semi-Final between

alleged, further state in what circumstances and to what extent it

is alleged such system had been successful on the said occasion.




UNDER PARAGRAPH 9(j.)




Of       "The main Police function was expected to be the prevention

of crime and control of disorder if necessary"




State:

         Whether it is alleged the police had functions other than

that stated herein; if so, identify such functions; further, state

in particular whether it is alleged that the police had any function

in relation to crowd safety on the West Terrace of the Leppings Lane

end of the ground, and the control and monitoring of numbers

entering the pens of the Terrace; if it is so alleged, identify what

that function was; if it is not so alleged, state who the police

allege had that function, if anyone.
UNDER PARAGRAPH 9 ( v )



Of       "The "self-levelling" policy was expected to work

successfully as on previous occasions"




State:

         Whether it is alleged that the police had any contingency

plans or maintained any system to be put into operation in the event

of the self-levelling policy not working, and if so, state

particulars of those plans and/or system with such particularity as

will be relied upon at trial.

TAKE NOTICE THAT this action has been brought by the

Plaintiff claims against the First Defendant damages

with interest as appears from the Statement of Claim

herein.


The First Defendant claims against you to be

indemnified against the Plaintiff's claim and the

costs of this action or contribution to such extent

as by the Court may be ordered on the grounds of your

negligence pleaded in the Statement of Claim and

further that:



     1.   You failed to recognise the need to

          provide a sufficient means of escape

          of the crowd from the pens in the

          event of emergency.


     2.   You failed to advise the First, Second

          and Third Defendants and the Football

          Association of the need to provide

          such means of escape.


     3.   You failed to heed that the gates

          provided were not such a sufficient

          means of escape.


     4.   You failed to design a sufficient

          means of escape as above.
     5.     You sanctioned the use of a crowd

            enclosure which was in fact a trap.

                 DEFENCE OF THE SECOND DEFENDANTS
    1.     Subject to production of the material documents paragraph

    1of the Statement of Claim is admitted.



    2.       Save that not all the PoliceOfficers to whom reference is

    made    in   the    Statement     of   Claim   were    members   of   the    South

    Yorkshire Force but they were all acting under the control of the

    First Defendant as pleaded, paragraph 2 of the Statement of Claim

    is admitted and it is averred that the First Defendant was at all

    material times acting in performance or purported performance of

    a      contract     between     himself    and the    Second Defendant       which

    provided for the policing of the ground and of the event in

    question.



    3.     Paragraph 3 of the Statement of Claim is admitted but it is

    averred that at all material times the First Defendant was also

    an occupier of the ground for the purposes of the Occupiers

    Liability Act 1957, and was in control of the event and of all

    members of the public admitted thereto.



    4.     Paragraph 4        of the Statement of Claim is admitted.



    5.       Save      that   the   only   works which     were directed        and/or

    supervised by the Third Defendants were those which were material

    to their safety certificate,              paragraph 5 of the Statement of

    Claim is admitted.



    6.     Paragraph 6 of the Statement of claim is admitted.


                                              2


r
    7.   Save        that the       Deceased was,      in the      premises,     a lawful

    visitor     of    both    the    First    and Second     Defendants        within    the

    meaning of        the    Occupiers7 Liability Act              paragraph    7 of     the

    Statement of Claim is admitted.



    8.   As to the matters alleged in paragraph 8 of the Statement

    of Claim, the Second Defendants:

         (i)         admit that, by 3.00 p.m. at the earliest, pen three

    was overcrowded and that crushing was occurring;

         (ii)    admit that the deceased was subjected to such crushing

    and as a result sustained injury from which he died that day;

         (iii) admit that a barrier collapsed on the terrace but deny

    that this collapse occurred before 3.00 p.m;

         (iv)         deny that the          collapse of the        barrier caused or

    contributed to any injury or death.

         Save as aforesaid paragraph 8 of the Statement of Claim is

    denied.



    9.    It is admitted and averred that the First Defendant acted

    negligently       and    in     breach    of    duty,   both    contractually        and

    statutorily, and that his said breaches caused the death of the

    deceased.    The Second Defendants will adopt and rely upon the

    matters pleaded against the First Defendant under the following

    sub-paragraphs of paragraph 9 of the Statement of Claim:                            (d),

    (e), (h), (k), (1), (m), (n), (o), (p), (q), (r), (s), (t), and

    (u)- subject to the deletion of the word "forwards" from the

    penultimate line of that sub-paragraph.


                                                3


9
    10.    The second Defendants will further rely upon the fact that

    at all material times the First Defendant was in joint occupation

    of the premises and accordingly owed to the Plaintiff a duty to

    ensure that they were reasonably safe for the purposes for which

    he had been invited to visit the same, and in so far as they were

    unsafe that resulted solely from the activities which were under

    the control of the First Defendants.



    11.     It is denied that the Second Defendants acted negligently

    or in breach of duty as alleged or at all or that any negligence

    or breach of duty on their part caused or contributed to the

    death of the deceased.            Without prejudice to the generality of

    that denial the Second Defendants will specifically contend that:



                  (&)         the turnstile facilities at the Leppings Lane

    end of the ground were adequate having regard to the reasonable

    expectations         of    the    Second        Defendants   and   the   policing

    requirements of the First Defendants and the need sensibly to

    balance the demands of segregation and public order on the one

    hand and controlled entry of supporters for a semi-final match

    on the other;



                 (b)                      the signing system within the ground to the pens,

    though admittedly poor, did not cause or contribute and was not

    in    any   way     relevant     to   the   death    of   the   deceased.   It   is

    specifically denied that the crush which led to his death could

    or would have been prevented by better sign-posting;


                                                4


I
                (c)      it would have been wholly impracticable and

    largely pointless to attempt mechanically to monitor the entry

    of numbers to the individual pens the required design of which

    expressly provided for them to remain open and to allow free

    lateral movement. The Second Defendants will further rely upon

    the fact that whatever system had been employed to monitor the

    numbers in pens 3 and 4 it would have been defeated and rendered

    useless by the First Defendant's decision suddenly and without

    warning to open "C" gate and thereby to allow approximately 2,000

    persons directly,     rapidly and without control to enter those

    pens;



                (d)    it is denied that the police at any material time

    gave    any or any adequate warning        that the designated capacity

    of the Terrace was too high for safety.           It is admitted and in

    so far as it is not alleged it is averred that in a letter dated

    5th June 1981 the police did express the view that the terrace

    was "...not constructed to give maximum aid to the packing and

    control of the crowd and the accepted crowd capacity is such that

    there is no safety margin."         The second defendants will rely upon

    the fact that following their receipt of that letter the design

    of the terrace was altered in accordance with the suggestions of

    the police and with the approval of the third defendants and that

    the    certified   capacity   was    thereafter   retained   at   the   same

    figures;




                                           5


1
             (e)      there    was    at        all    material    times    a   clear

understanding between police and the Second Defendants as to the

manner in which the numbers in the pens would be monitored and

controlled by the police,          who alone were occupying the only

positions from which this could effectively be done, and in this

regard the Second Defendants will particularly rely upon the fact

that the police well knew that none of the Second Defendants'

employees was or was required by them (the police) to be present

in the control      box, on the terrace or in the perimeter area;



             (f)     no representation of              any kind was made by or

with the knowledge of the Second Defendants to the City Council

concerning any agreed system of crowd control and if, which is

not admitted, any         representation was made it was made by the

First Defendants;



             (g)    if and to the extent that the configuration of

the terrace dictated a need for the crowd to be assisted in

spreading itself evenly,        the Second Defendants were entitled

reasonably    to   have   regard     to       the    fact   that   the   police   had

exclusive control of that crowd;



             (h)   they did inform the police of the estimated flow

ratethrough the turnstiles - and,                   in doing so, in fact under­

estimated that rate.        The Second Defendants will further rely

upon the fact that their said estimation would in fact have been

exceeded if the area outside the turnstiles had been sensibly and

properly policed;


                                          6
             (i)    they were entitled to and did rely upon the fact

that the police had a position of unparrelled advantage from

which to view the state of the terrace - both from their control

room and from the perimeter, and that the police had control of,

or the means to control, the crowd thereon at all material times;



             (j)        there was at all material times a perfectly

satisfactory system for keeping police on the concourse informed

of   the   state   of   the   terrace       and   efficient   and   expensive

equipment had been installed at the request of the police by the

Second Defendants and at their expense in order to facilitate

that; and there should have been no conceivable advantage to be

derived from informing the stewards on the concourse of the state

of the terrace;



             (k)        the only reasonable means by which spectators

could effectively have been directed from pens 3 and 4 was the

closing of the tunnel. It should have been wholly unnecessary for

any steward to have been involved in that simple process. There

was a moveable barrier available for the purpose and if the

Police had, for any reason, required assistance with it, stewards

were available     in the area standing beside police officers at all

times.     If any warning of the intention to open "C" gate had been

given to those stewards and/or to those officers the tunnel would

have been closed;




                                        7
            (1)     the Second Defendants will rely upon the fact

that they did regularly inform the police in the control box of

the numbers of spectators who had been admitted and that those

officers had a better view of the pens in question than did

anyone else and it should have been pointless and unnecessary for

anybody to inform them of what was plain for them to see but

difficult to judge from other places in the ground;




            (m)    the   gates   in       the   perimeter   fence    precisely

accorded with the requirements of the local authority (the Third

Defendants or their predecessors) who at all times licensed the

premises for the purposes of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act and

it would not have been open to the Second Defendants to alter the

dimensions of those gates in any event.               It is    specifically

denied that the size of the gates caused or contributed in any

way to the death of the deceased;



           (n)     the gates in the perimeter fence were to the

knowledge of the Second Defendants all manned at all times by

police officers and it was not only unnecessary for stewards also

to   man   them   but    would   have       been   dangerous    to    confuse

responsibility for the control of those gates the opening and

closing of which were necessarily matters for police decision and

action;




                                      8
              (o)               the Second Defendants took all reasonable steps

to ensure that the crush barriers were safe and conformed to the

requirements of the licensing             authority and it is denied that

they permitted the removal of any of them.                 They retained the

services of the Fourth Defendants who were            competent experts in

that field.     The crush barriers were in fact safe in all material

respects;



              (p)    the Second Defendants took all reasonable steps

to plan for the 1989 semi-final and took account of all the

information which was available to them;



              (q)    it would not have been reasonable for the Second

Defendants to have available or, indeed, to anticipate any need

for bolt cutters because it was wholly unforeseeable that the

police would fail and/or refuse to open the perimeter gates until

a time when the crush behind them was so bad that cutters were

required;



10.   Further and/or in the alternative the Second Defendants

will contend that if, which is denied, the physical layout of the

premises or the condition of any part thereof was defective or

inadequate as is alleged in the statement of claim and, which is

also denied, that the same caused or contributed in any way to

the   death   of    the   deceased   then   that   death    was   due   to   the

negligence of the Third and or Fourth Defendants.

      PARTICULARS OF NEGLIGENCE OF THE THIRD AND FOURTH DEFENDANTS


A.    As against the Third Defendants the Second Defendants will

if necessary adopt and rely upon the allegations pleaded against

the Third Defendants under sub-paragraphs (a) - (f) inclusive of

the Statement of Claim.




B.    As against the Fourth Defendants the Second Defendants will

if necessary adopt and rely upon the allegations pleaded against

those defendants under sub-paragraphs (a), (b), (d), (e), (f),

(g), and (h) of the Statement of Claim and will further contend

that the Fourth Defendants were negligent in failing to give

adequate consideration and response to the Second Defendants'

enquiries concerning the certified capacity of the terrace in

February, March and April 1987.



12.   It is admitted that the deceased died as a result of the

injuries which he sustained but no other admissions are made as

to any of the matters alleged under paragraph 11 of the Statement

of Claim.

                 DEFENCE OF THE SECOND DEFENDANTS
1.     Subject to production of the material documents paragraph

1 of the Statement of Claim is admitted.



2.     Save that not all the Police Officers to whom reference is

made    in    the    Statement   of     Claim   were     members   of   the   South

Yorkshire Force but they were all acting under the control of the

First Defendant as pleaded, paragraph 2 of the Statement of Claim

is admitted and it is averred that the First Defendant was at all

material times acting in performance or purported performance of

a    contract       between   himself    and    the     Second   Defendant    which

provided for the policing of the ground and of the event in

question.



3.     Paragraph 3 of the Statement of Claim is admitted but it is

averred that at all material times the First Defendant was also

an occupier of the ground for the purposes of the Occupiers

Liability Act 1957, and was in control of the event and of all

members of the public admitted thereto.



4.     Paragraph 4       of the Statement of Claim is admitted.



5.     Save     that    the   only    works     which    were    directed     and/or

supervised by the Third Defendants were those which were material

to their safety certificate,             paragraph 5 of the Statement of

Claim is admitted.



6.     Paragraph 6 of the Statement of claim is admitted.


                                          2
7.   Save that       the Deceased was,          in the      premises,   a lawful

visitor of both the        First and         Second Defendants within the

meaning of    the    Occupiers'     Liability Act paragraph             7 of the

Statement of Claim is admitted.



8.   As to the matters alleged in paragraph 8 of the Statement

of Claim, the Second Defendants:

     (i)      admit that, by 3.00 p.m. at the earliest, pen three

was overcrowded and that crushing was occurring;

     (ii)    admit that the deceased was subjected to such crushing

and as a result sustained injury from which he died that day;

     (iii) admit that a barrier collapsed on the terrace but deny

that this collapse occurred before 3.00 p.m;

     (iv)     deny that the collapse of the barrier caused or

contributed to any injury or death.

     Save as aforesaid paragraph 8 of the Statement of Claim is

denied.



9.    It is admitted and averred that the First Defendant acted

negligently    and    in   breach   of       duty,   both    contractually   and

statutorily, and that his said breaches caused the death of the

deceased. The Second Defendants will adopt and rely upon the

matters pleaded against the First Defendant under the following

sub-paragraphs of paragraph 9 of the Statement of Claim:                     (d),

(e), (h), (k), (1), (m), (n), (o), (p), (q), (r), (s), (t), and

(u)- subject to the deletion of the word "forwards11 from the

penultimate line of that sub-paragraph.


                                         3
10.    The second Defendants will further rely upon the fact that

at all material times the First Defendant was in joint occupation

of the premises and accordingly owed to the Plaintiff a duty to

ensure that they were reasonably safe for the purposes for which

he had been invited to visit the same, and in so far as they were

unsafe that resulted solely from the activities which were under

the control of the First Defendants.



11.     It is denied that the Second Defendants acted negligently

or in breach of duty as alleged or at all or that any negligence

or breach of duty on their part caused or contributed to the

death of the deceased.          Without prejudice to the generality of

that denial the Second Defendants will specifically contend that:



             (&)                     the turnstile facilities at the Leppings Lane

end of the ground were adequate having regard to the reasonable

expectations        of   the    Second    Defendants     and    the   policing

requirements of the First Defendants and the need sensibly to

balance the demands of segregation and public order on the one

hand and controlled entry of supporters for a semi-final match

on the other;



             (b)                    the signing system within the ground to the pens,

though admittedly poor, did not cause or contribute and was not

in    any   way    relevant    to   the   death   of   the   deceased.   It   is

specifically denied that the crush which led to his death could

or would have been prevented by better sign-posting;


                                          4
             (c)     it would have been wholly impracticable and

largely pointless to attempt mechanically to monitor the entry

of numbers to the individual pens the required design of which

expressly provided for them to remain open and to allow free

lateral movement. The Second Defendants will further rely upon

the fact that whatever system had been employed to monitor the

numbers in pens 3 and 4 it would have been defeated and rendered

useless by the First Defendant's decision suddenly and without

warning to open "C" gate and thereby to allow approximately 2,000

persons directly,      rapidly and without control to enter those

pens;



             (d)    it is denied that the police at any material time

gave     any or any adequate warning      that the designated capacity

of the Terrace was too high for safety.          It is admitted and in

so far as it is not alleged it is averred that in a letter dated

5th June 1981 the police did express the view that the terrace

was "...not constructed to give maximum aid to the packing and

control of the crowd and the accepted crowd capacity is such that

there is no safety margin."        The second defendants will rely upon

the fact that following their receipt of that letter the design

of the terrace was altered in accordance with the suggestions of

the police and with the approval of the third defendants and that

the     certified   capacity was    thereafter   retained   at   the   same

figures;




                                      5
             (e)      there    was    at    all     material   times   a   clear

understanding between police and the Second Defendants as to the

manner in which the numbers in the pens would be monitored and

controlled by the police,           who alone were occupying the only

positions from which this could effectively be done, and in this

regard the Second Defendants will particularly rely upon the fact

that the police well knew that none of the Second Defendants'

employees was or was required by them (the police) to be present

in the control box, on the terrace or in the perimeter area;



             (f)     no representation of any kind was made by or

with the knowledge of the Second Defendants to the City Council

concerning any agreed system of crowd control and if, which is

not admitted, any         representation was made it was made by the

First Defendants;



             (g)    if and to the extent that the configuration of

the terrace dictated a need for the crowd to be assisted in

spreading itself evenly,        the Second Defendants were entitled

reasonably    to   have    regard    to    the    fact that    the   police   had

exclusive control of that crowd;



             (h)   they did inform the police of the estimated flow

rate through the turnstiles - and,               in doing so, in fact under­

estimated that rate.        The Second Defendants will further rely

upon the fact that their said estimation would in fact have been

exceeded if the area outside the turnstiles had been sensibly and

properly policed;
             (i)    they were entitled to and did rely upon the fact

that the police had a position of unparrelled advantage from

which to view the state of the terrace - both from their control

room and from the perimeter, and that the police had control of,

or the means to control, the crowd thereon at all material times;



             (j)        there was at all material times a perfectly

satisfactory system for keeping police on the concourse informed

of   the   state   of   the   terrace       and   efficient   and   expensive

equipment had been installed at the request of the police by the

Second Defendants and at their expense in order to facilitate

that; and there should have been no conceivable advantage to be

derived from informing the stewards on the concourse of the state

of the terrace;



             (k)the only reasonable means by which spectators

could effectively have been directed from pens 3 and 4 was the

closing of the tunnel. It should have been wholly unnecessary for

any steward to have been involved in that simple process. There

was a moveable barrier available for the purpose and if the

Police had, for any reason, required assistance with it, stewards

were available in the area standing beside police officers at all

times.     If anywarning of the intention to open "C" gate had been

given to those stewards and/or to those officers the tunnel would

have been closed;




                                        7
           (1)     the Second Defendants will rely upon the fact

that they did regularly inform the police in the control box of

the numbers of spectators who had been admitted and that those

officers had a better view of the pens in question than did

anyone else and it should have been pointless and unnecessary for

anybody to inform them of what was plain for them to see but

difficult to judge from other places in the ground;




           (m)    the   gates   in   the   perimeter   fence     precisely

accorded with the requirements of the local authority (the Third

Defendants or their predecessors) who at all times licensed the

premises for the purposes of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act and

it would not have been open to the Second Defendants to alter the

dimensions of those gates in any event.           It is     specifically

denied that the size of the gates caused or contributed in any

way to the death of the deceased;



           (n)     the gates in the perimeter fence were to the

knowledge of the Second Defendants all manned at all times by

police officers and it was not only unnecessary for stewards also

to   man   them   but   would   have     been   dangerous   to     confuse

responsibility for the control of those gates the opening and

closing of which were necessarily matters for police decision and

action;




                                     8
              (o)   the Second Defendants took all reasonable steps

to ensure that the crush barriers were safe and conformed to the

requirements of the licensing          authority and it is denied that

-they permitted the removal of any of them.                They retained the

services of the Fourth Defendants who were           competent experts in

that field.     The crush barriers were in fact safe in all material

respects;



              (p)   the Second Defendants took all reasonable steps

to plan for the 1989 semi-final and took account of all the

information which was available to them;



              (q)   it would not have been reasonable for the Second

Defendants to have available or, indeed, to anticipate any need

for bolt cutters because it was wholly unforeseeable that the

police would fail and/or refuse to open the perimeter gates until

a time when the crush behind them was so bad that cutters were

required;



10.   Further and/or in the alternative the Second Defendants

will contend that if, which is denied, the physical layout of the

premises or the condition of any part thereof was defective or

inadequate as is alleged in the statement of claim and, which is

also denied, that the same caused or contributed in any way to

the   death    of   the   deceased   then   that   death    was   due   to   the

negligence of the Third and or Fourth Defendants.

      PARTICULARS OF NEGLIGENCE OF THE THIRD AND FOURTH DEFENDANTS



A.    As against the Third Defendants the Second Defendants will

if necessary adopt and rely upon the allegations pleaded against

the Third Defendants under sub-paragraphs (a) - (f) inclusive of

the Statement of Claim.




B.    As against the Fourth Defendants the Second Defendants will

if necessary adopt and rely upon the allegations pleaded against

those defendants under sub-paragraphs (a), (b), (d), (e), (f),

(g), and (h) of the Statement of Claim and will further contend

that the Fourth Defendants were negligent in failing to give

adequate consideration and response to the Second Defendants7

enquiries concerning the certified capacity of the terrace in

February, March and April 1987.



12.    It is admitted that the deceased died as a result of the

injuries which he sustained but no other admissions are made as

to any of the matters alleged under paragraph 11 of the Statement

of Claim.

         Mr.       HYTNER: Well before the Summons.

A        Mr.       JUSTICE STEYN:               Yes.

         Mr. HYTNER:   I am obliged.  In relation to the cases which are
             to be heard in June - and I do not think my learned friends
             will mind my mentioning this in their absence - what we
             propose to do is that when the names of all cases are known,
             we will then seek an order under Order 18, Rule 21, and I
g            do not think it should be necessary to seek it from your
             Lordship;   it can be done through the District Registry.

         Mr.       JUSTICE STEYN:               Yes.   Thank you very much.

         Mr.       HYTNER: We are               much obliged to your Lordship.

         Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:                     Thank you.

I in-'eciately arrroached the pile of bodies and sa' that there were abc-'t ten other ecxi
officers in that area at that tiae including F.S. h6B V.’hitlar. I also saw that a youth va
buried waist high in the pile of bodies but was alive and therefore all my eforts were
concentrated on getting this youth out of the pile as it was obvoius ‘•.hat most if not
all of tie others wer dead by this time. After assisting with the aid of some fans and :
other officers to remove bodies frorr. arounfi this youth he w- s able to get out and was ir.
fact uninjured. I then as. isted in removing all the bodies to the trackside via a gate h e
and a part of the fence that officers had stafcted to rip down to get the injured,dying
and dead on tc the trackside to receive any medical treatment possible. Towasis the Jb*±t*
bottos of the pile of bodies I saw a youth that was alive but barely and effots       re
made to get hir. out as soon as posrible and whilst this was happening ( ap-ro"imately
ten bodies n- ding moving to get to this nran man) other officers were frantiaclly trying
in vain tc get seme oxygen for this nar. but when we finally got to him it was again
wvidend 'hat this amn was dead and although attempts were made by other o r'ic rc to
revive hirr. without oxygen this was impossible. 7f en the dead were finally all cleared
there was a rile of jumpers,gla5 es money, ■‘alse teeth ect strewn abou- the terracing
and the fans still remaining i the pen were becoming more and more hostile towards
the officers of which i was one who we -e still in the pen. v/hen one fan started to look
for a friends jumper the fans surg'd towards him accusing him of grave robbing and thi~
ms.n ha" to be protected by the officers in the pen as did tfce scenes of crime man who
attended at the scene and wss mistake;, as a pres photographer. As "he feeling inside tr.e
pen calmed down I moved onto the pitch with other officers a w iting further instruction.
I can?t recall what time it was by this tixeor how long I was in the pen. I then waites
on the pitch and found P.S. Hunt and the remainder of cur unit before resuming patrol
outside the ground and although there were r-ports of fighting via personal radio it
was irarosrible tc at'end anywhere due to the large volume of traf’ic ant I      - not sctuai
witness any scenes of the fighting r e p orted. I later went of duty.

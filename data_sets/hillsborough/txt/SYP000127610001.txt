                 I, STEPHEN RICHARD CLARK OF                                              WILL SAY AS

                 F OL LO WS :



                 1.      I am 37 years old and have worked for the football Association

                 (FA)    for the last 20 ye a r s .   Since   1982 I have held the position as

                 Competition Secretary at the FA and one of my jobs i s               to deal with the

                 organisation for the FA Challenge Cup.              In particular,    I have

                 responsibi1ity for organising the senu-final arrangemants for the

                 Challenge Cup.,      Adrian Tit combe did this jab before m e .



                 2.      In about February each year     1 send out an invitation to various

                 clubs as to wh s t h e r they are prepared to hold semi-final           of the FA

                 Challenge Cup and consider their          replies,,      Liverpool Football Club
                                                                             PAGE


was on the 3.list until    last year when    it replied to me letter to the

effect that    it did not want to hold a semi-final         because of the

reduction in capacity of its ground.          Liverpool    had installed more

seats and as result the standing        room of one end was reduced to 3,000.

At the other end 20,000 could stand.          Such an unequal distribution if

League match,



3.   Apart from the correspondence with the clubs there was one

telephone    call which Adrian Tit combe received on Thursday        16 March

1989 from Bernard Halford the S e c r e t a r y   of Manchester City.    1

understand that Mr Halford asked whetner a semi-final match could be

played at his club and had confirmed that the police would be happy

for this to happen even if Manchester United were            involved in the

match.     At that time Liverpool;, Everton, Manchester United and

Nottingham Forest were all still        in the draw,      Mr Tit combe and 1

discussed the position and agreed that            1 should telephone Everton to

ask for its views about      playing at Manchester       I then telephoned Jim

Greenwood the secretary at Everton on F r iday 17 March,           Mr Greenwood

indicated that Everton were       loath to play at Manchester,



4„   Mr Tit combe and 1 had a brief discussion with Graham Kelly the

Chief Executive of the FA later on the morning of 17 March about

venues for the semi-finals snatches,         Mr T it combe was going to be out

of the office the following Monday when the draw would be made and

there were some details he wanted to sort with Mr Kelly,             One of the

paints was the fact that there was no London Club prepared or able to
                                                                                PAGE


stage a semi-final match and Brentford,            Nest H a m , Wimbledon and

Norwich were still     left in the draw,,         We also told Mr Kelly about the

telephone    call from Manchester City and E v e r t o n ’s reaction,

Hillsborough and Villa Park we?’e also inentionad as possible venues.

The meeting    lasted altogether about       15-20 minutes,,



5,   This year the draw for the semi-final was made at "7.45 am on

Monday SO Harcii,     At about   10 o ’clock on 20 March I received a

telephone call from Peter Robinson of Liverpool,               I was expecting

Sheffield Wednesday would be chosen for the Liverpool              tie because of

the discussions on Friday.        I cannot now recall exactly what Mr

Robinson said during this telephone          conversation and I did not make

any contemporaneous notes.        However,    I    think that he also thought that

the match was    likely to be played at Hillsborough and he was asking me

whether   it would be possible to swap ends from those that was used

last year.     Last year Liverpool     had been allocated the Leppings Lane

end rather    than the Penistone Lane end.           I knew that the reason for

the request was that the Leppings Lane end resulted in Liverpool

getting 4,000 less tickets than Nottingham Forest and bearing               in mind

the size of the s upp o rt f o r the two c1u b s , L i v e rpo o 1 had been anhapp y

about the allocation last year.         I do not remember Mr Robinson asking

for a venue other than Hi 1 Isborough.            In my mind Hillsborough was the

likely venue    in view of the draw.      This was because       last year's semi­

final had been staged there and it had been vary successful with no

complaints as far as I am aware.



6.   I immediately rang Graham Mack re X1, the secretary at Sheffield

Wednesday d u b ,   to tell him about the call         I had had from Mr Robinson

and to ask him to speak to the police on the likely allocation of

tickets   if Hillsborough wore selected for the Liverpool            tie.   The
                                                                             page;
                                                                                 ;        4


reason for making this call was that           X knew that only if the police

agreed could there fay any change          in the end that was allocated to

Liverpool,     I suspected that        looking at the geographical    location of

Liverpool and Nottingham Forest           in relation to Hillsborough that the

police would not be minded to change their views from last year.                   The

police views on which end should be allocated to which club are the

decisive factor for the staging           club for obvious    reasons,, Shortly

after that call     I spoke to Mr Kelly about the a r rangernents for the

Challenge Cup Committee meeting and mentioned to rum the call that                  1

had had from Mr Robinson mentioning about the likely allocation of

ends if Hillsborough were chosen.



7.     Shor t y before    11 o'clock    I received a telephone    call from Mr

Mack re 11 to say that if Hillsborough were         chosen for the Liverpool        tie

then the police would allocate the Leppings Lane end to Liverpool                  in

accordance with last seasons arrangement-            The   reason for this was to

avoid a clash of supporters approaching and leaving the ground.                   There

was a Challenge Cup sub-committee meeting at 11 o ’clock and I

mentioned to Mr Kelly at that meeting about the call              1 had recievad

from Mr Mackrell.        The purpose of the sub--commit tee meeting was to deal

with artificial     pitches and had nothing to do with the selection of

venues for the semi final matches,



8.     The sub-committee meeting finished before           11,30 am and I think

that    I went with Mr Kelly to the general        office where we discussed the

matter further,      Mr Kelly asked me about what had happened last year

at Hillsborough and I told him there had not been any problems that I

was aware of and certainly no complaints had b e e n           received as far as I

was aware,     Mr Kelly was     interested    in my recommendation as to venue

and 1 told him that        1 thought that Hr Robinson's       phone call should not
alter the recommendation that the match should be played at

Hillsborough.           The only alternative venue would have been M a n c h e s t e r .

My own feeling was that the fact that Liverpool would have gained a

larger allocation of tickets by going to Manchester was not a

sufficiently strong           reason for altering the venue from Hillsborough

where the match had been so successfully run last year,                   1 also

thought     perhaps Manchester was         rather   close to Liverpool    for a tie

between Liverpool and Nottingham F o r e s t ■



9.     1 then went       into the Challenge Cup committee meeting with Mr

Holly,     One of the items on the agenda was the venues for the semi­

final m a t c h e s .    There were no papers for this      item but in relation to

another     item there was a list of the venues for the semi-final matches

for the past 10 years,            Mr Wiseman,   the Chairman of the Matches and

Grounds C o m m i t t e , recommended that the match between Everton and West

Ham/Norwich should be at Villa Park and that the one between Liverpool

and Nottingham Forest should be at Hillsborough,                 Villa Park was

accepted without any debate the members cf the Committee.                   There was a

suggestion made that the other match should be at Manchester.                      There

was the briefest of discussions and the committee accepted Mr

Wi s e m a n ’s recommendation that the Liverpool match should be at

Hi 1lsborough.          There was no reference during the       committee meeting to

the phone call that I had had with Mr Robinson,                 I did not consider         it

necessary for me to raise            it as I had mentioned     it to Mr Kelly,



•10.   The meeting finished at about            IS,30 pm and at about     1 o ’clock I

phoned both Sheffield Wednesday and Villa Park formally asking them

whether they would be prepared to stage the semi Finals, They both

confirmed that they were happy to do so and I therefore told them to

go ahead with the usual arrangements and to contact the                  police
                                                                                       PAGE


concerning segregation of s u p p o r te rs .             I then telephoned Liverpool avid

Nottingham Forest brie-fly cut                  of courtesy to tell them of the

decision.         I think         1 spoke to Sheffield Wednesday and Villa Park           an

the telephone          later     in the afternoon about some of the administrative

details.



11.     On 21 March 1             received a telephone     call from Mr Robinson in the

morning to tell methat Liverpool were going to make                     public their

disapproval        of the choice of venue of Hillsborough as they would be

receiving       less tickets than Nottingham Forest.                1 understood the      call

to bs by way of information to say that Liverpool would be making

these comments           rather than as a formal          complaint.    If I had thought

that Hr Robinson was               in any way making a formal       complaint then in

accordance with standard practice                  I would have asked him to put it in

writing or to speak to Mr Kelly direct.                    Hr Robinson thought that the

FA might also be receiving                  critical   telephone calls or letters from

Liverpool       supporters who were unable to get tickets.                 There has been

some press comment             recently regarding L i v e r p o o l ’s criticism of the

choice of Hi IIsborough but so far as I am aware no such calls or

letters were         received from any Liverpool            supporters until after the

disaster and nothing was                 received in writing from Liverpool Football

Club.      I was also unaware of any media comment at the time criticising

t h e c h o i ce o f H i 13. s b o ro u.g h .



"IE.    It was my practice for the semi-final arrangements to b e                      typed up

into the blue booklet which sets out all the details of the

organisation required as well as the telephone numbers of the clubs

and other contact             points.       On 20 or 21 March?   I faxed to Sheffield

Wednesday and Villa Park the details                    concerning the matches which had

not at that stage been printed.                   The booklet was      printed by the 22
                                                                              PAGE       7


         March by the print department at the FA.      The booklet was   in

         'substantially the same form as that for previous years and was sent to

         the staging and competing   clubs, members of the Chal lenge Cup

         Committee and match officials.      Basically the FA* s policy is to leave

         the staging   clubs to deal with the organisation required.     They are

         generally familiar with what is needed for these matches and also have

         the advantage of the contracts with the police which are always        needed

         for these occasions,    I was   in touch with Mr Mack re 11 from time to

         time but basically my job was z o    ensure that the FA received the

         appropr iate number of tickets and that they were appropriately

         distributed as required.    The tickets are printed by the club and so

         the FA allocation was sent to me once the tickets were ready and I

         arranged for their distribution.

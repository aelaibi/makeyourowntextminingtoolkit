DAVID ALFRED ILLINGWORTH



POLICE CONSTABLE 417



SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE HAMMERTON ROAD POLICE STATION



During my service with South Yorkshire Police and Sheffield and Rotherham, I have been

to many large football matches at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, and during my

time at West Bar did many duties at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.

In September 1987, I started serving with the Community Constables at FI and have been

on duty at       the majority of matches.   At all these games I have   been on Serial 1 (the

track) and       I have placed myself behind the goal near to gate number 5, and PC 1285

Smith has been near gates either 3 or 4.

 I originally took up this position as there was less manpower at that end of the

 ground.       I have never been detailed any particular position on the track.

 On Saturday 15 April 1989, I arrived at the ground at 9-45 am and went into the North

 stand for the briefing at 10 am.        Inspector Darling was in control of our sector and

 PS Chapman was in charge of Serial 1.         After the briefing from Chief Superintendent

 Duckenfield and Superintendent Murray I had a packed meal in the North Stand but

 received no other instruction regarding my duties for the day.

 I collected a stool        and placed it near   to gate 5-    At most games I sit at this

 position as it is directly between two sets of railings on the terrace and often fans

 climb up on to and over the railings and gives easy access for climbing the perimeter

  fence.       (Two Liverpool fans scaled the perimeter fence at the start of the 1988 semi

  final ran      onto the pitch.   I detained one as he attempted to    get back in the crowd.

  The other one got back in but was later taken out by St Johns with a leg injury,

  caused when he fell from the fence).

  The fans began arriving at the Leppings Lane end before 12.00 and I stood on the track

  behind the goal with PC Smith.        The next officer on the track was PC 442 Cookson who



                   Mr
was near the small gate in the North Stand.         I don't know where the next officer was

in the opposite direction (South Stand)

There were very few     Liverpool fans      in the ground but the ones near PC Smith and me

were sober and    well behaved.    I amnot sure of the time but at     about 1 pm I heard a

radio message    from PS Chapman     (The radio was on talk through)       to the effect 'I m

taking half my serial for meal before it gets busy" Reply "Roger".          I then saw a group

of officers on the track, near the players tunnel leave the track via the North Stand

obviously going for their meal.

About half an hour later I saw PS Chapman back near the players tunnel and assumed he

had had his meal and I was anticipating a radio message to go for mine.          At 2 pm I had

received no instruction regarding a meal and walked over to PS Chapman and asked him

 if PC Smith and I could take       our meal. He said     OK.   On our way to the canteen     a

 message came over the radio "The canteen will close in 20 minutes".        On our arrival   at

 the canteen we found it was closed and one of the ladies said: "We're closed for the

 next twenty minutes" PC Smith and I then stood in the queue until          they re-opened    at

 approximately 2.20.     We were    served and returned to the track at 2.45-2.50 pm.         PC

 Smith went to     the toilet I walked onto the Leppings Lane end where I found PC           700

 Helliwell wasstanding behind      goal.     I saw the centre pen (CN &CS) was very full but

 the two outer pens were only about half full.        This surprised me as I'd never seen the

 fans so badly distributed.        At first there didn't appear to be a serious problem the

 fans were swaying back and forth and some were climbing from the pen marked N on the

 map into the stand above.      This is a common occurrence at large matches.      The swaying

  and pushing became much worseto the extent that        females were screaming and fans were

  beginning to panic.     I put over       a radio message to the   effect: "There is a serious

  crush down here it is serious".           I don't know if it was received or not as I was

  unable to hear my radio due to the noise.         At this time I was near gate 4 and it was

  obvious that people against         the fence were in serious trouble.     There was only PC

  Smith and me at this section       and I think he was near to Gate 3-     I opened gate 4 and
                                                    -   3   -




    assisted the first injured    man who I saw onto the track.               The fans began to spill out.

    I assisted this man with      a leg injury to the St Johns at                 the corner of the North

    Stand.    All the fans who were spilling onto the track and the grass I was attempting

    to get them back on the terrace through gates 5 and 6 which I opened.                  At this stage I

    was joined by another serial which arrived from the direction of the North Stand.                  The

    first body I saw was      on the terrace just                  behind the fence.I cannot describe this

    person as I could see     little of him due to the crowd but he was male, white and laid

    flat out with fans standing on him.           It was impossible at that stage to get to him.

    We were dragging fans out of gate 4 as quickly as possible.                    They were climbing over

^   the fence onto the track      and over the railings into the North pen.                 The fans began

    pushing the dead and      injured through the gate.               Officers began   resuscitation on the

     grass.     I assisted in pulling a large fat man from gate 4.                 Hewas about 50 years of

     age, I think bald/greying, wearing a green jumper.                  He was with his son about 30 years

     he had black hair and a black moustache.                   He seemed uninjured but very distressed.     I

     carried his father onto the grass but I thought he was dead as he wasn't breathing and

     wasn't conscious.     I began to give him heart massage but it didn't appear to have any

     effect but I continued and he began to breath for himself.                     A police officer who I

     don't know but I think he was either from Barnsley or Woodseats was near by said "make

      sure he doesn't     swallow his   tongue"         I turned him onto his side and after a few

     minutes he regained consciousness.           By this time an ambulance had arrived and was

      parked near to the goal.     I carried this man by his arms and a civilian had his legs

      to the ambulance.     Inside the ambulance there was a body on the bench and one or two

      on the floor. We had to put the casualty down and take the bodies out of the ambulance

      then put him inside.     He was still breathing and conscious and his son was with him.

      I obtained no details and donâ€™t know what happened to him.

      I don't know how long I stayed with this particular casualty but whilst I was reviving

       him on the grass many more bodies had been brought from gate 4 and were covering the

       grass.    At some stage I saw the first officer, he was Inspector Harper.               I said to him
"Can't   we   get   rid   of   these    bodies".   He   replied:   "Bodies?"   with disbelief.     It

appeared to me that officers were being directed to that end of the ground who had no

idea what was taking place.            At some stage I ended up at gate 3 where the crush to get

out was enormous,         several fans had fallen over the small wall and were trapped by

their legs and the crush behind them and as a consequence they began to pile up.                    I

think it was at this stage the fans began to pull at the fencing which started to rip

away I together with other officers, fans, ambulance staff began to kick at the bottom

of it, sufficient gave way so we could get the fans under it.

I did several journeys carrying bodies and injured on advertising boards, at first to

the ambulance station.         I first remember seeing about 6-10 bodies or injured on boards

on the floor outside the gym.            I made another journey and on my return with a body the

whole floor outside the gym was covered.            I made another journey and on returning this

 time I saw the bodies were being taken into the gym itself.             I followed suit.    I don't

 know how many trips I made, the descriptions of the bodies or who I was with during

 this time. The only recollection of staff in the gym I have is an officer shouting:

 "Someone must stay with the bodies".

 After all the dead were in the gym and the injured had gone I was informed we should

 all go to the North Stand where we were de-briefed by Chief Inspector Beal.                     After

 that I was asked by Inspector Calvert to sit with fans on a S.Y.T bus in Penistone

 Road.    I went with PC 700 Helliwell and 295^ Morledge. The fans were in fact missing

  friends and relatives.        We obtained their details and descriptions of persons missing.

 After this was completed a coach arrived in Penistone Road and we put the relatives on

  the coach which I was informed was to take them to Hammerton Road Police Station.

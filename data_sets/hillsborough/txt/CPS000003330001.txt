RE: HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

Thank you for your letter of the 8 August which gives a most
helpful resume of the present position with which I entirely
agree.

You will know by now that the Chief Constable, South Yorkshire
Police has decided that there should be a full criminal
investigation and has asked the Chief Constable, West Midlands
to conduct this investigation and in due course he will submit
his Report to me.  In all the circumstances you might be
minded to now adjourn the Inquests until I have considered the
Report and a decision made as to what action, if any, should
be taken.

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds

I refer to the ongoing Hillsb o r o u g h I n q u i r y and have noted f r o m the evidence
that apparently works have been done at the grounds without the Council as
Certif i c a t i n g A u t h o r i t y being notified of them.
                           /
As I am sure you are aware any alterations to the s t adium w h i c h may affect
safety must be notif i e d in advance to the Council in accorda nce w i t h S e c t i o n 8
of the 1975 Act and Conditions of the Safet y Certificate.     W ould you please
confirm as soon as possible wh at alterations have b e e n made to the s t a d i u m about
which notice has not been given s ince 1st A p r i l 1986.

In a d d ition I w o u l d like to receive your w r i t t e n confir m a t i o n that in future no
such alterations will take place without proper n o t i f i c a t i o n being given to the
Council.

I am sure you will appreciate that it is essential for at least the m i n i m u m
notice to be given so that the Council may look into the s a f e t y implicati ons of
any proposals.

I l o o k forw ard to receiving your response to this letter,             and also to my letter
of 22nd May and 8th June, as soon as possible.


Y ours faithfully.

        purpose of Meeting

 The original Intention of the visit had been to check that the outstanding matters
 referred to in the Note of the meeting held on 12th November had been completed
 or were in the course of completion prior to the anticipated issue of the Certificate
 by the County Council this week.

 2.      Minor Matters

 An inspection of the ground showed that a number of minor matters still required
 attention, but the Club undertook to ensure that these were attended to in the ie x t
 few days.

 3^____ Major Matters

 A.     Emergency Lighting - South Stand

  The meetings which had taken place between the County Fire Service and M essrs.
  Eastwood and Partners since 12th November on the South Stand Emergency Lighting
  had produced agreement on an interim arrangemert which would be regarded as
acceptable for the duration of the existing battery life. Further modifications at
that time would remedy the shortcomings of the existing installation. Details were
contained in the letter dated 12th December which M essrs. Eastwood and Partners
had addressed to the Fire Service.
     /
B.       South Stand Construction

The Building Authority expressed concern as to what they saw as a lack of structural
Integrity In the South Stand. In their opinion, corrosion was contributing to the
progressive deterioration of the Stand which, It was felt, could only be properly
determined by a full structural survey. The report forwarded by M essrs. Eastwood
and Partners In the la st week was not considered to be sufficiently comprehensive
to provide tte required Information, and the basis of calculation used could not be
agreed as appropriate. Whilst It was agreed that there had not been a specific
written request for such a full structural survey of tbe South Stand, the Building
Authority felt that It had been Inherent in the detailed discussions which had taken
place that such a report would be forthcoming. The Building Authority were
 concerned at the possibility that the requirements of the Building Begulations and
the Code of Practice Safety Factors could not be met; In particular the Structural
 stability o f the South Stand In conditions of gale force winds and heavy snowfall
 was mentioned.

 For the Club, Dr. Eastwood agreed that the Stand would obviously not be built to the
 same specification or the same construction standards nowadays, but pointed out
 that, for Instance, none of the buildings In Sheffield built before 1970 could meet
 the latest wind p ressure requirem ents. Even the Building Besearch Station was
 evidently           In term s that these requirements were unrealIstlcally high. In
 his professional opinion, the Stand was structurally safe and able In practice to meet
 the loadings demanded. In any case, the conditions which had been described as
  being possibly dangerous would mean In prabtlce that a match could not be played
  and consequently no spectators would be present.

 Experience of the corrosion of Indoors steel in the Sheffield area showed this to be
 minimal, and the Stand was regularly test loaded by spectators. Structures such
 as this would show obvious external signs, such as cracks, well before there was
 any possibility of collapse, and would be readily apparent on even a superficial
 visual Inspection. Even though he did not consider It essential, pla ting of the
 front steel columns had been carried out as a compromise to try and m eet the
 Building Authority's concern. He agreed there might well be a continuing
 maintenance problem with the stand, but this was a different matter to saying there
 was a structural problem. Beference was made to the Guide's advice that when
 a ssessin g whether existing situations provided adequately for the safety of spectators,
 the criterion to be used Is that of a reasonable degree of safety. In Dr. Eastwood s
  view It would be unreasonable and unnecessary to Insist on a full structural survey
  of the South Stand or to delay the Issue of the Certificate. It was his professional
  opinion (which he was m ost jealous of and would not put In jeopardy) that the Saxth
  Stand was structurally safe and that the basis of the calculations provided was
  appropriate. He was prepared to advise the Club to u se the appeal procedure open
  to them should this be necessary.
IT WAS AGBEED that:

(a)   as there was no obvious deterioration In the South Stand structure of such
       a nature as to be of Immediate concern, no objection waild be raised to the
       continuance of the derby game with Sheffield United on Boxing Day morning
       provided that no extreme weather conditions occurred In the Intervening
       period, and

(b)     a further meeting should be held as a matter of urgency between the Building
        Authority and Dr. W. Eastwood to discuss tbs structural Integrity of the
       South Stand and the appropriateness of the calculations used (Mr. D. Vaughan
       to be present at Dr. Eastwood's request).

NOTE As the discussions on the South Stand Construction hinged on structural
     theories and practices, the Fire Service and P olice representatives felt
     there was little they could contribute and left the meeting prior to its
     termination.

             Dear Mr. Mallett,

              H aving met and c o n v ersed w i t h Mr. David Vaugh an at the police
              m e e t i n g in Sheffield yesterday, I confirm that the a l terations
              to t urns tiles etc. on P e n i s t o n e Road have had to be deferred
             -until the end o f next season, due entirely to the size of the
              p r oject and the possi b i l i t y o f creat i n g h a zards for our
              spectators.                                                   ■

              The police and first aid facili t i e s are p rogressing very well,
              and we are h o peful that they will be in operation for the
              start o f the season.

              Yours sincerely,




              Secretary.

                                 4.1      Many aspects of these safety requirements were found lacking, the
                                          details of which are as follows and are in contravention of those
                                          conditions laid down in Schedule 2 of the General Safety Certificate.

                                          (a)          Numerous stewards, when questioned about their, responsibilities
                                                       under Section 9 of the Certificate, could not give correct or
                                                       suitable replies to the questions. Many were not familiar with

                                                       responsibility.                            \-

                                          (b)          Many stewards when questioned could not provide the fire service
                                                       representative with the documents required under 9(d) of the
                                                       certificate.

                                          (c)          Since the start of the season the Fire Authority have not been
                                                       approached with regard to training on fire safety procedures,
                                                       as has been the case in previous years. Training sessions
                                                       should be held at least once in every three months Section 9(3)

The p u rpose of the m e e t i n g was to c arry out the "winter" inspec t i o n of the
G r o u n d in accordanc e wi th the p olicy of twice y e a r l y visits to Football L e ague
g r o u n d s in South Y o r k shire b y the appropriate O f ficer W o rking Party.

Th e Club reported that the m a j o r i t y of the items listed as n o rmal m a i n t e n a n c e
items foll owing the "summer" inspection had yet -to be carried out.                This was
due to a c o m b i n a t i o n of the change in Club Secretary and c e r t a i n development
p r o p o s a l s (outlined on a confidential basis) w h i c h the Club had in mind.
However, those whic h the Club's staff coul d u n d e rtake would be commenced shortly
and tenders had b e e n invited and received for the urgent r e m a ining larger
items (to be carried out c ommencing in M a y ) . The e x c e ption was the roof of the
tunnel exit from the Spion Kop (towards the N o r t h Stand end) in v i e w of its
possi ble inclusion in the d evelo p m e n t propo sals outlined.

2.   ___ Gr o u n d   Inspection

A.        West. Stand and T e rra ce

It was noted that the former A R P build i n g adjacen t to the b o u ndary wall was
in the pro cess of d e m o l i t i o n and the site cleared and levelled. This would
have the a dditional benefit of improving the access/egress.

B.        N o r t h West Terrace

It w as n o t e d that w hilst g e n e r a l l y the sealing of the cracks b e n e a t h the Terrace
to prevent seepage of water had been successful, there was still a slight
seepage from one of the repairs.

T he p o s s i b l e need for p r o t e c t i o n of the wir e m e s h on the inside of the upper
access deck was          also discussed.

IT WAS A G R E E D -

(i)    That the Club would continu e to m o n i t o r                the slight      seepage of water
from the r e p a i r e d cracks under the Terrace.

 (ii)       That the p o s sible need for lateral b r a c i n g to the frame of the*wire
m e s h b a r riers on the inside of the u p p e r access d e c k be investigated b y a
test loading d ur ing the forthcoming close season.
C.     Spion Kop

As previously indicated, the Club confirmed that the remedial work to the
existing access ramp and barrier rails required as the result of the
construction of the new refreshment and toilet^ together with the erection
of barriers to prevent access to the roofs of the new facilities, had been
carried out.

The present condition of the spalled concrete and corrosion of the roof of
the tunnel exit from   the Spion Kop was inspected.

The stability of the        perimeter wall at the Penistone Road   end of the ground
was also discussed.

IT WAS AGREED -

(i)   That the Building Authority and Mr. J. Strange of Messrs. Eastwood &
Partners should discuss and inspect that part of the perimeter fencing
erected at the northern end of the ramp to prevent access to the roofs of the
new facilities.

(ii)  That the Club would undertake continuous maintenance work  on theroof
of the tunnel exit, pending a decision on any development proposals.

(iii)  That the Building Authority and Dr. W. Eastwood should discuss and inspect
the stability of the   perimeter wall at the Penistone Road end during the
forthcoming close season.

D.    Lighting     Pylons

The Club undertook to carry out a visual inspection of the lighting pylons during
the forthcoming close season and to make more detailed inspections should this
prove to be necessary after the visual inspection.

E.    Emergency Lighting,        Fire Alarm and Public Address Systems Test

IT WAS AGREED - That the County Fire Service in conjunction with the South
Yorkshire Police and the Club's staff, would carry out a test of these systems
at the evening match against Fulham to be held on 7th March.

    evidence to the InguLcy indicated that I would shortly be in touch with
    you with a view to discussing any input which you may wish to make into
    the current Safety of Sports Grounds administrative system in Sheffield.

    Perhaps you would like to give sane thought as to the areas in which you
    feel you have a particular contribution to make and let me know of your
    thoughts in due course.

    It would also be helpful to me if you could give me seme idea of the
    input which the ambulance service already has in repect of emergency
    planning arrangements at football grounds.

    If you feel that the ambulance service could offer useful input into
    other licensing systems (for example that relating to public
    entertainment) please also feel free to make the point.

    I look forward to hearing frcm you in due course.

Thank you for your letter of 25th July, 1989, inviting my comments upon       the
above mentioned review which you are undertaking as a result of               the
Hillsborough Inquiry.

Since you invite comment on matters other than those you have listed,    I take
this opportunity of giving my thoughts on other aspects.

The comments are in three parts as follows:-

(i) My thoughts on how the City Council might proceed.
(ii) The legal position regarding consultation, acceptance of advice and
       enforcement.
(iii) Comments on the headings contained in the letter.

1.    How the Council Might Proceed

1.1    I consider that urgentpriority needs to be given to the replacement of
      the Sheffield Wednesday certificate and the issue of General Safety
      Certificates in respect of Bramall Lane and Owlerton Sports Grounds.

1.2   To achieve the above objective I recommend that the multi-disciplined
      safety team approach which has always been used should be retained.    I
      am of the opinion however that the City Council will have to become more
      actively involved in the process than it has in the past.

1.3   Manpower resources will be needed to enable the City Council to co­
      ordinate the inspections and advice of the Advisory Group, evidence at
      the Inquiry suggested that the officer concerned was overburdened.    In
      my view your officers must arrange and Chair meetings and produce prompt
      and accurate minutes for circulation; correspond directly with the clubs
                               - 1 -
to obtain plans and information pursuant to the issue of certificates;
generally act as the catalyst to ensure that General Safety Certificates
are issued as soon as possible and that clubs get on with any
outstanding work is required to inform the Council when it has been
completed so that arrangements can be made for the safety team to
inspect.

I would emphasise that the City Council is not entitled to take the view
that it is for the Fire Service rather than the Council to pursue the
clubs to ensure that work is completed. As you may know it has been
necessary in the past for the Fire Service to ask the Council to remind
clubs of the need for action. The Fire Service has limited manpower
resources at its disposal and, in addition to its main statutory
responsibility, for issuing fire certificates under the Fire Precautions
Act 1971, it also gives advice to the Council on means of escape and
fire precautions in literally hundreds of premises for which the City
Council is the responsible licensing Authority.

I am of the opinion that all three designated grounds and in particular
Sheffield Wednesday should be comprehensively surveyed by the individual
members of the Advisory Group. This is emphasised by the views on the
apparent low level of maintenance of grounds noted by the Building
Surveyor and Health & Consumer Services. Each department should act in
unison in this respect rather than separately. The Green Guide and the
interim recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor should form the basis of
the standard to be achieved and in this connection the City Council will
need to consider and make known its policy as regards the use of
professional judgement in cases where provisions within sports grounds
fall below that of the Green Guide. I say this in the light of the
attitude which was apparent from some quarters during the Hillsborough
Inquiry that the Green Guide should be applied without flexibility. I
would emphasise that I will always require my officers to apply their
professional judgement in applying any code of guidance.

At the same time the many recommendations stemming from the extremely
comprehensive safety audits carried out by the Council's Health and
Consumer Services Department, many of which cut across the expertise of
other disciplines will need to be actively considered except for those
aspects which are required to be implemented before the commencement of
the football season. I note one recommendation for the restriction of
use of two sections of the Spion Kop at Hillsborough which you will need
to decide upon before the new season. Has a similar report been done on
Owlerton?

A copy of the report of each discipline should be sent by the City
Council to each other discipline after which the City Council should
Chair a meeting to enable problems to be discussed so that an accepted
approach might be determined by the City Council and consolidated into a
single report of requirements which should be forwarded to the clubs or
included as requirement conditions in the General Safety Certificates
when they are issued. In my opinion this method of working is necessary
in the case of all new applications and where alterations and extensions
are made to certificated grounds. The City Council must arrange the
meetings not put the onus on individual disciplines to ask for a meeting
as it has previously done.

It is my view that the necessary comprehensive surveys could not be
undertaken satisfactorily without accurate and detailed drawings of all
parts of the grounds. Duplicate sets of drawings should be obtained for
all disciplines so that one set can be marked up and sent to the City
Council and one be retained on file for record purposes. As a minimum
the following drawings are needed:-
                         -   2   -
(i)   A site plan showing the ground and its surroundings at a     scale   of
      1:500

(ii) A plan view of the ground showing entrances, exits, gates, stands,
     terraces etc at a scale of 1:200

(iii)Drawings of each stand, terrace, building within the ground and the
     use of rooms - including areas beneath stands at a scale of 1:100.

(iv) Drawings of emergency lighting and       fire   alarm   and   detection
     equipment and public address system.

I also take the view that the plans which have been supplied on behalf
of Sheffield Wednesday and Sheffield United by Eastwood and Partners
have often contained insufficient detail.      Often for example such
details as entrances and exits or their widths, perimeter fences and
gates or their widths, the area and rake of terraces, the location of
emergency lighting, and fire warning and fire equipment are not shown.
I am of the opinion that much more detail needs to beshown on        the
drawings forming part of General Safety Certificates as is the case with
fire certificates issued under the Fire Precautions Act 1971. This will
facilitate   the   re-inspection   of   the   sports   grounds and the
identification of any unauthorised alterations which might have been
made.

Following receipt of drawings I suggest that the City Council calls a
meeting of the Advisory Group to agree on common identification
procedures.   In order that each discipline is able to identify parts of
grounds in a uniform manner, I suggest that stands and terraces are
clearly identified, exit routes, passages, gateways, doors etc. numbered
in a consecutive manner and stairways lettered.   At the same time a
suitable deadline for submission of survey reports by each discipline to
the City Council should be agreed after which the procedure outlined in
1.7 above would operate preparatory to the issue/replacement of a
General Safety Certificate to each ground.

The Legal Position

I have included this part in order to outline my understanding of the
legal position and to indicate a number of aspects about which I think a
clear understanding is necessary.

As I see it the powers, duties and functions of the CityCouncil      are
clearly set out     in the 1975 Act.    The Advisory Group (safety team)
approach is not    covered in the Act although       it   is   obviously
advantageous.

The Council is required to send a copy of any application for a safety
Certificate or a transfer of a safety certificate to the Fire Authority.
In the case of an application for a Safety Certificate, the council is
required to consult the Fire Authority about the terms and conditions to
be included in the certificate.       This requirement to consult also
applies to any proposal to amend,       replace or transfer a safety
certificate.

To consult means to seek information or advice from; to take into
consideration. It imposes no requirement on the City Council to accept
the advice of the Fire Authority.For example, the Council may
sometimes have to balance the merits of conflicting advice and make a
judgement which it considers will provide for the reasonable safety of
spectators. This is the reason why I regard my recommendations at 1.2
                         - 3 -
       and 1.7 to be extremely important. Ultimately the City Council sets the
       standards having first considered professional advice it has received.

       The Council is also required to give notice in writing to the Fire
       Authority as an interested party of its decision to issue, replace or
       amend a Safety Certificate or to refuse to amend or replace a Safety
       Certificate.   As an interested party the Fire Authority has a right of
       appeal which could be used for example where the Fire Authority did not
       agree with the standard set by the City Council perhaps as a result of
       its judgment of the merits of conflicting advice as mentioned in 2.4
       above.

2.6    Once the Council determines that, in its opinion, an applicant is a
       qualified person, it is then under a duty to issue a General Safety
       Certificate.   It has no power to withhold the issue of a Safety
       Certificate pending the carrying out of alterations or additions to the
       sports ground.    However, the terms and conditions within the Safety
       Certificate may be such as to involve alterations or additions being
       made at a sports ground. Pending the satisfactory completion of such
       works, the crowd capacity of the ground or parts can for example be
       limited or the use of a stand or a terrace entirely prohibited etc. By
       this means the General Safety Certificate becomes an instrument of
       continuing control.

2.7    In issuing a Safety Certificate the City Council has power to require an
       applicant to provide them within such time as they specify with such
       information and such plans as they consider necessary to enable them to
       determine the terms and conditions which ought to be included in any
       certificate issued in response to his application.         It would seem
       therefore that although once having determined an applicant to be a
       qualified person a Safety Certificate must be issued, the Act recognises
       that this is not possible if the necessary plans and information are not
       furnished within a reasonable time. The Council has power to extend the
       time allowed after which the application is deemed to have been
       withdrawn and an offence is committed if the sports ground is then used.

2.8    If while a General Safety Certificate is in force it is proposed to
       alter or extend the sports ground or any of its installations in a way
       which is likely to affect the safety of persons, the holder is required
       to give notice to the City Council.   Notice is particularly required
       when it is proposed to alter the entrances to or exits from the sports
       ground or any part of it (including any means of escape in case of fire
       or other emergency) or the means of access to any such entrances or
       exits.   Since such changes would necessitate the replacement        or
       amendment of the General Safety Certificate the City Council would be
       required to consult the Fire Authority as set out in 2.3 above.

2.9    The Fire Authority have powers of entry and inspection of sports grounds
       under Section 11 of the 1975 Act and has authorised its officers
       accordingly.

2.10   I feel that the Council should inform the disciplines in the Advisory
       Group what its policy is as regards enforcement of the Act particularly
       as regards the use of prohibition/restriction powers under section 10 of
       the 1975 Act and as regards contravention of Safety Certificate
       conditions.   Is there aprocedure     and standard form in being for
       implementing   Section    10?   In what form would the Council wish
       information to be passed to it where contraventions          of   Safety
       Certificate    conditions are found    by fire officers at a "during
       performance" inspection?Do you have your officers on call and would
       you want them to be called to the grounds? If so, details need to be
       supplied of names and telephone numbers.
                                 - 4 -
2.11 My view is that any legal proceedings for contravention of Safety
     Certificate conditions is the responsibility of the City Council. It
     has in the past been suggested that the Fire Service could institute
     legal proceedings regarding matters within its expertise regarding
     contravention of Safety Certificate conditions in view of its powers of
     entry and inspection under Section 11 or the 1975 Act. As indicated
     above, this is not a view to which I subscribe but I would be grateful
      for your view on the matter for the purposes of clarification.

2.12   As you know, Section 10 of the Fire Precautions Act 1971 is broadly
       similar to Section 10 of the 1975 Act. As such it can be applied by the
       Fire Authority to structures within sports grounds as regards fire risk.
       I do not envisage a situation arising where it would be appropriate to
       use the power since I regard the power under the 1975 Act to be the
       primary controlling legislation. Should a fire risk which merits the use
       of Section 10 powers come to the notice of the Fire Authority it will be
       my policy to consult the City Council with a view to it using its
       Section 10 powers.        Only in the case of a dispute where the Fire
       Authority considereda Section 10 notice should be served and the City
       Council did not, would the Fire Authority use its powers under Section
       10 of the 1971 Act.

       I stress that this is very unlikely to occur since any use would be a
       last resort, after consultations with the ground operator had failed to
       secure a reasonable standard of safety. I would be grateful for your
       comments regarding agreement or otherwise with this position so that any
       differences might be sorted out.

2.13 Under Section 10B, the City Council is required to enforce the 1975 Act
      and arrange for annual inspections of designated grounds in accordance
      with guidance issued by the Secretary of State under cover of Home
      Office Circular 72/1987.

3.     Comments on Content of Letter

3.1    In addition to giving advice to the City Council the Fire Authority
        advises Rotherham, Barnsley and Doncaster Councils.   Under the former
        South Yorkshire County Council there was a common Safety Certificate.
        This was convenient because a fire officer (or a police officer) being
        county based knew that certificate conditions were identical. Under the
        District Councils there are now four different sets of conditions which
        is in my view confusing and unnecessary. I recommend that liaison takes
        place between the District Councils to produce a common standard.

3.2    Communications

       I think my comments in part one indicate          my    views   regarding
       communication between the City Council and the members of the Advisory
       Group. It will obviously be necessary for there to be extensive
       consultation with clubs when dealing with applications for safety
       certificates, extensions or alterations to grounds and statutory and
       other inspections.    In this respect I refer to paragraph 4 of Annexe C
       to Home Office Circular 7/1986. A firm but friendly and helpful approach
       should be adopted when dealing with the clubs. You mention that Council
       members may wish to have a more prominent role in relation to the system
       although you do not state whatthat involvement might be.     So far as the
       carrying out of inspections isconcerned I feel that the Council should
       receive its advice from the professional members of the Advisory Group.
       Clearly, however, it is for the Council members        todetermine any
       involvement they consider appropriate. My only note of caution would be

                                - 5 -
to avoid any lengthening of the process leading to the issue   of   Safety
Certificates.

Role of each Member of the Advisory Group

I think that the group needs to meet to discuss this aspect in detail
taking into account any recommendations in Lord Justice Taylor's interim
report.   The comments of each discipline would have to be restricted to
those aspects for which they have expertise. The objective has to be to
ensure that no aspects are missed. Simply put, I perceive the role of
the Fire Service as giving advice on means of escape and fire
precautions in their broadest sense and ground capacity based on the
capacity of exits only. There are many areas of overlap particularly
between the Fire Officer and the Building Control Officer.           The
objective of designating a primary authority for certain aspects adopted
by the South Yorkshire County Council and in amended form by the City
Council is sound and both should be used as a basis for any review.

Review of Council's Approach to the Clubs

I am in general agreement with your comments although I will want to
discuss with you the exact method you propose and I would draw your
attention to my comments in Part 1 regarding surveys and the provisions
of plans etc.     It should be emphasised to all members of the Advisory
Group that they must not deal direct with clubs on matters covered by
the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 because of the danger that the
clubs will make alterations which may affect the safety of spectators
without the knowledge of the City Council or the other members of the
Advisory Group. All correspondence with the clubs on Safety of Sports
Grounds matters must be via the City Council.

Another problem which I feel needs addressing with the clubs is        the
tendency for a sudden rush of proposals usually in July when time       is
short and they want the work done before        the start of the new   season.
Because of the timing, key officers are often on holiday.     Often    the
alterations could have been submitted for approval long before the     end
of the playing season so that work could commence immediately after    the
end of the playing season.

Inspections and Enforcement of Certificate Conditions

So far as inspection prior to the issue of a general Safety Certificate
or in the case of extension or alteration of a certificated sports
ground is concerned. I refer to my comments in Part 1. As to a rolling
programme of inspections I refer to my comment at 1.5.

I feel that inspections carried out under Section 10B of the 1975 Act
should be in accordance with the statutory guidance and also the
supplementary but non statutory guidance given in Home Office Circular
72/1987.   Where there is no outstanding work to be done an annual
inspection should suffice but where work is outstanding or general
housekeeping and maintenance give cause for concern inspections should
be carried out more frequently. During performance inspection should be
carried out on an ad hoc basis, the frequency being determined according
to the standard of compliance found. Normally a DP inspection should be
carried out in the early part of a season. There may be advantage in
having the odd joint DP inspection, although I don't consider that
should be more than once per season, perhaps the first early season
inspection. The police should normally be notified in advance when a DP
inspection is to be made and any comments forwarded to the City Council.
So far as enforcement is concerned, I would refer you to my comments in
Paragraphs 2.10, 2.11 and 2.12. A standard inspection form similar to
                         -   6   -
     that attached to HOC 72/1987     would   be   Invaluable   for   carrying   out
     section 10B inspections.

     Role of Advisory Group and its ^rtministration

     I believe that the role of the Advisory Group has to be limited to
     giving professional advice within its area of expertise to the City
     Council to assist it to carry out its enforcement function. The City
     Council is ultimately responsibility for setting the required standard
     hopefully on the basis of agreed common advice from the Advisory Group.
     I do not believe that the notes (minutes) of meetings have been adequate
     in the past (often non were done). To maintain the impetus of such a
     diverse group needs active central administration and co-ordination.
     Hence my comments in Paragraphs 1.2 and 1.3. Properly devised forms
     could be of very great benefit. Obviously their objective and content
     would need careful consideration.      The notes or minutes of meetings
     whatever they are called should seek to record what was agreed or
     decided so that the progress made is identified. The whole objective
     being to ensure any differences are ironed out and a consolidated view
     reached.

      Safety Certificate Conditions

     There are a number of the conditions which I would like to discuss with
     Mr Bownes. Although I have not had time to give detailed consideration
     to them as yet. What I have mainly in mind is what detail should be
     recorded on the Safety Certificate plans. See Paragraph 1.9

I hope you find the contents of this letter both helpful and constructive and
I look forward to your response.        I look forward also to receiving the
comments of the other members of the Advisory Group which you stated in your
letter you would circulate.

ACO Seaman is on annual leave between 4th and 21st August and recognising that
the interim report will shortly be issued, I would ask that you contact my
Senior Fire Prevention Officer, Divisional Officer Hildreth or in his absence
either Divisional Officer Binnington or Temporary Divisional Officer Ryder.

  SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS

  In reply to your letter dated 16th August, 1989 requesting ground capacity
  figures for Sheffield United and Sheffield Wednesday Football Clubs, the
  figures based on means of escape calculations for Sheffield Wednesday's ground
  are included below.     The figures for Sheffield United's ground are being
  checked and will be forwarded to you as soon as possible.

  Sheffield Wednesday

  Spion Kop

  1.    The means of escape available without the forward evacuations on to the
        pitch consists of five exit routes, these being indicated on the
        terraces as V, W, X, Y and Z.

        The units of exit width available via these exit routes is:-

        V      -    8   units   catering   for
        w      -    8   units   catering   for 3,840 people    in   eight   minutes
        X      -    6   units   catering   for 2.880 people    in   eight   minutes
        Y      -    6   units   catering   for 2.880 people    in   eight   minutes
        Z      -   _7   units   catering   for 3,360 people    in   eight   minutes
                   35   units   catering   for L6,800 people   in   eight   minutes

  2.    It must be pointed out however that exits X and Y, whilst accepted at
        six units each, are very tight on the limit and it is only by accepting
        an allowance for overlap over handrails that the decision was made.   To
        avoid any doubt in future, it must be made clear that constructions such
        as these should have 1.1m clear between vertical uprights supporting the
        handrail/barriers.

       As can be seen, the units of exit width available could exit 16,800 in
       eight minutes and are capable of evacuating the revised capacity of
       18,200 in 8.6 minutes.

    3.   In previous calculations, four of the pitch perimeter gates, numbered 2,
         3, 4 and 5, supposedly of two units each, were utilised to ensure that
         the Kop could be evacuated in an emergency in under eight minutes. On
         checking the widths of these gates however, they were found to measure
          950mm, 1070mm, 990mm and 990mm respectively, each being less than the
          1100mm width required.

         Until such time as the gates can be widened to 1100mm, it would be
         reasonable to accept each gate as one unit instead of two units. The
         effect of this would be to reduce the evacuation time for the 18,200
         people to 7.8 minutes if the gates were used in an emergency situation.

    4.   What needs to be determined by the City Council is whether the principle
         that was previously adopted in allowing a normal evacuation time in
          excess of eight minutes is still acceptable, the use of certain pitch
         perimeter gates bringing the time below eight minutes only in an
          emergency situation. I understand Mr Purcheon, Director or Health and
          Consumer Services, expressed the view that the eight minutes should not
         be exceeded at a meeting of the Advisory Group held last week. Since
          then a similar view has been expressed by Chief Superintendent Broomhead
          of the South Yorkshire Police.

         Obviously it would be preferable if the conditions of the Green Guide
         were met in full and an evacuation time of eight minutes achieved for
         normal evacuation.    However, owing to the fact, that the principle is
         already in existence, and was agreed following much discussion and
         consultation with a normal evacuation time exceeding eight minutes when
         the Kop was extended in 1986, it may be considered unreasonable not to
         accept the situation as it now stands.

         If it is decided to continue to accept the principle of using pitch
         perimeter gates as part of means of escape calculations at Hillsborough
         Stadium, it should not be assumed that this will be allowed in other
         situations in order to increase crowd capacity if the limiting factor is
         means of escape.

    5.   In view of Lord Justice Taylor's recommendation that all pitch perimeter
          gates be recognised and indicated as emergency exits, it is felt that
          all such gates should be suitable for that purpose. Accordingly all
          gates indicated as emergency exits should be of at least 1.1m in width
          and provided with a level walk through arrangement off the terrace.

    North West Terrace   (upper)

    6.   This area is served by three exit stairways which are reasonably spaced
          and more than adequate to evacuate the capacity of 2,300 people
          specified in the Certificate. Again though, as in paragraph 2 above,
         the lower sections (below the intermediate landing) of each stairway,
         reduce to slightly less than 1.1m. By only calculating each stair as
         being two channels of one unit each, there are still six units of exit
         width available which would be capable of evacuating 3,300 people in
         eight minutes.

    7.   With 2,300 people evacuating from the North West Terrace and 50% of the
         capacity of the West Stand (2,233), 4,533 people are being directed to
          final exit gate 'B'. This number of people would require an exit width
         of 10 units. Gate 'B' is in fact only seven units wide.

         Until such time as the future use of the whole of the west end of the
         ground is determined, it is considered that the above situation is
         acceptable for the following reasons

                                   - 2 -
      (a)   It is understood that the capacity of the West Stand has been
            further reduced by agreement between the Club and the Police to
            4,000, reducing the numbers using gate 'B' by 233 which actually
            brings the number of units of exit widths required down to nine.

      (b)   The North West corner will not be used other than for overspill
            purposes should people turn up without tickets at those matches
            where large away crowds are anticipated.

      (c) Immediately in front of gate 'B' is a large area or 'reservoir'
           that would contain the additional number of people not catered for
           by the exit.

8.   The above calculations do not take into account any future use of the
     West Terraces which will have to be given further consideration when
     their use is determined.

      North and South Stands

      The means of escape arrangements for the North and South Stands are
      being considered separately and the observations of this department will
      be forwarded to you as soon as possible.

The above comments are made without prejudice to any further requirements that
maybe necessary following the      outcome of the second stage of Lord Justice
Taylor's Inquiry or the review of       Safety    Certificates   required   by
recommendation 13 of the Interim Report which I consider should be done in
accordance with recommendations in Section 1 of my letter dated 3rd August,
1989.

If there are     any      observations   you   wish to make please do not hesitate to
contact us.

Yours faithfully

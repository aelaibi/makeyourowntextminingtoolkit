 Dear Secretary

 Clubs will by now have had chance to study the Interim Report
 of the Hillsborough Inquiry and, in particular, Chapter 24 -
 The Recommendations.

 Clubs will, no doubt, have arranged to meet their local
 authority and local police, fire and ambulance services to
 liaise on this matter.

 Clubs are requested to ensure that the asterisked
 recommendations are carried out before the 1989/90 season
 starts. The remaining recommendations should be started
 forthwith and completed as soon as possible.

 If any problems are encountered, clubs should not hesitate to
 contact The Football Association or The Football League for
 advi ce.

 Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Bush

THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY - INTERIM REPORT

Thank you for your letter of 9 August about the Hillsborough
Inquiry's Interim Report.    I do realise the pressure which a
report of this sort places on those in local authority with
responsibilities for safety certification under the Safety of
Sports Grounds Act 1975.      We all appreciate the effort and
commitment which you and others are giving to the implementation
of the Report's recommendation as far as possible before the
beginning of the new football season.

Recommendation 2 of the Interim Report is, I believe, considered
an interim measure which together with other measures recommended
in the report is designed to maintain safety in the short term.
For our part we would not under any circumstances recommend a
calculation of capacity based on a density figure greater than 54
people per 10 square metres (now reduced by 15% in line with the
Interim R e port). This is the maximum figure quoted in the Guide
to Safety and Sports Grounds and should be used only in the way
described in paragraph 221 of the Guide.   Any figure higher than
this would not be commensurate with the spacing and strength
specification set out in the Guide for crash barriers and, as a
result, would be liable to pose an undue risk to the safety of
spectators.

On the question of police responsibility referred to in the
Interim Report, the Guide makes clear that responsibility for the
safety   within   the  ground   lies with  the  ground  operator.
Paragraph 2 04 of the Guide makes it clear that to discharge this
responsibility properly a special police presence inside the
ground may be necessary.      The relevant recommendation of the
Hillsborough Inquiry takes into account the position found to
exist at that ground on 15 April where certain functions and
responsibilities were regarded as having been taken over by the
police.  What is important here is that both the police and the
club should have a written agreement setting out the lines of
responsibility for each and in this way avoid the confusion of
which you speak.

I am copying this   to both   Liverpool   and Everton Football   Clubs
for information.
                                           Yours sincerely

    For the Attention of Mr. Mold

    Dear Sir,

    The Hillsborough Disaster - Interim Report

    The above report by Lord Justice Taylor includes, at Chapter 24, a total of 43
    recommendations which he regards as the minimum necessary, for the present, to
    secure safety. That applies pressure on me, as the officer to whom the City
    Council's functions under the 1975 Act have been delegated, to amend
    accordingly, the current Safety Certificates for the Liverpool and Everton
    clubs.

    I did that yesterday in respect of recommendations numbered 2, 5, 6 and 29.
    Those recommendations numbered 18, 19 and 22 will also be implemented by me very
    soon. Of the remainder, there are many where the recommendations have been the
    practice here for some time, and some of which are not applicable to the grounds
    concerned.

    Those then remaining will be examined during the next few months, in
    consultation with the Clubs, Police, Fire Authority and Ambulance Authority.
    Meanwhile, I refer to my conversation with your Mr. Mold on the telephone this
    morning, in which I expressed the view that some of those recommendations are
    not possible to implement under the current legislation.  The 1975 Act, as
    amended in 1987, restricts the Local Authority to certifying and controlling the
    reasonable safety of spectators at football grounds.  A number of Taylor's
    recommendations move into the field of comfort and convenience.   In my opinion
    that description must be applied to the very firm recommendation no. 2 which
    imposes a density of packing on terraces of a little under 46 persons per lOm^,
    when the "Green Guide" itself specifies 54, and I know from more than 18 years'
    experience, that a density of about 58 secures reasonable safety.




                                                                                       Continued ...

     There are a number of recommendations made in the Interim Report which cloud the
     division of responsibility for safety, and will tend to cause confusion, and
     therefrom will spring the sort of neglect which caused the Hillsborough
     disaster.  In that I refer to the several recommendations which imply that the
     Police have a responsibility for spectator safety, which in my Safety
     Certificates for the two local grounds, clearly rests with the Certificate
     Holder and his Stewards : the Police role, and what they are paid for by the
     Club, being to assist the Holder in that endeavour.

     I discussed the above matters for some time with your Mr. Mold, and the
     conversation was very helpful.  I would, however, urge that you should, at the
     earliest possible date, give firm guidance on the problems raised by Taylor's
     recommendations, so as to eliminate the sort of confusion which does lead to
     disasters like Hillsborough.

     Yours faithfully,




     City Building Surveyor.

    Dear Peter,

    The Hillsborough Interin Report

    I expect that you have now considered Taylor's Interim Report on the
    Hillsborough Disaster. You will therefore appreciate the urgent need, for
    me to let you know what amendments will be made to the current General
    Safety Certificate, in order to incorporate those very firm interim
    recommendations contained in Part IV. Before doing that, a couple of
    relevant general comments are worth making, even at this early stage.

    Firstly, the report reveals clearly that a special relationship existed at
    Hillsborough between the Police and the Club (See Paras.  166 to 171). That
    relationship does not exist at either of the Clubs in Liverpool, nor do I
    imagine it exists at the majority of other grounds designated under the 1975
    Act. The purpose of the Police presence within the Stadium at Anfield has been
    agreed and is identified at general condition 1.7 of the Safety Certificate.

   The Taylor Report contains a number of other references, and one or two
   recommendations to Police duties and responsibilities, in relation to
   safety in the ground, during a certified use, which are not provided for
   or implied in the legislation.  I regard the law, and therefore this Authority's
   Safety Certificate, to make it quite clear that 'the Holder' is responsible for
   all matters of safety, both at normal times and in any emergency. He is
   required to set up management, communications and stewarding systems to cope
   with that responsibility, and to use the uniformed Police presence to add
   authority and to provide consultative advice to those arrangements during a
   'certified use'. The one present exception to that is contained in the Safety
   Certificate at General Condition No. 1.8. Another is being recommended by
   Taylor (and is to be added) to take account of the responsibility of the Police
   for law and order outside the ground.




         When calling or telephoning please ask f o r   Mr....L.N.â€žBush

NBBAAX
                                                    -   2 -



         In some respects, the Taylor report appears to produce grey areas, but I am
         concerned to avoid any division of responsibility for safety in 'the
         Stadium' which might lead to confusion, and possibly therefore, a lack of
         attention. Therefore, I would emphasise that unless specific provision is
         made in the Safety Certificate for the transfer of responsibility in any
         particular matter, every aspect of spectator safety within the ground, with the
         exception of breaches of law, order and decency, remains the responsibility of
         the Certificate Holder.

         It will be some time before I can complete the formal amendment of the current
         Safety Certificate, having regard to the alterations which are still taking
         place at Anfield, and also the total recommendations contained at Chapter 24 of
         the Taylor Interim Report. Meanwhile, therefore the current Certificate will
         have to be amended piecemeal by letters, this being the first. The
         recommendations contained in the report fall into a number of categories, as
         follows

         1.   Amendment of the Safety Certificate

              Phase 1   :Immediate Specific amendments, to apply to all certified
                          uses, based on the firm recommendations of the Interim
                          Report.

              Phase 2   :   Possible amendments, for which the details need to be
                            discussed with the Club and other parties.

         2.   Matters to be dealt with by myself, for the Local Authority.

         3.   Matters to be dealt with by the Club.

         4.   Matters to be dealt with by the Police.

         The actions suggested> or required to be taken are scheduled separately and
         attached to this letter.

     In addition to the recommendations made by Lord Justice Taylor, there are also
     recommendations to Clubs from the Football League, dated 10th July 1989, and
     from the Football Association, dated 26th July 1989, copies of which have been
     furnished to me by Jim Greenwood of Everton. You will no doubt compare these
     with the attached schedule when considering your response to them.

     Finally, whilst I appreciate that all the recommendations contained in Taylor's
     Interim Report are discretionary, I feel bound to apply those which are very
     directly related to spectator safety, and which are very specific in their
     content.  Some of these may be reconsidered in the final report which is to come
     following Phase 2 of the Inquiry and other parties, including football clubs,
     will undoubtedly continue to debate their merit, to influence the final report
     in those respects.

     Yqurs sincerely,




         City Building Surveyor.

         SCHEDULE REFEREED TO IN LETTER OF 8TH AUGUST 1989

         Considering Chapter 24 - The Recommendations of the
         Hillsborough Interim Report

         Action to be taken, including amendments to General Safety Certificate

         (The numbering is that used in the report)

         1.   Not applicable.

         2.   Only applicable to the Kop, and needs to consider   also
              Recommendation 19.

              Current certificate capacity - 21,500

              Current area - 3,682m2

              Density   - 58.3 persons per 10m2

              Area reduced by Safety Corridor - 3,506m2

              Reduction to "Green Guide" Capacity   of 54 per 10m2 - 18,940

              Reduction by a further 15% - 16,090   persons

              Number of turnstiles provided - 31

              Turnstile check (See Item 19) - 18,600   persons

              Schedule 2 of the Certificate is therefore AMENDED to fix       the maximum
              capacity for this enclosure at 16,090.

         3.   These arrangements already exist.

         4.   The Police have no responsibility for this matter at Anfield, except
              so far as they are employed by the club to assist the Certificate
              Holder and his Stewards in this respect. The item nevertheless will
              be tabled for further discussion in meetings to be held.

         5.   Schedule 6 of the Certificate is AMENDED to add two more Crowd
              Stewards, allocated to the Spion Kop enclosure,providing   a total of
              eight.    The duties and functions ofthose 8Stewards shall now
              specifically include monitoring the filling of the enclosure,and    to
              check crowd conditions therein at all times during a certified use,
              for possible overcrowding or distress. The two extra Stewards
              required shall be located on the track in front of the Kop for that
              purpose. All 8 Stewards shall be able to communicate to the Head
              Steward, without delay, in adverse circumstances noted by any of them.
              The Head Steward shall then notify the Police Control        Room to          arrange
              for suitable announcements to be made, and shalltake steps, with the
              aid of Police Officers, to correct the overcrowding, or deal
              effectively with the distress.

         6.    Paragraph 6.3 ofthe Certificate shall be AMENDED toinclude the
              training referred to here.    That training requires to be done without
              delay.   It is suggested that it be organised for some time next
              weekend, when the assistance of the Liverpool Supporters Club may be
              enlisted to provide about 100 spectators.    These can be confined to

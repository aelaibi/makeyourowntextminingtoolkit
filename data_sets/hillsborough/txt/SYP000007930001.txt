involved          in.        There       were        very            few    inflatables                about,          the w e a t h e r          was

good    and       the       crowd       spirit          seemed             terrific.              I looked             around          the    ground

and    I t o ok        in the       scene          for          a good        ten m in ut e s            before         and       up    to    the

like    two      thousand.               I saw          the          kick-off          for    the        g ame        and    I knew          where

the    two       supporting             factions                were       located          in the          stadium.

About      one m i n u t e         or   one        and a             half     minutes         into          the       game       I scanned           the

pitch and          saw B r u c e        GROBBLER                 far       out    on    the       e dge      of       his    penalty          area.

I thought          to m y s e l f       t hat        he w a s          playing          a    dangerous                game       and    running

to L a u r i e     McManamie            and        said          something             like,           “W H A T       ARE THEY          ALL

              and worse          and      built       up    to     quite          a surprising                number.               There       was    no

              am    utterly amazed               that       what       was        happening             at    the        Leppings          Lane       end

           persons       was    good when       the   scope    of   things    became    apparent       but   that

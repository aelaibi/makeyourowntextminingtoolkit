               At 9. 4 5 am         (0945)      on S a t u r d a y    15th April            1989   (150489),       I commenced

               duty at the S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y Football                     C l u b w ith regard to the s e m i ­

               final       betw e e n Liv e r p o o l      and N otts Forrest.

               My    immediate         s u p e r v i s o r y officer        was Pol i c e S e r g e a n t C H A P M A N and,            at

               approximately                11 am   (1 1 0 0 ), we took up ouj^p<jfsi,;tion at the bottom of

               the       p l a y e r s ’ tunnel     on the      perimeter            te4ckJ

               At    1 pm (1300),             together w i t h Po l i c e S e g e a n t CHAPMAN,                 we went         to the

               rear       of the N o r t h S t a n d where we were                    provided wit h a hot meal,                   which

               we    consumed,         and then        retu rned to our original                     posilxton on the tunnel.

               At a b o u t 2. 3 0          pm (1430),       as the        centre      pen began/to           fill,     I saw a

               number        of Liv e r p o o l     supporters            doing what         I                 describe as

               storming         from the top of the                   centre        pen to/the       b o t t o m , causing a

               large number            of     people to be pushed for/wjard towards                          the s e c u r i t y
                                                                                                            PAGE
                                                                                                            S922

f encing at the front.

One    of these s u p p o r t e rs involved kept s t a nding                       on a safety barrier

an d then throwing              himself         intp^frhe c r o w d , who w ould then repeat

the m a n o e u v r e    by pushing i^wanqr t&tfards the front of the terrace.

The    only d e s c r i p t i o n Jr have of this ma n                  is that he a p p e a r e d to have

shoulder        length d/trk h a i r a n d was wearing a blue                        checked       lumber

jacket      type (ftytrt.             My a t t e n t i o n was then d i r ected on the Forr e s t

supporters.

At 2.41        pm   <1441),          I n o t i c e d that the a rea a l l o c a t e d to the Forr e s t

s u p p o r t e r s a pp e a r e d    to be     reaching       capacity         level and,     again,      on

looking        towards       the N o r t h S t a n d and L e p p i n g s LN area,             I said to

P o l i c e S e r g e a n t CHAPMAN,          "Where are all            the Liv e r p o o l   supp o r t e r s ? "

As there a p p e a r e d to be a mple                  room in both areas     rt from the

a fter a few minutes,                  the    crowd a p p e a r e © Vo s/frg© forward and there

                                                                                .
was what a p p e a r e d to be an overspill                       9/rtto (the       at the back                 of

the goal at the L e p p i n g s LN end.

There was nothing                else     to suggest         that there wds a n y t h i n g          other      than

an overspill            onto    the track.                                  /
                                                                               /
I then saw S u p e r i n t e n d e n t G R E E N W O O D        run o/ito the        pitch and speak             to

the    referee.          It was then that               I realised that this              incident was

s o m e t h i n g more     serious.

The    players        came off the            pitch an d the            referee and     linesmen stayed

w i t h Police S e r g e a n t C H A P M A N and myselff <at the                   bottom of the tunnel

It then seemed that all                      hell    had\ l e t [loose as         s upporters were all

over     the    pitch.

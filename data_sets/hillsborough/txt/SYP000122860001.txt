                                                I attended the Football match in question and
                                       was standing in the Leppings Lane terraceing were the
                                       incidents took place. I was also involved in the
                                       problems that occurred outside the ground prior to
                                       the kick-off.
                                                I would be grateful for the opportunity to
                                        give a statement to an officer of the Investigating
                                        Team from West Midlands Police, and forward this report

  Dear David,

  further to our telephone conversation herewith please find our press release “for
  information” and you will see it contains the names of the committee/ official
  party that will meet Jack Straw. Hopefully that should assist you with the pass/
  security procedures.

  It has been suggested that the families “do not want the Liverpool M P ’s present”
  at the meeting - please be advised that is not correct. We are quite happy for
  them to join us if possible.

  I will be contacting you on Monday morning to check everything is O.K. but
  please note my mobile number “just in case'” in.|

  regards

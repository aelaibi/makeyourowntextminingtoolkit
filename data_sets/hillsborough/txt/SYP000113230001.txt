           The    pre-match Police                  briefing             was    given      in the N o r t h S t a n d           (Hop end)

           and    c o m m e n c e d at a p p r o x i m a t e l y          1 0 . 0 0 a.m.         It was       a    comprehensive

           briefing       and       there         was    in put       from Chief           Superintendent               Duckenfield,

           Inspector          Sewell         and Detective                Sergeant         Charlesworth.

           Immediately             following            the    briefing,             I sought         out all        the a b o v e      named

           Inspectors          and      I personally                handed        to t h e m w r i t t e n        (photcopy)           details

           of    criminal          intelligence which                     had     been     collated          concerning           people

           likely      to a t t e n d        the m a t c h       from         both Liverpool             and Nottingham.

           I spoke       to e a c h        of     the    Inspectors             and mentioned              points       which      I

           considered          to     be     of    particular             importance            as    far as       their     own a rea         of

           r e s p o ns i bi l it y was           concerned.              I knew       t h at    Inspectors           Sykes       and White

           both    had    vast        experience              of P o l i c i n g      at H i l l s b o r o u g h a n d     intimate

           knowledge          of    the      duties          they     had      been allocated.

           Following          the     briefing           until        approximately              S.00      p.m.      no m a t t e r s     of

           particular          n o te      took     place.            I spent         this      t i me    'walking        the     ground*

           Additionally,              I spoke           to m a n y       of    the S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y F.C.

           operate.           During         the    course          of    th e m o r n i n g     I saw,       and     heard       part     of a

spoke            to S u p e r i n t e n d e n t    Murray.               I asked         him      if he ha d a n y             preference

the L e p p i n g s       Lane      terraces.                I was       informed           that         the       filling          of    the

fenced         pens w o u l d      be a l l o w e d          to    take       p l ac e     in a n a t u r a l            fashion and

that      no     control        would       be     exercised             by the P o l i c e              on the          supporters

regarding             which     particular              pen w o u l d         be    filled.              This       i ns tr uc ti on was

exactly          in     line w i t h       the     instruction                given       the      previous              y e a r,    when

Liverpool             supporters           ha d    occupied             the     same      parts          of    the       stadium.             I

only      raised         this     question           because            I was       aware         that        on    previous

occasions             different         methods          ha d      been       used       to a c c o m m o d a t e         spectators.

As     people         started      to      enter        the       stadium          I could         see        the    usual          mixture

of     supporters.              They were            in g o o d         spirits          and      obviously              looking

forward          to w h a t     had     been       forecast             as    an    interesting                game       between          the

two     teams.

Shortly after               2.15      p.m.        I visited             Leppings          Lane       where          I spoke          to

Inspector           Sykes.         There          was    a    contingent             of L i v e r p o o l           supporters

standing           in L e p p i n g s      Lane      on the         opposite             s i de    of     the       r o ad     to    the

stadium.            We    discussed          the m e r i t          of       encouraging             these          people          across

th e    r o ad     to    queue     for      e n t r y to          the    stadium.              Many       of       these       were

openly         drinking         from       cans     of       beer       and     lager;         they were             no t at         t h is

time     causing          any    trouble.               After       d i s c u s s i o n we a g r e e d              that       such a

course         of a c t i o n w a s        not     necessary             as     there       was      a    reasonable                quantity

of     supporters           already         forming           queues          outside          the       turnstiles.

Furthermore,              it w a s      considered                that       to m o v e     these         people          at    t h is

stage may             inflame      the      crowd.

    As    t i me    progressed              towards            the      scheduled          kick       off    time       it b e c a m e

    apparent         that        a    large         number          of L i v e r p o o l       supporters          were       still

    outside         the     ground          in L e p p i n g s         Lane       and    in the        queues       to       the

    turnstiles.                 I n o t i c e d at          t h is     time       that     the       proportion          of    supporters

    who    had o b v i o u s l y           been       drinking           increased.              They were,             however,            at

    this     time        only a minority                    and were             not    causing        any    distruption.                  Many

    of    the      fans     who       arrived were                  unsure        of    th e    geographical             layout         of       the

    turnstiles             which       gave        admittance               to    the N o r t h S t a n d ,        the L e p p i n g s           Lane

    terraces         and        elevated           section and                the W e s t       Stand.        The       signs       above

    the    turnstiles                were       not    cl ear         and many          fans were           confused,          a specific

    example         of     this was             the a l p h a b e t i c          character           displayed above                the

    turnstile            and      the      alphabetic                character shown                 on the    ticket         as     the

    gangway         to      be u s e d      for a c c e s s            to   the     West       Stand were          in    apparent

    conflict.               It w a s        necessary               for P o l i c e O f f i c e r s to        give       constant

    assistance              in t h i s          r es pe c t.

    At    approximately                2.30        p.m.        I could           see    that     difficulties                were     being

    experienced             in the          build        up to         the       turnstiles          which were              allocated            to

    t he N o r t h S t a n d ,         the         West      Stand and            the L e p p i n g s       Lane     turnstiles -

    all    these         three        locations             ar e      fed     from Leppings             L a n e.        From       t hi s

    point       un t i l    after          3.00       p.m.       I continued             to m o n i t o r     and       supervise            the

^   Leppings         Lane        end       of      the    g r o u n d on the            outside.

    I was       with       Inspector               Sykes       w h e n he        caused        the    flow    of     traffic          to s t o p

    in L e p p i n g s      Lane       in o r d e r         to      facilitate           more        opportunity             for    the      e v er

    increasing             pedestrian              traffic            to m a k e       progress.

    I have         considerable                 experience             of     Policing          this     particular            area and            I

    c o u l d see        that        the    build        up of         supporters              was    later    than          usually         the

    c a se a n d     there           appeared          to      be     larger       numbers.            The    o p e r a t i o n was

    frustrated more                   so    by the          presence             of a    considerable              number          of f an s

    who    ha d a r r i v e d         in the          vicinity           of      the    ground        but w e r e       not    in

Leppings        Lane        end      of   the     ground          in      possession              of      tickets           which

entitled        them admission                   to    the       Spion Hop and attempted                               to    seek

approval        to      enter        at   the L e p p i n g s          Lane        end with             friends         who        had

legitimate           tickers          for       that    a rea.

The     situation           outside         the       turnstiles,               particularly                   those        leading           to

the L e p p i n g s      Lane        terraces,          was       such       that         by a p p r o x i m a t e l y           2.40       p.m.

a   situation           had a r i s e n w h e r eb y             there       was      a     l a r ge      crowd        of     supporters

who were        all      pushing          towards          the        turnstiles               but      the      turnstiles               could

n ot a c c e p t      them      quickly          enough          to     permit        entry          to    the     ground.                The

mood     of    t h is    crowd was              changing          from a good                  natured           crowd        to a

frustrated            crowd who            could       perhaps            see      that        they       h ad    little            chance         of

gaining        access          prior      to     the    start           of    the m a t c h .             The     proportion                of

spectators            who      had    been       drinking             i n c r e a s e d as        t im e       progressed              but

they were           outnumbered             by    people          who        did    not        exhibit           any     signs         of     dr in k .

Within        this      crowd        there       were       at     least        two       or     three         Police         horses who

were     attempting             to    stop       the       pushing.             It has a l w a y s               b e e n my

experience            t ha t    horses          are able           to      control          such a situation,                        but      it

was     obvious         in t h i s        instance          that        this was            not      the       case.

A Polilce           Constable             was    allocated              to    the     outside             of     e a c h of         the

turnstiles            for      the L e p p i n g s         Lane       terraces.                These       officers                were     given

the     task     of     preventing              Supporters                entering          the      ground         in       possession

of w e a p o n s ,      banners,           alcohol          etc.          This      searching              action            did     not

impede        the     rate      of    flow       of    spectators               through            the     turnstiles.

Because        of     the      intense          pressure           from       the     surging             crowd,            it w a s

The    crush w i t h i n            the     crowd was          such        that      people        were    suffering           and

or    three       bodies           of y o u n g    persons           passed       over      the     head     of m e m b e r s        of

the    crowd,           these       people        either       had,        or w e r e     c lose     to    fainting.

At approxima tel y                  2.45        p.m.    I rejoined            Inspector            Sykes     in L e p p i n g s

Lane      a n d we       adopted          a strategy           of     forming         a   line      of P o l i c e      horses        at

the    rear        of      the     crowd w it h a view                to    preventing             the    queues        at    the

turnstiles              becoming           la r ger.         This     took some           t i me     to a r r a n g e .       There

were      gaps        between           one P o l i c e      horse      a n d the         n e xt    one a n d    I attempted

to a r r a n g e        for a P o l i c e         Officer        to    ’p l u g ’ each         gap.        Many       supporters

approached              this       line     and    forced        their        way     through,           despite        firm

advice       not        to    do    so.         I even       saw a s up p o r t e r         crawl        under     the       belly        of

a horse          in o r d e r       to     breach       the     line.

I could         see        that     some        people       were      climbing           o ve r    the t o p    of     the

turnstiles              in o r d e r       to    gain admittance                to    the     s t a d i u m a n d at         one

p oi nt    I r ec a l l          seeing         Inspector        Bennett          (*F ’ Division)               on t o p       of    the

wall      above         the      turnstiles            serving        the L e p p i n g s        Lane      terraces.

Some      minutes            l a t er     I attempted           to    contact         Police        Control        by        radio    but

could       not       do     so;     there       appeared        to    be a f a u l t w i t h m y             particular             rad i o

(a Py e         PFX     personal           hand    held       radio)         in t h a t     it w a s       receiving           but    I

could       not       transmit.              I approached             Police          Constable          Buxton        who     was    at

this      t im e      in a P o l i c e          Landrover.            This       vehicle         was     parked        in L e p p i n g s

Lane      and      the       officer         was       giving     instructions              to the         supporters           by

means       of a         public         address         system.        He       was    urging        the    spectators              not

to     pu s h    forward.               I requested Police                   Constable             Buxton     to      suggest        to

t he C o n t r o l         Room      that       consideration              be    given      to      delaying          th e    kick-off

time      of     the m a t c h           (his     radio,       a Motorola HT600E                    hand    held       radio,

appeared           to      be      functioning           well).        This       suggestion was                apparently                not

acted       upon.

At   approximately                 this          time    I was        able    to     see       that     th e     large

’ c o n c e r t i n a ’ gates,             k n o w n as     ’A ’ , ’B*        and        ’C ’ , h a d    been        opened and

t h at   a    large           proportion           of    the    crowd        surged        forward through                  these

gates.            These         gates      were     only       opened        for a s h o r t           period        of    time a nd           I

c o u l d see        officers/stewards                    at    t he       rear    of     the     gates        apparently

struggling               to     close       them,       which       they were            subsequently able                   to     do *

It    is m y       impression              that     gate       * C ’ remained             open        for a      longer         period

than     the       others.            As     a    result       of     this    action            the    pressure           on the

turnstiles               reduced although                 supporters              were     s t i ll     arriving           at      the

ground.            This         action       clearly       had        the    result         of    easing         the      tension

outside           th e     turnstiles             although          th e    crowd there were                   still       pushing

forward.

A    short        t im e      later,        I would       estimate           just        after        3.00     p.m.       there         was    a

request           for      all    officers          to a t t e n d         inside        the     ground        to    deal       w i t h an

apparent           invasion           of     the     surface          playing        are a .          I did      not      h ea r    the

specific           r a d io      transmission             but       I did     hear        officers            a r o u n d me       saying

words        to    t he       effect        of    "all    officers           inside         -    pitch        invasion".

I immediately attended                            inside       th e    ground and went                  to     the     rear        of    the

g oa l   at       the L e p p i n g s        Lane       e n d of      the    stadium.             I could           see    that

people were                t r a p pe d a nd that           the       gates       from      the       centre        p en s w e r e       open

and      people were              coming          through       them.         There         was       considerable

confusion.                 Some       supporters          were        climbing           over     the     fences,          they were

assisted            to     do    so    by P o l i c e     Officers           and      by o t h e r      supporters.                 I

assisted            in the        general          activity           of    lifting         injured and apparently

dead      people           from       the    Leppings          Lane        terraces         onto       th e     playing         a r e a.       I

arriving.                I gave        instructions             to     some       officers            in a n a t t e m p t         to

co-ordinate what                      was    happening.               I can        r ec a l l    in    particular

              mortuary.      My    primary         tasks      were    ensuring         t h at    each    victim        brought

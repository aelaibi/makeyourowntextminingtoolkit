HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY - INCIDENTAL EXPENDITURE


Mr Sandiford's note of 9 May to Mr Whalley (copy attached)
confirmed that reasonable expenses for the provision of a piano
at the Judge's lodgings would be met from financial provision for
the Inquiry.

2.   I am therefore enclosing form ACC13 together with an invoice
for the first two weeks hire, and should be grateful if you would
authorise payment and forward to Accounts Branch, Room 1533,
Lunar House.

3.   Please let me know if there are any difficulties.

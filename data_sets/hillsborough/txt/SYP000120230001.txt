                 At 8 .30 a.m.            on Saturday,        13th April       1989,    I comenced duty          in full

                 uniform at W o o d s e a t s Police Station,                  Sheffield,         in relation to a

                 1 was t r a n s p o r t e d together wit h other P o l i c e Officers,                      by a PS V

                 took     place      in the N o r t h S tand are a an d the o f f i c e r s w e r e            given some

                 packed refreshments.                  My duties were          that    of serial      11.

                 At a p p r o x i m a t e l y   11.13 a.m.      that    day,    together with Det e c t i v e

                 Pol i c e S e r g e a n t Edwards,         I went     to the     inside of the L e p p i n g s Lane

                 t urnsti les        to    patrol    the    inside     of the     turnstiles        numbered        1 to 8.

                 The    s upporters         could be seen thro u g h the turnstiles and M o u n t e d

                 O f f i c e r s were      on duty at that          location outside the ground.                    Police

                 Of f i c e r s were a lso         p ositioned on the outside              of the t u r n s t i l e s    to

hinged fencing           had been opened.                 This      p revented suppo rt er s         entering

the West S t a nd a r e a and a portable                      barrier        fence was      placed there       by

the    ground staff.            This      enab le d two more               turnstiles      to be brought

into     use to a l lo w the suppo rt er s                 into the N o r t h S tand a re a of the

ground.

At    12 noon,       the t ur ns t il e s were           op en ed and a number of suppo rt er s

came     t h ro ug h to get        t he ms el ve s a good           p os ition    in the ground.         A

number       of S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y s up po rt er s        came to the turns ti le s

as ki n g    if a progr amme           could be        pur ch as ed        and   passed out to them.

T h o s e r e quests were m a d e ..

As    the time       passed,       the    turn st il es        became muc h busier and            problems

were     being       caused by the supporters.                      As the tickets wet'e being

handed       into     the tu rn st il e        operators,,          fans from behind were             snatching

the tickets and             trying to use them a g ai n to get                      into    the ground.

O ther      fans were       jump in g     over      the barri er s and            claiming    that     they   Itad

h anded      their     tickets       in but that was                not    so.

Due    to these        problems,,        1 stood        inside       the    turnstile areas and

s up e r v i s e d   both booths at that                e nt rance        numbers F     and 6-    .     I could

see    the     crowd outside and at a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 . 3 0               p.m.    1 could see that

the    crowd out-side had swollen                     considerably.              fhe Police O ff ic er s

outside were           e x p e r i e nc i ng   d i ff i c u l t y   in searching       due to    the numbs r ■*>

and an obvious            pressure was            being       caused       in the surge      forward     to   the

tur nsti 1 e ertt ranees .

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 .40     p.m.     the     turnstile          entrances     were jammed and        a

number       of youths        e n te re d with        tickets        to    the West Stand area.          It was

impossible           to direct       them back and             to the       correct    turnstiles?       due to

the suppo r t er s        that had m o v ed forw ar d and filled their                        space     as they

entered        the    turnstile.           They were a 1 lowed through and d ir ec te d

t hr o u g h the      portable       barrier        fencing         to the a p p r o pr i at e a r e a of the

ground.

                                                                                                                 R 384

At    that, point,          n um erous        fans we re s cr am b li n g       over the walls             and    into

the    ground and           it was       impossible       to    stop them.            1' d et ai n ed    two and

at t em p te d to eject            them from the          g r o u n d , but     it     was    not possible to

send     them back          t h ro ug h the tur ns ti le areas.                      It was   not possible to

put    them thro ug h the               large gates       to L ep pi n gs Lane as the s upporters

were     pushing a g ai n st            it.     Had   it b een opened           they w o u l d    have      spilled

i nsi d e .

It was        not    practical          to take these          two    to the Poli ce R oo m as the

d ep l et i o n of P ol i ce O ff icers w o u l d have                 caused more            problems      than

could have           been       benef itted and the            two were allo we d to enter as

paying        supporters.              Furt he r youths        e n te r ed with tickets and                it was

quite     obvious          that    they had been          in an       i ntoxicated        state      but    it was

not    possible        to arrest          or eject       these       from the ground either.

L o ok in g    t h ro ug h the         turnstiles      I could see that               the M o u n t e d Officers

were     stuck       solid       in a compacted          crowd w hi ch was s ur geing                forwards and

stre tc h i ng       for    some       considerable       distance.            The P o l i c e w o m a n on the

outside        of the       tur ns ti le       had been      pinned to           the wall       by force     of the

crowd and she was                 pulled       into the      t u rn st il e      and into      the      ground.

As the supp or te rs              c on tin ued to      come     thro ug h the turnstiles,                  I could

see that some              of    them were        clearly      injured.         Some     had obvious         limps,

others were           clutching at             parts of their          own bodies and showing                    sign©

of pain on their                 faces.        As they    came t h ro ug h the gates they

e xpressed          relief      due     to having      e s ca p ed from        the    pressure       on the

outside        of the ground.

I could see that                 the    people     on the      outside        of the     ground were         clearly

d i s t r e s s e d and a great           deal     of s uf f er i ng was        being     experienc ed.

B eing    inside       the       turnstile area,          1 s t ar te d to pull           people        through the

turnstiles           to atte mp t        to a l le vi at e     the outside           pressure.          As some

came through           they were          in poor      con di ti on and were             taking      their       first

full     gasp of air as they ente re d the                       tur ns ti le        space.      A number went
                                                                                                            PAGE        4
                                                                                                            R384

to an     internal           fence     in the    t ur nstile and stood for a w hile                   to

recover       before m a ki n g         their way to the N o rt h Stand                part    of the ground.

The     stream       of s up p or te rs    continued to come over                 the wall      and    into       the

W est    Stand e n t rance           to the ground a nd           1 continued to pull            supporters

t h r o u g h the turnstiles.              A number       of these          did not have       tickets,       but

there was        no way        they     could be sent        back,       ejected or arrested.                There

was     no other       course        of action     but    to let them through and                into the

ground.         As    1 pulled some of the s pe ct a to r s                  through,     the turnstile

staff were           unable      to take     the stubs       off      the    tickets    fast    enough and

some went        thro u gh w i th ou t       handing      the m    in.       The t ur ns ti le s w o u ld have

r egistered          the     numbers     going    through.

T h r o u g h o u t all      this,     children as young as              seven or eight years               old

were     jumping       over      the    turnstiles,       claiming          to be wit h    parents and

running       t h r o ug h    into     the ground.        It was       impossible       to stop them,             due

to their        numbers        and the     c ir cu ms ta nc es     s ur ro unding      their    en trance and

the     duties       that     I was     completing.         Elderly         people were       complainant          of

the     intense       pressure         outside and some           of the      injuries     they had

sustained.            T hey were        d ir ec te d towards       the Police Roo m and as                 none

were     p a r ti c u l a rl y serious,         they were       directed,        rather    than escorted

to the Police R o o m and                first aid area.

As    the time        neared three         o'clock,       the     pressure      behind the outside

crowd was at           its worse,,         People were          s c reaming and f ig ht in g was

taking     place,          although      limited,     and    being       nothing more         than the

s w i nging     of fists and            pushing    to get       into     the turnstile a re a         and

through       into the         ground.       The a t mo s p h e r e    was      very tense and

a g g r e s s i v e and      v i r tu a ll y everyone     that     e nt er ed stated that         someone

was     going    to foe k i ll e d       in the    crush outside.

I did not have a radio                   issued to me        for this           duty but   I was aware

that a mess a g e            had alre ad y      been passed        to the Ground Control              R oom to

that     effect.           I could hear         the crowd       shouting       outside an d      it was

appar en t     that      the       teams    had gone       onto    the      pitch.    The    time w ou ld be

approximately 3.00                  p.m.    and the     pushing and a g gr e s s i o n was

accelerated            by the       fact    that the game          had s t a r t e d .

Whi ls t    helping          the    s upporters      thro ug h     the turnstiles,           I noticed that

the     pressure        had s ud de n ly dropped.                I was      unaware      of the    reason why

as    I was    p r e - o c c up i ed with helping               the s upporters          thro ug h the

turnstiles.             As    I looked       through       I could see that the               crowd had

v i rtually      gone and that              some    s u pp or te rs    had moved         to the    sides.        Only

a few       continued         to queue       to hand       in their         tickets and the         turnstiles

slo w e d down al mo st             to a halt.

W o n d e r i n g at    the    reason for the drop                in crowd pressure,              I came out

from the       t urnstile are a to see the tail                        end of a crowd of            supporters

running       into the         crowd.        1 soon     reali se d that the gates                 had been

o pened and on looking at                    them    1 could see that            they were         badly    dented

a n d d i s to rt ed w here          they had been either                 pushed agai ns t        or banged on.

At a p p r o x i m at e ly 3.0 6        p.m.   I was       i n fo rm ed     that there      had    been a pitch

i nv asion and as my a tt en d an c e was                   no    longer      required at the

turnstiles,            I a t t e nd e d w it h other        o ff ic er s     from serial       11, making my

way     to the     pitch.           T og ether with D e t e c t iv e C on st ab le s Friend,

T i t t e r t o n and Oakes,          I went       round the       right      side    of the West Stand

an d to the        rear       of the goalposts             in     front      of the West Stand.

As    I did,     1 saw that           the    crowd was s ur g in g and that                people were

pinned to the            perimeter wire fencing,.                     The    place w here      it was      the

most     serious was           to the       left side       of the goal posts w here               I could see

that     people were           d i s fi g u r e d as their        faces were         pinned to the wire

meshing.         An officer           pointed to one              stating      that he was        dead and       on

looking,       it was         clear     that a number             were a l re ad y dead and others were

dyi n g .

S ome    of the        people       pinned to the          fence      had vomit       on them and        they

were     unable        to move.        Their       skins    had turned         to a b l ue /p ur pl e      colour

-and their            eyes were         lifeless.     A small        entrance       gate      had alre ad y          been

o p e n e d some           ten feet awa y and Po li ce O f f ic e rs were                   pulling       supporters

out    through             that   gate    in order    to     relieve       the    pressure         inside      the

area.       Being           unable     to enter     the gate        due    to the number            of Police

already          there,       I p osit i on ed myself         in front          of the      fence where         the

m a j o r i t y were         being      crushed.

T o g e t h e r w i th a r o u n d       twenty other Po li ce            Officers,         I tried       to pull

the    fencing             forwards      onto the    pitch.         Desp it e     the substantial              force

that was           used,      it could not be m ov ed at all.                     I then clim be d onto                  the

wire     fencing,            perched on the         top s e ct i on and bent             the f o rw a rd       spikes

back     that         p r o tr ud ed    into the     crowd.     R e a c hi n g down         into    the    crowd,         I

managed          to    pul 1 some y ou ng st er s       up from the heaving mass.                         As   1

pulled them up by their arms?                         they    laid on top of the               fence and            I

threw them down to two Police O f f ic e rs who                              caught      them as      they fell.

Superintendent                G r e e n w o o d and Chief Sup© r i rtt endent Nesbit                 were at            that

location and a number                     of supporters        had been          pulled t h ro u gh the small

gate     from the West S t an d and                  pushed onto          the    pitch.       It a pp ea r ed           that

these were             unaware         of the    reason for      them being brought                out of the

crowd*           The y were        hostile and a number              of    blows were made            towards

Police           O f f i ce rs    before    they r ea lised that they were                  being     brought out

to get           to the dead and            dying.

A   chain was made                 of Police      to the gates and as              bodies were            dragged to

the    gate,          the dead were         passed down the           line and placed               on the         pitch

a dj a c e n t     to the         goalposts.       Those     that    had a normal            colour       but were

not    breathing,             were      carried out     i m me di at el y and either               placed      in an

ambulance             or    laid on the         pitch for     treatment.

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3 . 1 5      p.m.    I carried a y outh             1 now know to be the

laid him down.

His    body was        d i s c o l o u r e d a blue/pur pie         colour .

                     His    eyes were m o t io n le s s       and     I was      unable    to find a

pulse.         I checked        both his wrist            and his        neck and opened his eyes                to

check        for dilating,          but they never           changed.           He was    o bv i ou s l y dead

and    this was        con fi rm ed by a doctor who approached,                          informed me that

he was a doctor              and    checked the same as               I had alre ad y done           before

saying        that    he    "had gone and to           leave       him".

I covered his              face w it h a red/blue/greeri jumper and                       r et ur ne d to where

the gate was           to assist          in the    removal        of further       bodies.        As    they

came out         1 checked them for               pulses and for d il ation of the eyes

before        covering       their    faces,       whilst     they       laid on the       pitch awaiting

their        removal       in due    course.        All     a r o u n d Police Officers,           am bu la nc e

a n d supp o r t er s were a tt em p ti n g          to breath           life    back    into the       victims

a nd m a s s a g e d their         chests.

The Police           presence       had    increased at this              time and a fter as si st in g              to

remove a number              of dead foodies from the                 stand,      I con ti nu ed     to check

the    bodies        that a p p e a r e d to have a normal                or near       to normal       skin

colouring.            I was aware         that at      least       three doctors were among                the

victims,         confi rm in g w hi ch bodies were                 too    far gone and selecting

others        to a t te mp t    to resuscitate..             As    the a mb ul an ce s a t t e n d e d    they

were     filled       p a r t i c ul a rl y with small        c hi ldren and        left w i t h i n moments

of their arrival.

Bo d i e s    had been       pulled       from what       can only        be des cr ib ed as a mass             of

dead     people who had             p revi ously     remai ne d          standing due to       the      pressure

that was        holding        them upright.           As    that        pressure was relieved,           they

fell     into a t an g le d mess and the Pol ic e                        O ff icers inside the          stand had

some     c o n s i d e r ab l y d if fi cu lt y    in s ep ar at in g      them.

The arrival           of other Police O f f i ce r s              enabled me to return             to the

bodies,        comfort       griev in g     fans and        relatives and at that              point,      I

area.        One   piece was          placed at the          side       of one of the bodies               1 had

previously         removed,         M ar t in TRAYNOR.            1 then took notice               of the

clothing       that      he was wear in g w h i c h          con si st ed one black Adidas

W i t h a s s i s t an c e    from other         people,     I placed him           on the       board and he

was     picked up a nd w it h the a s si s ta n ce                  of Police and supporters,                   he

was    carried at            some    speed across          the    pitch,      towards          the Police Room

which      I had a l r e a d y       e s ta bl is he d was       the    point where            the dead were         to

be taken-          As     1 approached           the Po li ce R oo m        I was     d ir ec te d    into the

On entering          I. was a p pr o a c h e d by D e t e c t iv e S u p e r i n t e n d e n t i n f o r m e d

r e s p o n s i b i l i t y until     i de n ti f ic a ti o n had been completed,                    I took

notice       of the      time at that            stage and        realised that           it was      now 3 ,4 0       p.n

The    body was          removed      from the board and                posit io ne d beside          other

bodies.         At that        point     the face was            covered over again,               due    to

further       supp or te rs         entering      the g y m n a si u m whilst a ss i st i ng             in the

carriage        of other dead and                preventing        anyone       identifying him as being

a member        of their         family.         At 4.08     p.m.       I was a p p ro a ch e d      by Doctor

was     given the            number 57,    whi ch was       to         relate    to my dead youth.              I

s ea rc h ed him to e st a bl i sh his               identity but had he had no personal

property on him at all.                     His    pockets were           c ompletely empty and he had

no w r i s t w a t c h    or other        form of j e we ll er y on him at all.

h and/wrist.            It did       not seem unusual              for    him not to have any                  property

                                                 as he was       pulled from the d e a d »                  It was

cover      someone        e 1 s e 's face after’ death.

I tagged his            body w it h a sudden d eath                  label     ma rk ed w ith my details

an d the       bare details            that were         known at        that time          of the deceased,                     A

photo gr ap hi ng         him.       Some     time      later    the     d ec eased was           p h ot og ra ph ed and

the P o l a r o i d snap was ma rk ed with                    the body number               before        being taken

The     body was         cleaned,         w r ap pe d and     placed      into a plastic                body bag

after       it had been            clearly m ar k ed w it h the known details.                            I wai te d for

At 2.45 a.m.             on Sunday,          16th April,          1989,      I was     informed that the

 photo gr ap h had          been      picked out         by a r e l a t i v e .       The     body was       cleaned

an d    prepared for              i de n ti f ic a ti o n purposes        and then w h e e l e d to a

 viewing a re a for a proper                     identification.              I saw J ohn          1R A Y N O R ,

 i\                                                who    p os it i ve l y    identified the               body to          be

 that     of his        brother Ma rt in Kevin              TRAYNOR       of the same address,                       1 he

 body was        removed an d          I o bt ained       personal        details          for    the G E N / 18 form.

On     comp le ti on the           body was       conveyed       by the Amb ul an ce S er vi ce                to the

Med ic o Legal           Centre       on W a te ry Street,           Sheffield,            a rr iv in g    at 3.30 a.m.

 Documentation            proc ed ur es were            c om pleted and after               the    body had been

 clearly marked,              I left       it in the        care of the m o r t u a r y staff.                      I had

-obtained a d is cl a im e r              form to a ll ow disposal                  of the       clothing      of the

 deceased.           There was         nothing       of value amon gs t              them.        I then     returned

                                                                                                      R 334

to the      gymnawsiurn before              being    returned to W o od se at s P o l i ce S t at i on

to sign off          duty.

F roffi my duties at             the g ro u nd and      p os it io n at the turnstiles,             I can

state      that     the     pressure       on the outside          of the turn st il es was         building

up     considerably,          p a rt ic ul ar ly after 2 . 4 0       p.rn. that      day.      As the time

approached 3.00              p.m.    it was    clear     that the         crowd surge w o u ld      increase

an d that        injuries,        and most     d e fi n i t e l y fata li ti es     by s u f f oc a ti o n were

possible         at the L e p p in g s Lane         tur ns ti le    entrance.        T hat    p ossibility

was a c c e l e r a t e d    by the     roar   of the      crowd as        either    the teams      coming

onto      the    pitch or a near            goal,    w h i ch e n c ou r ag e d them to surge        forward

 in fear        of m i ss in g    s omething on the          field.

 If the gates          had not been opened,              I feel      certain that        fatal ities

w o u l d have      been found on the outside                 of the       ground at     this    location.

 The opening         of the gates was            essential         to a lleviate      that     possibility,

 but     u nf ortunately,         no one     could foresee          the    problem that w ou ld be

 caused     inside.

Fr o m my o p in i on        I believe that          numerous       people were a l r e a d y      dead at,

3.0 6     p.m.    w he n    I made my way        in front      of them to see           them    crushed

agai ns t       the fence.          Some had a lr e ad y      d i s c ol o ur e d bodies and were

 lifeless,         clearly       dead by that        time.     As    time    progressed,        I could see

 people     changing         colour     in front      of me    in that       crowd.       It was    obvious

 that     they were         dying    due    to lack     of oyxgen and         it was     f ru st ra ti ng    to

 s e e t hem and be i ng u n a b 1e t o d o any t h i ng a b o u t it in t ime                  t o *a v e

 them.      I am      co nv in ce d that       if the    fence      could have       been op en ed at

3. 0 6    pm.    then at      least a third or even half                   of them could have          been

 saved.

 The     delay     in being able           to get    to them and being unable                 to tear down

 the     fence was most           d ef in i te l y a c on tr ib u to r y    factor w h ic h     led to the

-un ne ce ss ar y death of           people who had e n te re d            the ground early         in order

 to obtain a prime               position      to see    the football         match.         They did not

                                                                                                                              R384

                   do a n y t h i n g    thems e l v e s    to cause    their    own deaths,          but suffered,            in my

                   belief,       due     to the     late arrival        of supporters who             crushed them by

                   o v e r f i lling     the West S t a n d areas.

                   In my belief           I am    certain that         some of the       people were dead                prior to

                   the     rush of s u p p o r t e r s      entering the a r e a after           the gates had been

                   opened,       due     to the    c olouration of the           bodies.        They a p p e a r e d to have

                   been dead for some time by 3 .06                     p.m.     One   ob s e r v a t i o n w h i c h    is clear

                   in hindsight           is that     the fences        should have e m e rgency wire                   cutters      in

                   prominent        positions        to eliminate        this hap p e n i n g again.            The     delay     in

                  getting       to the       people        crushed agai n s t    the fence has            caused a

                  considerable            unnecessary         loss of    life.

                  S u c h wire      cutters       could be placed out            before       every m atch and            returned

                  to a place            of s a f e t y on completion.           Failing       this,    every a l ternate

                  s e c t i o n of fencing should be a d a p t e d to enable                    it to be opened

                  outwards        in any e m e r g e n c y situation.            Fenc i n g    is u n f o r t u n a t e l y

                  essential        with      today's       football     supporters,       but death through

                  suffocation            can be    prevented w i t h a little           thought.

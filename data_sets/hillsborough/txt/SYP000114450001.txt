              Together with other                officers we then made              our way       in Police          vehicles

              to S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y Football      Ground,       Hi 11sborough,          for    the event

              of the F.A.           Cup Semi-Final         between N o t t i n g h a m Forest and Liverpool.

              On arriving at the              ground,      we made       our way      into the N o r t h S tand             to

              specified seating areas where at                      10.00 a.m.          Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t

              our     duties       for the    day and      collecting         a pre-packed snack               bag^-'f' made

              my own motor           vehicle      from H a m m e r t o n Road,      w h i c p x f parked       in Hoyl a n d

              patrolling           the N ee p s e n d area dressed          in casual         clothing with a view

              to vehicle           s e c urity and the a p p r e h e n s i o n of offenders              involved        in

              theft     of and from motor             vehicles.

              Together with Police                Constable Walton,             I patrolled H o y l a n d Road,

              N e e p s e n d Lane,     P a r k w o o d Road,   Clubmill        Road,    P e n istone Roa d areas and

              had occasion to            pass     both the Owl          and V i c t o r i a   public     houses.

              Outside      both these         pubs were         large    groups      of N o t t i n g h a m Forest
                                                                                                        PAGE

supporters who were            drinking        heavily.           I would estimate         that      there

was approximately. 100 supporters                    outside         the Owl    and 6U supporters

outside     the Victoria,          the   latter      being        the most     rowdy?    shouting,

singing and shouting abuse at                   passing motorists,              e s p e c i a l l y vehicles

containing Liverpool            supparlers,            The atte n d a n c e     of u n iformed

officers     in personnel          carriers,      dog       handlers     and Special           Const a b l e s

was     required outside        this        location.

Outside     the Owl       public    house was a Police                control    unit and the mere

presence     of this and the few officers                      inside,     deterred the           supporters

at this     location from becoming               too     rowdy,       but the area was            strewn

wit h    cans,    glasses and empty bottles                  of Newcastle B rown Ale.

Traffic     in the a rea g r a dually built                 up,    and side     streets were           soon

full with        parked    cars.     On the main            roads,     Neeps e n d Lane and

Pe n i s t o n e Road,    there was a steady stream                   of traffic, t r avelling

towards the v i c inity of the                football       ground which became               heavily

congested towards 2.00              p.m. and was            being     controlled by a uni f o r r ned

officer at        the j u n ction of these            two    roads.       He was       later     joined       by

m otor    cycle    officer and. a Police Range Rover                      containing a further

traffic     officer and Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t            Nesbit who a ss i s t e d with

traffic     control       and att e m p t e d to make          two    lanes    of traffic         flow

towards     the vicinity         of the ground.

They     did this by forming a second                   lane      of traffic on Pe n i s t o n e Road

travelling        towards H i l l s b o r o u g h with vehicles            turning       right      into      that

road from N e e p s e n d Lane.             Traffic a l r e a d y on Penistone Roa d                city side

of that     junction and travelling                  towards H i l l s b o r o u g h    formed the

inside     lane.      P r i o r i t y was    given to both these               lanes of traffic and

vehicles        t r avelling   towards        city on Pen i s t o n e Road were            forced        to

turn     left    into N e e p s e n d Lane and traffic               travelling        down W o o d Street

towards     that     j u n ction was        forced    to turn        left and also        travel       towards

Hillsborough.

                                                                                                       R372

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 .30   p.m.   football      supporters      could still            be seen

outside      the    two    previously m e n t i o n e d    pubs and      large       numbers were

walking      towards       the   ground,      a distance     of a p p r o x i m a t e l y a-mile       to a

mile and a half.             By three       o'clock    the m a j o r i t y of football

supporters         had    left   the area and traffic            congestion had eased

considerably.

At 2.55      p.m.     we a r r i v e d at the Police        control      unit outside            the Owl

pub which was            by this time       empty and      saw Chief      Inspector McRobbie.

W hilst at      the      control     unit    1 became aware       of some      problems          at   the

g round by over           hearing     radio    transmissions        on channel          25.      We had

until     that time        been monit o r i n g a C..I.D.        channel , number             19.     We were

then joined at that              location by Det e c t i v e Sergeant               Bu x t o n and

D e tective C o nstable          Hirst who were        engaged on mobile               crime     patrol      and

together with them,              listened to further           t r a n smissions        on channel          25.

It became all            too obvious        from those     t r a n smissions        that an      incident

had occurred at the Leppings Lane                     end of the ground and that                      injuries

had occurred.             D e t ective S e r geant B u x t o n and D e t ective C o nstable

Hirst     liaised w ith Detective              Inspector      Towe'll and then            left      to att e n d

at the ground.

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3 .15   p.m.    as a result      of a radio       t r a n s m i s s i o n with

Detective Sergeant Bu x t o n and together                    with Police Co n s t a b l e Walton,

I made my way back               to my vehicle and then drove               to H a m m e r t o n Road

Police Station.             After     collecting      together GEN/18 and GE N / 1 9 .body

labels,      exhibit       bags and major        incident       box,    1 made my way with

Police C o nstable Walton,              D e tective     S e r geant Ellis and Det e c t i v e

C on s t a b l e Walker     to the g y m nasium w i t h i n      the football           ground.

On arriving at            the gymnasium,        at a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3.45    p.m.     I saw that

well    over     fifty     bodies were        laid on the       gym floor and most               of them

were with a Police Officer.                    Towards     the middle       section of the gym                 I

could see that amb u l a n c e and medical                 teams were ass i s t i n g          the     injured

     END OF RE P O R T

INTRODUCTION

At 9.00 am on Saturday 15 April 1989, I commenced duty at

Hammerton Road Police Station together with Police Constable

Walton.   Together with other Officers we then made our way in

Police vehicles to Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground,

Hillsborough, for the event of the FA Cup semi final

between Nottingham Forest and Liverpool.



On arriving at the ground, we made our way into the North

Stand to specified seating areas where at 10.00 am Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield commenced the briefing of the

event.    Having being given our duties for the day and

collecting a pre-prepared snack bag, I made my way with

Police Constable Walton to the Neepsend Lane, collecting my

own motor vehicle from Hammerton Road which I parked in

Hoyland Road, Neepsend.    Our duties for the day were

concerned with foot patrolling the Neepsend area dressed in

casual clothing with a view to vehicle security and the

apprehension of offenders involved in theft of and from

motor vehicles.



Together with Police Constable Walton, I patrolled Hoyland

Road, Neepsend Lane, Parkwood Road, Clubmill Road,

Penistone Road areas and had occasion to pass both the Owl

Victoria public houses.
Outside both these pubs were large groups of Nottingham

Forest supporters who were drinking heavily.     I would

estimate that there was approximately 100 supporters

outside the Owl and 60 supporters outside the Victoria, the

latter being the most rowdy; shouting, singing and shouting

abuse at passing motorists especially vehicles containing

Liverpool supporters.    The attendance of uniformed Officers

in personal carriers, dog handlers and Special Constables

was required outside this location.



Outside the Owl public house was a Police control unit and

the mere presence of this and the few Officers inside,

deterred the supporters at this location from becoming too

rowdy, but the area was strewn with cans, glasses and empty

bottles of Newcastle Brown ale.



Traffic in the area gradually built up, and side streets

were soon full with parked cars.     On the main roads,

Neepsend Land and Penistone Road, there was a steady stream

of traffic travelling towards the vicinity of the football

ground which became heavily congested towards 2.00 pm and

was being controlled by a uniformed Officer at the junction

of these two roads.     He was later joined by a motorcycle

Officer and a Police range rover containing a further

traffic Officer and Chief Superintendent Nesbit who assisted

with traffic control and attempted to make two lanes of

traffic flow towards the vicinity of the ground.
They did this by forming a second lane of traffic on

Penistone Road travelling towards Hillsborough with

vehicles turning right into that road from Neepsend Lane.

Traffic already on Penistone Road city side of that

junction and travelling towards Hillsborough formed the

inside lane.    Priority was given to both these lines of

traffic and vehicles travelling towards city on Penistone

Road were forced to turn left into Neepsend Lane and

traffic travelling down Wood Street towards that junction

were forced to turn left and also travel towards

Hillsborough.



At approximately 2.30 pm, football supporters could still

be seen outside the two previously mentioned pubs and large

numbers were walking towards the ground, a distance of

approximately 1 to l| miles.    By three o'clock the majority

of football supporters had left the area and traffic

congestion had eased considerably.



At 2.55 pm we arrived at the Police control unit outside

the Owl pub which was by this time empty and saw Chief

Inspector McRobbie.    Whilst at the control unit I became

aware of some problems at the ground by overhearing radio

transmissions on channel 25. We had until that time been

monitoring a CID channel, number 19.    We were then joined

at that location by Detective Sergeant Buxton and Detective

Constable Hirst who were engaged on mobile crime patrol and

together with them listened to further transmissions on

channel 25.
                                                              ^ 372-




It became all too obvious from those transmissions that an

incident had occurred at the Leppings Lane end of the

ground and that injuries had occurred.   Detective Sergeant

Buxton and Detective Constable Hirst liaised with Detective

Inspector Towell and then left to attend at the ground.



At approximately 3.15 pm as a result of a radio

transmission with Detective Sergeant Buxton and together

with Police Constable Walton I made my way back to my

vehicle and then drove to Hammerton Road Police Station.

After collecting together Gen 18 and Gen 19 body labels,

exhibit bags and the major incident box, I made my way with

Police Constable Walton, Detective Sergeant Ellis and

Detective Constable Walker to the gymnasium within the

football ground.



On arriving at the gymnasium, at approximately 3.45 pm I

saw that well over fifty bodies were laid on the gym floor

and most of them were with a Police Officer. Towards the

middle section of the gym I could see that ambulance and

medical teams were assisting the injured and at least two

doctors were examining bodies and certifying life extinct.



Together with Police Constable Walton, I distributed body

labels bags etc, and assisted wherever possible in the gym

with the bodies, relatives etc as did Detective Sergeant

Buxton, Detective Constable Hirst, Detective Constable

Dynes, Detective Constable Lilley, Detective Constable
Askew, Detective Constable Lawrence, Detective Constable
        *



Locking, Temporary Detective Constable Drajling, Police

Constable Bocking and other Officers.



I continued working within the gym, assisting with the

moving and removal of bodies before and after

identification by friends and relatives, and went off duty

at 4.00 am.

 THE CROWD OUTSIDE THE TURNSTILES WAS THE WORST CONTROLLED THAT

 1 HAVE EVER SEEN.   WHEN I WENT THROUGH THE GATE I SAW BE iW£fc.N FOUR    TO SiX

 POLICEMEN STANDING THERE DOING NOTHING.    THE CROWD STARTED BERATING THEM TO

 GO OUT IN FRONT OF THE TURNSTILES TO CONTROL THE CROWD.       A POLICE INSPECTOR

 IN FACT CAME AND ORDERED THEM OUT.    A LONG LINE OF POLICEMEN FORMED UP

 ACROSS THE PITCH.   THEY AGAIN WEREN'T DOING ANYTHING EVEN AS PEOPLE WERE

 CARRYING THE DEAD AND INJURED ON THE HOARDINGS THROUGH THE POLICE RANKS.

 THEY COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER USED IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

 2.     THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO CO-ORDINATION BETWEEN THE.            THEYyHD ID NO i

 REALISE THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE MATTER,      THEY KEPT PUSHff^TANS,

 3.     ONCE THE POLICE REALISED THE SERIOUSNESS THEY WERE VERY GOOD, /THEY DID

 HOWEVER TAKE TOO LONG TO REACT.

 4^     THERE WAS A TERRRI8LE WASTE OF MANPOWER BY THE POLICE, THEY FORMED A

 CORDON ACROSS THE GROUND INSTEAD ASSISTING AT THE LEPPINGS LN END PULLING

 FANS OUT.

 5.     THERE WAS A LACK OF COMMUNICATION OVER THE LOUD SPEAKER SYSTEM.      THE WHOLE

 OF THE GROUND SHOULD HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE SEVERITY OF THE SITUATION.

 THE SPEAKER SYSTEM WAS POOR     AND UNAUDIBLE.

 INJURED AND DYING.

 JUDICAL INQUIRY’?

 TERRACES IN THE NOTTINGHAM FOREST E N D .   WHEN LIVERPOOL PLAYED THE TESTIMONIAL

 GAME WITH GLASGOW CELTIC AT PARKHEAD YOU     HANDED YOUR TICKET IN COMPLETE

 YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR A STU B.   THE POLICING WAS ALSO EXCELLENT,     I FEEL

 ^     THE POLICE REACTION WAS TOO S L O W , / m E Y APPEARED MORE CONCERNED WITH THE

 HOOLIGANISM ASPECT, THAN CROWD SAFETY.        EVEN WHEN THEY COULD SEE PEOPLE

 CRUSHED UP THEY STILL TRIED TO KEEP THEM IN THE PEN.

2.      WHEN PEOPLE DID GET ONTO THE PITCH,    IT WAS THE PEOPLE WHO STARTED THE

 RESCUE OF OTHERS IN THE PENS, AND THE POLICE ONLY GOT INVOLVED AFTER THE FANS

HAD STARTED THE RESCUE OPERATION.         PEOPLE WERE VERY FRUSTRATED WITH THE POLICE

 APPARENT LACK OF CONCERN.

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

^JpiCIAL INQUIRY?

 1.     THERE WAS NO DIRECTIONS OF PEOPLE TOWARDS THE SIDE TERRACE.

2.      THERE WAS NO POLICING OF THE TUNNEL PREVENTING OTHERS ENTERING THE ALREADY

FULL PENS.

3.      THE NEWSPAPER REPORTS OF HOOLIGANISM WERE LIES AND COMPLETELY UNTRUE.
                                                           /
4.      THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE PRESS PHOTOGRAPHER WAS DliSCUSTIiiiG IN THAT THEY DID

NOT ASSIST THEY ONLY GOT IN THE WAY.         THEIR ONLY CONCERN WAS TO OBTAIN

PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE DECEASED AND INJURED.

 5.     THE TICKET ALLOCATION WAS A-MISTAKE FROM THE START, LIVERPOOL THE BETTER

SUPPORTED CLUB SHOULD HAVE HAD THE HOP END IF THAT WAS NOT POSSIBLE THEN

ANOTHER STADIUM SHOULD HAVE BEEN USED.

G 19



 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO



 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

       APPEARED THAT THE AUTHORITIES - POLICE STEWARDS ETC - WERE UNAWARE OF WHAT

 WAS HAPPENING AND THEY APPEARED TO BE TAKING THEIR TIME BEFORE TAKING ANY

 ACTION.    ONCE PEOPLE HAD GOT ONTO THE PITCH AND STARTED MILLING ABOUT,

 POLICE OFFICERS STATIONED NEAR THE GATES LEADING INTO THE OTHER PENS WERE

 UNSURE OF WHAT TO DO AND THE CROWD WERE GENERALLY TELLING THEM TO OPEN THE

 GATES SO THAT THE FANS COULD GET INTO THE OTHER PENS.     I ALSO SAW A

 CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF POLICEMEN(200-300) COME ONTO THE PITCH IN FRONT OF

 THE NORTH STAND AND STAY THERE FOR ABOUT 5-10 MINS.     THE FANS THOUGHT THEY

 WERE GOING TO COME TOWARDS LEPPINGS LN TO HELP BUT INSTEAD THEY MARCHED ONTO

 THE PITCH AND CORDONED IT O F F .

 WHILST IN PEN 6 I SAW A MAN IN HIS EARLY 2 0 ’S, WEARING JEANS AND SWEATER
     •*
 SCALING THE PERIMETER FENCE ATTEMPTING TO ESCAPE FROM^PEft 4 ONTO THE PITCH.

 AS HE WENT OVER THE TOP AND DANGLED HIS LEGS OhjK5 THE OTHER SIDE,       I SAW

 ONE POLICEMAN, WHO HAD A BEARD, GRAB HIM B ^ T H E ANKLES AND YANKED HIM DOWN.

 THE MAN LOST HIS GRIP AND FELL TO THE GROUND HITTING THE BACK OF HIS HEAD

 ON THE FLOOR. THE MAN WAS UNCONSCIOUS AS A RESULT OF THE KNOCK.   THE CROWD
   »■   —    ■
 IMMEDIATELY IN FRONT BECAME AGITATED AND WERE VERBALLY INSULTING THE

 POLICEMAN.      OTHER POLICEMEN CAME TO ASSIST THE INJURED MAN AND THE FIRST POL

 PC MOVED AWAY.                                      A   ^ 3 ^        *


Q2Q

 »
 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 IF THE FANS OUTSIDE THE TURNSTILES COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER CONTROLLED,

 THE CRUSHING WOULDN’T HAVE OCCURRED.      IF THERE HAD BEEN MATCH STEWARDS

 OR POLICE TO DIRECT FANS AWAY FROM THE TUNNEL, TOWARDS THE OUTER

 SECTIONS THE CRUSHING IN THE TUNNEL AND ON THE TERRACING WOULD NOT HAVE

 HAPPENED.

 IF THE FENCES HAD NOT BEEN THERE THE FANS WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ESCAPE

jj^ T O   THE PITCH.

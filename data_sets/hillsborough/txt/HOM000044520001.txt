                DRAFT LETTER FOR SIGNATURE BY THE HOWIE SECRETARY


Lord Justice Stuart-Smith
Royal Courts of Justice
Strand




Thank you very much for the report which you have submitted on the Hillsborough
disaster. I shall be considering very carefully your conclusions before I publish the
report.        However, I wanted at this stage to express my gratitude for the considerable
time and effort which you have given to this task, which I recognise was not a
welcome one.


There may well be issues which I will want to discuss with you before the report is
published, in which case I shall ask my office to contact yours to arrange a suitable
time. I will also of course, nearer the time let you know exactly when the report is to
be published and the terms of my response.

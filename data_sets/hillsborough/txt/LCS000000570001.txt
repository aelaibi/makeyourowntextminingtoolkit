                                 STAFF DE VE L O P M E N T DAY.

Venue P r ob ab l y     Laburnum      House.




 Briefing.

 The mai n       task    of   the    day    is   to   do   some    wo r k   on     the    t e a m s 's
 future.

 The team and           Centre      are    funded     in   their    pr e s e n t    form     until
 Spring 1991.

 It is likely that there will be some form of te am based at the
 Centre be yo n d that date for at least 1 year, but it could be
 permanent.    This team will be smaller than the pr es en t team.

 At this stage there has been no di sc u s s i o n or in di ca ti on of how
 the te am will be pared down; ob v i o u s l y some pe o pl e may choose
 to       move . on       themselves;       some  of  us  ma yb e redeployed.
 I n d i c a t i o n s from m a na gem en t are that most/ if not all of us
 should be able to decide what and where our future jobs will
 be.

 Wh i l s t     considerable     work        in  the  future        will       be  around
 H i l l sb or ou gh , the in di ca t i o n s are that H i l l s b o r o u g h based wor k
 could tail off.           For this re aso n it is n e c e s s a r y to look at
 some fu tu re roles the team could ju sti fia bly fill.

 Due to c o m mi tt ee cycles and commi tte e demands,              we have to
 presen t to Oc to b e r s Social Se rvices C o m mi tt ee a report on our
 present work, and 3 or 4 wo rk ab le plans for the future.              Gerry,
 Sarah,         Barney      & Carole have had one se s s i o n th rowing  1deas
 around, and are meeti ng again early in August, to continue this
 task wi t h a view to setting about writing a re po rt /p r e p a ri ng a
 p r e s e n t a t i o n for the committee.

 The ta s k of the team on July 9th                   is twofold:-

         (1)   To look at the ideas al r e a d y thr ow n                    in     and
               see k out new and dif fe ren t ideas.

         (2)   To al lo ca t e tasks stemming from this e x c e r c i s e
               for       individuals/groups     w i th i n   the    tea m  to
               develop        and  think t h ro ug h     and   p r es en t in
               w r i t t e n form.

 O b v i o u s l y th in ki ng about the future, which will m e a n change
 and       possibly        some    form   of te r mi na ti on   is    di ff icu lt and
 possibly            painful. This  needs    to          be   ac kn owledged,      and
 h o p e f u l l y the day will begin with an ex cercise to a l lo w us all
 the       ch a n c e   to   air      this. But     we do have a ta s k to          be
 ad dressed.

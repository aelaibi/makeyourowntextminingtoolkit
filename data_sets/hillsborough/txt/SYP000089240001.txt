               I am a single man and I live at the above adc^ress with my parents and

               two younger brothers.
                                           CAT
               I am a supporter of         Liverpool Football Club.             I have been attending

               most home fixtures for the last four or five                     years. I am a season

               ticket h o l d e r .

               On Saturday 15th April          1989 (150489)           I travelled to the Sheffield

               Wednesday Football Ground in Hillsborough, Sheffield to the Football

               Association Challenge Cup semi final game between Liverpool Football

               Club and Nottingham         Forest Football Club.

               I got my ticket for         the game from Liverpool Football Club using my

               season ticket voucher,          it was a six pound ticket for the Leppings Ln

               terraces     (standing a r e a ) .

               I travelled to Sheffield with eleven other people                    in a mini-bus.
                                                                                            PAGE    2„

           Of the people I travelled with seven were people I had known for a

           number of years and were friends of mine,            the i r details are as f o l l o w s :

                              who                                    hired and drove the mini

           Of the other four passengers on the mini-bus who were all

                    , I had only seen one of them before who I knew from College




                                                                     had never seen before

 A / ^ 9   J 1) Gary CHURCH         P jO D Y

           On the morning of Ja^turday 13th April           1989 (150489)     I walked

                           house in                    and met both               and his brother

               , also                            and                 *




                                               from his house then we went to

           house who was living in                     at that time.       From          house we

           collected        himself and his friends, Tony OWEN,

                            and Gary CHURCH.

           The last person we collected was                       and we finally commenced

           our journey to Sheffield some time between 10.30am and 11.00am.

           I was sitting                                                 Hof the mini-bus.

           sitting around me was
                                                                                       PAGE
                                                                                       S335Q

              and his friends were sitting in the seats towards the front,

    as far as I can recall Gary CHURCH was sitting             in a double seat with

    Tony OWEN.

    During the course of the journey to Sheffield I c an’t recall having

    any direct conversation with Gary CHURCH or any of the other lads who

 were friends of                    Although everyone in the mini-bus was

    engaged in group conversation mainly about the game we were going to.

    The atmosphere on the mini-bus during the journey was happy,                   everyone

    joining in the conversation.

    I cannot say I noticed anything particular about Gary CHURCH or his

 mood.

 We travelled direct to Sheffield I can *t recall what route we took

    other than we were mainly on motorways.              I cannot       recall being

 subjected tn any travel delays.

 We hadnft taken any alcohol on our miiyi-bus, when we were driving

    through Sheffield towards the Hi 11 sbj/rough ground I had seen pubs open

 and supporters standing outside them having a drink.

 As we were driving towards the j^j/und there were police directing

    vehicles carrying supporters towards the ground.

    At about 2.40pm   (1440) we parked the mini-bus           in a side street about

* five minutes walk from the ground,               I c a n ’t remember the name of the

    street.

    We walked down to the Leppings Lane entrance to the ground.

    We did not receive any police escort or directions to the ground,                     but

    we could see the ground from where we had parked/the van and we just

    followed the crowds.    At that time about 2.40pft> <1440) there were a

    large amount of supporters making their way Jio the ground.

    When we walked down to the ground from the/mini— b u s , I saw a couple of

    lads drinking cans of beer,         but I never &4w any signs of drunkeness,

    disorder or fighting,

           When we had got oat of the mini-bus and started to walk towards the

           ground we had split up into s e n a t e      groups although we were following

           each other towards the groujara we were split up in the crowds.

           I was walking with                                             and

           I think Gary CHURCH was walking towards the V^ounci w A h       Tony OWEN

                             and

           We arrived at the Leppings Ln entrance to the ground at abo                  45pm^)

           (144-5) in a group consisting of myself,

                  and

           I last saw Gary CHURCH and the people he was walking towards the

           ground with shortly a fter leaving the mini bus at about 2 ^             m

           (1440).

           I never saw Gary/CHURCH again after that time either outside or inside

           the ground.

           On arriving at/ the entrance to the ground there were no queues at the
5-0 £
           turnstiles juf&t a mass of people stretching back from the turnstiles
 i— {L —
           to the arAfc Jay the outer gates.     Our group joined onto this mass.

           Apart from this mass of people leading up to the turnstiles          (terrace)

            he area in Leppings Lane       itself was heavily congested with people who

           were joining onto the mass behind us.

           il cannot    remember seeing jfny stewards    in this area outside the

           turnstiles and the only /pol iceman I saw was one on a horse stuck in

           the middle of the cr|o^d, he appeared to be trying to organise people

            pproaching the turnstiles but there was too large a crowd for one

           horse to deal with.

           I had no problems       identifying which turnstiles to use, however,         I did

           have problems getting to the turnstiles there was a lot of pushing and

           shoving and people were very tightly packed together.          I was being

           crushed by the masses around me to an extent that I would describe as
                                                                                       PAGE

             worrying.

             I eventually managed to enter the ground through a turnstile at some

             time between 2.50pm (1450) and 2.55pm (1455).

             I had not seen any other gates open other than the turnstile gates.

             I had not witnessed any unauthorised entry beLng made to the ground.

             Once inside the turnstiles area 1 never ^aw/any signs directing

             supporters to the terraces,        3r just saw the tunnel and our group just

             followed all the other supgorte rs into the tunnel.

             I cannot recall seeing an/ policemen or stewards in the area by the

             entrance to the tunnel,

             Our group had free pjkss/age along the length of the tunnel.

             Between entering the Vround and getting through the tunnel            I never saw

             any kind of disorder nor did I see anyone consuming alcohol            inside the

             ground.

             as number one     (1) on the seperate grid plan which I produce        (Exh

             No.           ) (Ref No    /I ).

             When we arrived at position one        (1)   the players had not yet come      out

             onto the pitch for the kick around.

             Within about a minute of us getting          to position number one   (1)1

             can remember seeing the players running onto the pitch for            their kick

             about.

             I think we were still     in this position (number one) when the game

             kicked off, between first getting to position one (1) and kick off
                                                                             PAGE      6
                                                                             S3350

time the pressure around me had gradually increased,          I was very

tightly packed in with the crowd and by kick off time I was starting

to get frightened.

I can remember the game kicking off but after that time because of the

crush I was involved in I can't remember seeing anything else of what

was occurring on the pitch.

I had looked across towards my left towards         pen number 6 and I could

see that the terraces to my left appeared fairly empty.            Because of

this our group decided to move to our left towards the emptier

terracing.     I did not know at that time tha) there was a fence between

the pen I was in and pen numbers 5 and 6.

Whilst making our way towards our left i/fel.t a very sudden excessive

crowd surge in our pen, this surge tightened everyone up to an extent

where I found it impossible to move.           cannot be precise but I would

say this surge occurred about one o r H w o minutes after kick off.

After about another two minutes the pressure around me started to ease

slightly and then I managed to work my way over to the position I have

marked as number two     (2> on the separate grid plan.

It was then that I     saw the dividing fence,      people were already

climbing over this     dividing fence into pen number five (5)

As people climbed over the fence this gave me suffi cient A p a c e to do

the same.      I cannot say what time it was that I climbedr over the fence

other than to say that I looked at the pitch w h i 1 s t N ^ a l i n g the

dividing fence and I saw that a large number of fans were on the pitch

b y the Liverpool goal.        I can say that the game had definitely been

itopped although I     could see that the players were still on the           pitch,

jl climbed over the    fence    into pen number five   (3) and put my hands

through the fence to help                   over.   Afte r      got into pen
                                        T
five    (3),             and             also climbed over within a short

time.
                                                                     PAGE     7,

The five of us then went out of pen number five    (3) and onto the

f\itch, it was chaos on the pitch lots of bodies   lying on the pitch and t

 eople running around,    so the five of us went into the North Stand,

where we got some refreshments from the refreshment bar situated at

the rear and underneath the North Stand.

On first entering into the terraces    (Pen 4) and during my time in the

terraces    I did not see any kind of disturbance or fighting.

I did not see the barrier break in pert number three      (3).

I was not physically injured as a result of my involvement       in the

crushing    in the terraces nor outside the turnstiles.

I did not witness any deaths,    I did not assist any of the dead or

i njured.

I did not witness anything during that day which I considered to be a

criminal offence.

Whilst we were in the North Stand               went off to look for his

Dad and his brother who had also attended the match,      the rest of us

sat in the North Stand watching what was going on on the pitch.

At about 4.30pm (1630) myself,                          and

went down onto the pitch to try and get together with the rest of our

travelling companions.

Eventually we found out that everyone was a c counted for except Gary

CHURCH, we went back to the mini-bus to check if he was there, when we

found he was not we drove to a Police Station.

Tony OWEN reported Gary CHURCH as a missing person and following this

we went to a boys club by the Police Station to speak to the Social

Workers on duty there and to await    information about Gary CHURCH.

Later the same day at about    11.00pm (2300) myself,

                                     and Tony OWEN were taken from the

Boys Club by coach to the gymnasium at the Hillsborough Stadium.

Once at the gymnasium a person dressed in civilian clothing       (suit and
                                                                                  PAGE    8

CAT         tie) showed us a board containing a quantity o V photographs each one
MCttL^r     of the photographs was numbered.       I looked a / the photographs but I
?hqi
            was unable to identify Gary CHURCH from tbrase photographs.

            I think Tony 0        nd                  identified Gary from the

            photographs displayed,     I cannot recall/which photograph they picked

            out.

            After this Tony OWEN,                    and           were taken inside

            the gymnasium where I understand they identified the body of Gary

            CHURCH.

            As I have previously stated prior to Saturday 15th April      1989 (150489)

            I had never seen Gary CHURCH,     I would describe him as a white male,

            about   19 years old, about my size 5*7 tall and slim in build,      he had

            blonde short hair.    As far as I can remember he was wearing a dark

            green jumper,    blue denim jeans and reabok trainers.

                                                                                 SIGNED

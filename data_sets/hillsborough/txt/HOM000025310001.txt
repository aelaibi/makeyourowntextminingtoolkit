receives a regular 'update disk' frctn Synchro which is copied on to the main canputer thus
ensuring that the club has access to all of the patron records.


Manbership Cards

All membership cards that are produced include a photograph of the member tqgettier with the
relevant patron nunber. Included on the reverse side of the cards are rules and regulations
tqgettier with a bar code. The reverse sides of the cards are in fact a perforated section of
the application forms and the reason for this is to ensure that membership cards can be produced
as quickly as possible.

Tickets for tine membership area are available for all heme matches one calendar month in advance.
Tickets for all heme matches are issued at tine rate of one per member. Personal, postal and
credit card telephone bookings are accepted. The elite ticketing system has tine membership
database on line and when a ticket is issued tine relevant membership is 'figged' in order

    After the match has taken place manbers details are 1uploaded1 back to the main computer in

Arrived         at       Hillsborough,             w h e r e m y aerial               occupied          seats     in the N o r t h

General         briefing             by Chief          Superintendent                 Duckenfield,              Superintendent

Murray.




10.30        a.m.        to    11.00    a.m.

Packed meal               consumed          in C 8c V C r e w B u s              at    r ea r    of N o r t h     St a n d.




11.00        a.m.

As    per     t he O p e r a t i o n a l      O r d er ,       I deployed my                serial       to a p o s i t i o n

adjacent            to    the P o l i c e     Ground           Control         Box,     between          t he    South and Vest

Stands.             At    this       point    the       ground was             e m p t y a n d al l       appeared           to be     in

o r d er .      Radio          tests    were       in p r o g r e s s .




11,25        a.m.

I noticed            approximately                12-15        people       on    the       Spion       K o p , indicating

t h at    the       turnstiles          may       be    open.         The      remainder           of    the g r o u n d

appeared            empty       of    supporters.              At     t hi s     time my         serial         was    deployed

via      Ground          Control       to a s s i s t      in p o l i c i n g         the   turnstiles            at    Penistone

Road      North.              This    was    in r e s p o n s e       to a r e q u e s t         by     Inspector         Booth who

had      insufficient                officers          to c o v e r    turnstiles               ’L ',    ’M ’ a n d     ’N '.

(Turnstiles               ’0'    were       not    in u s e , as         these         only gave          access        to    the

North        Stand        and    this       area being           allocated             soley       to L i v e r p o o l

s u p p o r t e r s , it w a s         contrary           to    the p r i n c i p l e s         of c r o w d     segregation           to

have      them queuing                alongside           Nottingham             fans who were              s e e k i n g e n try

onto      the S p i o n         Kop).

                                                                                                                              R56



During       the    period         of      policing          these      turnstiles,              many      a Liverpool

supporter          came       to    the       Penistone         Road        North        End and wh e n          faced with

the    closure         of     turnstiles             'O',     made      enquiries              regarding         access       to       the

North     Stand.            These        supporters            came      in v e r y       s m a ll   g r o u p s , but      at

regular       intervals.                 In m y      opinion         they had            travelled by            car.




Many    supporters             were        in p o s s e s s i o n      of    cans        which       contained

intoxicants.                They     comprised mainly                   of       Nottingham supporters                     (mostly

m a l e , but      females          were       included) and                in     the    18    to    30 a g e     group.          I

was    surprised            to f i n d        that    some were             not     aware       of    t he C o n t r o l    of

Alcohol       at    Designated                Sports        Ground       Legislation.                 Numerous       c a ns

containing          in t o x i c a n t s , were             discarded            i n to p l a s t i c    bin     liners       kept

by Police          Officers          at       the    turnstiles.




Other     i t ems      confiscated              or d i s c a r d e d , i n c l u d e d a b u l b h o r n             and      flag

poles.



At    2 . 4 5 p.m.       that       afternoon,              I arrested             a 48 y e a r       old,     Nottingham

supporter          for      the     offence          of     ’a t t e m p t i n g    to e n t e r      a designated            sports

ground whilst               d r u n k '.       He w a s      in a v e r y d r u n k e n          state       and    required

t he p h y s i c a l     support           of h i s       friends.           He was         attempting           to e n t e r      the

Spion     Kop v i a , turnstile                     'N '.



I escorted          this m a n           to    the Pol ice           r o o m and n o t i c e d          him holding           out

his    ticket       to p u b l i c         vi ew,     before         any     action         c o u l d be     taken      someone

came    from behind                and     exchanged           his     ticket         for      a £10.00        note.




At    2.50    p.m.       we    arrived          at    the      Pol ice R o o m a n d m y s e l f             and my        prisoner

were    photographed.                    He w as      then plac e d              in the h o l d i n g        r o o m p«

At    approximately               2 . 5 5 p.m.        he w a s       subjected              to d o c u m e n t a t i o n    and       then

returned         to    t he h o l d i n g       room.




At    approximately               3.00       p.m.     I entered            th e    g y m n a s i u m at H i l l s b o r o u g h            to

commence         the n e c e s s a r y p a p e r w o r k          relating             to    the a r r e s t .        I was          a w a re

t h at    two    other       persons          had     been      arrested           by members              of m y     Serial          for

similar         offences          at    t hat      location.



At    approximately               3.05       p.m.     Chief       Inspector             Sumner        entered         the

gymnasiun         and     informed me                t hat    there was            some        trouble        at     the    Leppings

Lane      end    of    the    ground          and     that he         re-deployed                 the r e s t      of m y       Serial

to    t hat     area.        He    also       requested           other         officers           in th e      gym     to go         to

the      Leppings       Lane       end.




I immediately             entered            the p e r i m e t e r        track        via     the    entrance         between

the Spion Kop             and      North        Stand        and ma d e my w ay                along       the p e r i m e t e r

track      (in f r o n t      of       the N o r t h      Stand)          towards           the    Leppings          Lane       end.

The      game was       still          in p r o g r e s s     and     I r e c a l 1 the            crowd      roaring           in

response         to a n e a r m i s s           by Liverpool               at     Spion        K o p goal.           I seem          to

r e c a l 1 Liverpool             winning          a corner          as    a r e s u l t , but          I cannot           be

certain.          As    I neared             the     halfway         1 ine      I s a w s om e        supporters            on       the

playing         area    in    t he p e n a l t y b o x          at    the       Leppings           Lane g o a l .          Some

supporters            were    climbing             over      t he p e r i m e t e r         security        fence      at       t hi s

point      a nd m a n y      others were              congregating                on    the       track.        At    t hi s m o m e n t

the p l a y e r s      had    started           to    leave       the      f ie l d .        The     radio m e ssages                were

totally         incoherent             and    indeed         very     few       transmissions               appeared            to h av e

been made         from       2 . 3 0 p.m.          onwards.           In     t he a b s e n c e       of    any      other

information, I believed                         that      a pi t c h       invasion was               about        to ^ f e u r . hu t

I had no        i de a       for w h a t      rea so n.         The    crowd        in     the o t h e r      parts           of    the

ground were very                   orderly       a nd     the    only       trouble         appeared           to b e b e h i n d

t he    Leppings          Lane     g o al.



On     reaching         the    Leppings          Lane      end       and    standing          on    the       track       in f r o n t

of     the N o r t h      S t a nd ,    I still         could not           see     th e    cause        of    the       tro ub le .

The     only police            action which               seemed       obvious           to m e w a s         to    f o r m an o p e n

cordon        across         the    touch      line       from       the    n orth west            corner          flag       towards

the g oa l      mouth.             I ordered         officers          to    form        t his     cordon          to w h i c h         they

complied.




As     I neared         the goal         mouth       I saw       that       th e    emergency gate                  in    the

perimeter         fencing was                o p e n a n d Pol ice          officers were                attempting                to

pull      Liverpool           supporters            through          and    onto     the      track.           (Th is         gate was

t he    one    immediately              to    the    left       of    t h e g o a l , as v i e w e d w h e n              facing

the W e s t     S t a n d ).



Some      supporters           were      lying       on    the       grass     ju st       off     the    playing a r e a ,

some were         in t e a r s , s o m e w e r e           v o m i t t i n g , whilst            others        j us t     appeared

shocked        and      dazed.          Shouts       and       screams       could         be h e a r d       from       the

supporters           in      the    Central         pen    area.




1 approached              t he p e r i m e t e r     fencing near              to    this        emergency            gate         and      on   |

looking        i nt o     the c r o w d       I saw a pile             of p e o p l e       at     the    front          of    the

crowd.         They were            lying      on    the       terracing           near     to     the p e r i m e t e r           w a ll

and     several         of    them appeared               to b e d e a d .          Bodies were               lying       at all

angles,        some were            completely            buried       by    other         bodies        on t h e        top       of

them.         Most      of    those      visible were                blue    in     th e    face and           1 i p s , e y es

fixed and         s t a r i n g , their          hands         and    arms w e r e         ivory c o l o u r .            Tgad^s            of

vomit      were      visible           around       t h e ir    noses       and m o u t h s .         They         appe

                                                                                                                               R56

inconsistent             with    1ife.



The    crowd       behind were          hysterical,              those     in d i r e c t        contact          with         the

bodies     were      still       under       crowd     pressure           from b e h i n d .             The   only means

of    relieving          pressure       was     by a s s i s t i n g      persons            to s c a l e      the    fence          or

to s q u e e z e    through       the g a t e ; b o t h          these m e a n s         being hampered                   by    the

presence        of d e a d      bodies.



At    this p o i n t      I took p o s s e s s i o n        of    a loud hai ler                (I d o n ’t k n o w w h o

from)     and      shouted       instructions             into      the    crowd         for     calm .         I also

pleaded      for     those       at    the     back    to    stop pushing.                    I was       aware       that

other     officers         were       atempting        to    remove        part         of    the p e r i m e t e r        fence

behind      t he g o a l .



After     a short         while       the p r e s s u r e    had     eased         in    the      crowd        eiabling

several      police        officers          to e n t e r    t he    terracing               to u n t a n g l e      the

bodies.         I instructed             numerous         officers         to e n t e r         t h is    a r e a a n d be

observant          for    any persons           in the       pile who may                s t il l    be     alive         and       to

give     them priority.



I was     joined by          Chief       Superintendent              Nesbit         and       Superintendent

Greenwood          (to w h o m    I handed          the     l o u d h a i l e r ).           I then a ssisted                  at    the

emergency          gate    by    causing        the    other        officers            present          to f o r m a t u nn el

thereby      endeavouring              to k e e p     the    exit       c 1 ea r    of p e r s o n s        and      to

facilitate          the    passage        of    bodies       through         the g a t e .           A human          chain had

St.    Johns A m b u l a n c e        Officers        were       attempting             to r e v i v e      the      b o di es ,         as

were many          other     persons         including           fans     and      Police        Officers.                M^py

were    clearly          dead    and needed           to b e m o v e d       from v i e w .              I asked ^

radio was            faint       and       totally        incoherent.                No    instructions               were

forthcoming.                I could             only presume             the      g y m n a s i u m to b e          u s e d as a

temporary mortuary,                        so    I therefore             instructed             supporters            and     Police

Officers         to       form stretcher                 teams       and     take bodies            in t h a t        direction.




I was aware               that    an A m b u l a n c e         had     stopped        behind        the        Leppings        Lane

instructed            o ne w i l l i n g         supporter           to u n h o o k       the g oal          net,     as     it w a s

His    colleague             restrained            him.       I did        not     witness          any other attack                on

ground     control           via      r a d i o , b ut    this was           to no       avai l.         In     t he    early

stages     I had          attempted          to c o n t a c t       control        asking       for      th e    evacuation

procedure           to be       adopted       at    the       rear    of     the    central          pen,       there was           no

              Eventually         the       announcement           was     given      t ha t    the m a t c h w a s         to be

              abandoned         and    the     crowd was asked              to r e m a i n       in s i t u     f or    a f ew

             minutes.           The    c r ow d ,    however,          began   to     leave.           I took m y          Serial       to

              the      Leppings       Lane     gates     on      the o u t s i d e    of      the g r o u n d       until    the

              terraces         inside were           empty.         I then     ordered my              serial        to p e r f o r m

              mobile         patrol    on    the     routes       leading       from       the      ground and          joined        them

              in    t hi s    duty.        Radio     contact       had     been      re-established,                 but    successful

              transmissions            were     few and          far    between.




              At    aproximately            6.30     p.m.     we were       directed           to     the    Northern        General

              Hospital         where       a disturbance            was    in p r o g r e s s       involving          Liverpool

              supporters.             On m y    arrival          I ascertained             fr o m some         of    the    fans      that

              the p r e s s     had    been     intruding upon              those       in gr i e f.           The     press     had been

              asked      to r e m a i n     in a h o l d i n g      area    and were           under        the d i r e c t i o n s     of

              t he H e a l t h A u t h o r i t y ,     Press      Officer.           Some had become                 over-

              enthusiastic            and had        taken matt e r s          into     their         own h a n d s .       A l 1 parties

              including         the    Press        Officer       were     advised.




              At    7.15      p.m.    my    Serial      gave      assistance          to      ’D l ', S u b - D i v i s i o r , b u t        no

the    Leppings         Lane      goal.




On    reaching        the     Leppings        Lane       end and          standing           on    the       track        in; f r o n t

The    only     police        action which              seemed       obvious        to me w a s              to    f o r m -an o p e n

the    goal     mouth.           1 ordered         officers          to    form     this          cordon          to w h i c h     they

As    I neared        the     goal      mouth      I saw       that       the     emergency             gate       in the

perimeter        fencing          was     open and Pol ic e               officers           were       attempting            to

Some     supporters           were      lying      on    the       grass    just        off       the    p l a y i n g area,

some     were    in     tears,       s ome    were       v o m i t t i n g , whilst           others          just        appe^r^si

shocked        and    dazed.         Shouts        and       screams       could        be    heard          from     t*         .

I approached            the      perimeter         fencing          near    to     this       emergency             gate and          on

looking        into     the      crowd     I saw a pile              of    people        at       the    front        of    the

crowd.         They    were       lying      on    the       terracing           near    to       the    perimeter            wall,

and    several        of    them     appeared           to    be    dead.        Bodies       were           lying       at all

angles,        some were          completely            buried       by    other        bodies          on    the     top     of

them.      Most       of    those       visible      were          blue    in the        face       and       l i ps,      e y e s ___

inconsistent, w i t h            life.
The    crowd         behind were              hysterical,                those         in d i r e c t        contact         with       the

bodies        were     still           under       crowd       pressure               from    behind*              The       only means

of    relieving            pressure           was       by a s s i s t i n g          persons          to s c a l e      the      fence          or

At    this     point        I took           possession             of      a    loud       hailer          (X d o n ' t      know who

pleaded        for     those           at    the       back    to     stop        pushing.              1 was         aware       that

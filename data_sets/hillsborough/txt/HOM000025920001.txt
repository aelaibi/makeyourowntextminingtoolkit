                                        (HORNING SESSION)

                          SUPERINTENDENT BERNARD DEAN HURRAY Recalled

                               Cross-examined by HR. WOODWARD:

                Q. Hr. Hurray, you were involved in the 1988 semi-final? - A.
                   Yes, sir.

                Q. And in not only what happened then,          but also in the   review
                   of how it had gone? - A. Yes, sir.

                Q. And were also concerned and involved in the planning and
                   preparation for the 1989 semi-final? - A. Yes, sir.

                Q. It may be a very difficult line to draw, but is it a
                   question, when you are planning for events, to have to
                   make judgments about what you expect to occur?  - A. Yes,
                   sir, that is correct.

                Q. And is there a policy to avoid heavy and oppressive
                   policing? - A. We try and provide the Police that we feel
                   is necessary for the event, sir.

                Q. You were asked yesterday about the making of judgments and
                   assessments of numbers in crowds, time required, the
                   ability of the system to cope.  Do you follow? - A. Yes,
                   sir.

                Q. Hay I ask you a little about that? Were you, in fact,
                   making mathematical, scientific assessments or were you
                   exercising your judgment in the light of experience? - A.
                   It was judgment and experience, sir.

                Q. And you were, of course, acquainted with the Leppings Lane
                   end? - A. Yes, sir.

                Q. With the ordinary, expected functioning of the turnstiles?
                   - A. Yes, sir.

                Q.   With the reliability of your men? - A. Yes, sir.

                Q.   Were they reliable men? - A. Yes, sir.

                Q. Were they conscientious Policemen? - A. Yes, sir.

                Q. Did you expect your Policemen to exercise oppressive
                   force? - A. No, sir.   The briefing isthat  theyshould            be
                   fair;  they should be firm when necessary;   and they
                   should allow people to enjoy themselves.
                      2                          B. D. HURRAY




You were asked about the croud situation on Leppings Lane
and you may recall Hr. Harshall’s request for Leppings
Lane to be closed? - A. Yes, sir.

Do you follow?  In your Control Room you had the various
monitors, the various video monitors? - A. Yes, sir.

When Hr. Harshall asked you at the time that he has
described for Leppings Lane to be closed, did you look out
on the monitor and see what was being shown along there at
about 2.17? - A. Yes, sir.

Is that an instance there of relying on people’s judgment?
- A. Yes, sir.  I relied on Hr. Harshall’s judgment.

And you did not query what he was asking for? - A. No,
sir.

Or countermand it.  Whilst in the Control Box, were you
only concerned with Leppings Lane? - A. No, sir.  I was
concerned with everything that is going on in and around
the vicinity of the ground and also the other monitors
showing pictures from different parts.

So if we are to have, as close as one can get it, a
flavour of what you are doing, you are not just watchiang
Leppings Lane monitors or cameras? - A. No, sir.

You are not just looking at Leppings Lane terrace? -     A.
No, sir.

The West End terrace.  Why are you looking at other areas?
It may be obvious, but why?

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I think it is.  I mean, he has
got a responsibility all round the ground.  I accept that.
We know something awful happened at Leppings Lane, but he
has got to look at the whole picture.

     HR. WOODWARD:   Thank you, sir.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I understand that.

     HR. WOODWARD:   During your surveillance, your
observation of what was going on at this venue, did you
from time to time look down to the West End terrace? - A.
Well, yes, sir.

Your view, of course, from the Control Box is an oblique
view along that terrace? - A. Yes, sir, just slightly set
off from the fence.

And may it be misleading to guess what your view happens

               to be from visiting the ground when there is no match on,
               compared with what is happening on a match day? - A. I
               think everything is different when the terraces are full
               of people obviously, sir.

          Q. Would you have a look, please, at the Composite 2? That
             is the South Yorkshire Police bundle of photographs
             showing the terraces at 2.46.  Photographs 1629, 1630 and
             1631.  Do you have them, Hr. Hurray? - A. Yes, sir.

          Q. Of course, that is not the view that you had.    That is the
             view of the camera looking  at the terrace almost from the
             front? - A. Yes, sir, that   is correct.

          Q. But that view, taken at 2.46, does that indicate to you
             that there is room for more people to come on to those
             terraces? - A. The terraces look pretty full at that stage
             to me, sir.

          Q. Would you look down at thefront, down at  Gate No. 4? Do
             you see the gentleman holding the Scottish flag up to the
             railings? - A. Yes, sir.

          A. And do you see there the people to his left and right and
             behind him? - A. Yes, sir.

          Q. Of course, I suppose it depends which particular spot on
             the terrace one looks at? - A. Well, they look fairly
             comfortable at the front.

          Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Do I understand the question
               that Counsel put to you was, "Does it look as though there
               is room for more?1' and your answer was, "The terraces look
               pretty full to me."   Is that right? - A. From that angle,
               sir, the terrances do look full to me.

          Q. Does that mean that it is pretty full, but you would not
             think it desirable that there should be more or, at any
             rate, very many more put in?  Is that about right or you
             tell me how you see it? - A. Looking at the picture, from
             this angle it is taken, sir, there is some room at the
             front, but it looks quite full at the back.

          Q. So if you were looking at that terrace from the position
             of the photographer? - A. Yes, sir.

          Q. And somebody was querying whether more should be allowed
             in or not, what would your view be? - A. Hy view would be,
             sir, if there was movement down towards the front, there
             would probably be room for some more at the back.

          Q.        HR. WOODWARD:   If one looks at DB1631, you can see a
               view of the Police Officer standing looking at the fence.
               Do you see the rear of the Officer? - A. Yes.

                                                             B. D. HURRAY




         Q. And the people in his immediate front, one can see almost
            down to their waists, some of them.  People standing,
            turning, looking around, lighting cigarettes? - A. I feel
            there is some room at the front, but it looks full at the
            back

         Q. Whilst you were up in the Control Box before the incident
            happened, did you have any worry or concern over the state
            of those people in the terraces? - A. No, sir, I had no
            concern.

         Q. In 1988 we know that the same game had been played - the
            same venue, same teams, supporters, similar allegiance -
            and in 1988, to the best of your recollection, how had the
            terraces been? - A. The terraces were similar to what they
            were in 1989.

         Q. Hay I ask you about another matter - the question of
            delaying the match? - A. Yes, sir.

         Q. And it was being put to you that you had the discussion
            with Hr. Duckenfield? - A. Yes, sir.

         Q. About the circumstances in   which the game would be
            delayed? - A. Yes, sir.

         Q. And the point was being made about people coming along
            late? - A. Yes, sir.

         Q. How do you know when to draw the line? - A. I think that
            is perhaps one of the most difficult decisions that there
            is to make as to when you decide that you are going to
            delay the kick-off.  I think if you are in a situation
            where you know that there is something definite that is
            preventing people getting to the venue, then the decision
            is very easy, but if it is   just that people are arriving
            and you are wondering whether they are going to get in in
            time, the decision is very difficult.

         Q. Of course, I suppose it might be said that even one
            car-load of angry, frustrated and late supporters might
            cause some problem if they are rushing into the ground and
            the game is not delayed for their benefit.  Do you follow?
            That would be an extreme proposition, but it might be
            foreseen or foreseeable that those individuals, in their
            rush to get in, might cause problems for others? - A. That
            is possible, sir, but my experience is that there are some
            people who come to games late anyway rather than be in
            before kick-off.

         Q. And is it very much a matter of judgment? - A. Very much
            so.
                                               B. D. HURRAY



And is this the situation, that that judgment, whilst it
is more easily to be exercised in obvious situations like
where there has been a motor accident blocking a motorway
or something serious on the Pennines, is a judgment that
has to take into account all matters? - A, Yes, sir.

And it is not a judgment in respect of which there is any
hard and fast rule according to which you will or will not
delay the game? - A. I do not think there can be a hard
and fast rule.

And has it ever been the practice to have such a rule? -
A. No, I have never been to a match where the kick-off has
been delayed.

Are you aware of any rule which says, "Never mind.  We do
not stop it because they are late"? - A. There are not any
rules,  no, sir.




                             /Q. Did the thought occur.
                                       B.D. MURRAY


Q. Did the thought occur to you that the game should be delayed?
   - A. The thought did not occur to me.  I think I was probably
   preoccupied with other events.

Q. Of course with hindsight we can achieve miracles? - A. With
  \ hindsight, yes.

Q. May I now move on to ask you about the communication facilities,
      just a little because there may be detailed evidence as to
    ] its complexity, but first of all was a consequence of the
    I radio difficulties that were being experienced, that tshe
   I Control Room switched to using the hand-held portable
 [     radios? - A. Yes sir.

Q. Did that mean that the Control Room by adopting that course
   was in just the same position, in effect, as anybody else
   equipped with a hand-held radio? - A. Yes sir. When we
   use the main set we can override anyone who is sending a
   message into control, but by using personal radios every­
   one is on the same circuits and everyone is competing for
   the same signals.

Q. In order to achieve the communication, because of the circum­
   stances which one understood to obtain., did it mean that
   you in effect no longer had the control with the substantial
   radio system? - A. Yes sir, we no longer had the facility
   to be able to cut people off and override them and pass
   messages from control.

Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  You could not go on to non­
     talk-through? - A. No sir, that was my impression on the
     day and we did operate our personal radios after the
     radio breakdown, my Lord.

Q.         MR. WOODWARD:  Of course therewas a radio link that
     you had with the ground, the Club's Operations Room? - A.
     Yes, we did have a personal radio on their system.

Q. That was a personal system which was possessed by the
   ground which provided you the facility to link in? - A.
   Yes sir.

Q. That is a separate radio system from the Police radio system?
   - A. It is a separate personal radio system run by the Club.

Q.           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: That is the one the Club use
     to contact their Stewards? - A. Contact their Stewards and
     their Officials, yes sir.

Q.        MR. WOODWARD:   You can contact them and they could
     contact you using it? - A. Yes sir.

Q.Did you also have a telephone link with    the Club? - A.   Yes
   sir, on the Club's private network.
                            7

                                        B.D. MURRAY


Q. So you had the radio and the Club's telephone, private line?
   - A. Yes sir.

Q. The Police had down in the Club's room a Mr. Guest, I think?
   - A. P.C. Guest, yes sir.

Q. He was able to communicate with you and if anybody in the
   Club Room had wanted to see something through the Police
   cameras could that have been asked for? - A. That could
   have been asked for by radio or telephone but I have never
   known it requested.

Q. If they wanted it they could have asked for it? - A. Yes.

           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  As I understand it from the
     visit this morning they can switch a button which will show
     what the Police video is producing?

           MR. WOODWARD:  That shows what the Police are in fact
     videoing but not everything that is coming in.

Q. They can switch that on and they can ask for the camera
   to be moved if they want to? - A. They could have asked for
   us to record a particular camera which they could monitor,
   yes.

Q. Of course again that would depend upon whether the Police
   were able to give them that facility at that moment because
   the Police's intention might be for reasons unknown to the
   Club, concentrated on something apparently utterly innocuous
   and utterly irrelevant?- A. Yes.

Q.          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   When you tried to get through
     to Mr. Lock how were you trying to do that, on the Club's
     radio? - A. I tried to do it on the Club's radio.    I cailed
     him two or three times.    I even switched the radio off then
     to make sure it was on properly, switched it off and then
     switched it back on again and called another two or three
     times.   It was in a fairly short space, my Lord, perhaps
     over the period of a minute.

Q.         MR. WOODWARD:  That use of the radio, are you able
     to say whether the inability to communicate with Mr. Lock
     was a technical matter or some other matter? - A. I don't
     know why sir.

Q. So you switched the radio on and used it and broadcast, as
   you thought, but received no response? - A. The radio was
   on.  I called two or three times, received no response and
   I just checked that it actually was on, which it was,
   turned it off and on again and tried again.

Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  The point you were concerned
     about was people did not seem to be coming through the
     turnstiles satisfactorily? - A. Very much so, my Lord.
     If I have any problems in the Club at all my contact is
                                   B.D. MURRAY


Mr. Lock.  We have a very good relationship.    If he has
problems with a Police Officer,, or a Steward does/ then they
will go to Mr. Lock and we will try to sort it out together,
sir.

      MR. WOODWARD:  Have you ever known Mr. Lock fail to
raise some matter with which he was concerned or have any
reluctance to raise a matter? - A. No, we get in touch with
each other.

Mr. Lock I think is fairly forthright, isn't he? - A. Oh
yes sir.

The turnstile figures you were asked about.  Of course the
Club is monitoring those constantly in the room? - A. Yes,
it is.

It has a video, a VDU screen showing the cascade of figures
and the performances of the various turnstiles? - A. It does.
It is able to tell us how many people are in each end of
the ground.

If there was a situation developing according to the computer
understanding of the turnstile throughput does, so far as
you know, the computer if capacity is about to be reached
or they are getting to an amber stage, give any communication?
- A. I do know that when each end of the ground has reached
15% off being full there is some flashing indication.  I
don't know whether the counters show individual turnstiles
or total.

 It is probably not important Mr. Murray that you should
 know how it is done, but you know that the facility exists
 for the computer to give a warning some time before capacity,
 according to the turnstiles, is reached? - A. Yes sir.

 And upon such a level being reached would you expect to be
a told? - A. Normally sir.

 No such communication came through that day? - A. No sir.

 When the incident occurred you went down to see? - A. Yes
 sir.

 You put your hat on and went down? — A. Yes sir.

       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  Just before you move away to
 that.  If there had been information come through to you
 that the turnstile section for the terraces on the west
 end had reached their amber level, put it that way, the
 15% less than capacity, if you had had that message what
 would you have done? - A. Well all it would have occurred
 to me was that we had reached 15%.  It would have been an
 indication of how many people were to come in and how
 many people were outside.

£                                           B.D. MURRAY


    Q. Well would it require any action? - A. It depends, my Lord.
       If we knew that there were 1,500 people to come in and there
       were 5,000 outside, it would have indicated we had an
       enormous problem.

    Q. I mean it occurs to me one of the things you might want to
       do if you knew you were getting towards capacity on the
       terraces and you still had a lot of people coming in, would
       be to have someone, if not before now, certainly now,
       monitoring the state of the pens and perhaps closing off
       one part and directing to the less occupied part? - A. If
       we knew of the exact number that were to come in it may
       well have triggered that thought, yes my Lord.

    Q. In fact what you had instead was completely bypassing the turn
       stile system and letting in a large number through the
       gate? - A. That is correct, yes, my Lord.

    Q. So that could produce the same result, couldn't it? - A. Yes,
       it could.

                                                              B.D. MURRAY


                      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    It might have been a different lot
                 of supporters.

                      MR. HYTNER:   A different lot of supporters, yes.

                                    Bv LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:

            Q. There are one or two things I would like to ask you, Mr.
               Murray.  First of all, can you help about this, because you
               were in the control room from time to time, indeed most of the
               time. - A. Yes, my Lord.

            Q. Was there a stage - the time I am talking about is between
               about 10-to-3 and 3 o ’clock - when there were any senior
               Officers standing at the top of the steps leading into the
               control box? We have heard some evidence about two senior
               Officers that were standing there, one at the top and one a
               couple of steps down.   Can you help about who they might have
               been? - A. Not that I was aware of, but I do know from time to
               time the Inspectors in charge of different areas of the ground
               would use the control room steps as a vantage point to have a
               look around.

            Q. They would not have braid on their caps, would they? - A.
               Well, no, sir, the only people with braid on their caps were
               the Superintendents.  It has been known for someone from the
               control room to stand on the top of the steps, again perhaps
               to get a better view.  I c a n ’t recall myself or Mr.
               Duckenfield doing that on the day.     If we had we certainly
               would not have been wearing caps unless we were actually going
               elsewhere, my Lord, because we d o n ’t wear caps in the control
               room environment.

            Q.   So if we are talking of Officers with braid on their caps, and
                 we leave you and Mr. Duckenfield out, who else might it have
                 been? - A. Are we talking about gold braid or silver braid
                 o r ....?

            Q.   Well, we actually had a suggestion of gold braid and black
                 braid for these two Officers? - A. Well, black braid would be
                 Inspectors or Chief Inspectors.

            Q. Inspectors would have black braid, would they? - A. Inspectors
               and Chief Inspectors have black braid.

            Q. Chief Inspectors? - A. Inspectors and Chief Inspectors, my
               Lord.  Superintendents or above have silver or gold.  The only
               other Officers apart from Mr. Duckenfield and myself would be
               the other three Superintendents.

            Q. That is Mr. Greenwood.... - A. Mr. Marshall, Mr. Greenwood and
               M r . Chapman.

            Q. Mr. Marshall would not have been up there? - A. No, sir.

            Q. Mr. Greenwood and....? - A. Mr. Chapman, who was looking after
               the Nottingham Forest end.

     Q.   He was at the other end? - A. Yes.

     Q.   I think one of them was identified as being possibly wearing a
          kind of light coloured anorak over his uniform.   Does that
          ring any bells? Was there any Officer would have been wearing
          a light coloured anorak over his uniform? - A. I would not
          like to see any Officer wearing an anorak over his uniform at
          an event like that, my Lord, and as far as I know there was no
          Officer had an anorak other than the proper Police black
          anoraks.

     Q. If I can just give you the one other identifying feature, the
        Officer who was two steps down was said to be fair stocky and
        to be wearing a cap with black braid? - A. That could be any
        of the Inspectors.

               MR. WOODWARD:   I do apologise.  The witness said there
          may be silver or gold braid.  That ought to be clarified, sir.

               LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      If you want to clarify it, do.

               MR. WOODWARD:   Sir, we are not aware of anybody in our
          Force wearing gold braid on their hat.

     Q.           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Are you? - A. My apologies, my
          L or d .

     Q. Are you aware of anybody with that? - A. I can't recall
        whether the ACPO ranks wear gold oak leaves or silver oak
        leaves, but the only ACPO rank there was M r . Jackson who was
        not in uniform anyway, sir.

     Q. Thank you.  The other thing I wanted to ask you particularly
        as to the facts was you referred yesterday to an individual
        getting on top of the goal posts who you said was drunk and
        was fetched down but di d n ’t please the crowd, and you said he
        was to be allowed to go.     Is that right? - A. Yes.

     Q. I think there was a stage, was not there, at which a decision
        was made by somebody to remove the netting from the goal
        posts? - A. The netting was removed.  I d o n ’t whether it was
        removed deliberately by Police Officers.

     Q. I may be wrong but my understanding was it made it easier to
        cope with the situation behind the goal from the pitch? - A. I
        would think it probably did.  It would certainly make it
        easier for perhaps an ambulance to approach it if the netting
        was down.

     Q. All I am asking you is, it seems a strange thing for anybody
        even if drunk to want to do, to get up on the goal posts.  Was
        it anything to do with trying to get the netting down, do you
        know? - A. No, my Lord, it was just one individual who was
        hopelessly,drunk and my impression, I am almost sure the
        netting was down at that stage.

                                                 B.D. MURRAY


Q. The netting was already down? - A. The netting was already
   down.  He just wanted to get up a n d . ...

        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Can I just say generally round
   the room, I don't find it helpful for people to be shaking
   their heads in disagreement or nodding in agreement.   It does
   not contribute anything to the Inquiry from whatever quarter
   it comes and I hope it will stop:

Q. Yes.  Sorry. - A. Yes, he was climbing up on the goal posts
   and it was my opinion he was going to wave towards the crowd.
   The two Officers pulled him down before he could stand.  He
   had actually got on the crossbar but before he could stand the
   Officers pulled him down.

Q. Thank you.  I want to ask you, and this is not a personal
   criticism at all, but I want to ask you the mode of
   controlling the numbers on the terrace.  You told the Inquiry
   yesterday that you accepted, although you did not
   particularly remember it yourself, but there may have been a
   conversation between you and Mr. Creaser at an earlyish stage
   when he questioned whether you were going to fill first one
   pen and then move on to another one, and you said that you
   would leave the fans to find their own levels.     Is that right?
   - A. Yes, my Lord.   I can't recall the conversation, but Mr.
   Creaser did approach me a couple of days after and said, ”Do
   you recall me seeing you before earlier?” , and I said, ”No",
   and he said to me, "I did see you and asked if the fans were
   to find their own level".  I said, "No, I d o n ’t recall, but if
   you had of asked me....” .

Q. That is what you would have said? - A. I would have said
   "Yes” .

Q. That is the point I want to start from.  It must follow from
   that at some matches, league matches as I understand it, you
   may adopt a policy of putting people into one pen and when
   that has got sufficient in moving on to another one.  Is that
   right? - A. That is not normally policy, my Lord.  We try and
   assess how supporters there will be on the terraces before the
   event takes place.  If there were say to be 1,000 then we
   would confine them to the centre two pens.  If there were
   going to be 3,000 we would open as a matter of course the
   centre two pens and the one under the Police control.  If it
   was going to be a large crowd we would open all four pens and
   the very last one would be the raised section.  If we have got
   some idea of the numbers that were coming we make the
   arrangements beforehand.

Q. Yes, but what I had in mind was this, if that conversation
   took place Mr. Creaser must have thought of it as at any rate
   a possible strategy to fill one pen and then move on to
   another? - A. He may have, yes.

Q. Is that something that is sometimes done? - A. What happens is
   if we underestimate, if I think it is going to be 1,000 away
   fans come we will confine them to the two centre pens.  If we
                          19


                                                  B.D. MURRAY


   find those two centre pens are getting full and there are
   still other supporters to come then we will extend it to
   another pen, my Lord.

Q. So that involves, whether you do it by design at the beginning
   or because the situation develops, it involves a judgment
   about at what stage you have got enough in the area you have
   allotted and have to open another one? - A. Yes, my Lord.

Q. So some kind of judgment has to be made? - A. Yes, it does.

Q. But if you adopt a policy of letting the fans find their own
   level across the whole of the terrace does there not still
   have to be some surveillance about whether they are doing it
   effectively or not? -A. I am sure there has to be some
   surveillance, but it is just one of those things that by
   experience has not caused a problem in the past, my Lord.

Q. I see.  Can you help as to why - would you look at the bundle
   of photographs, the thick one, West Midlands 2, and open at
   the same time photographs 21 and 32.  They show the mouth of
   the tunnel looking out of it and looking into it? - A. Yes.

Q. Can you help me as to why there are those two projections of
   brickwork out on to the terrace? - A. No, I have no idea, my
   L or d .

Q. Because do you agree, you were talking about people using the
   gates between pens which are right up against the front of the
   West Stand, in order to level themselves out, but those bits
   of brickwork actually act like blinkers, don't they, to shield
   off to anybody coming through the possibility of doing that? -
   A. I have never noticed that before, but it is perfectly
   true, it tends to throw people down the terrace rather than to
   the right or the left.

Q. The only reason I can think of for it, having been there again
   this morning, is that if you look at 32 the terracing actually
   rises higher at either side of that brickwork than it does
   where you emerge on to the terrace from the tunnel? - A.
   Yes, to stop people falling.

Q. They may be like book ends to stop people falling off the ends
   of those highest terraces.  - A. I would think that is
   perfectly right, my Lord.

Q. But it does have that blinkering effect? - A. I agree.

Q. And makes it the more optimistic, might I suggest to you, that
   people will actually be able to even themselves out between
   pens? - A. Yes, my Lord.

Q. Without some supervision? - A. Yes, my Lord.

        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Thank you.  If anybody wants to
   ask anything further please say, arising out of what I have
   asked.  No.  Thank you very much.  Do you want to re-examine?

    Q.   We know that this year you were ground   Commander and the year
         before you had the Leppings Lane end.    What was your
         responsibility in 1987? - A. I had the   Leppings Lane end
         again.

    Q. Now, could you go, please, to Tab 4 in the South Yorkshire
       Police documents.

                   It was during your spell as an Inspector that the crushing
                   incident occurred at the Tottenham Hotspur and
                   Wolverhampton Wanderers match in 1981.  Is that right? -
                   A. Yes, sir.

              Q. And I think you are the first witness we have called whose
                 name appears at the debriefing meeting for that match.
                 Tab 4? - A. I was present at the debriefing.

              Q.    Do you have the document in front of you now? - A. Is that
                   Part 4, Policing Hillsborough Football Stadium? Do I have
                   the right one?

              Q.   No, do you have the larger of the two South Yorkshire
                   Police documents?  I think you have got the right one.   If
                   you go to Tab 4? - A. <Yes.

              Q. It is a Minute of the debriefing meeting and, from the
                 Index, we know that the date is 11th April, 1981? - A.
                 Yes, I have got the Minute, sir.

              Q. Now, before I come on to that matter, can I just clarify
                 one other matter.  I think during your spells at F
                 Division you had some contact yourself with the Club? - A.
                 Yes.

              Q. But it would be right to say, would it, that Inspector
                 Calvert throughout that period was the main Officer
                 responsible for liaising with the Club? - A. That is
                 correct, sir.

              Q. And so we can leave general matters to him when he gives
                 his evidence? - A. I have experience, as a Chief
                 Inspector, of going to certain meetings.

              Q. But Mr. Calvert was also present? - A. He was the liaison,
                 yes.

              Q. Do I take it, Mr. Greenwood, that you were actually
                 present at this match when crushing occurred? - A.
                 Certainly.

              Q. Whereabouts in the ground    were you on that occasion? - A.
                 I cannot recall the exact    duties that I was actually
                 assigned to.  I certainly    recall clearly where I was at
                 the area at the time that    the crushing occurred.

              Q. Where was that? - A. That was on the perimeter track,
                 almost directly between the Police Control Box - in other
                 words, what would now be the South pen.

              Q. Can you tell us fairly briefly what the problem was, as
                 you saw it, on that occasion? - A.  Yes, the problem, if I
                 remember rightly, was just to the right of the perimeter
                                              R. L. GREENWOOD



fence gate, where it was abundantly apparent to me that
people were being crushed up against the fencing.  They
were being squeezed against the fencing.

Can we just identify on the model where that is? - A. Yes,
it is further along to the left into the space a bit
further to your left.  A bit further.  About there,
directly beneath the Police Control Box.  (The Usher
demonstrated on the model. )

So not on the terrace as such, but on the corner section?
- A. Well, I regard that as part of the terracing, yes.
What is now the South pen.

And at what stage were you conscious of that crushing? -
A. Well, I know it was after the teams had kicked off, but
I cannot recall specifically when it was.

And what steps were then taken to ease that problem? - A.
I recall broadcasting by personal radio to the Police
Control Box, telling them of the situation, and I think,
to the best of my recollection, asking for authority to
open the gates.

Did you, in fact, open the gates? - A. I opened a gate and
a colleague of mine opened another gate.  We had no
response because communications, under those
circumstances, were really non-existent.

And on that occasion was the opening of the gates
sufficient to ease the problem? - A. Yes, it was.

But had some people already been injured by that stage? -
A. I cannot honestly recall injuries.  There certainly
were not serious injuries.   If there were, they were
minor, so whether they had been injured by that stage, I
cannot honestly say, but we got them out.  The people were
ou t .

Could you move on, please, to Tab 8 in the same bundle?

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Are you leaving the 1981
incident?

     MR. GOLDSACK:   I was going to at this stage, sir.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Can I just ask:

You said the problem was crushing against the fencing.
This was in a situation before there were any radial
fences? - A. Yes, my Lord.

So, theoretically, there was the whole width of the West
Terrace for people to level  themselves out? - A. Yes,
                             23


                                                   R. L. GREENWOOD



     that is correct.

Q. Are you able to say what it was that caused the crushing
   to occur at that end? - A. It was because there were too
   many people at the back, my Lord - too many people at the
   back of the terracing - and that crush had come through to
   the front.  Why those people were there in those numbers
   at the back of the terracing, I cannot say.

Q. And you said there was no reply when you radioed to the
   Control loom and went on - am I right - to say that really
   in that kind of situation, for which I took it you mean a
   lot of noise at the ground, that is more or less what you
   would expect? - A. Yes, you are talking about a cauldron
   of 50,000 people.

Q. I mean, there was nothing wrong with the radio on that
   occasion that you know of? - A. Not to my knowledge, no.
   It is the noise, the level of noise from the crowd, that,
   even with public address systems, one can hear it if the
   crowd is quiet, in my experience at football and rugby
   grounds.  When   the crowd is extremely noisy - it is
   something that   you have got to witness, to beon the
   touchline, you know, to really get the flavour of it, if I
   may say so.

Q. Can I ask you then, with your experience, what do you
   suggest as a method of communication from the perimeter
   fencing to Control   in an emergency if a radio working
   correctly will   not do? -A. We did not have earpieces in
   1981.  I remember that.

Q. Earpieces would help? - A. They have helped, but, even so,
   there are extreme difficulties.  I know of no technology
   that is available that can get over that.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Thank you, yes..   Sorry,   Mr.
     Goldsack.

Q.        HR. GOLDSACK:   Could you move to Tab 8, the same
     bundle of documents? Now, this is, in fact, an internal
     memorandum from Hr. Herold to Hr. Smith and Inspector
     Calvert? - A. Yes, I have got that, sir.

Q. Just about half-way down, do you see a paragraph:

          "We should stress to the stewards that the admission
          of spectators and the packing of those spectators at
          the bigger games on to the terracing is primarily
          their function and not a police one."

     - A. Yes,   I see, that sir.

Q. Now, although this document does not appear to have been

                  circularised to you, were you aware that that was going to
                  be passed on by Mr. Calvert to the stewards at the Club? -
                  A.  No, I do not recollect that.

               Q. Can you help us as to whether* at the match you have been
                  describing in 1981, anyone was monitoring the people going
                  into the terrace? - A. I cannot say categorically that I
                  know of people that were doing that.  It would somewhat
                  surprise me if that had not been the case, based on my
                  experience.

               Q. So in 1981 what was your experience as to the monitoring
                  of the crowd into the terrace? - A. Well, I do not have
                  any.  I said I have no recollection of that whatsoever.

               Q. Now, based on something that we find in your briefing
                  notes for this y e a r ’s match, is it right that you had also
                  had experience of overcrowding at the other end - the Kop
                  end - at a match in 1985? - A. Yes, that is true, sir.

               Q. Sheffield Wednesday and Liverpool? - A. Yes.

               Q. Was that a League match? - A. I believe it was, yes.

               Q. And was the decision taken then to move some of the
                  Sheffield Wednesday supporters from the Kop end to the
                  Leppings Lane end? - A. That is correct, sir.

               Q. Which,   in itself, sparked trouble? - A. Yes.

               Q. What I would like you to deal with, please, is the
                  overcrowding at the Kop end.  Who decided that there was
                  overcrowding on that occasion? - A. I cannot assist you
                  with that.  The only comment that I could make that is
                  within my knowledge, I think that the manual, probably
                  click recording system that they had may have gone faulty.
                  That is the only comment I can make.  I cannot....

               Q. You were then Chief Inspector? - A. Yes.

               Q. Do you remember where you were in the ground at that
                  match? - A. Well, I remember where I was when they were
                  transferred.  I was not responsible for transferring
                  them, but I do remember I was towards the Leppings Lane
                  terracing.

               Q. So you cannot, in fact, help as to whether the decision
                  that the Kop was overcrowded was a purely visual
                  assessment or based on some other means? - A. Not at all.
                  I would have thought that, if the recording mechanism had
                  gone faulty and that was an issue, then it would have been
                  based on a visual, but certainly not from my view of it.

                       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      That was Sheffield Wednesday
                                               R. L. GREENWOOD



against....?

     HR. GOLDSACK:    Liverpool:

But is this the position, Mr. Greenwood, that, based upon
those two personal experiences, overcrowding on the
terraces was something that you were certainly alive to? -
A.  Certainly from 1981 overcrowding in the South pen and
certainly from that match on the Spion Kop, yes.

Can we come, please, to the semi-finals in recent years?
The 1987 one was on a Sunday? - A. Correct.

And a 12 o ’clock kick-off? - A. Correct.

So far as policing the Leppings Lane end of the ground in
1987, did you adopt the same method as in 1988? - A. Yes,
as far as I can recall, it was the same plan, same
tactics, same strategy.

So can I concentrate on 1988? On that occasion what was
your procedure for monitoring the movement of fans down
Leppings Lane? - A. Well, Officers would be stationed at
the end of the roads.

The side roads? - A. Yes, the side roads that were
barriered off.   Officers would also be stationed on the
main road outside as well, so the procedure was that fans
that were coming would be passing through a presence of
Police Officers.   In addition, I had a role as well, in
terms of monitoring.   I brought, I think, three or four
train loads, supervised them down from the station, and
had a roving commission and so I was able to monitor
myself as well, and, of course, traffic was being
monitored from the motorway, as far as I can recall.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    I had a letter from somebody -
I do not know whether he is right - who points out, if he
is right, that the day of the semi-final in 1988 was also
the Grand National day.    Do you recall that? - A. No, my
Lord.

Would that have any effect on numbers  coming, do you
think? - A. I would not have thought so because, I am not
sure....

Another sporting event as a diversion in Liverpool? - A. I
do not know whether the Grand National would be run at a
different time.  I am not sure.

You would not be able to get to both,     would you? - A. I do
not know.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Well,   it may be worth looking
                                            R. L. GREENWOOD



at.

     M$, GOLDSACK:   In 1988 did you have a method for
sifting out the people in Leppings Lane who did not have a
ticket? - A. No, not as such.

Was any check made by individual Officers as people
approached the ground? - A. Not within my recollection,
unless - I mean, it is a flexible situation.  The Officers
that work there are very experienced.  They have worked
there for some years.  If they saw, for example, a group
hanging about that might attract their attention, it might
come into their minds at that stage that one of the
reasons that they would be hanging about is because they
did not have a ticket and they might check for that
reason, but not a formalised procedure of having to go
through a network of Officers and be asked if you have got
a ticket, no.




                             /Q. Where physically were.
                                  R. GREENWOOD



Where physically were you between 2 and 3 o'clock at last
year's match? - A. At last year's match you would have to
remind me, or I would have to be reminded as to what time
the special trains came in because I certainly supervised
those trains from Wadsley Bridge right down to the ground
and then went back for the next train.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  How were you transporting your­
self? - A. I used the Land Rover with the loud speaker
equipment on, my Lord.

      MR. GOLDSACKs  After the last of the special trains
loads had been delivered in Leppings Lane, would you remain
in Leppings Lane? - A. Yes, under normal circumstances, yes.

Were you conscious that the 1988 match had any crowd
problems in Leppings Lane? - A. No, totally different than
what I have seen this year, totally different.

Do you have any views as to why that is? - A. Yes, I have
expressed a view from what I have seen.  I was not obviously
present outside the ground on the occasion of this match
so I can only speak from what Officers have told me and
the videos, the media exposure that I have seen, television
etc.  In my view that is outside my experience.  It is
something unique.  I have described it as a phenomenon
that I have not witnesses before and I cannot understand
it.  I think to myself:  "What is the purpose?"

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  Purpose? - A. Yes, the purpose
in terms of what really was it all about? Was it about
people that had joined in that did not have tickets? Was
it about people who had forged tickets? Was it something
other than it appears to be? I don't know the answer to
it. As I say it is a phenomenon in my view.   I have not
seen anything like it before.

      MR. GOLDSACK: Based on your experiences in 1988,
if you had been the Commander at Leppings Lane again this
year would you have made any alterations to your policy?
- A. I was not there.  In 1988 I saw nothing that would
make me consider a change for 1989.  From what I have seen
of the situation as it developed in 1989 I cannot comment
on how that situation developed but I have been interested
having experienced that side of the ground and it appears
that it was a sudden swamping.

Can I come to this year please?  I think before the event
you had attended two planning meetings before the Friday
when you were present at the briefing for Senior Officers?
- A. That is correct, sir.

At any of those meetings was the question of avoiding
overcrowding in the terraces mentioned? - A. Not as
directly as that.   It raised its head in terms of the
numbeis of Liverpool supporters who might be expected to
                                   R. GREENWOOD


appear to surface on the Spion Kop area.  One thing that
was considered, dependent on what that number would be,
would be the transfer of supporters from the Spion Kop
to the Leppings Lane terracing.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  You are talking about seeing
it as a problem in segregation rather than in sheer
numbers? - A. That is right, but of course the critical
fact as far as I was concerned was it had to remain
flexible if you were talking about two or three, but
based on the experience of last year where you had got
hundreds, then it would not be feasible to accommodate
them, to transfer those people to the Leppings Lane end
of the ground because that in itself would have resulted
in overcrowding, so it was a consideration in that
direction.

      MR. GOLDSACK: As the Commander within the ground
for 1989 what was your understanding on the morning of
the match as to whether anyone would be monitoring
entry into the Leppings Lane terraces? - A. Well from
experience again that is something that is done from the
Control Box.  It is something that would be done by the
Police Officers at that end of the ground as well and
that was my understanding.

When you say "the Police Officers at that end of the
ground" who in particular do you mean? - A. Well I have
a Chief Inspector at that end of the ground.  There are
Inspectors with duties there and if there was a problem
in the terraces then I would expect them to come forward
and tell Police Control of that problem.  In addition
to that, of course, 1 had a roving commission in the
ground as well and was also monitoring on a more casual
basis, because of responsibilities towards other areas
in the ground, as to what the situation was at the Leppings
Lane end of the ground.

Can I just consider the individuals that you mentioned.
The Chief Inspector at that end was Mr. Creaser? - A. Yes,
that is correct, sir.

Where would you expect him physically to be based between
2 and 3 o'clock? - A. I don't think that there is a
categoric answer. It would depend what the circumstances
were that were appertaining at the particular time.

Is it more likely that he would be behind the West Stand
monitoring entrance to the ground at that stage? - A. I
don't know whether I would class it as a likelihood.  That
is difficult.

Inspector Watt with Serials 14 and 15. Would you expect
him to be in the concourse area with his Serials? - A. Yes,
I would expect him to be where he is outlined to be on
the order, yes.

                                              R. GREENWOOD


    Q. And Inspectors Sykes and Purdy, although under your, control,
       are the Officers outside the turnstiles? - A. Yes, if I
       can just enlarge on that to clarify it it might be of
       assistance.  They are under my control technically under the
       Order, but practice and custom would not treat them, as I
       say how I have performed the duties at Leppings Lane end
       in the previous two years as practically, in practice being
       under my control at that stage.  They certainly come under
       my control if you wish when they come into the ground under
       Phase 2, but they would be outside the turnstiles, yes.

    Q.j    so was there an Inspector under your control who you would
      \ expect to be at the front end of the Leppings Lane terrace
          ; and in a position to assess the build up? - A. Well there
           was an Inspector in the West Stand, yes, who had a Serial
            in the West Stand who would be able to.

    Q. Inspector Bullis? - A. Yes, that is correct sir

    Q. Now you on the Saturday briefed the Serials under you.       Is
       that right? - A. I did not brief all the Serials, no.

    Q. You briefed the Inspectors? - A. Yes, I briefed the Inspectors
       on the Friday.

    Q. Can we just consider for a moment Inspector Bullis and
       the Serial in the West Stand? - A. Yes.

    Q. So far as you are aware was   any specific briefing given to
       them from their vantage position in the Stand to monitor the
       build-up of crowds in the terrace below? - A. No, I can't
       recall whether Mr. Bullis was present.    I would have expected
       him to be.  I certainly did   not give him any specific briefing
       in terms of the build-up in   the terraces below, no.

    Q. Are we to take it from that that you would expect the
       Inspector to brief his men to that effect of his own
       initiative? - A. No, I don't think so.

    Q. {You would simply expect the individual Officers to keep
        their eyes open? - A. Well yes.  I think the role of the
        Serial of men and the role of the Inspector is supplementary
        to the role of the Control Box, in my view, in terms of
       monitoring the crowd and I would not give them a specific
        briefing the Inspector, or I would not expect him to give
        it to his Serial to says  "Look, we have got to be watching
        for the build up in the terracing because that is our job",
        What I was trying to explain to you earlier on is they
        would not be doing it specifically but if they saw something
        that caused them concern, any incident, any problem, then
        that would be a supplementary means in addition to the
        Control Box of notifying the problem, but not a specific
        role.

    Q.           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   But your understanding is that
                                        R. GREENWOOD


     the Control Box would be specifically looking for that on
     their screens.  Is that it? - A. That is right, my Lord,
     yes.
Q.         MR. GOLDSACK:  Can I just ask you one matter of detail.
     The gates at the rear of the Leppings Lane terraces on the
     lateral fences, the radial fences, did you have a respon­
     sibility in connection with those on the day of the match?
     - A. Not a direct responsibility.  I think one of my
     inspectors or the Chief Inspector may have had, so an
     indirect responsibility possibly.

Q. Now by the late morning of the match, were you generally
   touring around the inside of the ground? — A. That is
   correct.

Q. Speaking with various Officers as you did so? - A. Yes.

Q. Can I ask you in particular about Serial 1 and could we
   turn to Tab 14 and find the relevant page for that Serial.
   It is about 10 or 12 pages into Tab 14, Appendix B.
   - A. You are referring to the Operational Order?

Q. Yes.  Top right-hand corner it says "Appendix B" and
   immediately under that "Inspector Darling" with a list
   of the Officers in Serial 1 to the left? — A. Yes, Serial 1
   and 2. I have got that, yes sir.

Q. Did every Officer in Serial 1 have a radio on the day? -
   A. I can't confirm that.

Q. As I understand it a lot of those Officers were Community
   Constables? - A. Yes sir.

Q. And they would have personal issue radios? - A. That is
   correct, yes.

Q. But if they were not Community Constables, were they issued
   with a radio on the day or not? - A. I am not sure of that.

Q. Now can I direct your attention to the last three lines
   of the briefing for Phases 1 and 2, those three lines that
   are in capital letters and which refer to the perimeter
   gates? - A. Yes*

 Q. Now firstly were you aware that that had been highlighted
    in comparison with the 1988 Order where it was simply
    underlined? - A. No.

 Q. Did you give specific instructions or underline those parti­
    cular instructions to Inspector Darling and Sergeant Chapman?
    - A. No, I didn't, no.

 Q. Can I move on please to about half-past-2 because I think
    at about that stage you went to the Lpppings Lane perimeter?
    - A. Yes, it was around that time.

I think you spoke to one of the Constables, Constable
Helliwell? - A. That is correct.

Whereabouts was he at that stage? - A. He     was in the area
behind the goal, as I recall it.

What was your assessment of the filling of the terrace
at that stage? - A. Well I think it was some time later
than half-past-2.  It is very difficult to be exact.
I would have thought that that would have been nearer
to quarter—to-3 rather than half-past—2. The assessment
at that time was that I saw nothing that would concern
me.  The atmosphere in the crowd was ....

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  This is after half-past-2.
About what time? - A. I would think, my Lord, it would be
nearer quarter-to-3 but it is difficult to be exact.
In terms of the actual atmosphere   in the terracing I recall
a beach ball being flicked about.    I have since seen that
on the television, on the video, in the terraces.

      MR. GOLDSACK:   Were you conscious at that stage that
the middle pens were certainly fuller than the side pens?
- A. I may have been.   It is very difficult because I have
seen so much since to actually get true recollection, but
I think that is a likelihood, yes.

If you were conscious of that would you have considered
doing anything to alter the situation? - A. What do you
mean "Alter the situation?"  There was nothing wrong with
it.
Well if you had got a build-up in the central area would
you not consider it desirable either to ask people to move
out to the sides or make sure not too many more people
come into the middle? - A.No, I did not see anything that
concerned me at that particular time.  There was no problem
in the terracing and if I might say to you that later when
I looked at it there was not the problem that may have been
drawn out by some people even then.

Q. As you had approached the fencing how close had you had to get
     before you were aware of people being pressed up against it? -
     A. Well, I had to get very, very close to it to make the
  I assessment. I might have been aware - it is very difficult.
     You see, my judgment of it was that there was not a pitch
     invasion per s e . that there was a problem in the crowd, based
     on experience.    I can't tell you at what stage how far I was
     away from the fence when I realised that people were squeezed
     up to it.  To gain the true extent of what was there I had to
     get I think fairly close because there were some people
   1 milling about at that time.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   You mean on the pitch side of the
     fence? - A. Yes, my Lord.

Q.        MR. GOLDSACK:     When you got on to the adverting
     hoardings to look into the crowd were you conscious at that
     stage that a lot of people were in distress or injured? - A.
     Yes.  Yes, I was conscious.   I would like to be a bit more
     specific about that.  When one says "a lot", it was certainly
     the front three or four rows of people;    certainly there was
     distress there, yes.

Q. That would be what? At least a few dozen people? - A. Oh, no,
   no, more than that.   It was spread across the front of the
   pen.  It seemed to be - I think it would be fair comment to
   say right across.   It was both sides of the gate, so you were
   talking about more people than that.

Q. At what stage did you decide the match had to be stopped? - A.
    Well, my assessment of the situation was that that was
    retrievable.    There was a chance to retrieve it, and again I
    stress that that in my assessment was not a heaving, seething
    mass of people, and nothing that I have seen since has      changed
    that assessment.    It was retrievable on the basis that the
    crowd, certainly two-thirds of it were watching the match.
    There was room.    There was room for people to move back.     I
   'took at that stage the only option I thought that was open to
    » e , and that was to try and persuade the crowd, the rest of
   Ithe crowd, to move back by standing on the advertising
    hoarding.    I did it as in a pushing motion like th a t , and
    shouting at them to go back, and then pointing with those
    fingers down at the front to and illustrate to t b & m that
    there was a problem at the front of the pen.    The gate I
    believe was open at that stage.    It was impossible to get
    people through the gate.    That was the option that was
    available.    The central tunnel was clear.  That option
    did not work.

Q.   Were you near enough to the gate to see why people could not
     get out of it at that stage? - A. Oh, yes, I think I probably
     looked in the gate area when I did the initial assessment.   It
     was jammed packed.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   When you say it was retrievable,
     did you think that the people who were in those front two or
     three rows could be actually relieved and resuscitated at that
2^   '

                                                            R.L. GREENWOOD


                 stage if everyone moved back, or just that more people would
                 not be put into their plight? - A. I felt that the situation
                 was retrievable on that assessment. I think what I probably
                 didn't know at that time from what I saw later is that there
                 would bodies I think underneath, but I thought that was the
                 assessment that there was a chance to retrieve the situation
                 as far as the people that I saw at the front of the fencing.

         Q.            MR. GOLDSACK:   During the time you were attempting to
                 motion to people to move back and shouting, did you say
                 anything into the radio? - A. I can't recall.   I may well have
                 done.   I don't know.  I certainly recall broadcasting when in
                 my view the point of no return had been reached.

         Q. What did you then broadcast? - A. Well, again the sequence is
            difficult.  You have heard from Mr. Murray how it was done.
            That is exactly how it was done.  It was done like that
            (demonstrating) and it was broadcast to the extent that the
            game must be stopped and that we had potential casualties at
            that stage.

         Q. Did you consider at that stage the option of a Tannoy message?
            - A. To stop the game?

         Q. No.  You had appreciated by then the situation in pen 3? - A.
            Yes.

         Q. Were you aware that those in the control box did not know what
            the situation was? - A. No.

         Q. Did you think they could see it for themselves? - A. Yes.
            When you say "see it for themselves", I am talking about the
            general situation, yes, not the specifics.

         Q. So at all events there was no request by you for a Tannoy
            message asking people   to move back? - A. X don't think so,     but
            there was a message broadcast.

         Q. To what effect? - A. I seem to recall it coming over the
            Tannoy system to ask people to stop pushing or something to
            that effect.  It was something anyway that tied in with what I
            was trying to achieve at that time.

         q   .        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   After you began to try and achieve
                 it, you mean? - A. I can't recall, my Lord.

         q   .        MR. GOLDSACK:   Were you conscious    whether that message
                 was being received in   the terraces? - A. I don't know.  As I
                 have tried to illustrate earlier, I certainly heard it.
                 Ithink at that time I was on the advertising hoarding at a
                 higher level.   You have got to put people into the situation -
                 they certainly did not react to it, if that is what you are
                 looking for - you have got to put people into the situation of
                 what they are actually at at that particular time, what they
                 are doing.   If I can enlarge in terms of the difficulty with
                 the radio.  When you are in a cauldron of 54,000 people like
                 that you can be hearing messages on the radio that might be
                            39


                                                 R.L. GREENWOOD


     coming over.   You can hear a noise.  You won't hear what it
     is, particularly if you are actually doing something.   In
     other words, the ear cannot focus in with the eye.   You can't
     keep two channels open in that sense.   It is extremely
     difficult.   I think probably the same thing from the public
     address system.   If all is calm then one will hear, but if
     something has just scored a goal and there is an announcement
     over the public address system at a large crowd, even with the
     very effective public address system such as Old Trafford, one
     may not hear the content of the message.

Q. You signalled as you described to the control box that you
   wanted the game stopped? - A. Yes.

Q.   You then yourself ran on to the ground to stop it? -   A. Yes.

Q.    Was that simply because it became an emergency decision or
     because you realised your message may not be getting through?
     - A. No, we were then into an emergency situation.    On a scale
     out of 10 the situation might have been at something like 6-
     plus, 7, and it was very quickly moving, and we were getting
     to an extremely difficult situation, and I took that action
     unilaterally; because it was a question that we needed, if you
     like, to be able to approach - the game had to stop.

Q . Having spoken to the referee you returned immediately to the
    fencing.  Is that right? - A. Yes.

Q. I believe at some stage round about this time you saw Mr.
   Jackson? - A. Yes, I did.

Q. Can you put that in context for us? - A. Yes, I think I can.
   I went back to the fences.  The area around the gate was still
   jammed.  I moved to the left towards the south pen area.  I
   think it was somewhere in that area I saw Mr. Jackson, yes.

Q. Why had you moved towards the south pen area? - A. I think it
   was - it is unusual to see somebody from the pitch going on to
   the ground to stop a football match.   It is contrary to what
   is accepted practice.   It was a unilateral decision.  I am
   sure, and I know with hindsight, that there were Officers in
   that ground who thought it was a pitch invasion, and so I can
   only say it aust have been so that I could really get other
   people into the grips of the situation as to what was actually
   happening.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   You mean talk to other Officers? -
     A. Yes, to make sure that everybody was aware because of the
     problem with communications and what have you.

Q.        MR. GOLDSACK:   What passed between you and Mr. Jackson?
     - A. I told him we had got casualties in there, and crushing.

Q. Had you prior to speaking to Mr. Jackson broadcast for
   ambulances? - A. Again that is extremely difficult.  I do
   know, I can't say I did it specifically, I have a feeling I
   did but I can't be categoric about it, but I do know that
                           40

                                                R.L. GREENWOOD


  ambulances had been requested, and I say that because at one
  stage I was concerned that we were not getting what I thought
  would have been an appropriate medical support.  I had asked
  an Officer to get all the St. John's people, because I knew
  they were usually positioned at the corners of the ground, to
  get them there.  I remember discussing with other Officers
  about the ambulances and what have you, and then recalling
  that there are ambulances which are stationed in the area
  between the Spion Kop and the North Stand at the back.  One of
  the Officers said, "I will go for it".  So that is show it
  fits in.  I can only work it, if you like, in reverse gear, to
  say that I am satisfied that ambulances had been requested.
  It may have been me.  It may have been another Officer, but I
  had a concern about speedy effective medical support, and
  dispatched an Officer into that corner of the ground to get an
  ambulance as well.

Q. In those few minutes that must have seemed much longer,
   what did you consider effective medical support to be?
   What did you actually want? - A. I can't define to you in a
   situation like that what would be effective medical support
   at all.  It needed a response.   I have heard the word
   "fleet of ambulances" mentioned.   I think that is a fairly
   accurate description.

Q. At this stage that you are making sure ambulances are being
   called for, what is happening by the gate? - A. The gate - I
   have heard these words used - that Police Officers did
   nothing.  One of the things about this incident is a question
   of frustration, extreme frustration.   What can one do? The
   gate area was jammed.   What can one do? I have turned it over
   in my mind a thousand times since, what more could we have
   done? What more could we have done about Police officers
   standing there doing nothing? I heard yesterday, I think it
   is Mr. Jackson, accept the fact that nothing could be done.   I
   try to think to myself what more could have been done.   The
   Police Officers that worked by that fence, I have the greatest
   respect and admiration for them.   The heroics that they
   performed, I have been told by people who were in the stand
   may be unconnected with either Nottingham Forest or Liverpool,
   that they deserved a medal.   There are some horrific stories
   sir, in terms of what Police Officers experienced when they
   were resuscitating.   I am proud of then.

        There is also a large measure of frustration, frustration
   by Officers who wanted to help but couldn’t h e l p , They were
   not doing nothing.   They were there.   They were there on
   standby, that is how I would like to look at it.     If there was
   a problem they would react to it.   They couldn’t all react,
   because what could we do.   You have also got to take this on
   board.  It is difficult to talk about it in this room here,
   extremely difficult.   I have seen it before to a lower scale
   as we have talked of this morning.    Officers there are not
   seasoned, experienced Officers of 25 years' service, who can
   be emotionally troubled by i t . Some of them only have three
   or four weeks' service, sob you are also going to have the
   effect of what it was like at that fence.    It is easy for

                                                     R.L. GREENWOOD


        some to talk about it, not being there.  It was more
        difficult to do something about it, and Mr. Jackson said it
        yesterday, really.

     Q. Were you conscious of Mr. Nesbit arriving? - A. Y « e .

     Q. And I think at some stage a chain of Officers was formed by
        the gate so that those inside could be moved outside? - A.
        Yes.   We had already got Officers by that time into the crowd,
        both at the back and at the front as well.   In fact, I
        remember saying to some Officers, "Right, go in.   Now is the
        time", because again, I talked to you earlier on about the
        difficulties of putting Officers into a crowd situation.
        There was a time when it was not safe for Officers to go in
        there.   Officers went in considerably earlier than that.
        Officers went down, to the best of my recollection, down that
        side fencing and into that crowd earlier than that.   They
        certainly went in through the gate.   They put themselves at
        some risk, but I recall specifically saying, "Right, it is
        clear to some extent.   Go in", and we then formed a chain.
        Officers were I think prior to that in at the back.   By that
        time I had acquired a loud hailer and I instructed those
        Officers to take casualties, people, bodies, out through
        that rear tunnel.   We got the line of Officers there at the
        front. I broadcast to them.




                                         /There was a problem
                                             R. L. GREENWOOD



There was a problem.  The gate is not wide enough.   It
takes two Officers to a body.   They could not get through
and I used the loudhailer.   I had used it before to ask
the crowd to move back.   I used the loudhailer at that
stage to say to them - and these are the words - "Bring
the body to the gate.   Do not attempt to go through it,"
because the first Officers were struggling to get through.
"Pass the body through.   Release it.  Then go back for the
next one, and the next two Officers, bring the body to the
gate.  Do not attempt to go through the gate.   Release the
body and now go back for the next." That is how the
operation continued at the front of the pen in terms of
getting those people out and I am satisfied that that was
done as quickly as it possibly could be in the
circumstances.

When you spoke of the first Officers into the pen going in
at some risk? - A. Yes.

What is the risk that you have in mind? - A. There are two
risks really.  I stood behind that goal in the early 1980s
and saw one single Officer going into that crowd, where
somebody was sitting on a crush barrier gesticulating.
That Officer never came out.   He had to be carried out.
He was then followed by another Officer and that Officer
had to be carried out.   So that is always a potential risk
in that particular area.

     In addition to that, of course, there was the problem
of the crushing, of putting more people at risk.   It is
very difficult to assess how crowds are going to react.
One does not want to create more panic in a situation like
this, but the experience of 1981 taught me this, that once
you open the gates, you really cannot shut them.   That is
when you are getting a free flow of people through them.
It accelerates through.   You cannot stop it.  People will
see - and it is only based on experience - that there is a
way of getting on tq the pitch to secure a better view.    I
have heard people say, "If the fences were not there."   I
question that.   I have heard people say, "If they had been
cut down." I question that because my experience says to
me that the moment - and particularly with a situation
like this, where the crowd were not apparent what was
happening at the front - in my view, the moment that you
give egress on to the pitch, you are going to create a
dangerous situation because people, in my view and based
on that experience of 1981, will continue to come and if -
it has troubled me.   I have heard it mentioned about
cutting gear.  Should that have been something that I had
really considered at an early stage?   I am satisfied that
that was not the answer at all.   I mean, I do not know
what sort of cutting gear is available, but that terracing
there is below the level of the perimeter and those people
that were trapped at the front, some of whom got out,

                                                               E. L. GREENWOOD



                   incidentally - they did not all die along that fencing.
                   Some of them got out, but they were trapped.  Imagine the
                   consequences, if you could, of what a stampede of people
                   from the back may have been like if that had happened, and
                   my reaction, in hindsight, is that there could have been
                   greater catastrophe than what we had on this occasion, the
                   reasons for which I do not understand.

              Q. You mentioned, Hr. Greenwood, that at a relatively early
                 stage you acquired a loudhailer? - A. Yes.

              Q. Do you know where from? - A. I do now because I have seen
                 it on the video.  An Inspector.  I got it from an
                 Inspector.

              Q. Was that effective, a loudhailer, within the limited area
                 where you were? - A. Well, it was certainly effective as
                 far as the Police Officers were concerned, in terms of the
                 recovery operation, yes.  When you say "effective", is it
                 because people want to react to something or is it the
                 effectiveness of the actual equipment?   I do not know.

              Q. I think, in fact, on the day you had difficulties with the
                 first loudhailer and a second one was obtained? - A.  Yes,
                 that is right.  Yes, at some stage, but I do not think it
                 was from point one that it was faulty.

              Q. Now,   I think at some stage - again you may be able to help
                   to put a. tine to it - you instructed another Officer to,
                   in effect, remain with you at all times? - A. Yes,   I did.

              Q.    Can you help as to the stage at which you did that? - A.
                   I thinkit was about half-past three.   It was  about the
                   time when the rescue operation was completed from the
                   pen.

              Q. And what was your purpose in doing that? - A. The
                 difficulties in broadcasting.  I then had to turn my
                 attention to we have got a stadium full here of 54,000
                 people and we have got people on the pitch, etc., etc.,
                 and I wanted that continuity in terms of broadcasting and
                 any action that I wanted to take as well

              Q. Hr. Nesbitt had joined you on the pitch at some stage? -
                 A. Yes.

              Q.    Had you been conscious of any other senior Officers on the
                   pitch during this 20 minutes or so? - A. No.    There are
                   people who will tell me that they were there and they will
                   say, "We said this to you or that to you." One cannot
                   recall everything.    I cannot recall them.

              Q. Can you recall whether or not you had any communication
                 with the Control Koom between about quarter-past and
                                               R. L. GREENWOOD



half-past three? - A. I certainly had communication with
the Control Room at one stage because I enquired as to Hr.
Duckenfield’s location.  I was not successful on - I think
I probably made two calls and I think it was on the third
one that I was told he was in the Sheffield Wednesday
Boardroom, yes.

And I think,   in fact, you did go and join him there? - A.
Yes.

A decision was made that the game should be abandoned? -
A.  I did not see him there.  I am sorry.

Where did you see him? - A. I did not see him there.   He
had already left the Boardroom.  There were only other
people in there.

I think you then came across Hr. Kelly, the Football
Association gentleman, who was doing a television
interview? - A. Yes, Hr. Kelly was in the tunnel, being
interviewed by Desmond Lynam.  They were being subjected
to abuse in their general direction from supporters on the
pitch and....

I think you suggested that being curtailed? - A. Yes.

     HR. GOLDSACK:    Yes, thank you, Hr. Greenwood.

               Cross-examined by HR. HYTNER:

     HR. HYTNER:   Can I go back to the beginning of your
evidence, Hr. Greenwood? Your problem with technology to
improve communications.  Has it occurred to you since the
tragedy that it is not modern technology that you needed,
but rather older technology, that was, indeed, used by you
on the day and is used every day of the summer on cricket
fields? That is, a simplified and crude form of
semaphore.  Has that ever been considered, other than the
specific signal that you used for indicating that the
match should be stopped? - A.  Semaphore in respect of
what, sir?




                               /Q. Signalling messages.
                                     R. GREENWOOD


Signalling messages, that is just as an umpire does not
shout that there is a six or a leg-bye or a four, but
gives a prearranged signal, just as you did not shout to
stop the match but used a signal, that if it is necessary
in conditions of noise to indicate that one pen is full
or that crowds should move from one place to another, that
you can do so by signalling to the Police Control Box?
- A. I think there is a distinction between the cricket
umpire situation because he is signalling to the crowd as
such.

No he is not, he is signalling to a Control Box, a score­
board? - A. But the crowd as well so that the crowd can
understand what the actual decision is.   It is certainly
something that I have not considered.   I would have thought
that the signals that I gave ...  I don't know, you are
talking about crowd reactions as well.

No, no. What I am putting to you, and it seems it is not
being considered but it is being received in a friendly
fashion by you, is that if it is foreseen that it is
going to be difficult to give certain specific indications
by radio, that is that you need the crowd to move from
left to right or such and such a pen is full, or that there
is a hooligan in Pen 3, that sort of thing, disorder, crowd
pressure, that you can have a prearranged signal just as
the umpire has, to indicate to Police Control what the
situation is on the ground? - A. I have certainly not
considered it.  I would have thought that the signals I
used are natural and one does not have to ....

IS it worth considering for the future to overcome the
problem of noise interfereing with radio communication?
- A . It bears thought but little thought in my view.

      MR. HYTNER*.   Well, there is a modest success with
the question.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   The suggestion is for example,
it seems that in the Control Box they just did not know
what the trouble was.   It might have been a pitch invasion,
pretty unlikely because nobody was going on the pitch.
People might have been wanting to get a better view or
it might have been crushing.   I think the suggestion may
be if you   know there is going to be    a hell of alot of
noise, it   may not get through on the radio, foil® or five
options as to what signal you might give.   Like overcrowding,
crushing might have a special signal which would Instantly
go to the Control Box.   I don't know, is that a sensible
suggestion or not? - A. I can think of one better sir, I
think, in   that respect as far as my    position isconcerned.

Please tell us? -    A. If I was to go     through thesame
situation again I    would do what I did at half-past-3 much
earlier, and that    is have somebody who was with me who was
able to carry out    my instructions and inform other people
as well.
                                   R. GREENWOOD


Given that you can't get through on the radio, does that
mean he has got to be a runner or what? - A. Not necessarily,
no.  I mean the situation that I found myself in at that
particular time was trying to do so much and the question
of deputing.  I think he even on the radio would have been
in a position to possibly move away and concentrate on the
radio broadcast, whereas that was something that really
was beyond me at that particular time.

Because you had to give other instructions and so on? -
A. Yes.
      MR. HYTNER:  I was not just thinking about you,
Superintendent, I am thinking of an Inspector or a Sergeant
on the perimeter fence who wants to communicate with Control
that there is a spot of bother, there is a drunk or a
hooligan in a pen, or that there is overcrowding in a pen,
simple signals? - A. There may be simple signals that could
be brought in. When I said "thought" and possibly "little
thought" I think the danger is that one might have too
many signals    and then confusion arising from that.

Well umpires and scoreboards seem to get along all right
and there are signals that cricket captains have to direct
their players around the field without shouting at them.
Other people do it. Anyway, it is worth thinking about?
- A . It bears thought, yes.

Can I now deal with the situation in Pens 3 and 4 when    you
saw them at 2.30. - A. No, it was after 2.30.

I am sorry, nearer 2.45.  I beg your pardon. We have
evidence that has been given to the Inquiry and a great
deal more evidence in statements that has not actually
been given orally, that by about 2.45/2.50, and I think
the first time I can think of is just about 2.50, the
position in Pens 3 and 4 was uncomfortable.   By the time
the teams were announced or shortly after the teams were
announced which we think is 2.51, there was a great deal
of discomfort.  Now that of course was about five minutes
or so, may be ten minutes after you saw the pens, so I
am not going to be unfair and suggest to you that when you
saw the pens they were full to capacity, but by the time
you saw them there was not much room for more spectators
in Pens 3 and 4, was there? - A. At the time when I looked
over the fencing responding to the incident?

Yes. No, no, about 2.40/2.45? - A. I beg your pardon.      At
the time that I saw them they were certainly not in my
view uncomfortable ....

That is specifically in fairness to you what I did not put.
What I am suggesting is that they were getting near to
capacity and must have been if there was discomfort five
minutes or so later? - A. I cannot say what happened five
                                  R. GREENWOOD


minutes later.  They were fairly full.  There was room.   In
fact I said earlier on in terms of responding to the incident
that in my view there was room for the crowd to move back
even at that time.

Mr. Greenwood, what I am really asking you about is this:
you don't wait till a problem has occurred, you anticipate
it, that is the point of monitoring a crowd, isn't it? -
A. Yes, yes.
By 2.40 or 2.45 when you saw the pens there may have been
room for a few more but it was getting full? — A. There
was room for more people and my assessment based at 2.45
and at the time when I looked over the fence at the time
of the tragedy, I did not see it as much different.

Well x will have to come and ask you about that in a moment
or so.
      What did you think were the arrangements on the tunnel
side, that is the concourse side of the pens, for preventing
further spectators getting into Pens 3 and 4 when they did
become full? What did you understand was the arrangement?
- A. I did not know of the arrangement in terms of what
would happen if they got full.

You were the Ground Commander? - A. Yes.

Suppose at 2.45 it had been your view, and these are always
only valued judgments, aren't they, but if it had been your
view that the pens were full and that further spectators
coming in would cause danger, what would you have done about
it? - A. I would have ensured that Police Control were aware
of that, but I would have expected them to be aware of it
before me.
The answer to my next question may be that it was not your
business, but did you have any idea what they would then do
about it to prevent further spectators coming into Pens 3
and 4? - A. No, my understanding is that the Control Box
can view those pens and they co-ordinate that situation.

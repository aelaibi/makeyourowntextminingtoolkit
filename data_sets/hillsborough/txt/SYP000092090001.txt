               seated with               various            members        of     our    contingent             in the         2nd       row      of    seats

               j u st    to    the       right        of     the     goal       posts.           On    taking       up my         position             I had a

               c lear      view         of    the     Leppings            Lane     stanciing a r e a a n d              I could           see      that        the

               supporters               in the        central          penned         ar e a ,    directly          behind          the      goal.




               My    first       reaction             on     seeing        this       was    one       of   concern           for      the     fans      wh o         I

               could       see w e r e          being        c rushed agai ns t              the       fj x f n t per i m e t e r        fencs.          One

               man      in p a r t i c u l a r        was     drawn        to m y a t t e n t i o n         wh o    had       been       turned         round

      ^        completely               u n til     his      -Face     was      looking          up    towards         the                stand,              rii ■

               a kout      m i d 2 0 v s , nysdiurn l & j j d q t b             dark; hair.             He w a s       clean        shaven,

               obviously            m        g^eat      distress.               His     complexion           was       ch a l k     white         and    his

         1 and        other        spectators             shouted        to     the      f a ns    at      the    back        of    the     ce n t r a l

        By     t hi s    t im e     I was          aware     the     garne had           commenced            but my a t t e n t i o n            wa s

        not      on     the       game.           My ma in    concern was                for      the      supporters              below.         As     I

        looked          down       I would          estimate         the      time       to    be a b o u t       15Q4        hrs    (1504),

        when      due        to    the m a s s i v e        pressure          on the          front        crush      barrier         in p en 3 ;

        t he     barrier           gave       way    and     literally 20 - 3G                     f an s     fell       forward about                 2’

              w hi ch      cove r e d serials             1, 2 and 3.          In broad terms these              serials

              in charge            of serial         1.      This    serial consisted         of      20 C o n s t a b l e s who

             were       detailed         to work          round the     perimeter       track.        These      officers were

              particular              gates    for    individual        officers.         This       I left to PS Chapman,

              th o u g h    I understand             that these       officers work          in the same           position

             each week.               S e rg ea nt C ha p m a n then took          his serial         onto     the      perimeter

« *At   1035 am     I spoke          to the whole        of the serial          2 in the N o r t h Stand.

  I went       through     the details           of the m a t c h order,          leaving      the    sergeants

  to    identify officers              for    particular       duties.        1' s t r e s s e d to these

  officers       that    they        needed to be fully aware                of the     eme r g e n c y

  evacuation       p r ocedures and             pointed out        to them the        fact    that        the    upper

  section of the S ou th S tand was made m a i n l y of timber and a n y                                   risk of

  fire was       greatest at           that    end.

  At    1110 am     I spoke          to the whole        of serial       in the upper          level       of the

  S outh S tand w h i ch was where that                    serials      duties were.          The     briefing

  was    the   same as      for Serial           2, a g a i n the S e r geant        having     the

  r e s p o n s i b i l i t y of giving       individual       o f f icers    their     p a rticular        duties

  in line wit h         the order.

  At    1120 am    I    brie f e d     the stewards        who were work i n g         in   the S o u t h Stand

  both upper and          lower        levels.        This   took     place     in the upper          level       of

  the S outh Stand.             1 e xp la i n e d     to the      stewards     the    proce d u r e s      to be

  ■followed in the          event         of an e me rg e n c y    e v a c u a t i o n after w h i c h     1 a sked

  if there wre an y queries                   or doubts.          T here were      none.      I reminded

  them that their           duties were            in the S o u t h S tand w h i c h was          constructed

  m a i n l y of wood and        that any          l ik e l i h o o d of a fire      in the g r o u n d was

  greatest at the end.                    I e xp la i n e d that a capacity           crowd was           expected

  an d that safety was               of    paramount       importance and that              it was        essential

  that    the stewa r d s a n d Police must work                    in close       liaison.          If there

  was any hint of any                problems       they were       told to      contact a Police

  Officer      of w h i c h there were over 20 w o r k i n g                 in that     stand.           1 asked

  the stewards          if they had any q u e s t i o n s          or    a n t i c i p a t e d a n y problems at

  that stage.           Two    problems were             i d e n t i f i e d by stewards who hd w o r k e d

                was made           by someone               in there that                 there were              12,000         in the ground at

                that       time,         and at         the      same    time        the    previous year                   there     had been

                20,000        in the            ground.

                S o m e t i m e a ro u n d 2 pm               <1400)       I noticed              problems were                  being     experi e n c e d

                w ith my          radio.             There was an           i n t e r mittent                 buzzing       type     noise w hich

                made       re c e p t i o n very            poor and di f f i c u l t                   to understand.               At this         time   I

                had an earpiece                      e xt en s i o n    in use.            I took             this off       but     it made         no

                difference.                    I rriactfe my way to the                   "tunnel'             and spoke with

                Superintendent                   G r e e n w o o d and S e r g e a n t Chapman.                           They    c o n firmed that

                they were               e x p e r ie nc in g      similar           problems.                 Inspector H a r v e y         joined us

                a nd made          similar            comment.           He then st a t e d that                      he w o u l d , g o    to the

                about        to go         I saw one of the                 radio          te c h n i c i a n s walk i n g along                the

                perimeter               track        towards me.            He was wit h a Police Officer,                                  I believe

                crowd had               con t i n u e d     to    rise and the              noise             they were          creating was

  suppo r t e r s               in that                section.          I then made rny way to the                      players         tunnel

  The    time was                            just    about 3 pm and the game                      ready to start.                 I was

  unaware at that                                  time    that    there       were or had been any                   problems with

  supporters                    outs i d e             the      ground at       the L e p p i n g s Lane         end.         I am not

  sure      if this was                             due    to    continued        int e r f e r e n c e    on the       radio      or the

  volume        of noise                           g e ne ra te d by the        crowd.        I think         .it was        probably a

  c o m b in a t i o n of the two.                                The    game     had been u n d erway               for a few minutes

and    I was (
             a bout             to take my       place       just    inside      the tunnel         w hen     I looked

towards         the L e p p in gs       Lane    terracing and            saw what a p p e a r e d       to    be some

sort     of     com m o t i o n   taking       place    i m m e d i a t e l y behind the        goal.         I made

my way         round to that            location,       Supt.       G r e e n w o o d was    some 20 yards           in

front       of me,        and there were             other    o f f icers      either       there     or making

there w ay there.                 When       I got to the       s e c t i o n of the         terrace     to the

S ou t h side         of the      centre       I could see          there were        people        crushed up

a g ai n s t    the      perimeter       fencing.        Some were          o b v i o u s l y unconscious,           man y

others         clearly         could not move at all,                a n d were     having      difficulty

breathing.               The    gate w hi ch gave access               to this      pen was         open and

o f f icers were              tyring    to    pull    people     through.          I went      to the gate and

tried       to assist           but    the gate was          so narrow         that only a          certain number

of officers              could be effective,             o t herwise        we were         simply getting           in

eac h others way,,                Just       inside    the    gate     I could see           that     injured

people were              piled on top of each other,                     unable     to move.           Police

O f f ic er s were            pulling    them out and onto               the    perimeter       track,        but this

was    proving           d if fi c u l t y as man y of the           injured       in this      pile     of    bodies

just     inside          the    gate were       u nc on sc i o u s a n d    unable      to assist        themselves

in any way.                  I stood    on the a d v e r t i s i n g    boards      on the      perimeter t rack

an d shouted to the                   crowd further          back to       push b a c k w a r d s .     The mood          of

a large         s ec t i o n of this          crowd was angry,             and they were            shouting abuse

back at me.               Some    fans       on the outside          of the      central       pen m a n a g e d     to

climb over            the metal         fence    into    the outer          pen and         I remember        that

there was          suffi c i e n t      room    in the       outer     pen for them to              climb down

from the         fence         fairly easily.           Some    officers         had made       their way           into

this     outer        pen an d were a s si st i n g           people       over.      Depsite         this    there

                   where     other     officers,       St.      Joh n A m b u l a n c e     staff and       others were

                   attending        to them.         O nly slowly as the dead and                       injured were        brought

                   onto     the    pitch did        it becomfe s l i g h t l y easier              to bring more        from the

                   terrace,        t hr ou gh the     gate and onto              the      pitch.    I alternated        between

                   perimeter        fencing.         I lost all t rack              of time as this           con t i n u e d until

                   the     central     sect i o n of the terrace                 had been      cleared.        During       this

                   time     I cannot      recall      having       heard an y          radio messages,         but     the noise

                   f rom    the gro u n d was        deafening.            When     the     terrace was       clear     tft-ere were

                   many of the         fans    o b vi ou sl y     in a very d i s t r e s s e d stat#,           some were

                   crying     together        in groups,         others were              shouting abuse       at Police

                   officers - some a bu s e was                 d i r ected at blaming Police O f f i c e r s                for

                   what     had happened.            That    criticism was always                   directed     in the      terms

                   " I t ’s your      fault,    you     should have             given      us more      tickets'.

                   I became a wa r e        that     a police         cordon had been formed                 towards the Spion

                   After     the    pitch was        cleared       I did not assist                in any    particular         duty.

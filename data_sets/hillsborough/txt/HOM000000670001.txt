     didn't       seem to fas m u c h a ct ivity             by the        police but w hen                the game was

     s topped        I saw the          police and others            trying       tcs ;pul 1 and          r i p at     the

 w h i ch      ran down       the     terrace          from the top to the pitch,- this did not

 a l l ow      the    people       to spread           out at    the    sides.     Also    there appeared' to

  be a lack           of signs at the rear                 of    the s tand to      inform     people-: tnat you

  could reach the                 standing area by going ar ou nd each end of                         the stand

 and not only t h r ou gh the tunnel.                            I had been to the          ground    before ana

  did    not         know the other way -in.                    Before    the    fnat.cn s tarted     Isaw    tne

  gradually           leaving        the area and then the                rush started.

  In my opinion,              being a telephone                 engineer,       there was    c ertainly not

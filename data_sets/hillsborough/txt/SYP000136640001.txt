Dear Sir,

Re: VISUAL EVIDENCE - HILLSBOROUGH INQUESTS

With reference to your letter of the 27th November 1990 we write to confirm
that we will require hard copies of acetates produced as visual evidence for
the inquests.

We would be grateful if these can be handed to our representative as they
become available and if we could be invoiced at the end of the proceedings
for the total number of copies received.

Yours faithfully.

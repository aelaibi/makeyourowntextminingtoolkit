quite       full.         We    d ec i d e d to m o v e       to the        right       (looking at         the     pitch)

Occasional           groans        of    pain w ere          heard.         I specifically mentioned                       to r.

brought         no    response        in terms            of a c t i o n    from the           police.

this.



The    game      started.           I didn't          feel      any     surge      in terms         of m o v e m e n t         -

"Get    back,         get    back."            This       was   im p o s s i b l e ,    we were all             pinned

stationary            by the       pressure        from front,              sides       and back.

At     no t ime       at H i l l s b o r o u g h    did      I realise          people     had died          in the

tunnel.          At    no time        did    I see a n y t h i n g         to s u b s t a n t i a t e     claims      that

policemen were                assaulted        or    bodies         were    looted.          I saw        brava     young

fans     trying        to save        lives        hopelessly.             I s a w brave        lads       organise

themselves            to make m a k e s h i f t       stret c h e r s       to    carry the          dead.        I saw

some     p o l i ce    desperately           t r y in g      to    save lives.           I also         saw s o m a    pcl’ic*.

standing         idly -          not k no wi ng      what         was    happening       or m a k i n g     a n y attempt,

to f i nd o u t .



I did not           see     at    any time         any fan         (whether       before       or    after     the     brief

game)     misbehave              deliberately         in a n y ‘.'.'ay.



After      the      g ame    had     been a b a n d o n e d we           left the      ground        via the        centre

s ec t i o n   on     the    tunnel.         Remembering                the fan we       had    resuscitated            I

gave     a p o l i c e m a n my       name     and    address.             I felt      it v e r y       unlikely       that

he o/ould h a v e           s u r v i v e d -and r e c o n c i l e d my s e l f      by the         fact    that      if he

had he w o u l d          have     bee n b r a in     damaged.

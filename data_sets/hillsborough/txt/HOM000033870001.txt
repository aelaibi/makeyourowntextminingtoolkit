       I am writing in reply to your recent letter to Roger Law in the BBC’s Legal
       Department. You asked about the BBC’s likely attitude to putting the untransmitted
       tapes of the Hillsborough disaster into the public domain.

       Our attitude throughout the last eight years has been that, while we are, of course,
       very ready to make the untransmitted material available to any official Inquiries and
       for legal proceedings, the nature of the material is such that we do not wish to make it
       publicly available.

       The tapes deal with the moment of death of very many people and with the horrific
       nature of that death. For this reason, the BBC has chosen not to transmit the material
       and for the same reason we would not agree to making it publicly available.

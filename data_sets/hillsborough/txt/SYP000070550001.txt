we    parked but we were                  d ir e c t e d there       by Police Officers.

At    no time         did    I see any drunkenness,                    fighting     or disorder        on my way

people       in towards           the     turnstil/s,          the    numbers      of    people were        causing a

or s tewards           giving       d ir ec t i o n s     outside     the turnstiles.           At    one    point we

saw a child about                 10 yrs      old who had been s e p a ra te d from his                     father,

he was       getting         crushed and          so my b r o t h e r - i n - l a w and     I linked arms           to

put a barrier a ro u n d                   him to       protect him.          We m a n a g e d to get him

towards         the wall         out of the      crush and he              was taken from us by another

man who was            going      to       stay wit h him. At this point                  in time we were

knew     that was          the way to go.

W hi ls t      o utside     the gr ou nd       I did wito^ss a number                of fans        climbing           over

the wall         between the          two sets              turnstiles,        not   giving       in their

tickets,         gaining      unauthorised            entry.

Once     inside the g r o u n d , b e t w e e n          the t urnstiles and my m a t c h                   viewing

 signs pointing the way.

 I went down the tunnel to get                                     viewing    point,      access was          quite

easy and         I had a free          passage along               it.

T he re were         no Police       or /S te wa rd s       evident at        this   point.

Once     in the ground             I saw no-one          drinking alcohol            and      I saw no fighting

or d i s o rd e rl y       conduct.

I went         th rough     the    tunnel     and took         up my viewing         point.

                was    too bad.         I was       in it,    it was    terrible.             I had trouble         breathing,

                at one     point my feet              were    not touching I h e           ground.        I felt a      surge       in

              I. think my main bone              o f x f o n t e n t i o n was      the    lack of         cajrfTral

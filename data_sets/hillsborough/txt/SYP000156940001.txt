Dear

Hillsborough

Although, as my Secretary recently confirmed, your name does not
appear on the list of witnesses issued by the Coroner, I understand
from remarks which he made when I was not present at the Inquest
late last week that his present intention will be to call you as a
witness towards the end of the Inquest, i.e. after all the lay
evidence has been given.

I was not aware of these remarks until reviewing the transcript of
the present hearing.

As you would not be being called as "our" witness but rather as an
independent expert, it is unlikely that you will be notified via
this firm.

In order to enable you to plan your future timetable, the sensible
course might be to make direct contact with Mervyn Jones, now D.C.C.
of Cheshire, who is acting as the Coroner's Officer.  Even he will
not be able to give a precise date at this stage nor, I suspect,
will he be able to confirm that you will certainly be called.  On
the other hand, he will be better informed on both counts than I am.

I hope all goes well with you.

Inrelation   to    Mr.    Stalker's       experience,   the    following

questions might be put to him:



1.    Have you ever had operational command at a football game?



2.    Have you ever attended a football match in uniform?



3.    Have a ever taken part in planning for a major football

      venture?



4.    Is it the case that your normal custom was to watch the

      football games at Old Trafford and Main Road                  from    the

      Director's box where you had concessionary seats?



5.    Have   you     ever     attended      any    meeting    within       your

      professional association in relation to the policing of

      football?



6.    Have   you   ever     been   in    uniform   command    of   any   crowd

      situation?



(Mr. Stalker should have to concede that he has never attended

a football match in uniform, that he has never had command at

a football match and that he regularly watched the game from

the Director's     box,   usually       in the company of his wife Mrs

       Stalker).

2.   Paragraph 10



     John   Stalker's         observation      that    there        is no mention in the

     operational        order    concerning        closure     of     the    Penistone        Road

     turnstiles,        nor    advice to the officers at the Leppings Lane

     End turnstiles of the consequences,                     is a misunderstanding of

     what   the     operational        order would be           likely      to     include.         I

     doubt whether         Mr.   Stalker has had             knowledge       of    operational

     orders   for       football matches;           in my time he was never given

     one, nor did he ever ask for one.                  To suggest that officers in

     Leppings     Lane        would    not    be    aware      of     "probable,         or   even

     possible     congestion          ..."    is    ridiculous.        All       the     officers

     policing     the game       knew the          strategy    and knew that Leppings

     Lane would have to accommodate all the Liverpool supporters.



3.   In paragraph 12 Stalker states that he                         could    not    recall         an

     instance      of    more     than       600    officers        being    deployed         at        a

     football match:



     On 15th April, 1989, 872 officers were deployed at an FA Cup

      Semi-final     replay between Liverpool and Manchester United at

     Maine Road.        There were 45,775 supporters who attended.



4.   Paragraphs 13,           14 and 15 do not make a point.                       Mr.    Stalker

      criticises     the      deployment in Leppings Lane but does not say

     what should have been done as an alternative.                          So far as I can

      see the men were available, in good time and in a position to

      police the crowd as they arrived, what else did he expect?                                    He
                                     -3-



also raises the point of a strategy to deal with non ticket

holders near to the ground.                This sort of secondary perimeter

was widely criticised at Heysel Stadium.                    Mr. Stalker suggests

there were too many policemen but a secondary filter cordon in

Leppings Lane would have required perhaps                        hundreds more     men

and   some    scheme    to    stop encroachment via Vere Road and the

River Don Valley.            Traditionally any          checks,     in relation     to

forged tickets and whatever, are done at the turnstiles.                         Very

few fixtures are all ticket fixtures and I have not known of

the   sort of    arrangements            Mr.    Stalker refers to in the five

years I was responsible for policing fixtures in the Greater

Manchester area.



Chief Superintendent Mole in evidence adequately explains his

decision      to dispense         with    the    aircraft       in 1989.   In short,

"The need for it in 1988 was minimal.                     It had no purpose that

was of beneficial value at that time                     .... "      (Transcript   of

Evidence 4/4).



The suggestion of Mr.             Stalker that all supporters be checked

to identify non-ticket holders has                    some precident,      in 1987.

At    that    semi-final      a    similar       exercise was conducted      albeit

further      from the    ground      at        the   motorway     interchange.     The

outcome was serious delays and a delayed kick off as a direct

result.       The alternative method was                 used to good effect        in

1988 and      it is not surprising therefore that it was used again

in 1989.

5.   Paragraph 16



     Whilst          Mr.     Stalker's       suggestion          sounds    neat     it        is    not

     realistic.             Mr.    Stalker     suggests      there    should       have       been     a

     control system all along Leppings Lane to develop queues from

     the earliest.            In fact, until quite late, on there is no great

     pressure at the turnstiles and such queueing as is necessary

     is    achieved.              Thereafter    the       conduct    of   the     crowd        is     so

     turbulent that they will not queue.                         You cannot force a crowd

     to queue          if    they will       not     do    so,   in such    an     unstructured

     environment.             With    a normal        football crowd the horses would

     have been able to achieve reasonable queuing from the gates at

     the    rear       of    the west stand out into Leppings Lane.                           I have

     never known the police use lengthy barrier systems to achieve

     queuing.          Queuing is achieved by direction and co-operation.

     It would be a good question to ask Mr.                           Stalker when he has

     seen barrier            systems for queuing in place.                   I have enquired

     with the Police responsible for Manchester United, Manchester

     City,       Totenham,           Millwall,        Sunderland,         Leeds,     Newcastle,

     Chelsea,         Arsenal,       Liverpool,      Everton.        Whilst some of                these

     make use of these barriers to effect road closures, none use

     them       to    confront        queues.        The     inherent      danger        of        their

     instability is widely acknowledged.



6.   As    to   the        number of men in Leppings Lane,                 on Mr.     Stalker's

     calculation            over     two   hundred        were   still    available           in     the

     general vicinity regardless of the serials he refers to.                                       The
                                          -5-



     deployent of the serials he does refers to seem to have been

     appropriate,       in that they were policing              junctions        and other

     locations on the route of Liverpool supporters.



     Serials       36/37     comprising    18      mendid not      remain    at Wadsley

     Bridge Station, but escorted                  fansfrom the train to Leppings

     Lane where they remained.              Only three officers, a sergeant and

     two police constables from Serial 37 did not get to Leppings

     Lane.     They were diverted on route to deal with a disturbance

     at a public house.



7.   Paragraph 18



     I will take issue with Mr.                 Stalker's remarks with regard to

     use of flow rate information.                  If you are filling the ground

     pen by pen you will certainly monitor this - in the event they

     were not.        I do not believe that ground commanders watch this

     information unless they are filling the ground on that basis.

     They may pay some attention to it on the basis that if they

     expect        40,000   and only      20,000    have   arrived    then       they   will

     maintain officers in outsideposts for a long period and so on

     but     the    suggestion     that    judgingflow     rates     as      a   guide    to

     deployment is a regular issue is in my opinion plain wrong.



8.   I have    dealt        with   the arguments      regarding      late kick-off,        I

     would ask Mr. Stalker how many times he has                     been aware of         a

     delayed kick-off at Old Trafford.
                                                  -6-



9.      Paragraph 19



        In relation to paragraph 19 I would ask Mr. Stalker whether he

        would accept           that    Chief      Superintendent          Duckenfield had more

        operational experience of policing football matches than Mr.

        Stalker himself had.



10.     Paragraph 20



        My report discusses this in detail.                         The key question to put

        to    Mr.     Stalker        relates      to    the     ability      of   someone     in   the

        command post           to bring to mind the configuration of gangways

        and entrances at the rear of the stadium.                          It would be nice to

        ask     Mr.      Stalker      if    he is        confident      he    could   recall       and

        describe the number of entrances to the Kippax stand at Main

        Road in the event of the gates being opened there.



11.     Mr. Stalker describes              the decision to 'close the tunnel' as a

        "simple and obvious"               one, and that there was adequate time in

        which       to   have    done       it.    Mr.    Duckenfield did not               take   the

        decision         to   open    the gates         until    2.52     p.m.     This     decision

        would not have           been      a consideration before                 the decision to

        open the gates.              By then, time was pressing and the danger of

        fatalities at the turnstiles seemed imminent.

 Thank you for your letter dated 20 September including your comprehensive
 report and related annexes. Thank you also for sight of Mr Stalker's telling
 evidence.

 I have also noted the comment in your second paragraph in which you refer to
 Lord Justice Taylor's interim report. I have not yet had chance to have a look
 at the relevant sections and give you m y opinion but I will do in the near
 future and respond.

 In the meantime, best wishes,

Dear Mervyn,

       Thank you for your recent letter and enclosures.       As promised
here is a copy of our final report and of Mr. Stalker's telling evidence.

       I wonder if I could ask your opinion of what is meant by
paragraph 75 of Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report.   He seems to say
in the same paragraph that the vital moment corresponds with the surge
when Beardsley hits the bar (3.04 p.m.). He goes on to say I am sure it
occurred after the influx from Gate C (2.52 p.m.) This all seems highly
ambiguous to me and is very relevant to his conclusions.     Have you a
view as to what he meant?

                              Yours sincerely.

Dear Peter,

       Thank you for your letter of the 12th September.   I am content that
my report should be handed over to Mervyn Jones and I take it that you will
arrange that.

       I visited Hillsborough with Inspector McGahan on Tuesday last and I
think the visit was valuable both to re-acquaint myself with the ground and
to clarify some of our observations.   In particular, a walk round the back
of all four stands was extremely interesting in that it supports my
observations in the report that there are many gangways, stairways, tunnels,
corridors and the like, such that the ability of anyone to bring to mind an
immediate mental picture of a particular aspect would be in doubt.     A lot
turns on this point as for example the glib way in which John Stalker
presumes it would have been a routine decision to secure the tunnel. I can
of course give evidence to this effect although I did consider taking
photographs or video but as you observed it is probably too late in the
day. As a matter of interest Superintendent Sleath, who seems an impressive
man and has a thorough knowledge of the ground was unable to tell me on his
recollection how many entrances to the north west terrace there were on the
far side of the wall which has been knocked down.     He has spent a lot of
time looking at this area and without any discredit to him was wrong in his
estimate of the number of ways onto the terracing.      He himself made the
point that it showed just how difficult it was to bring to mind the
configuration behind the terracing.
                                   - 2 -

        We have examined the angle of view with the camera used        in the
compilation obtained and can illustrate it on the diagram.    Less than half
of the concourse area is covered but it is interesting     to    note thattothe
extreme right of the picture in what would be a direct line between       the-
tunnel entrance and the turnstile there are people standing about and the
general line of movement is as much towards the gap in the wall        as the
tunnel.   I feel this vindicates our observations in the report.   I attach a
copy of our expenses.

                             Yours sincerely.

Dear

Hillsborough

You may have heard that the Coroner intends to resume the Inquests
into the deaths at Hillsborough on 19th November, in effect,
immediately after the civil proceedings are timed to conclude.

The Senior Officers concerned with this matter at South Yorkshire
are very keen that a copy of your report should be made available to
the Coroner's Officer.

It seems to me that, as the report has now been exchanged with the
Defendants in the civil proceedings and will be put in evidence at
the civil trial, it is effectively in the public domain, but I
should be grateful for your formal consent before sending a copy of
the report to the Coroner's Officer who, as you may know, is Mervyn
Jones, now Deputy Chief Constable of Cheshire.


Yours sincerely,




Peter <

Dear Belinda,

       I enclose a copy of our account in respect of the visit to your
offices last Tuesday.

       I am considering covering some issues in a statement from Mr.
Gosling and if that seems to be appropriate when I have examined the
documentation, I will go ahead and see him.

       The amendments to the report will be in hand shortly and I will
forward amended copies as soon as they are ready.

                              Yours sincerely.

        I forward for your information a draft of my inquiry and report on
the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster of 15 April 1989.

         I also include a copy of a report by Chief Inspector Paul TEASDALE
whom I regard as probably the most experienced mounted officer in the
country.

        Within my report I refer to two appendicess-

        (i)    Photographs of the Kop taken at ’1000 person’ intervals;

        (ii) Video - a     compilation   of   crowd   scenes   inside   and   outside
             grounds.

        The    photographs were produced by Merseyside (Job No. 1020/90) and at
the   moment   I do not have sufficient copies to supply one to you.      It is
likely that    your own football liaison officer will already have a copy, if
not, please    advise and I will forward when available.

        The video is not yet ready, again I will forward a copy assoon             as
is practicable.

                                Yours sincerely.

Dear

       I now forward a second draft of my report, which varies only in
the grammatical sense from the first.

       I also include a copy of Chief Inspector TEASDALE'S report, which
should be considered a draft too and the only set of photographs which I
have, and refer to as an appendix.   I am now awaiting additional copies
and propose to bring them with me when we meet.

                             Yours sincerely.

I enclose for your perusal a copy of my report on the Hillsborough
disaster which I    venture at this stage as a draft.  I refer to two
appendices, one a collection of photographs and the other a video
collage.   I will have copies specially packaged and sent on when they
are available.

I have made enquiries with the investigating team and suffice it to say
my observations, so far as I am able to judge, are on all fours with
their report to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I trust you will
keep this information in confidence but as Assistant Chief Constable
Jones probably knows more of the details of this affair than anyone
else, I take itas comforting to know there is at least no       factual
discrepancy between his account and mine.

I am not familiar  with the civil courts and of course my report contains
a blend of recapitulation and opinion.    I amquite happy to be advised
if the balance is not appropriate.   I attach hereto a memorandum of my
expenditure.  I have not included visits to me by a number of people who
have made their own arrangements.

It may well be when you have read my report that you think it would be
appropriate to confer.  If that is the case I would be happy to visit
your office as this would give me the opportunity to visit the ground
again.

                                                           Cont'd

Peter C Metcalf Esq                                        March 1990




I should add that there is a third appendix to the report in the form of
a statement which I have obtained from Chief Inspector TEASDALE of the
Greater Manchester Police.   I regard him as probably the most competent
and experienced mounted officer in the country and I think he would be a
formidable witness.

I trust my efforts will be helpful to you.

                            Yours sincerely

 Dear Mr. Phillips,

 Hillsborough

Following a further High Court hearing on 20th December, it now
seems likely that the liability issues in this action will be tried
during the month of October, 1990.  It is not clear yet whether the
trial venue will be Manchester or Liverpool.  Clearly, you cannot
be expected to be present throughout the trial, but your presence
as an expert witness might be needed for up to a week.

For the time being, it would be of great assistance if you could
avoid major commitments during the month in question and I will, of
course, keep you informed of developments.

In the meantime, it will be most helpful if you could let me know
when you anticipate being in a position to deliver a draft report.
When that is to hand, I anticipate that it will be necessary to
have a conference with Counsel.

With all good wishes for Christmas and the New Year.


Yours sincerely.

Sir,

          Please find copies of statements of Mounted Officers enclosed.

       I am unable to local Mr. Phillips' chart in which he indicated the
information required so have prepared the sample enclosed from memory.

       I know it was intended as a guide and am aware you will adapt             it
as you see fit.

       Please    do   not   hesitate   to contact me   if   I can be   of   further
assistance.

Dear Mr. Metcalf,

       There is a matter about which I would like more information if it
is possible to obtain it.    The Safety Committee meeting of the 13th
November 1985 (at which the Police were represented by C. Galvert, R.
Greenwood and           \ referred at minute 5 to crowd flow problems at
Leppings Lane end.   The minute concludes that physical restraint could
conceivably be more of a danger than allowing the existing position to
continue.

       It may be this matter has been dealt with in the transcripts (all
of which I have not read yet) but if it is not I would like to know what
caused the police to    raise this issue and whether there is   any other
information about the   issue or greater recollection of the discussions
concerning it.

       My interest is    that whilst the problem was recognised evidently
the South Yorkshire County Council, the County Fire Service, the Club
and their Engineers, all took the view that they were happy to accept
whatever risks there were.

                              Yours sincerely.




                          /Deputy/Chief Constable

In Confidence


Dear Mr. Maxwell-Hyslop,

      I have chosen to write separately on this matter as it is my wish that
you treat these remarks as being in confidence.     I was a member of the
Minister's Working Party and although throughout the discussions I aired
these views, I would not wish to publicly challenge his position
particularly if the police will eventually have a significant role in
implementing any scheme.

      I note as you do that the legislation is enabling and therefore much
is still in the balance.     My remarks are more about the difficulties and
practicalities within the principle.     It would be desirable to exclude
hooligans from football and if the principle of banning categories of
spectators is politically acceptable it is a matter for Government not the
police as such.      However,  as someone who has had very considerable
experience of policing football, I feel in a position to comment usufully on
the difficulties:

1.     The whole idea of "exclusion" turns on being able to identify those
       who should be excluded.  From a practical point of view how long will
       it take before enough of the worst people are excluded under the
       scheme to make any difference? and by then will another generation
       have replaced those we have banned?

2.     The organised hooligan is a master at defying control systems and
       relishes the opportunity - is there much to stop him obtaining false
       credentials to enter football grounds?

3.     Over three million supporters are to be enfranchised - how will the
       administrators manage this with such rigour that bogus applications
       can be spotted?     They will have an interest in getting as many
       supporters registered as possible and they certainly will not have the
       means to do much checking.
                                   -2 -

4.   What is to stop a black market in membership cards genuinely obtained
      but not required by the person obtaining them?

5.   Even assuming the technology can stop a bogus card what is there to
      ensure that the hand that holds it is the person he claims to be? In
      the reality of busy turn-styles such checking is plainly impossible.

6.   Perhaps the most challenging question of all is the technology - will
      it be sufficiently robust to withstand the football hooligan with his
      chewing gum and super glue?

7.   Even   if the technology works will the turn-styles          be able to
      accommodate it?    Will we be left with more serious      crowd control
      problems as entry times are increased? Bear in mind the    spectator has
      now both hands full, a membership card in one, money      in the other,
      maybe a programme - it does not take much fumbling to     slow down the
      process dramatically.

8.   Will the police and the clubs have enough people to back up the scheme
      by way of enforcement to make it work?

      These are all simple but central questions that you may feel are
issues of sufficient weight that any proposed scheme should satisfy you
before it is approved.

     I hope these remarks are helpful to you.

     Kindest regards.

                             Yours sincerely.

Dear Mr. Metcalf,

       Further to my consideration of the Hillsborough Inquiry a matter
that I consider particularly pertinent is the level of experience
reposing on those in charge at the time of the disaster.     This matter
seems to have been dealt with rather lightly assuming that a fairly
regular presence at Hillsborough constitutes experience in dealing with
a capacity crowd.   I wish to develop the view that policing a half empty
stadium is no experience at all in fitting one for dealing with a crowd
of 50,000.    In consideration of this I would like to know how often
Chief     Superintendent     Duckenfield,    Superintendent     Marshall,
Superintendent Greenwood and Superintendent Murray have policed football
matches, during the last five years, when there has been a crowd in
excess of 25,000, in excess of 40,000 and at capacity.

       It might help me to know the record of attendance at Sheffield
Wednesday and Sheffield United over the last five years.

       Judgement is a function of knowledge. To be in aposition  to
recognise pursuant consequences     one would have to know how  the
tolerances of a football ground would be affected with a capacity
crowd. I shall be developing this point in due course.

                             Yours sincerely,




                                       Constable

                                                               questions whether the directors of many clubs are
                                                               genuinely interested in the welfare of their supporters or
                                                               their good behaviour. Players, too, are criticised, with
                                                               Lord Justice Taylor pointing out that incitement from the
                                                               pitch or bad behaviour by players, which is not contined to
                                                               soccer, has a major influence on the crowd.
                                                                 I acknowledge that some clubs have made an effort to
                                                             improve standards, but Lord Justice Taylors clear
                                                             conclusion was that the majority had not and that the
                                                             game has a future only if the directors and the players can
                                                             change their priorities and give a leadership which ts
                                                             plainly lacking at present.
                                                                 He agrees with the Government that there must be a

                                                              II of the Football Spectators Act 1989 specifically
                                                             provides the machinery for that. The change will improve
                                                             safety and behaviour, and we intend to bring it about.
                                                                 Lord Justice Taylor makes clear that the bulk of the
                                                             finances for ground improvements will have to be raised by
                                                             the clubs themselves. He says there are ways of raising the
                                                             money if the clubs' management is enterprising and
                                                             resourceful, and he points to the opportunities presented
                                                             by sponsorship. He also points to the revenue that flows to
                                                             the football authorities from television rights and says that
                                                             the football authorities should ensure that this valuable
                                                             source of revenue is directed towards improving stadia. He
                                                             canvasses the possibility of a levy on transfer fees which he
                                                             says have reached a level which many regard as grotesque.
                                                                 There is a whole series of detailed recommendations set

 value of the police national football intelligence unit in
dealing with football-related crime and with hooligans
travelling to matches abroad.
    As I have said. Lord Justice Taylor takes the view that
better facilities and better treatment of fans will bring
be'tter behaviour. Beyond that, the report recommends the
creation of three new specific offences to apply at
designated sports grounds— throwing a missile: chanting
obscene or racialist abuse; and going on to the pitch
without reasonable excuse. It also asks for consideration
to be given to extending the courts' powers to impose
attendance centre orders and for the use of electronic
tagging in the case of offenders' convicted of football-
related offences. The specific new offences suggested seem,
to some extent, to duplicate offences which are already
available in the Public Order Act 1986. but 1 shall look
carefully and quickly at all these suggestions.
    I now come to the proposed football membership
scheme. Lord Justice Taylor examined the invitation to
tender for a scheme which was issued by the consultants
employed by the football authorities. He came to the
conclusion that he could not support a scheme o f that kind
because he could not believe that the technology would
work well enough to avoid the danger of congestion and
disorder. He was also concerned about the call on police
resources. Instead, he proposes the measures to which 1
have referred.
    In the light of this advice, the Government have decided
not to proceed with the establishment of a football
membership authority, but part 1of the Act will remain on
the statute book. Work will continue to see how the
shortcomings identified by Lord Justice Taylor could be
overcome in case we have to return to the matter again,
should the problem of hooliganism not be defeated by the
alternative strategy proposed in the report.
     Let no one imagine that this means that there will be
any let-up in the fight against hooliganism. Those who,
 unlike the Government, have for so long shrugged off their
 responsibilities will now have to face up to them.
     The Government intend to proceed as quickly as
 possible to the establishment of a football licensing
 authority and. subject to consultation, section 11 of the
 Football Spectators Act will be used to direct the Football
 Licensing Authority to require all-seater stadiums— with
 standing being reduced by stages and entirely eliminated in
 first and second division grounds by August 1994 and in all
  Football League grounds by 1999.
     The necessary steps will be taken to ensure improved
 arrangements for crowd control and better training for
  police and stewards. There will be urgent consideration of
  the case for new offences and for new powers to deal with
  those excluded from grounds by the courts. The clubs will
  be compelled to get rid of the terraces. But Lord Justice
  Taylor indicates how much more they can do to create a

       This video clip,                 a police video,                 was      taken   at Wembley

Stadium    on      the         23rd March                1986,    the       match -        Chelsea       v

Manchester City in a Cup Final.                           It demonstrates problems with

overcrowding.           If       you look           at    the early part of                the video

sequence you will see a good view of the crowd on terracing at

the side of the tunnel and also the crowd above the tunnel.                                             It

is fairly clear that the crowd on the terracing to the left of

the    tunnel     are        not     in       discomfort         although           fairly       tightly

packed.     You see           fromtheir response                  to     events on         the        field

that most people                   are able to clap, throw their hands in the

air.     There    is no sign                  of    distress or          difficulty.             As     the

camera    pans     to      the      right          it    is    not evident          to     the    casual

observer or even to the more practiced eye that the level of

packing between the two sections of the crowd is that different

and yet as you will see                       there      is    serious        overcrowding.            The

next   sequence       that         shows       an officer who               has recognised that

overcrowding and obtains                      a    ladder which he puts                  against        the

tunnel.         For      some       considerable               length       of   time    people         are

evacuated from the crowd in a fairly precarious fashion as you

see.     The point         to be          made,         is the crowd who are above                      the

tunnel    are    clearly           in     some      discomfort,             such    that     they       are

prepared to take some level of risk in escaping the crush.                                             The

crowd to     the      left ofthe              tunnel      do      not       seem    to be        in     any

trouble    or     discomfort.                 The       question       is     whether      those        two

groups of people are noticeably different to an observer of the

crowd?     Were       it     not        for       the    escapes being             arranged by          the

policeman on the ladder it is reasonable to suggest that these

two    sections         of    the          crowd         would not           appear      noticeably

different.
                                            -2-

        It is also interesting that in a later sequence on this

video you will see whilst some people are being evacuated down

the    ladder,     other people            above     the     tunnel    are following the

game   with      interest       and    feel        sufficiently       unmoved       by     events

immediately        at        hand     that        their     undisturbed       concentration

remains on the match.                They applaud,           throw up their hands and

appear to be           enjoyingthemselves.                Clearly   they are not in any

discomfort.        Overall there are some similarities to events at

Hillsborough in that respect.



        Another        point        that    might     be     made     from    this       general

sequence      of       film    is     the     sheer        fatuity of        imagining       that

policemen,       or stewards for that matter,                      placed in and on the

terracing could engage in some kind of exercise to distribute

the crowd.         The notion of "packing" referred to frequently in

the Hillsborough Enquiry is not a realistic proposition.                                   It is

difficult     to       see    how      anybody        could     in some       way    or     other

distribute       evenly the          crowd we        see here       by   activity on          the

terraces.        The     only way          that    distribution could be              achieved

would be by controls at the point of entry to particular parts

of the ground (as per the Safety Certificate).                                 Looking at a

crowd of that size, and an occasion of this sort,                               the idea of

controlling the crowd on the terracing, packing them into safe

cohorts as the crowd builds up,                       is clearly not           a reasonable

possibility.



        The next sequence of video is also a police video and it

was    taken on the           10th February          1990     at    the Chelsea v           Spurs

Derby game        at    Stamford Bridge.              In many       respects        this    is   a
                                        -3-

typical piece of video and nothing untoward is recorded.                                     The

significance of          this video          howeverrelates          to the        issues     of

queueing       and     crowd     behaviour         when       the    crowd    is     somewhat

frustrated by being unable                  to get       into    the ground         at    a key

fixture as and when the kick off approaches.                           You will see that

the crowd outside the turnstiles is thickly congregated.                                  There

is no organised system of queueing and, as in many cases, the

turnstiles are too close together to allow for separate queues

when there is a capacity,               or near capacity crowd.                    The police

are visible amongst the crowd, there are no signs of trouble or

disorder and you will             see that is the case some five minutes

before       kick     off.       At    that    time       there      are     still       several

thousand people outside the turnstiles and the likelihood that

many    of     them    will     not    get    in    on    time.       Nonetheless           crowd

behaviour       remains        reasonable.         If you look         at this piece of

video and       imagined that          the crowd,         for whatever reason, began

to     surge    against        those    turnstiles,           you    will    see     that     the

situation would          quickly become            untenable.        In particular            the

crowd would be able to climb over the turnstile cabins which do

not     form    a     formidable       barrier.          As     it   is     the    crowd      are

reasonably behaved and reasonably co-operative.



         Some two minutes before kick off time on the video and

there are       still        visible   on     the police monitors             thousands       of

people at       the turnstiles waiting to get in.                      It is significant

that    the match        commander      did not on this occasion                     take     the

decision to delay the kick off, and did what is usually done,

which is to rely on police tactics to contain the crowd.                                       As

the camera moves away and pans left you can see there are still
                                            -4-

people       assembling         in    the   narrow main          road    approach        to    this

ground       and    you    can       see    some    four    horses       who     are    able     to

forestall the queue of several thousand people who are seeking

to approach the turnstiles.                  There are some similarities in the

geography          of     this       configuration         and     the       arrangements        at

Leppings       Lane,      Hillsborough.             In    this    case        there     are    iron

fencings       and      a gate and you will see that the police horses

have    no    difficulty containing                 the    crowd who          are     seeking     to

approach       the      turnstiles.         Less than one minute from kick off

time and the crowd remain well behaved.                           Four horses as against

the 13 that were deployed at Leppings Lane are sufficient to

hold back          a crowd of several               thousand people            who     are     still

unable to get into the turnstile area..



         You will         see in this sequence that police officers and

stewards are able to close the gate,                             not different          from     the

gate at Hillsborough, where thirteen horses and all the police

officers present were unable to close it or to keep it closed.

Of     course      the reason         is,    that the       crowd       are    behaving        in a

reasonable and co-operative fashion.



         At     kick      off    time,      still    thousands          of     people     at     the

turnstiles,          the match has commenced and this crowd will have

heard the roar that will have gone up inside the ground when

the     game       has begun          andyet,       despite       the          convergence        of

thousands of people around the turnstiles, there is no surging

so as to cause danger                 or    alarm to any of the police officers

who are there or any of the supporters themselves.
                                          -5-

        This    sequence         of police video            is    taken at Wembley and

records crowds outside the ground at                    Liverpool and Everton Cup

Final 1986.         There are a number of significant features to this

film which can be pointed out.                    The first observation to make

is that with a very large crowd on an occasion of this kind,

the   ability       of     the   police     to    achieve         any    kind      of    formal,

recognisable,         queueing       is   clearly out            of    the question.          The

police have to be content with a considerable presence, the use

of many horses             and an    attempt      to   influence             and control       the

crowd   by     being       amongst    them       and   by    talking          to   them.      The

packing outside the turnstiles is tight and continues to be as

kick off approaches.              The whole sequence will show the mounted

officers in various attempts to control the crowd and you will

see that the effectiveness of mounted officers at the rear of

the crowd is to be questioned.                    You will also see as the video

progresses many occasions when supporters recklessly invade the

stadium      and    this indicates something about the nature of the

crowd and the         difficulty of policing.                     On    few occasions         are

police officers able to get to people who are climbing into the

stadium in such a dangerous way.



        As    this    clip       reaches    its    finality            you    will      see   that

conditions         at the turnstiles themselves have become difficult

if not fraught.            Officers are standing on fencing waving at the

Merseyside         crowd    and exhorting them to ease back with little

evident result.



        It can be said that the sheer presence of a large crowd

outside the turnstiles in this fashion is not unusual.                                   This is
a     more   difficult     crowd      to   manage     than    most     crowds    as    is

witnessed by the constant attempts to clamber into the ground

unlawfully.     Nonetheless        at no      stage   does there seem to be a

sustained momentum by the crowd towards the turnstiles such as

was     experienced      at    Hillsborough.           One    is       drawn    to    the

conclusion     that   if      there    had    have    been,    the     same    sort   of

difficulties      would       have     been     experienced        -     despite      the

considerable number of mounted officers that were available.

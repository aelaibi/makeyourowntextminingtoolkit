              Ms Valerie Yates

              Nr Clarborough
              Retford




              Dear Ms Yates

              I read with interest an article which appeared in the Yorkshire Post on
              16 June 1989 which indicated that you were searching for a man known as
              Tony who saved your life at Hillsborough on 15 Aopril 1989.

              Whilst I am not in a position to help you at this time, if during the
              course of my inquiries I come across 'Tony' I will let you know.  I
              cannot make any promise, but my staff will do the best they can. Given
              that we have yet to pursue a considerable number of inquiries on behalf
              of Lord Justice Taylor and Her Majesty's Coroner, it will be some time
              before this information is likely to be available, if at all.

              I do hope that you have recovered completely from your injuries at
              Hillsborough and I wish you well for the future.

              Yours sincerely




             Assistant Chief Constable
             (Hillsborough Inquiry)

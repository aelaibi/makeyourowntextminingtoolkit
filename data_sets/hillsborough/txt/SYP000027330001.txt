                                                               ?6 th April,   1989.

    Dear Sir,                                                     .
                 I have supported Liverpool since they were a °nd Division side and
    have held a season ticket since 1968. Like many other fans, I have over the years
    accquired a lot of experience in attending 'big* matches. (These include five
    Suropean Cup Finals and the last sixteen F.A.Cup Semi Finals Liverpool have
    contested)
                 I have enjoyed many happy times, some not so happy and sadly at
    Heysel and Hillsborough, two very tragic ones.
                 As at Heysel, there was not one reason at Hillsborough which caused
    the disaster      but many. As an ordinary and responsible supporter, Iwould like
    to relate my view from experiences at this and other matches as to why the
    tragedy occurred.
                 In my opinion, there were ten reasons which contributed;

    (1) CH0TC3 0? YJMTB:- The 'P.A. said that arrangements for last years semi final
    went smoothly and that this was the basis for selecting Hillsborough again.
    Any supporter in the Leppings Lane centre section last       year will tell you      thatit
    was severely       overcrowded md arrangements far from satisfactory.
    In addition, Sheffield geographically is much nearer Nottingham and in fairness
    to both Clubs, the F.A. should have selected a ground nearer Liverpool.
    If the F.A. hierachy had stood on the Leppings Lane terracing last year instead
    of being friven luxury treatment by the Sheffield Wednesday directors, I feel sure
    they would have listened to Mr Peter Robinson's suggestion of Old Trafford.

    (2 ) TICKET ALLOCATION:- Any intelligent person could see it makes no sense to
    give Liverpool with an average home gate of 38,000, 4 >000 fewer tickets than
    Nottingham Forest who attract 18,000 on a good day.
    Again the F.A. did not listen to Mr Robinson.

    (3) TRAFFIC D3LAYS;-'The police advised fans to travel via the M62 & M1 to
    Sheffield. On this route and the more recognised way via Stockport, there
    was congestion and hold ups resulting in a large number of supporters arriving
    after 2 .00pm.

    (4) POOR ENTRANCE FACILITIES;- The entrances for the North .Stand,'the West Stand
    and the Lepping Lane Terracing are all conmregated together. This means that
    all 25,000 Liverpool supporters enter in the same area.
    The signs above the turnstiles are not clearly marked, which leads to concision,
    this is particularly heightened v/hen people arrive late.

                                                                               pto
(5) LACK 07 QTTSnaS:- If queues would have been properly organised, people
would have been able to pass through the turnstiles much quicker. There was
not enough police to do this and fans massed toother, trying to push thenselves
in the general direction of the turnstiles.

(6) TICKgl-'j-SSS FANS:- There was a number of fans without tickets, not thousands
as some media surest but perhaps three or four hundred. Some of them unfortunately
were hampering swift access through the turnstiles. Whilst edging my way to the
gates, I noticed several making abortive efforts to pass through the turnstiles.
I witnessed this at close quarters when I eventually reached the turnstile, the
lad immediately in front of myself tried to pass the gate man a £5 note, this was
refused, the lad pleaded and begged to be let through, he then proceeded to try
and climb over the turnstile. The gate man alerted a policeman at the rear of the
turnstile, on seeing him, the lad retreated, I had to force myself back against
the crowd to let him out. I estimate this abortive effort took between 30 and
35 seconds and in this time, six fans could have been admitted with tickets.
I would only be guessing as to how many of these abortive efforts were made but I
think it would be worthwhile asking the men employed on the turnstiles to asatain
a correct figure. If for example two hundred abortive efforts were made, this
would mean that about 1,200 fans could have been admitted diiring this wasted time.
I feel the police must accept some of the blame for this. If they would have had
enough men on foot outside the turnstiles, they could have organised the queues
and checked everyone had a ticket before entering the turnstile.
Obviously some blame must be attached to fans who travelled without tickets but
the Police must have expected this and should have made contingency plans.

(7) FANS COITfiREEATINfl IN MIDDLE SECTION:- A lot of Clubs have the terracing
behind one of the goals sectioned off. This is so that during a normal League
game, the visiting supporters can be herded into one of these pens with the
section either side empty.     This is some what different for an F.A.Cup Semi
Final as all the sections are used by the one club's fans. A lot of fans,
particularly the younger ones, prefer to go in the center section. This is because
they are nearer the goal and they wish to experience a more vibrant atmosphere.
At each of the previous two semi finals Liverpool have played, last year also
at Hillsborough and in 1986 at White Hart Lane, the center section was severly
overcrowded, whereas the side sections were a lot less congested. The Sheffield
Wednesday officials and Police should have been wary of this and either issued
tickets for each section or advised stewards to direct fans to the side sections
as soon as the center section was full.

(8) DELAYING THE KICK OFF:- It was quite obvious    to me when I got into the
ground at P.40pm that a lot of fans would not get   in before kick off. It should
have been a simple task for an officer outside to   relay this information to the
Police control room and ask for a 15 or 30 minute   delay.

(9 ) OPENING THE CONCERTINA GATES:-     I managed to pass through the turnstiles
at ?.40pm, it had taken me.-Vabaiit ?5 minutes to move ?5 yards. During which time
the crushing progressively increased and I was very relieved when I eventually
entered the ground. The policemen on horses did their best to try and prevent the
crowd from pushing towards the turnstiles but they too became trapped in the crowd.
Later on when I heard that the police had opened the blue concertina gate, I was
fully understanding of their decision and agree that a tragedy was highly likely
outside if this action was not taken.     In saying this, it is almost certain that
opening the gate was directly responsible for the tragedy but it was not the
physical act of opening the gate that was the mistake but allowing the fans to
rush thro^h the tunnel to the middle section which was already by all accounts
over capacity, ^he Officer who gave the instruction to open the gates has my
sympathy but he should have been fully aware of all aspects relating to any
decisions he made regarding the crowd control at the match. This is why he is in
charge.
                                                                        pto
(10) yHH0!3S:- It is my opinion that since the introduction of perimeter fences,
it has been inevitable that a tragedy would occur.     At the 1986 seini final at
7/hite Hart Lane, I was in the middle section behind the goal. I was ri^ht at
the front with ray two y c m g sons. We had been one of the first ones to enter the
ground and had a perfect view until just before kick off when it became danger­
ously crowded. I was desperate to get them out but because of the fences, it was
impossible to do so. I wrote to the Chairman and Secretary of Tottenham Hotspur
explaining that because of the crushing, there could have been a tragedy at the
match and that spectators who needed medical treatment could not have been reached
because of the fences.     In their reply they said "although it would be better for
us to have a number of exit gates, too many would defeat the object", they also
said "the reason why the pen became crowded was due to late arrivals"
It is very sad that it has taken the deaths of ninety five people to awaken
Tottenham and other Clubs to the danger of these fences.
(i enclose a copy of the letters referred to above)

             I pray that the enqi’iry will reveal the truth with no cover up and
that we can then hopefully learn the lessons. Football "-rounds must be made
safer and more pleasant places to visit. Treat a man like an animal and he is
more likely to behave like one.
             I hope the information contained in this letter may be of use to you.

                      Liverpool,




                      Dear Mr.   Hughes,

                      Th ank you very m u c h for your letter of the 7th April 1986 and
                      I have noted your comments regarding the recent FA Cup semi
                      final here at Tottenham.

                     For your information, we do have suitable exits to the perimeter
                     pitch, w h ich are the number permissible under our Safety
                     Certificate. The p e n n i n g and barriers on the terraces are a
                     segregation req uirement and, although it w ould be b e tte r for us
                     to have a number of exit gates in these, too m a n y d e f e a t the
                     object. We do, however, move the crowds into a lt erna tiv e
                     sections when another becomes congested. In the case of this
                     particu lar match, the reason w h y the pen to w h i c h you are
                     referring became crowded was due to late arrivals.' We do try
                     to resolve the press ure continually throu gho ut the game.



                     Yours sincerely,




                                                                                         ■if-

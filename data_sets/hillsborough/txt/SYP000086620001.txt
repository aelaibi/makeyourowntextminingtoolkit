with     perfectly               routine     negotiations.             However,          it is certainly             not the

case     that          there has         ever     been any agreement,                 oral      or    in writing,

(formal           or       informal),       w hi ch     in any way alters               the duties        of the

s te w a r d and those               of the Police O f f i c e r s               in acting as agents             of the

club.         The          only manner       in w hi c h      police     officers          have a c t e d as agents

of the        club          is in practis ing            their authority,               under R e g u l a t i o n    13 of

up to        it had no relevance,                     whatsoever,        to the         r e l a t i o n s h i p between

stewards and                 the    police      in any other          respect.



Having        said that             I would also wis h to astate                     for the          record that       being

a ware       of    the       inadequacies,            the age and often the                    imcompetence         of the

stewards,              in the       interests         of public       safety        I, as gro u n d       commander,

al w a y s    felt          it n ec es s a r y to ensure          that we          had a police          officer       (s)

a v a i l a bl e       to assume         the duties         of the     stewards          should trouble arise.

In essence,                I suppose        one    could say that we were acting as a longstop,

but    by no means                 did we    ever      seak    to assume          the    r esponsibilities            of the

I have        been asked to          comment        on the q u e s t i o n of the               radial     fences

have     been asked to          comment         on the q u e s t i o n        of the gates at the                rear of

  the    radial      fences     b e ne at h the West S t a n d on the L e p pings Lane

terrace.          During     the     n eg o t i a t i o n s    prior    to the e r e ction of those

•fences,        the F ire B ri ga de were anxious                   to sati s f y thernjye 1 ves ,tht               the

gates w hen         closed and         locked w o u l d be          "under         the      control     of the

police."          Clearly,      the      purpose        behind their              concern being          to ensure           an

adequacy         of safety      p r e c a u tions       in the      public         interest /in an emergency.

  In interpreting            that      requirement,             I u n d e rstood         tha^y to m e a n that

Po l i c e    officers     should       be    in p o ssession of keys a/fd in a p o s ition to                                   .

open     those gates         to ensure a d e quate               e v a c u a t i o n / n an emergency.                 To

the     best     of my k no wl e d g e       that    took       place     on each and every m a t c h                  for

which        1 was u l t i m at el y    responsible a n d to the                     best of my kno w l e d g e             it

has     been so every since               I left F Division.                      I never       understood       that

r e q u i rement     to mean        that a Police Officer                  would         be    phys i c a l l y and

p e r s o na ll y sta t i o n e d   by each of those               gates        before,         during and after,

an y    particular match.               We have         certainly,         as      police       officers,       been        in

a p o s ition to open those                  gates      in plenty of time                   for an e m e r g e n c y

e v ac ua t i o n for example,            if a terrorist               bomb alert was              to arise.

However,         where    the gates were              to be locked back                  in the      fully    open

position,         as at a semi          final       tie where all             the s upporters at              the

L e pp in gs Ln End f o l l ow ed the same team,                        Po l i c e    'control'         of the      gates

was a redundant            concept,

    December, 199S;

     (B) notes that the programme:-

          (i) provided a factual re-construction of events surrounding
         the Disaster and its aftermath based on the issues of justice
         and accountability for the bereaved families of the Disaster
         - the issues upon which this Working Party was created in
         April 1989; and

          (ii) has, through its research, revealed significant new and

         justice to be obtained.

    and favourable coverage by most newspapers, radio and television
    stations and in particular of the "Daily Mirror", and their
    journalist Brian Reade, who have specifically raised at a national
    level many of the questions related to justice which have been
    asked by this Working Party since 1989 and which are now being
    asked more widely as a result of the broadcast of the programme;

    (E) also places on record its thanks to the Social Services
    Department, Liverpool Personal Services Society and the Alder
    Centre for their roles in establishing and staffing the helplines
    which were available to the public during and after the
    transmission of the Programme;

    (F) calls for a wider campaign for justice for the families to be
    established on terms to be determined in conjunction with the
    Hillsborough families and requests that all District Councils,
    particularly those on Merseyside and appropriate parts of
    Lancashire and Cheshire, be requested to fully support and
    participate in this campaign;

                                RESOLUTION

Motion by Councillor Frank Prendergast, seconded by Councillor
Peter Millea and resolved unanimously -

That this Council -

 (a)   notes the proceedings of the meeting of the Hillsborough
       Disaster Working Party held on 6 December, 1996;

 (b)   fully endorses the terms of the resolution of the meeting of
       the Working Party and supports the actions taken as a result
       of that meeting;

 (c)   notes that the "Hillsborough" television programme -

          (i) in uncovering fresh and unused evidence about the
              disaster, has enabled the campaign for justice for the
              bereaved families which this Council has supported
              since 1989, to be taken forward on a stronger basis;
              and

        (ii) in bringing to national attention many of the issues
             surrounding the disaster about which rpuch of the
             general public has remained in ignorance, has served to
             expunge the msny lies about the nature of the disaster
             which have perennially surfaced in certain parts of the
             British media and to finally embed the true story of
             the disaster firmly on the national consciousness;

(d)    in the light of the above, places on record its thanks and
       sincere appreciation to Granada Television and in particular
       to factual producer Katy Jones and writer Jimmy McGovern for*
       their services to bereaved families and to survivors of the
       disaster in having the conviction to commission, research,
       write and broadcast the programme;

(e)    places on record its appreciation to all the media who have
       given positive support to the renewed calls for justice
       following the transmission of the programme;

(f)    in particular, places on record its thanks to the "Daily
       Mirror" and their journalist Brian Reade, for their
       exceptionally robust coverage of the programme and
       specifically for:-

         (i) their front page lead on the morning of the
             transmission of the programme and the accompanying
             articles which focused national attention on the
             contents of "Hillsborough" and provided a detailed
             analysis of the arising implications; and.

       (ii)   the national petition launched by the newspaper for a
              new inquest into the disaster, the terms of which this
              Council fully supports;


al/cttee/cc/motion/Hillsborou
 (g)   expresses thanks to the many people from all areas of the
       country who have indicated their feelings of anger following
       the programme and who have also expressed a desire to assist
       the families' campaign for justice in any way possible;

 (h)   notes the legal advice which has been received by the
       families and fully endorses their demands that :-

          (i) in the light of the fresh evidence which has emerged as
               a result of "Hillsborough" and of the statement sworn
               by video technician Roger Houldsworth on 25th November,
               1996, the Director of Public Prosecutions order a
               criminal investigation into how and why Mr.

Dear Colin

Re: Income from sales of No Last Rights

Please find enclosed cheques totalling £1149.95. If you are able to check for us, it
would be interesting to know how close we are getting to covering the print costs, as we
had always hoped that any money over and above this could be channelled back to
families and survivors. I don’t know if the Council can find a way o f doing this? The
income from sales must be getting near to the £4000 mark which is encouraging and we
are, o f course, still trying to generate interest in the book whenever and wherever
possible.

As I mentioned on the phone, our stationery budget has borne the costs o f postage and
packing of the books. An amount was added on to the overall cost o f the book to cover
p&p, however all income from sales has been passed on to yourselves. Would it be
possible for the Council to reimburse some o f these costs to us, as it has placed our
stationery budget under strain? I have enclosed a breakdown of costs for your
consideration - please let me know if you need any additional information.

I will get in touch with LFC and discuss with them ways of promoting the book in a more
positive manner.

Thanks for your help.

Best wishes

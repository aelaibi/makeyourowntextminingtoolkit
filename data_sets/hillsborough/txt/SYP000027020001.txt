         19.3         There wora some details omitted from the 1989 order which
                      wer'd included in the previous year, for example no fixed wing
                      aircraft for traffic information and no adhesive stickers for
                      mini bufiea which had baon checked by the Police.

                      There was a significant cut-back in manpower In the 1989
                      order which have been dealt with in depth in Paragraph 4.

         19-5         the reduction in police Personnel did h a w a direct affect on
                      Sector 2 who*a responsibility was the Policing of the
                      Liverpool supporters.

                      This Sector was reduced by*
                      3 Inspectors
                      5 Sergeants
                      58 Constables
The total -number* of Constables reduced from the 1988 figures is
1 3 5 , of which 123 would have been operational * Serials.
Therefore, as Sector 2 {Liverpool Supporters) was reduced by
58 Constables, this relates to 53% of the saving being
from one Sector.                         :

The match order In relation to duties of Officers outside the
ground at the Lepptng3 Lane end is Identical to that of 198$*
including the checking of fans at barriers, prior to the
turnstiles, In order to ensure that they had tickets#



Officers posted to the perimeter track were under specific
Instructions to prevent people climbing the fence and
additionally to Keeping the gates locked, The only exception
being for a person requiring medical attention.

The order clearly states "The*® Gates w i ' ^ ; tx*.   < it
a specific massage to evacuate is given m the Public Mclrtta
J^3 te»*\

It is quite clear due to the events of Hillsborough on tbs
15th April 1989 that fans entering the West stand ^-.d not
been checked at the advanced filter barriers, to ascertain If
they were in possession of tickets* This system is referred
to in both 1588 and 89 orders, the significant difference
being the reduction in mart power in the 1989 order *

                             The reduction In Inspectors was achieved by reducing the number of
                             Serials by two, removing the role of Liaison Inspector in each of
                             the Serials and additionally reducing the number of Officers in

                    It is necessary to exanlne the specific policing deployment
                    in detail:
                    Sector 1 * Ground .
                    Commanded by Superintendent Greenwood
                    This Sector was split into Sector 1A and 1B, each under the
                    supervision of a Chief Inspector.

                    Serials 1 - 1 0 came under Sector 1A
                    Serials 1 1 - 2 1 carae under Sector 1B

        8.2         The postings for these Serials are identical to tho3 e in 1988
                     but with a reduction in wan power of 4 Sergeants and 19
                     Constables. This was achieved by the removal of 1 Serial,
                     for example, Serial 22 was included in this Sector and posted
                     to stand-by duties along with Serials 20 and 21, Therefor#
                     in 1989 there was one Serial less on stand-by duties,

        3 .3        Serials 13 - 19 inclusive, had duties in relation to the west
                     stand and the Loppings Lane, turnstiles.

                      Appendix J on both orders deals with this. The 1989 order
                      does not show the nominated Officer or traffic warden for
                      each point, which was the point in the 1 9 8 8 order.

       13.1           Trains
                      Appendix K on both orders. The only difference being an

                      in 1989 this meant a total of 3 trains whereas in 1988 there
                      were   2.

                      Appendix N deals with this on both orders. The only
                      difference being that in 1988 adhesive stickers were to be
                      placed on vehicles that were checked i.e. on the windscreens
                        this was omitted in the 1989 order.

           14.2       Transit Vans - Nottingham Fan*
                      Appendix N for both orders. Similar to the Liverpool fans
                      the adhesive stickers policy was omitted from the 1989 order.

                 The same format, wording and postings were used.

       19.3      There wora sowe details omitted from the 19S9 order which
                 ware included in the previous year, for example no fixed wins
                 aircraft for traffic information and no adhesive sticket’3 for
                 mini bu?ies which had beon checked by the Police.


        19.A     There was a significant cut-back in manpower in the 1089
                 order which have been dealt with in depth In Paragraph 4.


        19.5     The reduction in police Personnel did have a direct affect on
                 Sector 2 who1a responsibility was the Policing of the
                 Liverpool supporters,

                 this Sector was reduced bft
                 3 Inspectors

                                            -   8   **




                   The total number of Constables reduced from the 1988 figures is
                   135, of which 123 would have been operational on Serials.
                   Therefore, as Sector 2 (Liverpool Supporters) was reduced by
                   58 Constables, this relates to 53% of the saving being wade

                       from one Sector.

        19-6       The match order in relation to duties of Officers outside the
                   ground at the Lepplngs Lane end is identical to that of 1988#
                   including the checking of fans at barriers, prior to the
                   turnstiles, in order to ensure that they had tickets.



        19.7           Officers posted to the perimeter track were under specific
                       instructions to prevent people climbing the fence and
                       additionally to keeping the gates locked. The only exception
                       being for a person requiring medical attention*

                       The order clearly states "These Gatos will only be opened if
                       a specific asssage to evacuate is given 00 the Public Address
                       Syste*".


        19.8           It is quite clear due to the events of Hillsborough on the
                       15th April 1989 that fans entering the West stand had not
                       been checked at the advanced filter barriers, to ascertain if
                       they were in possession of tickets. This system is referred
                       to in both 1 9 8 8 and 89 orders, the significant difference
                       being the reduction in man power in the 1989 order.

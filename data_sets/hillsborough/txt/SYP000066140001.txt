             people and the Po li ce                    trying        to    rip down the           fencing and        rea lised

             so me th in g was            s e r i o us l y wrong.           I couldn't          see     into the    pens due        to

             the mass         of    people.

             We    remained where                we were       and saw         people       d ir ec te d from the         pitch to

             that     some      people must             have     died,       a l t h o u g h even then       I only thought a

             few.        A l t h ou g h    I could see           people        lying       flat    out    I was    too    far a wa y to

             say what         their state              was.      I did see             people     using    hoardings as m a k e ­

             shift       stretchers.

             After about an hour                     things a p p e ar e d somew ha t              under    control,       and at

             D ur i ng     the whole           incident        I felt         t h a f \ t h e r e was a lack of          co­

    Subject:           Hillsborough

    I have now seen Sue Ross's further letter and the amended draft, which contains Philip Havers' suggestions. I
    am content with the amendments - 1do not feel strongly one way or the other about the final sentence of the first
    full paragraph on page 2. If the letter is to come from me, then some further amendments will be needed to the
    first three full paragraphs on the final page, which are at present expressed in the third person. That is no
    problem and can easily be done at this end if the letter does go from me. Do any of you have a view on who
    should sign the letter - or any other comments on the draft?

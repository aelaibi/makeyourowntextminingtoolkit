 Mrs S STRINGER,




^Dear Madam,

 REQUEST FOR THE RELEASE OF INFORMATION

 I refer to your letter regarding your request for copies of statements in
 connection with your son Paul.

 The policy on the release of information is as follows

 The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police invited the West. Midlands Police
 back in April 1989 to undertake the investigation into the Hillsborough Disaster.
 In fulfilling this investigatory role the West Midlands Police constitutionally
 were acting as the agents of South Yorkshire Police.

 The policy on the release of information has variously been determined by Lord
 Justice Taylor, later the Director of Public Prosecutions (in conjunction with the
 "’olice Complaints Authority), and the Coroner.  I now have to look to South
    rkshire Police, as principals of the information, for the policy in resp'onding
 ^ ^ y o u r request.

 At the present time the policy of South Yorkshire Police directed to me is not to
 release any information to any party.   This is based on legal advice that has been
 given which indicates that information should only .be released on the order of a
 court, which could include that of the Coronet. •

 I am sorry I cannot be any more helpful at the moment and as explained at the
 pieasnc timw I. fliusjt decline your request.

 Yours faithfully,




 J. Mervyn JONES,

Dear Madam

Thank you for your letter which was received on 11 June 1991 asking for . '
certain material arising from the Hillsborough Investigation. The position
is that South Yorkshire Police have adopted a policy based on le-gal advice
that at the present time means that none of this type of material is released.

If there is any change in this policy I will write to you again.

     very sorry to learn of your sorrow arising from the tragedy and would
.^^end my deep sympathy at your loss.

Yours faithfully

             Dear Mrs Stringer

             Re; Hillsborough

             We now enclose copy letter we have received from Elizabeth Steel who is the
             solicitor heading the Hillsborough Steering Committee.    You will see that she
             has dealt with in that letter the position regarding disclosure of witness
             statements not relied^at the inquest/ which you have asked us to obtain. There
             is still an ongoing dispute regarding this with the Police.

            11 In relation to the question of judicial review, that is dealt with in the latter
           I f part of Miss Steel's letter.  You will see that the Hillsborough families group
             have taken seperate legal advice and if you are a member of that group, you may
             care to ascertain the position regarding the advice that they are pursuing

      •      regarding judicial review.

             Finally, you mentioned recently that you wished to include as part of your
             claim, the legal costs which you had incurred in relation to reprsentation at
             the inquest.   If you will forward to me a receipt for this amount, we will
             endeavour to claim this back as part of your claim.

             Yours sincerely




             DAVID PHILLIPS^ PARTNERS-----------------

Hear Mr Teare,

l^feik you for your letter of the 5th instant, the contents of which I note.

I was told yet again by the Assistant Chief Constable of South Yorkshire that
they were awaiting the outcome of disciplinary proceedings before allowing
release of client and witness statements.

As a decision has now been made as to the individual officers who are to face
these disciplinary proceedings - simply Duckinfield and Murray - I have written
yet again on the basis that now whatever evidence they are going to use must be
known and asking them to confirm that statements not specifically required-
for these proceedings will be released.   I am copying that to Peter Metcalfe
of Hammond Suddards to try to get somemovement from that end.

As soon as we have any news I will let you know.

As far as the Inquest verdict is concerned I know that families were extremely
concerned over the accidental death verdict. This is understandable and
  •derlines the absence of any Coroner's verdict between that of accidental
L.^^h and unlawful killing.   I note that in the real disaster the verdict
last week was equally one of accidental death.

The points raised in your third paragraph were considered both by us and by
Counsel instructed in connection with the Inquest and we did not consider
that there was a realistic chance of success on judicial review. The families
Group - as is their right - have taken further advice elsewhere and although
I do not know the position it may be that judicial review proceedings are
underway.

If your client is a member of the Hillsborough Families Group she would get more
information through them than I have on this particular point.

I note that you are now handling this matter and we have amended the records
accordingly. •.

Every good wish.    Yours sincerely,

    Dear Ms Carlile,

    Thank you for your letter which was responded to by the Chief Constable's
    Staff Officer, on the 13th November 1991-

    As indicated in the Staff Officer's letter we were awaiting legal advice,
    and I have to inform you that that advice directs us not to release any
    information until such time as all discipline matters have been finalise'd.
    You will no doubt be aware that discipline matters are still pending against
    one officer in South Yorkshire, and until such time as the outcome of that
    matter is determined, I am unfortunately unable to release any material.

    I can once again assure you that the photograph has not been forgotten,
    and I will make every effort to release it as soon as I am in a position
    to do so.

    Yours sincerely,

         I refer to a letter received                   from Mrs Stringer,         a   copy   of      which     I have
         attached for your information.

         The material Mrs Stringer has requested was                        not   introduced       at   the    inquest
         and as such is not in the public domain.

         It is the policy of South Yorkshire Police not to release                                      post    mortem
         photographs and to date no such material has been released.

         Please be assured that I do not wish to be obstructive and am eager to assist
         in whatever way I possibly can.

Mrs S Stringer




Dear Mrs Stringer

Hillsborough Inquest

Thank you for your recent letter. I was sorry to learn that the
solicitors acting for this office have not been in touch with you or your
legal advisers.  I have spoken to them again this morning, they have
confirmed that your request is being dealt with and that they will write
to you about this within the next few days.

Whilst I do not wish to appear unhelpful or impolite, I feel it is wrong
for me to be corresponding with you direct when there are solicitors on
both sides dealing with the case. I wonder therefore if I could ask you to
direct future correspondence through your solicitors until such time as
the Judicial Review is concluded.

Yours sincerely




C P Dorries
H M Coroner

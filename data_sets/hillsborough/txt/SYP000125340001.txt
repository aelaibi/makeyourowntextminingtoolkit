 VIEWING POINT?

 NO I SAW THE TUNNEL AND THAT SEEMED TO BE THE WAY TO GO

 Q29

 DID YOU HAVE ANY DIFFICULTY AT ALL IN FINDING YOUR MATCH VIEWING POINT?

 I NEVER GOT TO ONE.      I WENT THROUGH THE TUNNEL AND EMERGED INTO A TIGHTLY

 PACKED CROWD, THIS WAS JUST AFTER 3 PM <1300).      SOME PEOPLE WERE WALKING BACK

 UP THE TUNNEL COUGHING AND RETCHING.      I REALISED THAT I COULDNT GET THROUGH

 THE CROWD,   IT WAS LIKE A SOLID WALL OF PEOPLE AND I WAS BEING PUSHED FROM

 BJ^ND.   I DECIDED TO GET OUT.      I WAS IN PEN 3 BY THE DIVIDING FENCE.   I TURNED

 ROUND AND WAS FACING THE TUNNEL. I MANAGED TO GET INTO THE TUNNEL, WHICH STILL

 HAD PEOPLE IN WHO WERE OBVIOUSLY DISTRESSED.      I EXITED THE TUNNEL AND MADE MY

 WAY ROUND TO PEN 1 AND SAT ON A WALL.     A POLICEMAN TOLD ME TO GET DOWN BECAUSE

 THE WALL WASN ’T SAFE.   I THEN WALKED TOWARDS THE TURNSTILE AREA SAW DEAD BODIES

 ON THE FLOOR AND LEFT THE GROUND.

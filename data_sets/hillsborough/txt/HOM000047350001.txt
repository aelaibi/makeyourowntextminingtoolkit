Dear Miss Adlington

Phillips Report

You recently asked for a copy of the Phillips report. I have sought legal advice on this
subject. I am advised that the report is not relevant to any current civil action against the
Chief Constable. That being the case, I am now pleased to be able to release it to you.

I have asked Constable Ken Greenway to produce a copy. You will appreciate that the
volume of requests for material, and the scale of some of those requests, mean that it may
take some days before you receive the material.

Yours sincerely




Ian Daines
Assistant Chief Constable

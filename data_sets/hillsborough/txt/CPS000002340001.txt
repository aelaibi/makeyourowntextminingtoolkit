George

Thank you for the update re funding the defence. It is mildly satisfying, for a change, to be
mere spectators, rather than participants - although the result, of course, could have significant
implications for us.

I am happy with Sue's draft letter, subject to a couple of small points (and some minor drafting
points, with which we need not be troubled here).

The first full paragraph on the second page should refer, in the first line, to Section 6(1), not
6(2).

At the moment, the draft suggests that it will be sent by Sue, rather than by us. Is that right? I
had assumed that the letter would come from us. It might look a bit too defensive if it comes
from our solicitor - but perhaps that is intentional!

I should certainly like Philip Havers to cast his eye over the draft. Subject to the views of any
other recipient of this, could the papers go to him today?

We can deal with the drafting points later.

I've consulted with Chris and we are in agreement on one small suggested amendment, which
is to the last line on page 2. We consider that the phrasing of the example would appear more
meaningful if it was changed to "...or where, although the offence may be serious, the
defendant is terminally ill)."

Other than that small point we agree with the rest of the draft letter and also counsel's
suggestion that it should come from you.

ADLINGTON y DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

As instructed, I asked Philip Havers QC to advise on the terras of the reply to Walker Murray's
letter dated 18 December 1998.

He agrees with the approach I have adopted in my advice and draft letter. He considers that if
a judicial review is in prospect it is on balance probably more advisable to provide information
rather than not, However, he several suggestions about the draft, with which I agree. To make
it easier I have annotated a draft, which I enclose. A couple of points could usefully be
expanded upon.

1      In the first full paragraph on the second page, Counsel suggested that the final line m ay
        not belong in that position and may confuse matters, albeit it reflects a principle that
        appears in the policy document. He did not have strong feelings about removing it, so
        you may want to consider whether to include it (there or elsewhere) and whether it adds
        anything to the explanation of your policy.

2      In the last paragraph on that page, leaving out "Generally" is designed to avoid the
        defendants simply inviting you not to apply the policy in this case as an exception. His
        alternative, which I have annotated, is of course much better and embraces cases which
        are not covered by the policy or which require a different approach on the particular facts
        (as with the attempt pervert).

3      He considers that the letter will look less defensive coming from Chris Newell at this
       stage.

Counsel does not consider that the defendants have a realistic prospect of successfully arguing
that the policy is unlawful.

I hope this is helpful. Let me know if there is anything further that I can do.

A 5>
         ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

         You wrote to the Crown Prosecution Service on 18 December 1998^following the receipt of a
         letter from the CPS, also dated 18 December 1998, informing you of the Service's decision not
         to exercise its power under Section 6(2) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 to take over the
 X       criminal proceedings against your clien^ with a view to discontinuing them.


         You ask for further information^ jj^as*to the factual matters on which the CPS relied^
X X tf   identifying which parts^ o f th^evidence is "new" since the O w n Paisxwtioa Swviee last
         considered the case; and ^ as to tie way the Service applied the Code for Crown Prosecutors
         in deciding whether to intervene.


         These questions indicate that you misunderstand the factor^the Ceouoi Ptoooutioa Sarviro
  pC     considers when deciding whether to take over a private prosecution at the request of a defendant,
         with a view to discontinuance. It may help if I set out again in broad terms the approach the
         Service adopts to these decisions.


 ^       As you know, the Code for Crown Prosecutors$ 0 0 - sets out the general principles applied by
         the Service when (inter alia) deciding whether to continue a prosecution it has taken over; or
 )C      whether to institute proceedings^ to advise the police whether to do so. It is correct that the
K-)C K Csewn Ppeceoution Seme# decided in 1997 that the evidence available at that tii^w a^no^i
  X      sufficient, in its view, to provide a realistic prospect of the conviction of either ^ y o u r client/^
  PC     for ani^offence.     However, it does not follow that, when considering the evidence and
K   i       ^ representations submitted by the private prosecutor, and by yourselves on behalf of your client^
                 the CPS should see^mijMy to identify whether there is now any new evidence sufficient to
                 provide a realistic prospect^M1a conviction. The decision whether to intervene in a private
                 prosecution w it^^y i'e^1to terminating it calls for altogether different considerations to be           ^
        K        apphed. It iaiiquite possible for a private prosecution to continu^notwithstanding that the CPS
                 is                   the basis of its own assessment of the strength of the evidence, that the
                 evidcro^|||pmd pass the evidential sufficiency test in the Code (that there should be a "realistic
                 p||spet^of a conviction").


                 In broad terms, the reason for this is that Section 6(1) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985,-ttu.       A elf
                 which established the Service's powers and duties, specifically preserved the right of private
                 individuals and prosecuting authorities or bodies other than the CPS to bring criminal
                 proceedings. This right is subject (among other limitations) to the limitation in Section 6(2) that
                 the CPS may nevertheless take over the proceedings with a view either to conducting or to


        K        terminating those proceedings.



                 Private prosecutors are not bound to apply the Code for Crown Prosecutors when deciding
                 whether to institute proceedings, nor do the courts apply the evidential sufficiency test in the
                 Code when deciding whether there is a case to answer. The Service therefore recognises that
                 it is not appropriate to intervene to terminate a private prosecution without good reason. That
                 general principle has recently been endorsed by the Law Commission in its Consultation Paper
                 No. 149 "Consents to Prosecution" (see paragraphs 6.3 and 6.4).

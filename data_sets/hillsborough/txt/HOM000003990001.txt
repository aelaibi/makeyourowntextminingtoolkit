  TAYLOR REPORT : POLICE ISSUES


 lord Ferrers indicated in April that he wished to have a meeting with Mr Anderton
  so that he could receive a report on ACPO's progress in responding to the final
 Taylor report.         My letter of 10 April commissioned a progress report for     this
  purpose.      I attach a copy of ACPO's written response and Mr Anderton's covering
  letter.


  2.      A meeting with Lord Ferrers has now been arranged to take place at 11.00 am
 on 10 July.         The purposes of this minute are:-


          (i)       to ask for your contributions to the briefing for Lord Ferrers' meeting;
          and


          (ii) to ask whether you or someone else from your Division would wish to
          attend.     A full attendance from Divisions concerned might be necessary for
          any oral briefing Lard Ferrers might require.


  3.      As to (i), I suggest that you should provide a short line to take on each
 topic covering the likely adequacy of the ACPO response and its likely timing, if
 not already in place and the timing and content of any Home Office response already
made or still outstanding. A short background note may also be needed.

4.    May I lock to the lead Division identified below for contributions on the
following topics set out in the ACPO response


               TOPIC                                         T.KRD DTVTfiTfN

                                                     contributions to, a draft
                                                     submission. It may be that
                                                     no further briefing is
                                                     required for Lord Ferrers'

If I have mis-allocated any of these responsibilities please let me and whoever is
correctly concerned know straight away.

overtaking the arrangement, signalled in Mr Boys Smith's letter of 16 February, for
officials to meet ACPO with a view to reporting later to Ministers on ACPO's
response to the final Taylor report.


6.   May I ask for your response to this note by 4 July.

                       T^ord Justice Tavlor*s Final Report

        In your letter of 10th April, 1990, you sought to arrange a
        meeting between representatives of the Home Office and Lord
        Ferrers with me as a representative of the ACPO, to consider the
        progress by the Police Service in the implementation of the
        recommendations contained in Lord Justice Taylor's Final Report.

        I am pleased to accede to such a request. To assist you in your
        preparations, as you suggested, I have had a written account
        prepared of the ACPO response to the Final Report, which
        accompanies   this  letter.   By   necessity,  the   account  is
        comprehensive, reflecting the depth and quality of consideration
        given by the Police Service to the Report's content.

        The ACPO response to the proposed offences and penalties,
        contained in Recommendations 70-73, has been addressed by the
        Sub-Committee.   That response has been routed via the ACPO
        General Purposes Committee.

        The date of the proposed meeting can be arranged with my Staff
        Officer, Superintendent Peter Madeley.

                    LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR *S FINAL REPORT
                       CONSULTATION WITH THE A.C.P.O.


Offences and Penalties (Rees. 70-73)

       In correspondence,            dated 16th February,            1990, Mr.       Stephen
BOYS   SMITH,       sought    the     views    of     the    A.C.P.O.       regarding      the
enforceability and resource implications for the police in the
implementation of these offences. That copy correspondence was
circulated       to     all     forces,        England        and     Wales,       and     the
Superintendents Association,                 accompanied by a          letter from         the
Chairman of the Sub-Committee in which comment was invited upon
the proposals.


       The     resultant        correspondence              was     collated        by     the
Sub-Committee and a synopsis of those views was forwarded to Mr.
John EVANS, Secretary of the A.C.P.O. General Purposes Committee
for    further      attention        as    deemed     necessary.           That    composite
response      has     since    been       endorsed    and    forwarded       to    the    Home
Office on 14th June, 1990.


C.C.T.V. and Public Safety fRecs. 35-51)


       In May,      1989,     the Sub-Committee correctly anticipated the
recommendations of Lord Justice TAYLOR, when it identified the
need   to    review     the    use    of    closed     circuit       television,         paying
particular attention to the contribution which could be made to
public       safety.     A     Working        Party     was       formed,         under     the
Chairmanship        of Mr.     Malcolm GEORGE,          Assistant Chief            Constable
(Operations)        of the Greater Manchester Police and Secretary to
the    Sub-Committee.          The    Working        Party    took    as    its    terms     of
reference Recommendations 35 and 51.


       The membership of the Working Party comprised senior police
officers with considerable skill and experience in the command




                                             - 1 -
of policing football fixtures. They were assisted by scientific
technicians of the Police Scientific Development Branch.


       The Football Trust 1990, had agreed to provide funding,                         at
least in part, to meet the provisions of the Taylor Report, to a
maximum      of    some   Â£2m.    To   that   end    it    was    agreed    that      the
A.C.P.O.     Working      Party would     provide technical            advice    to   the
Football Trust to assist its members in their consideration of
all applications for such funding. An additional member of the
Working Party represented the Trust.


       During the period of its existence,                 the Working Party has
met on a regular basis, visited football stadia and established
minimum standards of performance of C.C.T.V. That research has
since been completed and is encapsulated in a Technical Report.
This document forms a set of guidance notes for the procurement
of C.C.T.V. installations.


       The guidance proffered concerns technical matters so as to
help to ensure that the requirements made by the Advisory Group
for a proposed C.C.T.V. installation at football stadia is fully
analysed and clearly stated.             It covers the assessment of stadia
for risk,         establishing the operational requirement,               performance
of     the    C.C.T.V.      system,      tendering        for    and     selecting      a
contractor,         commissioning and hand over of the system and the
maintenance of the finished product.


       The    document      has   been    approved        by    the    Sub-Committee,
circulated to all forces, and commended to the A.C.P.O. General
Purposes Committee and A.C.P.O. Council for immediate adoption.
     Copies will be circulated to the Clerks of Police Authorities
for use by the Advisory Groups.               The Football Trust,               in their
own right as contributors,             will receive copies of the document
and ensure it is forwarded to all League Clubs for guidance.
Reviev of Police Charges (Rec. 53)

       The review of the system of charges was commenced early in
1989 but the tragic events of Hillsborough and the Inquiry by
Lord Justice Taylor which followed in its wake precluded further
consideration. Nevertheless,                 the SubâCommittee remained mindful
of criticism that had been raised by the press and some football
clubs over apparent disparity in the charging practices of some
forces.     Where     such disparities           had been highlighted,              it    had
often    been presented          in a    league table         format      of per       capita
policing     costs        which       ignored        geographic      and        demographic
considerations between grounds and variations between fixtures.


        This Sub-Committee correctly anticipated the tenor of the
Final Report of Lord Justice Taylor when, in November, 1989,                                  it
compiled     a     list    of     current       police    charging        practices          and
undertook    a     reassessment         of    same    with    a   view     to    suggesting
national    guidelines          for    future    police      practices      and    charges.
This    endeavour has been endorsed in the                     Final Report when              in
paragraph 210 it states ......"At the present time, the practice
as to recovering costs of policing inside the grounds from clubs
varies    greatly      from place        to place,        different       formulae       being
used     .......      In my     view    a    more     consistent     and    businesslike
approach should be made to such charges."


        This statement was encapsulated in Recommendation 53 of the
Report     which      stated,     "Police       Authorities       should        review       the
charges they made to clubs for the cost of policing inside the
grounds    so as to ensure that realistic                     charges are made.              The
Home Office should take steps to ensure consistency of practice,
subject to local discretion and the need to have regard to local
f.irraimstances.11

        In its deliberations the Committee considered the need for
the Ground/Divisional Commander's discretion in the numbers and
deployment       of   police      officers      at    a   football       match    to    be    of
    paramount importance.         It also acknowledge that each ground had
    peculiarities      of   demography      and     geography        which      compounded
    policing    problems    and    precluded      any    notion      of    a   recommended
    ratio of the number of officers : the number of spectators.


         It did, however, concur with the need for a uniformity of
    police practice to offset criticisms of disparity.


         Accordingly,       the    Committee      recommended        that       charges      be
    levied for ALL police officers deployed inside the ground for
    the full duration of the match, up to, but excluding, the Ground
    Commander (who acts as representative of the Chief Constable).


A        The Committee also recommended that consideration be given
    to the formulation and adoption of two national hourly rates for
    all federated ranks, one to be levied normally and an enhanced
    rate to be levied on the occasion of a public holiday.                            This was
    circulated to all Chief Constables on 20th February,                            1990 and
    the proposals were commended for immediate adoption.


         A     comprehensive      account   of    the reviewed        system has            been
    forwarded to Mr.        ADDISON,     FI Division of the Home Office,                      in
    correspondence dated 14th June, 1990.


    Training of Police Officer/Stewards (Rec.16)
    Review of Arrest Procedures (Rec.48)

         The     two   aspects    of    research,       listed above,          were    readily
    identified     from     the   Final     Report.       At   its        meeting      on    5th
    February,     1990, the Committee considered these matters in more
    detail.

         In      paragraphs       210     and     211     of    the        Final       Report,
    consideration is given to the replacement of Police Officers by
    Stewards,     for the performance of certain functions at football
    fixtures.      These     functions      allude       to    the        responsibilities




                                            - 4 -
identified        in paragraph         195   of   the Green Guide           to    Safety    at
Sports Grounds.        Moreover the Judge acknowledged the assistance
given by the police in the training of stewards in matters of
crowd control and management.


      It was also identified in paragraph 261,                           that the use of
ejection      from   a ground          rather     than    arrest    for    a     substantive
offence was based on apparent grounds of expediency.                                If that
observation was accurate,               it was recommended that consideration
be given to streamlining arrest procedures to encourage the use
of same without diverting the arresting officer from his post
for other than a minimum amount of time.


      The Committee considered that both these matters warranted
speedy development and commended them to the                             Forward Planning
Unit for assessment.             The response is awaited.


Written Statements of Intent (Rec. 11)

      Originally termed "Written Agreements" in Recommendation 4
of   the     Interim Report        by    Lord Justice Taylor,              the matter        of
Written      Statements     of    Intent        had generated much             dialogue     and
correspondence         between         forces,      the     Home        Office     and     this
Committee.


        In   an    effort   to     resolve         confusion       on    this     and    other
matters,       the    Chairman         met   with        Lord   Justice        Taylor.      The
discussion proved to be most informative. The clear intention of
the Judge emerged, simply that the football clubs and the police
should be         aware of their individual responsibilities to avoid
areas of duplicity and to ensure that there were no omissions of
responsibility.        The Judge absorbed the detail and the resultant
Final      Recommendation         11    clearly      resolved       the     confusion,       as
evinced in the Final Report.
      At     the        instigation             of     Lord      Justice        Taylor,        the
Sub-Committee undertook further areas of research and passed on
the detail he required.                  There were three areas of research:


      1.     The effect of the removal or partial removal
             of fencing at football clubs where this had
             occurred after the tragedy.


      2.     Detail          of     full       and     partial         membership
             schemes at football league clubs.


      3.     The use of attendance centres for offenders
             excluded             from       visiting        football       grounds
             under       Part           11    of      the     (then)        Football
             Spectators Bill.


      That    research            was    duly      completed        and    forwarded    to     Lord
Justice Taylor.


Ground Commander Training (Rec.52)

      The    Committee            noted      the     suggestion      in paragraph        215    and
Recommendation          52    of    the      Final     Report,       that    consideration       be
given to the provision of a specific Ground Commander's Training
Course and commended the merits of the proposal.


      Liaison had been maintained with David Graham, Chairman of
the A.C.P.O.       Personnel and Training Committee,                           to ensure       that
any   aspects      of    the       Final      Report        which    bore    implications       for
future training needs, were dealt with.


      As a result of that close liaison, a Working Party has been
convened      in    which          both       Committees        were        represented.        The
Chairman      is     Mr.          J.F.       CULLEY,        Assistant        Chief     Constable,
Nottinghamshire           and       this        Committee       is        represented     by    the
Secretary Malcolm GEORGE.

      A number of forces have prepared or are in the process of
preparing training courses and due cognizance will be taken of
the   merits      of    each.        Early      indications           favour       a    three-phase
approach of pre-reading of material by students, followed by the
course itself and finishing with hands-on experience in the home
force. It has yet to be decided whether the courses will be held
regionally,          centrally       or    at     two    or    more     designated            regional
centres;       the    content      and duration           of the        course         is    currently
being assessed.


All Ticket Matches (Rees. 40 & 47)


      Once      again,        this        Committee,          correctly          anticipated         the
recommendation of the Final Report. On 22nd September,                                       1989, the
Chairman wrote to all Chief Constables,                           England and Wales,                 and
highlighted problems identified with all-ticket fixtures.


        It was stressed that not only must ground capacities not be
exceeded       but     in    the   case      of    all    ticket        matches,            any   excess
number of fans without tickets much not be accommodated even if
there     is     space       in    the      stadium       to     do     so.        Moreover,         the
nationwide support for some of the largest clubs suggested that
in the absence of compelling reasons, viz. no ticket â no entry,
people     will       continue       to     arrive       without       bothering             to   obtain
tickets before hand.               The Ground Commanders were encouraged,                             in
their liaison with the football clubs, to seek that they refrain
from selling tickets on the day.


Football Supporters Club (Rec.31)

        At its meeting in May,                  1989, the Sub-Committee resolved to
meet with representatives of the National Federation of Football
Supporters           Clubs     following        their         request       to    meet        with   the
A.C.P.O.         The        Committee       also     initiated          a    meeting          with   the
Football Supporters Association.




                                                  - 7 -
      Though       Lord    Justice Taylor                did not            specifically        advocate
such liaison between the A.C.P.O.                        and the Supporters Clubs, the
desirability of regular contact is implicit in paragraph 152 and
rec. 31 of the Final Report.                       The views of the Associations are
relayed    to      forces        via       the     regional            representatives           on    the
Committee.       They      are      also         keen    to       maintain       the     dialogue;       a
further meeting is scheduled for Friday, 20th July, 1990.


Hand Signals

      This matter was suggested in the Interim Report but after
consultation with the Chairman of this Committee, the proposal
was rejected because of its impracticability.


Police Reserve (Rec.46)


      The requirement for a police reserve immediately available
for   rapid      deployment           in    emergencies,               was     first    intimated       in
Recommendation            28     of        the     Interim             Report.         The     Committee
originally         considered          that       such       a    requirement          could    best    be
provided      by    an    "uncommitted             reserve"            on     stand-by       within    the
Ground.      This had inherent implications for football clubs and
the   reimbursement            made        for     the       police          presence    at     football
fixtures.


      During a meeting of the Committee                                  in February this year,
the   interpretation             of     Clause          46       was    reassessed           against   the
backcloth of the previous discussions with Lord Justice Taylor
and the contents of the Final Report.                                  It was resolved that the
interpretation           of    an     "uncommitted               reserve"      was     too    inflexible
and   in   the      spirit       of    the       Report          it    was    concluded        that    this
provision of a reserve for public safety was best decided by the
Ground Commander in his operational planning for the fixture.


      This      suggestion was              communicated               to the A.C.P.O.            General
Purposes Committee, for the information of all Chief Constables.
Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (Rec.74)
(Green Guide)

     Consequent upon the recommendation of Lord Justice Taylor,
the Home   Office    are   currently   revising the       above    guide.      The
views of the A.C.P.O. have been sought via the SubâCommittee.


     All   Chief     Constables     have   been       circulated    and     their
responses will be collated.        A synopsis of those responses will
be forwarded to the Home Office as soon as possible.


     The   Working   Party,   to    enquire    into    the   revision     of   the
Guide, has been formed.       This SubâCommittee will be represented
by Commander Tony SPEED,       Public Order Department,            Metropolitan
Police.

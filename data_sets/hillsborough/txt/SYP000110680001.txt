Police Sergeant 616




I     have    been a    member    of     FI   Sub   Division,     for   some      eight    years    and

throughout that time have worked football duties as a Serial Sergeant, the

Police Room Sergeant and for the last four years have worked as the Police

Control        Sergeant     at     the        Sheffield     Wednesday         Football    Ground     at

Hillsborough under the command of Superintendent Freeman (now retired) and

Superintendent Murray.

I performed          this duty for the 1987 Semi-Final Coventry v Leeds, the 1988

Semi-Final Liverpool v Notts Forest and was again in the Control Box for

the    1989 Semi Final          between Liverpool         and Notts     Forest.     In addition to

the    three    above mentioned games I have performed the                      same duties at ALL

the big matches held at Hillsborough over the past four years.

My    duties    at     FI Sub Division are          as supervision of Community Constables

and I share an office with Inspector Sewell.                      Therefore I am very aware of

the planning and requirements necessary to Police matches at Hillsborough.

I have       also    performed    serial      duties   at   all   the   other    League   grounds    in

South Yorkshire.

On Saturday          15 April    1989,    I commenced duty at 8.00am              in Ground Control

which is situated in an elevated box between the South and West Stands and

which overlooks the Leppings Lane terraces.

Present       at this     time was       PC 1035 Ryan with whom I have worked this                 duty

for the       last     four years.        The   two other members        of the Control Box        team

are    PC     1370 Bichard       and     Superintendent     Murray      and    the four   of us    have

worked together          for the       full season.       There are specific duties allotted

to the members          of the Control Box, I control all the radio messages.                        PC

Ryan has the tannoy and telephones of which there are three viz.                             Internal

club phone, Police phone for internal and external use and a private phone

for external use only.

PC    Bichard      is    assigned        to    the   video     recorders            and    cameras    within    the

ground and to the use of a VHF hand set which has direct access to Force

Operations Room.

All the tasks mentioned are interchangeable.

During the early morning Roger Holdsworth tested camera 5 which is on the

West    Stand/Leppings            Lane    terraces       due   to    a     fault      on     the   camera.      The

picture      quality       he        obtained    although      was       not    of        normal   standard     was

acceptable.         Work was also going on on a Tannoy which is situated on the

boundary wall at the rear of the north side of the West Stand.                                         A test on

the tannoy was carried out and it was found to be working satisfactorily.

Other tannoy tests were made by PC Ryan within the ground and were found

to be in order, one of which was to                                             he groundsman.          He is in

the    centre     circle    and the words used               to him were to the effect                              E

thought you would have                 cut the       grass   by now'                                 Acknowledged

receipt      of    the   tannoy        message.         Also   in    use       in    the    Control    Box     is   a

message book in which any incident during a game would be noted.

However      on    Friday       14    April     1989,   I    had    seen    Superintendent            Murray    who

informed      me    that        the    Chief     Superintendent,           Mr       Duckenfield       required      a

specific message book.                  I discussed this with Superintendent Murray re an

additional        officer being present in the book to log such messages but we

came to      the joint conclusion that this was not feasible due to the size of

the box      and that we would do the log between us.

On the morning of the                  15th I opened the log but it was later taken over

solely by Superintendent Murray because of individual duties by myself and

the    two   others.        All this was very quiet and officers began to assemble

for the      briefing at 10.00am.               I believe that I timed the opening                       at 0959
hours and ending at 1018 hours.

At     10.00am    PC     Bichard            came    to     the     box    and    at        the    conclusion          of    the

briefing Superintendent Murray arrived.                                  I was informed by Superintendent

Murray that many serials were having their meal break but all would be out

on their respective                  points by 11.15am.                  With that         in mind I delayed the

test calls to all the Serial Sergeants and Inspectors.

Prior     to     11.00am         a     Tango       mobile        came    through       stating that              Liverpool

supporters       were       outside          the    Fox    pub     in    Foxhill       Road waiting             for    it to

open.      I was        aware        that    in the        1988 Semi Final the Fox                      had run out of

drink    and     there      was       quite     a lot       of publicity in local papers                        about       it.

Similar with Middlewood Tavern.

At   11.20am I began                 radio     checks      to Serial Sergeants                   and Inspectors.                 I

remember being constantly interrupted during this check and didn't finish

it until approximately 11.45am.

It   became      apparent            that    many     spectators          had    arrived          early    but    were          in

public    houses.           I     am    aware       that    the     gates       at    Leppings       Lane       opened          at

11.45am    and     there         was    a     trickle       of    spectators          on    to    the     terraces,         all

being    behind       the     Leppings         Lane       goal    in     the    central pens with                the large

majority of these spectators being young persons.

Between        approximately            12     noon      and     2pm     there       were    many radio          messages

received and transmitted, most of them being in relation to fans at public

houses    and     the    ones        that stand out              include       the Royal Hotel             on Penistone

Road/Bradfield          Road         where     Notts       Forest       supporters          had    gathered up             to    a

point where the pub closed because of the damage being done by supporters.

I believed        that Serial 60 had a lot of contact re this                                       and a number of

Tango mobiles attended because of things getting out of hand.                                               Traffic was

received       that     the     Special Constables                 were    having difficulty                in Neepsend

Lane    with     Forest         fans.        Tangos       despatched and the matter                       was    resolved.
There was an ambulance call to the White House pub, Halifax Road where a

Liverpool       fan    had        sat    on a broken                bottle       or   glass.            Reports       were    also

received       from    the        Tango        mobile          to   the     Wisewood/Wadsley                  arear re       large

numbers    of     Liverpool             fans       in    the Horse          and Jockey,            Beehive          and Wadsley

Jack pubs.

At this stage things were no different to the previous years semi final.

At   an unknown        time       but        certainly          after      the    gates          had    been opened Chief

Inspector       Creaser           came       into        the     Control      Box       and       asked        Superintendent

Murray     about        the        Leppings               Lane        terraces          and       it         was     stated     by

Superintendent Murray that                         the standing fans would find their own levels

in the pens rather than trying to fill one pen at a time.

At approximately 2pm Superintendent Murray left the Control Box in order

to see the referee which is normal practice.

He     returned       around        2.15pm              and    was     followed          into          the     box    by     Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield and the ACC, Mr Jackson.

I    noticed    that        the    Notts           Forest       end    (Spion         Kop     and      South        Stand)    were

filling    well       and    coming           to    capacity          but    the      Liverpool              and    North,    West

Stands    on    Lepping       Lane           terraces          were    COMPARATIVELY              empty        and I assumed

there should have probably been more people in those areas at that time.

I did see that the centre pens directly behind the Leppings Lane goal were

filling quite well but there was ample room in them.                                              This observation was

mentioned in the box because I believe we all felt that in comparison to

the Forest end, Liverpool seemed empty.

By 2.30pm PC Bichard I believe made mention                                        of large            crowds       in Leppings

Lane    outside       the    ground          and        on    looking upwards               at    the TV           screen I    saw

large    numbers       of    Liverpool              supporters            outside       the      ground        which I would

estimate at 3 ■ 4,000.

Only    once    before       have        I     seen       such      numbers       and    that          was    when Sheffield
                                               - 5 -




Wednesday played Coventry City in an FA Cup 6th Round match in 1987 when

the Coventry fans came to Sheffield in their thousands.

Around       this   time radio messages were coming thick and fast and any times

from this point can only               be estimated approximately.

A request came from the                Leppings Lane end asking for                  Leppings Laneto be

closed to traffic due to               the volume of persons in the road.

The radio system was operating on talk through and at around 2.35- 2.40pm

I received          calls    that my radio transmissions were                 poor and breaking up.

Within    seconds       of    hearing    this     a civilian communications             officer was     at

the    control       and    began     looking    at    the     equipment.      He   changed   the Tulip

Microphone          for a telephone handset             but the fault remained.           After a very

short        time     the back-up       set     with     the     telephone    handset    with    central

depression was taken into use by myself.                         The fixed ariel lead meant that

the base       station had          to be placed under the desk.               As a result the base

station had to remain                under the desk and this meant              that    the microphone

lead would not reach above                  the level of the desk top making it difficult

to use.        After only       two or three           calls with the handset,          which were not

acknowledged,         I believed        that    it was       faulty and I remember throwing the

handset on to the control desk.                   I took a normal hand held radio and from

that time all transmissions were relayed in that fashion.                              We were on talk

through so the use of a hand held radio provided the same service.

In    view     of    the     above    difficulties       I     asked   the   Communications      man    to

arrange for the Home Office Engineer to test the equipment on Monday.

2.40pm?        A    call     came    from     Superintendent       Marshall     requesting      that   the

Leppings Lane gates be opened because of the volume of persons outside.

Further      call    from Superintendent           Marshall       asking     for gates   to be opened

(means       Gate     C). Stated that people were being crushed against turnstiles

and if       gates were not opened someone would be killed.
                                                     - 6 -




I remember something being said about large numbers of non ticket holders

who would get in and cause serious problems for legitimate ticket holders.

Mr Marshall          again        came    through asking for gates                 to be         opened.        This was

not a request but an order.

Mr Murray asked Mr Duckenfield for his decision and he okayed the gates to

be    opened.         'C'    gate        was    opened but believed              at    this      time    it had been

forced and someone                said "They've broke through" I cannot remember if this

was a radio message or said in box.

Mounted       officers        retrieved              the   situation      and     only       a    few    persons       got

through.       More manpower deputed                       to Leppings Lane            including         mounted.      Mr

Marshall           again asked for gate to be re-opened a second time.                                     Gates were

opened       and    many     more        people       went      through   than        the    first      time.      Would

estimate many hundreds went through this time.

Radio traffic heavy and much distortion.

At approximately 2.52pm Sergeant Higgins of 'F' C & V came through saying

"The       gates    at      'A'    have        got    to   be    opened     as   if     not      somebody       will    be

killed."        On receipt of that I said words over                             the radio, "If           that is the

case we have no option open the gates."

The    'A' gate was opened and access to North Stand only was gained.                                             By the

time 'A'           gate opened the gates at 'C' had been closed.

During      this     time     I am unable              to say whether it was                before      or after       the

gates being opened PC 1863 Buxton came through asking for the                                             kick off to

be delayed.           As he        said    this the Liverpool team took                       to thefield and I

replied "It's too late one team is already on the field."

I    saw    that     in     the     Leppings          Lane   end    there    was       ample      room     in   the    pen

nearest the control box and the centre pens appeared full but not out of

the    ordinary for a big match of this kind.                                I did see            swaying in those

pens but again this is a regular occurrence on big match days.                                              I was not
                                                 - 7 -




aware that the game had started when a track officer on the Leppings Lane

end    came     through      with       an     unreadable       message.         I    then   saw a few people

climbing the fencing                  in the central pens area to                    get on to the pitch            and

at that time my first thought was "Christ                          there's           a pitch invasion."

Within seconds people started coming on to the track via a perimeter gate,

although        there    was      not    a      large     flood. Even           at    this   stage      I     did   not

realise       the enormity           of the problem and made comment about a Policewoman

who was on the track serial                     by Gate 1.        I would have anticipated                   that she

would have opened this gate                     to put the persons on the track back into the

outer pen.         Chief Inspector               McRobbie was in the                 Control Box at this time

and said words to the                 effect "I'll go and sort it out."

It    was   about       this      time    that    I   saw Superintendent                Greenwood       behind      the

Leppings Lane goal.                It was obvious he was trying to transmit but without

success.        I saw then he was waving his arms in a cross, across his body.

Many    officers        were      now    on     the   perimeter track           helping        people        from the

central pens.

It    was     approximately           3•05pm      when    Superintendent              Greenwood       came    through

"Stop the match, Stop the match" and I saw Superintendent Greenwood run on

to    the   field       of   play.        I didn't        see    the match           stopped    nor     the players

leave the field.

All    personnel        were      directed to the perimeter track at the Leppings Lane

end.        I   recall       PC    Bichard        going    via    VHF      to    Force       Control        requesting

ambulances - a fleet of ambulances.

Inspector        Charles       'C'      came    through requesting deployment of 5 and 50 at

his disposal.            I directed him to the tunnel Leppings Lane end to enter the

rear of the terraces.

A request came through for bolt croppers.                            I phoned Claywheels Lane asking

for some, to be told there was none.                            On completion of the call I said "No
                                                - 8 -



bolt    croppers,"         and    PC     Bichard       said    "Shall       I    get    the     Fire    Brigade"     I

didn't answer but just stuck my thumbs up.

Operation      Support          was     requested       and    I    remember       a     telephone       call   from

Operations saying "Is it you that's requested Operation Support" to which

I replied "Yes."

By   now    there        were    many       hundreds    of    people    on       the     playing       area   and   it

appeared     to     be    total       mayhem.      I saw Chief Superintendent                     Nesbit by the

goal at Leppings Lane and it was obvious he was in the midst of organising

things     in that        a tunnel was          formed and persons were being brought on to

the pitch.

I saw Police helmets              in the rear of central pens making their way to the

front and my thought was "John Charles and his teams."                                        People were still

climbing the perimeter fencing and many were being lifted up into the West

Stand      and my      thoughts        re    the access       to the stands was not                one of being

rescued from the crowd but getting up there so they could have a seat.

A Tango mobile which I believe was T.G. came through stating manpower was

required      in    Leppings          Lane    outside    the       ground       because    of    the    numbers     of

hostile Liverpool supporters and he assisted fire and ambulance personnel

with injured persons.

Throughout this time PC Ryan had been on the tannoy at the Liverpool end

requesting repeatedly that the supporters in the central pens move back to

allow injured persons to be brought from the terraces.                                        His pleas appeared

to be ignored.

I    remember      a     sole    supporter       dressed       in a black          'T'    shirt    run down         the

length of the pitch towards the Notts Forest end.                                      He stopped on the edge

of the 18 yard area and appeared to be gesturing to the Forest Supporters.

A Police Officer appeared and brought the youth down.

A cordon of Police               formed across the central line and was only broken to

        allow injured and            dead     spectators       being      carried on hoardings               through       to

        the Spion Kop end.              I remember PC 2988 Burkinshaw coming through on two

        occasions asking if control had any ideas where a temporary mortuary could

        be    set   up.        In the   second       occasion I believe Chief Inspector Beal came

        through saying that the gymnasium would be used.

        I would estimate            that many hundreds              of people were           on the pitch most of

        whom    were      being     attended to by Police and St John's Ambulance Personnel

        and    I    saw    a   number   being given mouth                to mouth resuscitation.                   At    some

        stage       Chief      Superintendent          Duckenfield          and    ACC    Mr    Jackson          left     the

        control,       Mr Duckenfield saying words to the effect "I've got to go to the

        boardroom."

        He did return some time later because the announcement that the match was

        abandoned had to be made and it had been decided not to say anything to

        the crowd so as to enable ambulances carrying the injured to have a clear

        run.        I remember Mr Nesbit             coming through stating "You have got to tell

        the crowd that the match is abandoned and to go" and it was Superintendent

        Murray who went on tannoy and announced to the crowd that the match was

        abandoned.             I   cannot    remember       his     exact     words      but    it   started           "Please

        retain       your      tickets..."        At    the        end   of   the     announcement           I    heard     an

        applause throughout the ground.

        Prior to this both Brian Clough and Kenny Dalglish had been in the Control

        and Mr Clough asked certain questions of Chief Superintendent Duckenfield

        and stated          if there        was anything you want,                you know where I am.                   Kenny

        Dalglish          attempted     to    talk     to    the     Liverpool        fans     via     tannoy      but     was

        unsuccessful           and PC Ryan took him down to the DJ's box where he made an

        announcement.

        The     front areas of the centre pens were cleared and I saw what I thought

        was     part      of   a   barrier     having       been    broken     and    was      lying    on       the    track.
                                        - 10 -




However,    this could have been a piece of hoarding.                    The pitch was finally

cleared of the dead and injured and the crowds left the stadium.

There    were    isolated   reports     of    fighting between rival         supporters    in the

Hillsborough Park       area but       nothing      untoward and       supporters   went   quickly

home.      A message    had earlier          been   passed     that   the Liverpool   supporters

were to be treated with sympathy and understanding.

I remained in the Police Control               until approximately 10.30pm that evening

attempting for much of the time to relay messages to the Northern General

Hospital    (officer on duty there PC 3082 Fletcher).                   I was then informed I

was    required to attend a meeting             at Headquarters.         On leaving the box I

went    to the    gymnasium where       I saw a number of Senior Officers              including

the Chief Constable, Mr Wright,               plus many, many officers dealing with the

lines of deceased on the gymnasium floor.                    I then saw Chief Superintendent

Nesbit and informed him that I would be going to Headquarters.                         He stated

that a meeting at that time of night after such a day was pointless.                          I am

aware    that he sought the advice of the Chief Constable on this matter and

he informed me the meeting would not go ahead.

I have     always   held    the belief and still do that               the SWFC stadium is as

WELL POLICED as any ground in the country and is MUCH BETTER POLICED than

most with consideration given to away supporters who on normal matches are

not    shepherded    into   a quiet     corner      of   the   ground nor    are they detained

after    the match     as   is   the   case    in many     football     grounds   throughout the

country.

The question therefore is why did such a disaster occur and I can only put

it down to three causes :

a)     Overcrowding in the central pens.

b)     The collapse of a barrier.

c)     The late arrival of the Liverpool supporters.
It will be seen that I have not included the opening of the gates because

I    believe       that      Superintendent              Marshall       had no alternative           other than to

ask    them       to   be    opened         and     the    Chief    Superintendent        who     gave    the    order

obviously and rightly believed that the gates required to be opened.

One thing does come to mind here and that is stewards or should I                                             say lack

of stewards in the standing areas of SWFC.

From    the Control Box                it    is easy to see around the ground and the South,

North and West Stands are more than                              adequately stewarded with the stewards

being easily identifiable by their yellow tabards.                                      However,      on the Spion

Kop    and Leppings             Lane      terraces        there     are no stewards           or should I say I

have    never       seen a steward.                 I know this matter has been brought up with

the    Club       in earlier years                 and    attached       to this    report      is a typewritten

agenda        prepared I            believe by           Inspector       Calvert when     he     organised       the

football duties at Hillsborough.                               Certain points on that agenda have been

implemented by the Club.

In    relation         to     (a)    it      is obvious          that    the   supporters      used      the    centre

tunnel         to      gain access.            I do      not   even remember          the      tunnel gates being

closed      before        and    the        only    times      a serial manned          the    tunnel was        a   few

years       ago     when     both      home        and    away    supporters       were   allowed        to    use   the

Leppings Lane terraces and West Stand.                                  The reason for the Police presence

was segregation of fans and had nothing to do with safety.

In relation to (b) and (c) there is nothing I can say except hopefully the

public            inquiry will         make        their       findings    known.         When    one talks      about

feelings,         it is only after the event can one realise the scale yet whilst

it was happening I felt a feeling of total disbelief witnessing the events

before my          eyes - that            this     can't happen at Hillsborough but with things

going on at such a pace I do not believe that I had the time to take it

all    in    and       the    events        and     incidents      I have      outlined       form    only a small
                                          - 12 -




portion of what took place that afternoon when a minute seemed an eternity

and an    hour a split second.

One thing that does         remain vividly in         my mind is the actions of the Police

Officers,     the   Special      Constables     and    the    St   John's    Ambulance     plus    all

unknown persons who ferried the dead and injured away from the perimeter

track.

I have      always been proud of being a member of the South Yorkshire                        Police

and   I     feel    humble that    I     could beassociated        with     those   persons   who

performed     heroics      not    just    on   the    field    but    in    the     gymnasium,     the

hospitals     and    the   centres       for   the    relatives      throughout      the   night    of

Saturday 15 April 1989-

MICHAEL GODDARD




Police Sergeant 616



I   have   been   a   member   of    FI   Sub   Division,    for   some   eight    years      and

throughout that time have worked football duties as a Serial Sergeant, the

Police Room Sergeant and for the last four years have worked as the Police

Control     Sergeant     at    the     Sheffield     Wednesday      Football      Ground       at

Hillsborough under the command of Superintendent Freeman (now retired) and

Superintendent Murray.

I performed this duty for the 1987 Semi-Final Coventry v Leeds, the 1988

Semi-Final Liverpool v Notts Forest and was again in the Control Box for

the 1989 Semi Final between Liverpool and Notts Forest.                    In addition to

the three above mentioned games I have performed the same duties at ALL

the big matches held at Hillsborough over the past four years.

My duties at Fl Sub Division are as supervision of Community Constables

and I share an office with Inspector Sewell.                Therefore I am very aware of

the planning and requirements necessary to Police matches at Hillsborough.

I have also performed serial duties at all the other League grounds in

South Yorkshire.

On Saturday 15 April 1 9 8 9 , I commenced duty at 8.00am in Ground Control

which is situated in an elevated box between the South and West Stands and

which overlooks the Leppings Lane terraces.

Present at this time was PC 1035 Ryan with whom I have worked this duty

for the last four years.             The two other members of the Control Box team

are PC     1370 Bichard and Superintendent Murray              and the four of us have

worked together for the full season.               There are specific duties allotted

to the members of the Control Box, I control all the radio messages.                           PC

Ryan has the tannoy and telephones of which there are three viz.                       Internal
                                              - 2 -




club phone, Police phone for internal and external use and a private phone

for external use only.

PC   Bichard     is    assigned       to    the   video     recorders         and       cameras    within    the

ground and to the use of a VHF hand set which has direct access to Force

Operations Room.

All the tasks mentioned are interchangeable.

During the early morning Roger Holdsworth tested camera 5 which is on the

West   Stand/Leppings          Lane    terraces       due   to    a     fault      on    the   camera.       The

picture    quality       he    obtained       although      was       not    of     normal     standard      was

acceptable.       Work was also going on on a Tannoy which is situated on the

boundary wall at the rear of the north side of the West Stand.                                      A test on

the tannoy was carried out and it was found to be working satisfactorily.

Other tannoy tests were made by PC Ryan within the ground and were found

to be in order, one of which was to                                          the groundsman.         He is in

the centre circle and the words used to him were to the effect                                        '

thought you would have cut the grass by now'                                                      acknowledged

receipt    of    the   tannoy       message.        Also    in use          in    the    Control    Box     is   a

message book in which any incident during a game would be noted.

However    on Friday          14   April    1989,     I had      seen    Superintendent            Murray    who

informed    me    that    the       Chief    Superintendent,            Mr       Duckenfield       required      a

specific message book.              I discussed this with Superintendent Murray re an

additional officer being present in the book to log such messages but we

came to the joint conclusion that this was not feasible due to the size of

the box and that we would do the log between us.

On the morning of the 15th I opened the log but it was later taken over

solely by Superintendent Murray because of individual duties by myself and

the two others.          All this was very quiet and officers began to assemble

for the briefing at 10.00am.                  I believe that I timed the opening at 0959
                                                 - 3 -




hours and ending at 1018 hours.

At   10.00am     PC    Bichard           came    to     the    box    and    at     the    conclusion     of     the

briefing Superintendent Murray arrived.                              I was informed by Superintendent

Murray that many serials were having their meal break but all would be out

on their respective points by 11.15am.                               With that in mind I delayed the

test calls to all the Serial Sergeants and Inspectors.

Prior    to    11.00am        a    Tango        mobile      came     through       stating      that    Liverpool

supporters      were     outside          the    Fox    pub    in    Foxhill Road waiting              for it to

open.     I was       aware       that    in the        1988 Semi Final the Fox had run out of

drink and       there was          quite a lot           of publicity in local papers about it.

Similar with Middlewood Tavern.

At   11.20am I began radio checks                       to Serial Sergeants               and Inspectors.          I

remember being constantly interrupted during this check and didn't finish

it until approximately 11.45am.

It   became     apparent          that    many    spectators          had    arrived       early but     were     in

public    houses.        I    am aware           that    the     gates      at    Leppings      Lane    opened    at

11.45am   and     there       was    a trickle of             spectators on to the              terraces,        all

being behind the          Leppings Lane                goal    in the       central       pens with the large

majority of these spectators being young persons.

Between       approximately          12    noon       and     2pm    there       were    many   radio    messages

received and transmitted, most of them being in relation to fans at public

houses and the ones               that stand out              include the Royal Hotel on Penistone

Road/Bradfield Road               where     Notts       Forest      supporters          had gathered up to a

point where the pub closed because of the damage being done by supporters.

I believed that Serial 60 had a                          lot of contact                 re this and a number of

Tango mobiles attended because of things getting out of hand. Traffic                                            was

received that         the Special Constables                   were    having difficulty           in Neepsend

Lane    with    Forest       fans.        Tangos       despatched and the matter was resolved.
                                                     - 4 -




There was an ambulance call to the White House pub, Halifax Road where a

Liverpool      fan      had sat          on a broken           bottle       or glass.           Reports    were    also

received       from     the Tango             mobile       tothe    Wisewood/Wadsley             arear    re    large

numbers    of Liverpool             fans          in the Horse        and Jockey,          Beehive       and Wadsley

Jack pubs.

At     this stage things were no different to the previous years semifinal.

At     an unknown time but certainly                        after     the    gates       had been opened          Chief

Inspector       Creaser           came       into    the     Control        Box    and     asked Superintendent

Murray     about        the         Leppings          Lane         terraces and            it     was     stated     by

Superintendent Murray that the standing fans would find their own levels

in     the pens rather than trying to fill one pen at a time.

At     approximately 2pm Superintendent Murray left the Control Box                                            in order

to see the referee which is normal practice.

He     returned       around        2.15pm          and was        followed        into    the      box    by     Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield and the ACC, Mr Jackson.

I    noticed    that        the    Notts          Forest    end (Spion Kop           and    South Stand)          were

filling    well       and    coming          to    capacity     but    the        Liverpool      and North,        West

Stands    on    Lepping           Lane       terraces were COMPARATIVELY                  empty     and I assumed

there should have probably been more people in those areas at that time.

I did see that the centre pens directly behind the Leppings Lane goal were

filling quite well but there was ample room in them.                                       This observation was

mentioned in the box because I believe we all felt that in comparison to

the Forest end, Liverpool seemed empty.

By 2.30pm PC Bichard I believe made mention of large crowds in Leppings

Lane    outside       the    ground          and on looking upwards                 at the TV           screen I saw

large    numbers       of Liverpool                supporters       outside        the ground which I would

estimate at 3 - 4,000.

Only    once    before       have        I    seen    such    numbers       and that was when Sheffield
                                           - 5 -




Wednesday played Coventry City in an FA Cup 6th Round match in 19 87 when

the Coventry fans came to Sheffield in their thousands.

Around this time radio messages were coming thick and fast and any times

from this        point can only be estimated approximately.

A request        came from the Leppings Lane end asking for Leppings Lane                    to   be

closed to        traffic due to the volume of persons in the road.

The radio        system was operating on talk through and ataround 2.35                    - 2.40pm

I received calls            that my radio transmissions were poor and breaking up.

Within    seconds         of hearing this     a civilian communications officer was at

the    control      and began      looking    at    the    equipment.     He   changed   the Tulip

Microphone         for a telephone handset but the fault remained.                  After a very

short     time      the    back-up   set     with    the    telephone     handset   with    central

depression was taken into use by myself.                     The fixed ariel lead meant that

the base station had to be placed under the desk.                          As a result the base

station had to remain under the desk and this meant that the microphone

lead would not reach above the level of the desk top making it difficult

to use.       After only two or three calls with the handset, which were not

acknowledged,        I believed      that it was faulty and I remember throwing the

handset on to the control desk.                I took a normal hand held radio and from

that time all transmissions were relayed in that fashion.                        We were on talk

through so the use of a hand held radio provided the same service.

In    view    of    the    above   difficulties       I    asked   the   Communications     man    to

arrange for the Home Office Engineer to test the equipment on Monday.

2.40pm?       A     call    came   from    Superintendent      Marshall    requesting      that   the

Leppings Lane gates be opened because of the volume of persons outside.

Further      call    from Superintendent Marshall             asking     for gates to be opened

(means Gate C).            Stated that people were being crushed against turnstiles

and if gates were not opened someone would be killed.
                                               - 6 -




I remember something being said about large numbers of non ticket holders

who would get in and cause serious problems for legitimate ticket holders.

Mr Marshall again came through asking for gates                              to be opened.            This was

not a request but an order.

Mr Murray asked Mr Duckenfield for his decision and he okayed the gates to

be    opened.        'C'    gate   was    opened but believed at                this    time    it had been

forced and someone said "They've broke through" I cannot remember if this

was a radio message or said in box.

Mounted       officers       retrieved         the   situation      and    only    a     few    persons       got

through.            More manpower deputed            to Leppings Lane           including mounted.            Mr

Marshall        again asked for gate             to be re-opened a second time.                 Gates were

opened      and     many    more   people       went      through   than     the   first       time.     Would

estimate many hundreds went through this time.

Radio traffic heavy and much distortion.

At approximately 2.52pm Sergeant Higgins of 'F' C & V came through saying

"The       gates    at     'A'   have    got    to   be    opened     as   if    not    somebody       will    be

killed."        On receipt of that I said words over the radio,                            "If that     is the

case we have no option open the gates."

The    'A' gate was opened and access to North Stand only was gained.                                   By the

time 'A'           gate opened thegates at 'C' had been closed.

During this         time     I am unable         to say whether it was before                  or after       the

gates being opened PC 1863 Buxton came through asking                                   for the kick    off to

be delayed.           As he said this the Liverpool team took                            to the field and I

replied "It's too late one team is already on the field."

I    saw    that     in    the   Leppings       Lane   end    there    was      ample    room    in    the    pen

nearest the control box and the centre pens appeared full but not out of

the ordinary          for a big match of this kind.                    I did see swaying in those

pens but again this is a regular occurrence on big match days.                                     I was not
                                               - 7 -




aware that the game had started when a track officer on the Leppings Lane

end    came     through    with       an unreadable message.                I then saw a few people

climbing the fencing                 in the central pens area to get on to the pitch                        and

at that time my first thought was "Christ there's                               a pitch invasion."

Within seconds people started coming on to the track via a perimeter gate,

although        there    was    not     a   large      flood.    Even      at    this   stage     I      did not

realise the enormity of the problem and made comment about a Policewoman

who was on the track serial                   by Gate 1.        Iwould have anticipated                 that she

would have opened this gate                   to put the persons on the track back into the

outer pen.         Chief Inspector McRobbie was in the                          Control Box at thistime

and said words to the effect "I'll go and sort it out."

It    was   about       this    time    that    I   saw Superintendent             Greenwood      behind     the

Leppings Lane goal.              It was obvious he was trying to transmit but without

success.        I saw then he was waving his arms in a cross, across his body.

Many    officers        were    now    on     the   perimeter track helping              people         from the

central pens.

It    was   approximately            3.05pm    when     Superintendent           Greenwood      came    through

"Stop the match, Stop the match" and I saw Superintendent Greenwood run on

to the      field of play.              I didn't       see   the match stopped nor                the players

leave the field.

All personnel           were    directed to the perimeter track at the Leppings Lane

end.        I   recall     PC    Bichard       going     via    VHF   to    Force       Control       requesting

ambulances - a fleet of ambulances.

Inspector Charles              'C'    came through requesting deployment of 5 and 50 at

his disposal.           I directed him to the tunnel Leppings Lane end to enter the

rear of the terraces.

A request came through for bolt croppers.                         I phoned Claywheels Lane asking

for some, to be told there was none.                         On completion of the call I said "No
                                         - 8 -



bolt   croppers,"    and    PC     Bichard    said      "Shall    I   get   the    Fire    Brigade"     I

didn't answer but just stuck my thumbs up.

Operation    Support      was     requested      and    I    remember   a   telephone       call     from

Operations saying "Is it you that's requested Operation Support" to which

I replied "Yes."

By   now   there   were    many    hundreds      of    people    on   the   playing       area    and   it

appeared to be      total mayhem.            I saw Chief Superintendent              Nesbit by the

goal at Leppings Lane and it was obvious he was in the midst of organising

things in that a tunnel was formed and persons were being brought on to

the pitch.

I saw Police helmets in the rear of central pens making their way to the

front and my thought was "John Charles and his teams."                            People were still

climbing the perimeter fencing and many were being                      lifted up into the West

Stand and my       thoughts re         the access       to the stands was not             one of being

rescued from the crowd but getting up there so they could have a seat.

A Tango mobile which I believe was T.G. came through stating manpower was

required    in Leppings         Lane   outside    the       ground because    of    the numbers         of

hostile Liverpool supporters and he assisted fire and ambulance personnel

with injured persons.

Throughout this time PC Ryan had been on the tannoy at the Liverpool end

requesting repeatedly that the supporters in the central pens move back to

allow injured persons to be brought from the terraces.                        His pleas appeared

to be ignored.

I remember     a   sole    supporter      dressed       in a black      'T'   shirt       run down the

length of the pitch towards the Notts Forest end.He stopped on                                   the edge

of the 18 yard area and appeared to be gesturing to the Forest Supporters.

A Police Officer appeared and brought the youth down.

A cordon of Police formed across the central line and was only broken to
                                          - 9 -



allow injured and dead spectators being                       carried -on hoardings through to

the Spion Kop end.            I remember PC 2988 Burkinshaw coming through on two

occasions asking if control had any ideas where a temporary mortuary could

be    set up.     In    the   second occasion I believe Chief Inspector Beal came

through saying that the gymnasium would be used.

I would estimate         that many hundreds of people were on the pitch most of

whom were being attended to by Police and St John's Ambulance Personnel

and I     saw a number being           given mouth           to mouth resuscitation.                   At    some

stage    Chief     Superintendent         Duckenfield           and    ACC    Mr     Jackson         left     the

control, Mr Duckenfield saying words to the effect "I've got to go to the

boardroom."

He did return some time later because the announcement that the match was

abandoned had to be made and it had been decided not to say anything to

the crowd so as to enable ambulances carrying the injured to have a clear

run.     I remember Mr Nesbit coming through stating "You have got to tell

the crowd that the match is abandoned and to go" and it was Superintendent

Murray who went on tannoy and announced to the crowd that the match was

abandoned.        I    cannot      remember      his    exact     words      but    it   started           "Please

retain    your    tickets..."          At     the      end   of   the     announcement           I    heard     an

applause throughout the ground.

Prior to this both Brian Clough and Kenny Dalglish had been in the Control

and Mr Clough asked certain questions of Chief Superintendent Duckenfield

and stated if there was anything you want,                            you know where I am.                   Kenny

Dalglish       attempted      to   talk     to   the     Liverpool        fans     via     tannoy      but     was

unsuccessful and PC Ryan took him down to the DJ's box where he made an

announcement.

The front areas of the centre pens were cleared and I saw what I thought

was     part    of a barrier        having been         broken     and was         lying    on       the    track.
                                        - 10 -




However,    this could have been a piece of hoarding.               The pitch was finally

cleared of the dead and injured and the crowds left the stadium.

There    were   isolated reports        of fighting between rival supporters in the

Hillsborough Park       area but nothing untoward and supporters              went quickly

home.      A message    had earlier been passed          that   the Liverpool    supporters

were to be treated with sympathy and understanding.

I remained in the Police Control until approximately 10.30pm that evening

attempting for much of the time to relay messages to the Northern General

Hospital    (officer on duty there PC 3082 Fletcher).              I was then informed I

was required to attend a meeting at Headquarters.                   On leaving the box I

went to the gymnasium where I saw a number of Senior Officers including

the Chief Constable, Mr Wright, plus many, many officers dealing with the

lines of deceased on the gymnasium floor.               I then saw Chief Superintendent

Nesbit and informed him that I would be going to Headquarters.                   He stated

that a meeting at that time of night after such a day was pointless.                   I am

aware that he sought the advice of the Chief Constable on this matter and

he informed me the meeting would not go ahead.

I have     always held      the belief and still do that the SWFC stadium is as

WELL POLICED as any ground in the country and is MUCH BETTER POLICED than

most with consideration given to away supporters who on normal matches are

not   shepherded     into   a quiet     corner of the     ground nor are they detained

after    the match     as   is   the   case   in many   football   grounds   throughout the

country.

The question therefore is why did such a disaster occur and I can only put

it down to three causes :

a)    Overcrowding in the central pens.

b)    The collapse of a barrier.

c)    The late arrival of the Liverpool supporters.
                                                    - 11 -




It will be seen that I have not included the opening of the gates because

I believe       that Superintendent Marshall                    had no alternative other than to

ask   them     to be     opened        and    the    Chief    Superintendent            who gave     the order

obviously and rightly believed that the gates required to be opened.

One thing does come to mind hereand that is stewards or                                   should I      say lack

of stewards in the standing                   areas of SWFC.

From the Control Box it is easy                       to see around the ground and                 the South,

North and West Stands are more than adequately stewarded with the                                       stewards

being easily identifiable by their yellow tabards.                                  However, on the Spion

Kop and Leppings              Lane    terraces       there    are no stewards or should I say I

have never seen a steward.                     I know this matter has been brought up with

the Club       in earlier years               and attached         to    this report        is a typewritten

agenda       prepared     I    believe        by    Inspector       Calvert        when    he   organised      the

football duties at Hillsborough.                       Certain points on that agenda have been

implemented by the Club.

In    relation     to    (a)     it     is    obvious       that   the     supporters       used   the     centre

tunnel       to gain     access.            I do not        even remember         the     tunnel gates being

closed before           and    the     only    times    a serial manned             the    tunnel was      a few

years    ago    when     both        home     and    away    supporters          were   allowed    to    use   the

Leppings Lane terraces and West Stand.                          The reason for the Police presence

was segregation of fans and had nothing to do with safety.

In relation to (b) and (c) there is nothing I can say except hopefully the

public       inquiry     will        make    their    findings          known.      When    one    talks    about

feelings,       it is only after the event can one realise the scale yet whilst

it was happening I felt a feeling of total disbelief witnessing the events

before my eyes - that this can't happen at Hillsborough but with things

going on at such a pace I do not believe that I had the time to take it

all     in   and   the    events       and     incidents I have            outlined        form only a small
portion of what took place that afternoon when a minute seemed an eternity

and an hour a split second.

One thing that does remain vividly            in my mind is the actions of the Police

Officers,    the   Special     Constables     and    the   St   John's    Ambulance      plus    all

unknown persons who ferried the dead and injured away from the perimeter

track.

I have always been proud of being a member of the South Yorkshire Police

and   I   feel   humble that     I   could    be associated       with     those    persons      who

performed    heroics     not    just    on   the field     but    in     the   gymnasium,        the

hospitals    and   the   centres       for   the    relatives    throughout        the   night    of

Saturday 15 April 1989-                             -----------------------------------

MICHAEL GODDARD




Police Sergeant 616                                                                       r




I     have    been    a    member     of    FI     Sub    Division,     for       some   eight    years      and

throughout that time have worked football duties as a Serial Sergeant, the

Police Room Sergeant and for the last four years have worked as the Police

Control       Sergeant         at     the        Sheffield     Wednesday          Football       Ground      at

Hillsborough under the command of Superintendent Freeman (now retired) and

Superintendent Murray.

I performed this duty for the 1987 Semi-Final Coventry v Leeds,                                    the 1988

Semi-Final Liverpool v Notts Forest and was again in the Control Box for

the 1989 Semi Final between Liverpool and Notts Forest.                                   In addition to

the three above mentioned games I have performed the same duties at ALL

the big matches held at Hillsborough over the past four years.

My duties       at FI Sub Division are as supervision of Community Constables

and I share an office with Inspector Sewell.                          Therefore I am very aware of

the planning and requirements necessary to Police matches at Hillsborough.

I have       also performed serial               duties   at all      the    other League        grounds in

South Yorkshire.

On Saturday 15 April            1989,       I commenced duty at 8.00am in Ground Control

which is situated in an elevated box between the South and West Stands and

which overlooks the Leppings Lane terraces.

Present at this time was PC 1035 Ryan with whom I have worked this duty

for the last four years.                   The    two other members of the Control Box team

are    PC    1370    Bichard    and Superintendent             Murray       and    the   four of us have

worked together for the full season.                         There are specific duties allotted

to the members of the Control Box, I control all the radio messages.                                         PC

Ryan has the tannoy and telephones of which there are three viz.                                   Internal
club phone, Police phone for internal and external use and a private phone

for external use only.

PC   Bichard     is    assigned     to   the   video     recorders        and        cameras    within    the

ground and to the use of a VHF hand set which has direct access to Force

Operations Room.

All the tasks mentioned are interchangeable.

During the early morning Roger Holdsworth tested camera 5 which is on the

West   Stand/Leppings        Lane    terraces     due    to    a    fault       on    the   camera.       The

picture    quality      he   obtained      although      was       not    of    normal      standard      was

acceptable.       Work was also going on on a Tannoy which is situated on the

boundary wall at the rear of the north side of the West Stand.                                   A test on

the tannoy was carried out and it was found to be working satisfactorily.

Other tannoy tests were made by PC Ryan within the ground and were found

to be in order, one of which was to                                      the groundsman.          He is in

the centre circle and the words used to him were to the effect

thought you would have cut the grass by now1                                                   acknowledged

receipt    of    the    tannoy    message.        Also    in use         in    the    Control     Box    is   a

message book in which any incident during a game would be noted.

However         on Friday 14 April        1989,    I had      seen       Superintendent Murray           who

informed    me     thatthe    Chief      Superintendent,       Mr        Duckenfield           required       a

specific message book.            I discussed this with Superintendent Murray re an

additional officer being present in the book to log such messages but we

came to     the jointconclusion           that this was not feasible due to the size of

the box    andthat we would do           the log between us.

On the morning of the 15th I opened the log but it was later taken over

solely by Superintendent Murray because of individual duties by myself and

the two others.          All this was very quiet and officers began to assemble

for the briefing at 10.00am.               I believe that I timed the opening at 0959
                                                  - 3 -




hours and ending at 1018 hours.

At   10.00am      PC    Bichard        came       to     the    box    and        at   the    conclusion       of    the

briefing Superintendent Murray arrived.                               I was informed by Superintendent

Murray that many serials were having their meal break but all would be out

on their respective                points by 11.15am.                 With that in mind I delayed the

test calls to all the Serial Sergeants and Inspectors.

Prior    to     11.00am        a    Tango        mobile      came     through          stating      that     Liverpool

supporters       were    outside           the    Fox pub      in Foxhill          Road        waiting      for   it to

open.     I was        aware       that     in the 1988 Semi Final the                        Fox had run out of

drink and       there was          quite     a lot        of publicity in local papers about                         it.

Similar with Middlewood Tavern.

At   11.20am I began               radio    checks to Serial Sergeants                        and Inspectors.          I

remember being constantly interrupted during this check and didn't finish

it until approximately 11.45am.

It   became     apparent           thatmany       spectators          had    arrived           early   but     were in

public    houses.         I    am aware           that    the     gates      at Leppings            Lane    opened    at

11.45am    and    there, was          a trickle           of    spectators         on to the         terraces,       all

being behind         the Leppings           Lane       goal     in the       central         pens   with the large

majority of these spectators being young persons.

Between       approximately           12    noon       and     2pm    there       were    many      radio     messages

received and transmitted, most of them being in relation to fans at public

houses and the ones                that stand out              include      the Royal Hotel            on Penistone

Road/Bradfield          Road       where    Notts        Forest      supporters          had gathered up to a

point where the pub closed because of the damage being done by supporters.

I believed that Serial 60 had a lot of contact re this and a number of

Tango mobiles attended because of things getting out of hand.                                              Traffic was

received      that     the     Special Constables               were     having difficulty                 in Neepsend

Lane     with    Forest       fans.        Tangos        despatched         and    the matter        was resolved.

There was an ambulance call to the White House pub, Halifax Road where a

Liverpool       fan    had        sat        on a broken        bottle         or glass.         Reports    were    also

received       from    the        Tango        mobile        tothe    Wisewood/Wadsley            arear re     large

numbers    of Liverpool              fans          in the Horse          and Jockey,          Beehive     and Wadsley

Jack pubs.

At this stage things were no different to the previous years semi final.

At   an unknown        time       but        certainly       after       the   gates     had been opened Chief

Inspector       Creaser           came       into     the     Control      Box    and      asked    Superintendent

Murray     about       the          Leppings            Lane         terraces and          it     was      stated     by

Superintendent Murray that the standing fans would find their                                               own levels

in the pens rather than trying to                            fill     one pen at a time.

At approximately 2pm Superintendent Murray left the Control Box in order

to see the referee which is normal practice.

He     returned       around        2.15pm           andwas     followed         into      the      box      by Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield and the ACC, Mr Jackson.

I    noticed    that        the    Notts           Forest    end     (Spion Kop         and     South     Stand)    were

filling    well       and    coming           to    capacity       but    the    Liverpool        and North,        West

Stands    on Lepping          Lane           terraces        were     COMPARATIVELY            empty        andI assumed

there should have probably been more people in those areas at that time.

I did see that the centre pens directly behind the Leppings Lane goal were

filling quite well but there was ample room in them.                                       This observation was

mentioned in the box because I believe we all felt that in comparison to

the Forest end, Liverpool seemed empty.

By 2.30pm PC Bichard I believe made mention of large                                           crowds     in Leppings

Lane    outside       the    ground          and on         looking upwards         at     the TV       screen I saw

large    numbers       of Liverpool                 supporters        outside the        ground which I would

estimate at 3 - 4,000.

Only    once    before       have        I    seen     such    numbers         and that was         when Sheffield
                                              . 5 -




Wednesday played Coventry City in an FA Cup 6th Round match in 19 87 when

the Coventry fans came to Sheffield in their thousands.

Around this time radio messages were coming thick and fast and any times

from this        point can only               be estimated approximately.

A request        came from the Leppings Lane end asking for LeppingsLane to                           be

closed to        traffic due to               the volume of persons in the road.

The radio        system was operating on talk through and at around 2.35- 2.40pm

I received         calls    that my radio transmissions were poor and breaking up.

Within    seconds         of hearing    this     a civilian communications officer was at

the    control      and    began   looking      at    the     equipment.     He   changed   the Tulip

Microphone         for a telephone handset but the fault remained.                     After a very

short     time      the    back-up     set     with     the    telephone     handset   with    central

depression was taken into use by myself.                        The fixed ariel lead meant that

the base station had to be placed under the desk.                             As a result the base

station had to remain under the desk and this meant that the microphone

lead would not reach above the level of the desk top making it difficult

to use.       After only two or three                 calls with the handset, which were not

acknowledged,        I believed        that    it was       faulty and I remember throwing the

handset on to the control desk.                  I took a normal hand held radio and from

that time all transmissions were relayed in that fashion.                           We were on talk

through so the use of a hand held radio provided the same service.

In    view    of    the    above   difficulties         I     asked   the   Communications     man    to

arrange for the Home Office Engineer to test the equipment on Monday.

2.40pm?       A     call    came   from      Superintendent       Marshall    requesting      that   the

Leppings Lane gates be opened because of the volume of persons outside.

Further      call    from Superintendent Marshall                asking     for gates to be opened

(means Gate C).            Stated that people were being crushed against turnstiles

and if gates were not opened someone would be killed.
                                               - 6 -




I remember something being said about large numbers of non ticket holders

who would get in and cause serious problems for legitimate ticket holders.

Mr Marshall again came through asking for gates to be opened.                                           This was

not a request but an order.

Mr Murray asked Mr Duckenfield for his decision and he okayed the gates to

be opened.            'C'    gate was     opened but         believed at this            time    it had been

forced and someone said "They've broke through" I cannot remember if this

was a radio message or said in box.

Mounted        officers       retrieved        the   situation      and    only    a     few     persons       got

through.            More    manpower deputed         to Leppings Lane           including       mounted.       Mr

Marshall        again asked for gate             to be re-opened a second time.                  Gates were

opened        and    many    more   people      went      through   than     the   first        time.      Would

estimate many hundreds went through this time.

Radio traffic heavy and much distortion.

At approximately 2.52pm Sergeant Higgins of 'F' C & V came through saying

"The        gates    at     'A'   have   got    to   be    opened     as   if    not    somebody        will    be

killed."        On receipt of that I said words over the radio,                            "If that is the

case we have no option open the gates."

The    'A' gate was opened and access to North Stand only was gained.                                     By the

time 'A'        gate opened the gates            at 'C' had been closed.

During this          time     I am unable        to say whether it was before                   or after       the

gates being opened PC 1863 Buxton came through asking                                   for the kick off to

be delayed.            As he said this the Liverpool team took                           to thefield and I

replied "It's too late one team is already on the field."

I     saw    that     in    the   Leppings      Lane   end    there    was      ample    room     in    the    pen

nearest the control box and the centre pens appeared full but not out of

the ordinary           for a big match of this kind.                   I did see swaying in those

pens but again this is a regular occurrence on big match days.                                      I was not
                                               - 7 -




aware that the game had started when a track officer on the Leppings Lane

end    came     through    with        an unreadable message.              I then    saw a few people

climbing the fencing                 in the central pens area to            get on to the pitch           and

at that time my first thought was "Christ there's a pitch invasion."

Within seconds people started coming on to the track via a perimeter gate,

although        there    was    not     a      large    flood. Even    at    this   stage     I     did   not

realise the enormity of the problem and made comment about a Policewoman

who was on the track serial                    by Gate 1.       Iwould have anticipated             that she

would have opened this gate                    to put the persons on the track back into the

outer pen.         Chief Inspector             McRobbie was in the          Control Box at thistime

and said words to the effect                   "I'll go and sort it out."

It    was   about       this    time    that     I   saw Superintendent        Greenwood      behind      the

Leppings Lane goal.              It was obvious he was trying to transmit but without

success.        I saw then he was waving his arms in a cross, across his body.

Many    officers        were    now     on     the   perimeter track helping         people         from the

central pens.

It    was     approximately          3 '05pm    when    Superintendent       Greenwood      came     through

"Stop the match, Stop the match" and I saw Superintendent Greenwood run on

to the      field of play.              I didn't        see    the match stopped nor          the    players

leave the field.

All personnel           were    directed to the perimeter track at the Leppings Lane

end.        I   recall     PC    Bichard        going    via    VHF   to   Force    Control       requesting

ambulances - a fleet of ambulances.

Inspector Charles              'C'    came through requesting deployment of 5 and 50 at

his disposal.            I directed him to the tunnel Leppings Lane end to enter the

rear of the terraces.

A request came through for bolt croppers.                          I phoned Claywheels Lane asking

 for some, to be told there was none.                         On completion of the call I said "No
bolt    croppers,"    and    PC     Bichard    said      "Shall    I   get    the    Fire    Brigade'     I

didn't answer but just stuck my thumbs up.

Operation     Support      was     requested      and    I    remember   a     telephone      call   from

Operations saying "Is it you that's requested Operation Support" to which

I replied "Yes."

By   now    there   were    many    hundreds      of    people    on   the    playing       area   and   it

appeared     to be   total mayhem.            I saw Chief Superintendent                Nesbit by the

goal at Leppings Lane and it was obvious he was in the midst of organising

things     in that a tunnel was          formed and persons were being brought on to

the pitch.

I saw Police helmets in the rear of central pens making their way to the

front and my thought was "John Charles and his teams."                              People were still

climbing the perimeter fencing and many were being lifted up into the West

Stand      and my   thoughts      re the access to the stands was not one of being

rescued from the crowd but getting up there so they could have a seat.

A Tango mobile which I believe was T.G. came through stating manpower was

required      in Leppings        Lane   outside    the       ground because      of the numbers          of

hostile Liverpool supporters and he assisted fire and ambulance personnel

with injured persons.

Throughout this time PC Ryan had been on the tannoy at the Liverpool end

requesting repeatedly that the supporters in the central pens move back to

allow injured persons to be brought from the terraces.                              His pleas appeared

to be ignored.

I remember      a sole      supporter      dressed       in a black      'T'    shirt run down           the

length of the pitch towards the Notts Forest end.                            He stopped on the edge

of the 18 yard area and appeared to be gesturing to the Forest Supporters.

A Police Officer appeared and brought the youth down.

A cordon of Police formed across the central line and was only broken to
                                                - 9 -



allow      injured and dead             spectators       being     carried on hoardings               through to

the Spion Kop end.                 I remember PC 2988 Burkinshaw coming through on two

occasions asking if control had any ideas where a temporary mortuary could

be    set up.          In    the   second occasion I believe Chief Inspector Beal came

through saying that the gymnasium would be used.

I would estimate              that many hundreds of people were on the pitch most of

whom were         being      attended to by Police                and St John's Ambulance Personnel

and    I    saw    a number being           given mouth           to mouth resuscitation.                   At    some

stage       Chief      Superintendent            Duckenfield         and    ACC    Mr    Jackson          left     the

control, Mr Duckenfield saying words to the effect "I've got to go to the

boardroom."

He did return some time later because the announcement that the match was

abandoned had to be made and it had been decided not to say anything to

the crowd so as to enable ambulances carrying the injured to have a clear

run.        I remember Mr Nesbit                coming through stating             "You have got to tell

the crowd that the match is abandoned and to go" and it was Superintendent

Murray who went on tannoy and announced to the crowd that the match was

abandoned.             I    cannot      remember      his    exact      words     but   it    started           "Please

retain       your      tickets..."          At     the      end    of   the     announcement          I    heard     an

applause throughout the ground.

Prior to this both Brian Clough and Kenny Dalglish had been in the Control

and Mr Clough asked certain questions of Chief Superintendent Duckenfield

and     stated      if there was anything you want,                        you know where I am.                   Kenny

 Dalglish         attempted        to    talk    to    the    Liverpool         fans    via     tannoy      but     was

 unsuccessful          and PC Ryan took him down to the DJ's box where he made an

 announcement.

 The front areas of the centre pens were cleared and I saw what I thought

 was       part   of       a barrier     having       been   broken        and was      lying    on       the    track.

However,    this could have been a piece of hoarding.                   The pitch was finally

cleared of the dead and injured and the crowds left the stadium.

There    were   isolated reports        of    fighting between rival supporters           in the

Hillsborough Park          area but    nothing      untoward and supporters        went   quickly

home.      A message    had earlier been            passed    that   the Liverpool   supporters

were to be treated with sympathy and understanding.

I remained in the Police Control until approximately 10.30pm that evening

attempting for much of the time to relay messages to the Northern General

Hospital    (officer on duty there PC 3082 Fletcher).                  I was then informed I

was required to attend a meeting at Headquarters.                       On leaving the box I

went to the gymnasium where I saw a number of Senior Officers                         including

the Chief Constable, Mr Wright,               plus many, many officers dealing with the

lines of deceased on the gymnasium floor.                    I then saw Chief Superintendent

Nesbit and informed him that I would be going to Headquarters.                        He stated

that a meeting at that time of night after such a day was pointless.                        I am

aware that he sought the advice of the Chief Constable on this matter and

he informed me the meeting would not go ahead.

I have     always   held     the belief and still do that the SWFC                stadium is as

WELL POLICED as any          ground in the country              and is MUCH BETTER POLICED than

most with consideration given to away supporters who on normal matches are

not   shepherded     into    a quiet    corner of the        ground nor     are   they detained

after    the match    as     is the    case    in       many     football    groundsthroughout the

country.

The question therefore is why did such a disaster occur and I can only put

it down to three causes :

a)    Overcrowding in the central pens.

b)    The collapse of a barrier.

c)    The late arrival of the Liverpool supporters.

lt will be seen that I have not included the opening of the gates because

I believe          that    Superintendent Marshall                 had no alternative other than to

ask   them     to     be   opened      and     the    Chief    Superintendent        who    gave    the order

obviously and rightly believed that the gates required to be opened.

One thing does come to mind here and that is stewards or should I say lack

of stewards in the standing areas of SWFC.

From the Control Box                it is easy to see around the ground and the South,

North and West Stands are more than adequately stewarded with the stewards

being easily identifiable by their yellow tabards.                              However, on the Spion

Kop and Leppings             Lane      terraces       there    are no stewards or should I say I

have never         seen a steward.             I know this matter has been brought up with

the Club       in earlier years               and    attached       to this report       is a typewritten

agenda       prepared I          believe      by     Inspector      Calvertwhen    he      organised       the

football duties at Hillsborough.                        Certain points on that agenda have been

implemented by the Club.

In    relation       to    (a)    it    is obvious          that    the   supporters     used      the    centre

tunnel        to    gain access.            I do not     even remember          the     tunnel gates       being

closed       before       andr the     only    times     a serial manned        the     tunnel was         a few

years    ago       when    both      home     and    away     supporters    were     allowed       to    use   the

Leppings Lane terraces and West Stand.                             The reason for the Police presence

was segregation of fans and had nothing to do with safety.

In relation to (b) and (c) there is nothing I can say except hopefully the

public         inquiry will         make      their    findings       known.       When     one talks      about

feelings,       it is only after the event can one realise the scale yet whilst

it was happening I felt a feeling of total disbelief witnessing the events

before my eyes             - that this can't happen at Hillsborough but with things

going on at such a pace I do not believe that I had the time to take it

all     in   and     the    events      and    incidents       I have     outlined     form only a small

portion of what took place that afternoon when a minute seemed an eternity

and an hour a split second.

One thing    that does remain vividly inmy mind is the actions of the Police

Officers,    the Special        Constables       and    the    St   John's    Ambulance plus      all

unknown persons who ferried the dead                   and injured away from the perimeter

track.

I have always been proud of being a member of the South Yorkshire Police

and   I   feel   humble    that    I     could    be   associated     with    those   persons     who

performed    heroics      not     just     on    the   field    but   in     the   gymnasium,     the

hospitals    and the      centres        for    the    relatives      throughout      the night    of

Saturday 15 April 1989.

Police Sergeant 616




I     have    been       a   member      of    FI     Sub    Division,      for      some    eight    years    and

throughout that time have worked football duties as a Serial Sergeant, the

Police Room Sergeant and for the last four years have worked as the Police

Control        Sergeant           at     the        Sheffield      Wednesday          Football       Ground     at

Hillsborough under the command of Superintendent Freeman (now retired) and

Superintendent Murray.

I    performed          this duty for the 1987 Semi-Final Coventry v Leeds,                            the 1988

Semi-Final         Liverpool v Notts Forest and was again in the Control Box for

the    1989 Semi          Final between Liverpool               and Notts       Forest.        In addition      to

the    three       above mentioned            games I have         performed      the same      duties at ALL

the big matches held at Hillsborough over the past four years.

My    duties       at    FI Sub Division are             as supervision of Community Constables

and I share an office with Inspector Sewell.                             Therefore I am very aware of

the planning and requirements necessary to Police matches at Hillsborough.

I    have    also       performed      serial       duties    at   all   the    other       League   grounds    in

South Yorkshire.

On Saturday          15 April       1989,      I commenced duty          at 8.00am          in Ground Control

which is situated in an elevated box between the South and West Stands and

which overlooks the Leppings Lane terraces.

Present       at   this      time was PC 1035 Ryan with whom I have worked this duty

for    the    last       four years.          The    two other members of the Control Box team

are    PC    1370       Bichard    and    Superintendent           Murray      and    the    four    of us    have

worked       together        for the     full season.           There are specific duties allotted

to the members of the Control Box,                          I control all the radio messages.                   PC

Ryan has the tannoy and telephones of which there are three viz.                                       Internal
                                                   _ 2 -




     club phone, Police phone for internal and external use and a private phone

     for external use only.

    PC     Bichard     is    assigned       to   the    video    recorders               and     cameras    within        the

    ground and to the use of a VHF hand set which has direct access to Force

    Operations Room.

    All the tasks mentioned are interchangeable.

    During the early morning Roger Holdsworth tested camera 5 which is on the

    West    Stand/Leppings           Lane    terraces      due       to   a    fault        on    the   camera.       The

    picture     quality        he     obtained     although       was         not    of        normal   standard      was

    acceptable.         Work was also going on on a Tannoy which is situated on the

    boundary wall at the rear of the north side of the West Stand.                                           A test on

    the tannoy was carried out and it was found to be working satisfactorily.

    Other tannoy tests were made by PC Ryan within the ground and were found

    to be in order,          one of which was to                                         le groundsman.       He is in

    the    centre     circle    and    the words        used    to him were to the effect

    thought     you    would have       cut the        grass    by now'                                    acknowledged

    receipt     of     the   tannoy     message.          Also    in use            in    the     Control    Box     is    a

    message book in which any incident during a game would be noted.

    However     on    Friday    14     April     1989 , I      had    seen      Superintendent              Murray    who

    informed     me     that    the     Chief     Superintendent,              Mr        Duckenfield       required        a
f
    specific message book.              I discussed this with Superintendent Murray re an

    additional        officer being present in the book to log such messages but we

    came to     the joint conclusion that this was not feasible due to the size of

    the box     and that we would do the log between us.

    On the morning of the              15th I opened the log but                     it was later taken over

    solely by Superintendent Murray because of individual duties by myself and

    the   two   others.        All     this was        very quiet and officers began to assemble

    for the     briefing at 10.00am.             I believe that I timed the opening                            at 0959
hours and ending at 1018 hours.

At     lO.OOaic        PC    Bichard           came    to     the       box    and        at    the     conclusion          of    the

briefing Superintendent Murray arrived.                                       I was       informed by Superintendent

Murray that many serials were having their meal break but all would be out

on their        respective              points by 11.15am.                    With     that in mind I delayed the

test calls to all the Serial Sergeants and Inspectors.

Prior     to      11.00am           a    Tango        mobile        came      through          stating        that    Liverpool

supporters         were       outside           the    Fox    pub       in Foxhill             Road    waiting        for    it    to

open.       I    was        aware       that     in the       1988 Semi Final                  the Fox        had run out of

drink     and     there       was        quite    a lot        of publicity               in local       papers about             it.

Similar with Middlewood Tavern.

At     11.20asc    I    began           radio    checks       to Serial          Sergeants             and    Inspectors.           I

remember        being constantly interrupted during this check and didn’t finish

it until approximately 11.45am.

It     became     apparent          that        many    spectators            had      arrived         early    but     were       in

public     houses.            I     am    aware        that       the    gates       at    Leppings          Lane     opened       at

11.45am     and        there       was     a    trickle        of       spectators         on    to     the    terraces,          all

being     behind        the    Leppings          Lane       goal        in the       central      pens        with the large

majority of these spectators being young persons.

Between     approximately                 12     noon       and     2pm       there       were    many        radio    messages

received and transmitted, most of them being in relation to fans at public

houses     and    the        ones       that    stand out           include      the Royal Hotel                on Penistone

Road/Bradfield              Road        where    Notts       Forest        supporters            had    gathered       up to        a

point where        the pub closed because of the damage being done by supporters.

I believed        that Serial 60 had a lot of contact re this and                                               a number of

Tango mobiles           attended because of things getting out of hand.                                          Traffic was

received        that    the       Special        Constables             were having            difficulty        in Neepsend

Lane    with      Forest       fans.            Tangos       despatched          and      the matter was              resolved.
There was an ambulance call to the White House pub, Halifax Road where a

Liverpool        fan    had       eat       on    a broken bottle                or    glass.         Reports      were     also

received       from     the       Tango          mobile       to    the    Wisewood/Wadsley                arear    re     large

numbers     of    Liverpool             fans      in the Horse             and Jockey,              Beehive       and Wadsley

Jack p u b s .

At this stage things were no different to the previous years semi final.

At     an unknown       time       but      certainly          after       the    gates       had     been opened Chief

Inspector        Creaser          came       into       the     Control      Box        and     asked       Superintendent

Murray      about        the       Leppings              Lane        terraces           and     it        was     stated     by

Superintendent Murray                   that      the    standing fans                would find their own levels

in the pens rather than trying to fill one pen at a time.

At     approximately 2pm Superintendent Murray left the Control Box in order

to see the referee which is normal practice.

He     returned        around       2.15po          and       was     followed           into       the     box     by    Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield and the ACC, Mr Jackson.

I    noticed     that       the    Notts          Forest       end    (Spion          Kop     and    South       Stand)    were

filling    well        and    coming         to     capacity         but    the       Liverpool           and    North,    West

Stands    on     Lepping       Lane         terraces          were    COMPARATIVELY             empty       and I assumed

there should have probably been more people in those areas at that time.

I did see that the centre pens directly behind the Leppings Lane goal were

filling quite well but there was ample room in them.                                            This observation was

mentioned      in the box because I believe we all felt that in comparison to

the Forest end, Liverpool seemed empty.

By 2.30pm      PC Bichard I believe made mention of large                                           crowds       in Leppings

Lane    outside     the      ground          and    on    looking          upwards       at    the TV           screen I    saw

large    numbers       of    Liverpool             supporters         outside          the     ground       which I would

estimate at 3 - 4,000.

Only    once     before      have       I    seen       such       numbers       and that           was    when Sheffield
 Wednesday played Coventry City in an FA Cup 6th Round match in 1987 when

 the Coventry fans came to Sheffield in their thousands.

Around       this    time radio messages were coming thick and fast and any times

 from this point can only be estimated approximately.

A request          came    from the        Leppings Lane           end asking for Leppings Lane to be

 closed to traffic due to                  the volume of persons in the road.

The radio system was operating on talk through and at around 2.35 - 2.40pm

I received          calls       that my radio transmissions were                    poor and breaking up.

Within       seconds       of    hearing       this    a civilian communications              officer was    at

the    control       and    began        looking       at    the    equipment.      He   changed   the Tulip

Microphone         for     a telephone handset but the fault remained.                          After a very

short     time       the     back-up       set        with    the    telephone      handset    with   central

depression was            taken into use by myself.                   The fixed ariel lead meant that

the base       station had             to be placed under the desk.                 As a result the base

station      had    to remain under             the desk and this meant              that     the microphone

lead would not reach above                     the level of the desk top making it difficult

to use.        After       only    two     or   three              calls with thehandset,       which werenot

acknowledged,         I    believed        that    it was          faulty and I remember        throwing the

handset on to the control desk.                         I took a normal hand held radio and from

that time all transmissions were relayed in that fashion.                                   We were on talk

through so the use of a hand held radio provided the same service.

In    view    of     the    above        difficulties         I     asked   the   Communications      man    to

arrange for the Home Office Engineer to test the equipment on Monday.

2.40pm?        A    call        came    from    Superintendent          Marshall     requesting    that     the

Leppings Lane gates be opened because of the volume of persons outside.

Further      call    from       Superintendent          Marshall       asking     for gates    to be opened

(means Gate C).             Stated       that people were being crushed against turnstiles

and if gates were not opened someone would be killed.
I remember something being said about large numbers of non ticket holders

who would get in and cause serious problems                              for legitimate            ticket             holders.

Mr Marshall          again came           through asking for             gates to be       opened.      This was

not a request but an order.

Mr Murray asked Mr Duckenfield for his decision and he okayed the gates to

be     opened.        'C'    gate    was     opened       but believed at           this   time    it had been

forced and someone                said    "They've broke through" I cannot remember if this

was a radio message or said in box.

Mounted       officers           retrieved        the     situation      and   only a      few     persons      got

through.           More     manpower       deputed        to    Leppings Lane    including mounted.              Mr

Marshall       again asked          for gate            to be re-opened a second time.               Gates were

opened       and    many     more     people       went        through   than the      first      time.Would

estimate many hundreds went through this time.

Radio traffic heavy and much distortion.

At approximately 2.52pm Sergeant Higgins of                              'F' C & V came through saying

"The       gates    at     'A'     have    got     to     be    opened    as   if    not somebody        will    be

killed."        On receipt of that I said words over the radio,                              "If that is the

case we have no option open the gates."

The    'A' gate was opened and access to North                           Stand only was gained.              By the

time       'A* gate opened the gates                    at 'C' had been closed.

During       this   time     I    am unable             to say whether it was         before      or after      the

gates being opened PC 1863 Buxton came through asking for the kick off to

be    delayed.       As he        said     this    the Liverpool team took to the field and I

replied "It's too late one team is already on the field."

I    saw    that    in    the      Leppings Lane         end     there   was   ample       room    in    the    pen

nearest the control box and the centre pens appeared full but not out of

the    ordinary      for a         big match of this kind.                 I did see swaying            in those

pens but again this                is a regular          occurrence on big match days.               I was      not
                                                   - 7 -




aware that the game had started when a track officer on the Leppings Lane

end    came      through        with       an   unreadable message.            I    then    saw    a    few people

climbing the fencing                  in the       central pens area to get             on to the pitch             and

at that time my first thought was "Christ                            there's a pitch invasion."

Within seconds people                 started coming on to the track via a perimeter gate,

although         there    was     not       a   large      flood.     Even     at    this    stage      I     did   not

realise         the enormity          of    the problem and made comment about a Policewoman

who was on the track serial by Gate 1.                              I would have anticipated that she

would have opened this gate to put the persons on the track back into the

outer pen.          Chief Inspector                McRobbie was in the             Control Box at thistime

and said words to the effect                        "I'll go and sort it out."

It    was   about        this    time       that    I    saw Superintendent           Greenwood         behind      the

Leppings Lane g o a l .               It was obvious he was trying to transmit but without

success.         I saw then he was waving his arms in a cross, across his body.

Many    officers         were    now       on    the    perimeter     track    helping       people          from   the

central pens.

It    was   approximately              3.05pm      when     Superintendent          Greenwood      came       through

"Stop the match, Stop the match" and I saw Superintendent Greenwood run on

to    the   field    of     play.           I   didn't     see    the match     stopped      nor       the    players

leave the field.

All    personnel         were    directed          to the perimeter track at                the Leppings Lane

end.        I    recall     PC    Bichard          going    via     VHF   to   Force       Control      requesting

ambulances - a fleet of ambulances.

Inspector Charles               'C'    came     through requesting deployment                 of 5 and 50 at

his disposal.            I directed him to the tunnel Leppings Lane end to enter the

rear of the terraces.

A request came through for bolt croppers.                             I phoned Claywheels Lane asking

for some, to be told there was none.                             On completion of the call I said "No

    bolt     croppers,"              and    PC     Bichard      said     "Shall    I   get     the    Fire    Brigade"      I

    d i d n ’t answer but just stuck my thumbs up.

    Operation         Support             was    requested       and     I    remember    a    telephone       call     from

    Operations            saying "Is            it you that's requested Operation Support" to which

    I replied "Yes."

    By    now    there             were   many     hundreds       of    people    on   the     playing       area   and    it

    appeared         to       be    total       mayhem.     I    saw Chief Superintendent               Nesbit by         the

    goal at Leppings Lane and it was obvious he was in the midst of organising

    things      in    that a tunnel was                   formed       and persons     were    being brought on to

    the pitch.

    I saw Police helmets                    in the rear of central pens making their way to the

    front and my               thought was "John Charles and his teams."                             People were still

    climbing the perimeter fencing and many were being lifted up                                         into the West

    Stand    and      my        thoughts         re   the access to the stands             was not           one of being

    rescued from the crowd but getting up there so they could have a seat.

    A Tango mobile which I believe was T.G.                                  came through stating manpower was

    required         in       Leppings      Lane      outside      the    ground because         of    the    numbers     of

    hostile Liverpool                 supporters          and he assisted fire and ambulance personnel

    with injured persons.

    Throughout        this          time PC Ryan had been on the tannoy at the Liverpool end

    requesting repeatedly that the supporters in the central pens move back to

    allow injured persons to be brought from the terraces.                                       His pleas appeared

    to be ignored.

    I    remember         a     sole      supporter        dressed in a black            'T'   shirt         run down     the

    length of the               pitch towards the Notts Forest end.                      He stopped on          the edge

    of the 18 yard area and appeared to be gesturing to the Forest Supporters.

    A Police Officer appeared and brought the youth down.

    A cordon of Police                    formed across         the central line and was only broken to
                                                  - 9 -



allow       injured        and    dead    spectators          being     carried on boardings                    through       to

the Spion Kop end.                  I remember PC 2988 Burkinshaw coming through on two

occasions asking if control had any ideas where a temporary mortuary could

be    set    up.       In    the    second      occasion I believe Chief Inspector Beal                                     came

through saying that the gymnasium would be used.

I would       estimate           that many      hundreds        of people          were       on the pitch most of

whom       were    being     attended       to by Police             and St John's Ambulance                     Personnel

and    I    saw    a     number     being    given mouth             to mouth        resuscitation.                   At    some

stage       Chief        Superintendent           Duckenfield              and    ACC     Mr    Jackson          left        the

control,      Mr Duckenfield saying words to the effect "I've got to go to the

boardroom."

He did return some time later because the announcement that the match was

abandoned         had to be made            and    it had been decided not to say anything to

the crowd so as to enable ambulances carrying the injured to have a clear

run.        I remember Mr Nesbit                coming through stating                    "You have got to tell

the crowd that the match is abandoned and to go" and it was Superintendent

Murray      who went         on tannoy       and announced to the                   crowd that          the match was

abandoned.             I    cannot       remember       his     exact       words       but    it     started         "Please

retain       your      tickets..."           At        the     end    of    the     announcement            I    heard        an

applause throughout the ground.

Prior to this both Brian Clough and Kenny Dalglish had been in the Control

and Mr Clough asked certain questions of Chief Superintendent Duckenfield

and    stated       if     there    was anything you want, you know where I am.                                            Kenny

Dalglish          attempted        to    talk     to     the    Liverpool          fans       via     tannoy          but    was

unsuccessful           and PC Ryan took him down to the DJ's box where he made                                                an

announcement.

The    front areas of the centre pens were cleared and I saw what I thought

was    part       of   a    barrier       having       been     broken       and    was       lying    on       the    track.
                                            - 10 -




 However,         this could have been a piece of hoarding.                   The pitch was finally

 cleared of the dead and injured and the crowds left the stadium.

There       were    isolated    reports    of    fighting between rival             supporters       in the

 Hillsborough         Park    area but    nothing       untoward     and     supporters went        quickly

 home..       A    message    had earlier       been    passed     that     theLiverpool supporters

were to be treated with sympathy and                    understanding.

I remained          in the Police Control until approximately 10.30pm that evening

attempting for much of the time to relay messages to the Northern General

Hospital          (officer on duty there PC 3082 Fletcher).                   I was       then informed I

was    required       to attend a meeting          at Headquarters.            On   leaving the box I

went    to    the    gymnasium where I saw a number of Senior Officers                            including

the Chief Constable, Mr Wright, plus many, many officers dealing with the

lines of deceased on the gymnasium floor.                         I then saw Chief Superintendent

Nesbit      and informed him that I would be going to Headquarters.                               He stated

that a meeting at that time of night after such a day was pointless.                                   I am

aware       that he    sought the advice of the Chief Constable on this matter and

he informed ee the meeting would not go ahead.

I    have    always    held    the belief and          still   do that      the    SWFC    stadium is as

WELL POLICED          as any ground in the country and is MUCH BETTER POLICED than

most with consideration given to away supporters who on normal matches are

not    shepherded       into   a quiet     corner      of   the    ground    nor    are    they   detained

after       the match    as    is   the   case   in many       football     grounds       throughout    the

cou ntry.

The question therefore is why did such a disaster occur and I can only put

it down to three causes :

a)    Overcrowding in the central pens.

b)    The collapse of a barrier.

c)    The late arrival of the Liverpool supporters.
It will be seen that I have not included the opening of the gates because

I     believe         that Superintendent               Marshall        had no alternative           other than to

ask     them      to    be     opened       and    the     Chief    Superintendent          who    gave the     order

obviously and rightly believed that the gates                                   required to             be opened.

One thing does come to mind here and that isstewards or                                       should I say lack

of stewards in the standing areas of SWFC.

From    the Control                Box it is       easy     to    see around the ground and the South,

North and West Stands are more than adequately stewarded with the stewards

being easily identifiable by their yellow tabards.                                        However,      on the Spion

Kop    and     Leppings            Lane    terraces       there     are no stewards          or should I say I

have    never         seen a steward.               I know       this matter has been brought up with

the    Club       in    earlier years             and    attached        to this    report     is a typewritten

agenda         prepared I           believe       by    Inspector        Calvert    when     he    organised         the

football         duties at Hillsborough.                    Certain points on that agenda have been

implemented by the Club.

In     relation         to (a)       it      is obvious          that    the   supporters     used       the    centre

tunnel           to    gain access.              I do not    even remember          the    tunnel       gates   being

closed       before          and    the    only    times     a    serial manned       the     tunnel      was    a   few

years       ago       when    both        home    and    away     supporters       were    allowed       to    use   the

Leppings Lane terraces and West Stand.                                  The reason for the Police presence

was segregation of fans and had nothing to do with safety.

In relation to (b) and (c) there is nothing I can say except hopefully the

public       inquiry          will    make       their     findings       known.      When     one      talks    about

feelings,         it is only after the event can one realise the scale yet whilst

it was happening I felt a feeling of total disbelief witnessing the events

before      my     eyes      - that this           can't    happen at Hillsborough                but   with things

going on          at such a pace I do not believe that I had the time                                    to take      it

all    in        and    the events          and incidents         I have       outlined     form    only a      small
portion of what took place that afternoon when a minute seemed an eternity

and an hour a split second.

One thing    that    does remain vividly inmy mind is the actions of the Police

Officers,    the Special        Constables       and   the   St   John's       Ambulance      plus    all

unknown   persons   who    ferried       the dead and injured away from the perimeter

track.

I have    always been proud of being a member of the South Yorkshire Police

and   I   feel   humble    that     I    could   be    associated       with    those    persons      who

performed    heroics      not     just    on     the    field     but     in    the     gymnasium, the

hospitals    and the      centres       for    the     relatives    throughout          the   night    of

Saturday 15 April 1989•
MICHAEL GODDARD



Police Sergeant 616




I     have    been    a   member      of    FI     Sub    Division,     for       some   eight   years     and

throughout that time have worked football duties as a Serial Sergeant, the

Police Room Sergeant and for the last four years have worked as the Police

Control        Sergeant        at     the        Sheffield     Wednesday           Football      Ground     at

Hillsborough under the command of Superintendent Freeman (now retired) and

Superintendent Murray.

I performed this duty for the 1987 Semi-Final Coventry v Leeds,                                    the 1988

Semi-Final Liverpool v Notts Forest and was again in the Control Box for

the    1989 Semi Final between Liverpool                     and Notts Forest.            In addition to

the    three above mentioned games I have                      performed the same duties             at ALL

the big matches held at Hillsborough over the past four years.

My    duties    at FI Sub Division are               as    supervision of Community Constables

and I share an office with Inspector Sewell.                          Therefore I am very aware of

the planning and requirements necessary to Police matches at Hillsborough.

I have       also performed         serial       duties   at   all    the    other League        grounds    in

South Yorkshire.

On Saturday 15 April 1989,                  I commenced duty at 8.00am in Ground Control

which is situated in an elevated box between the South and West Stands and

which overlooks the Leppings Lane terraces.

Present      at this      time was PC 1035 Ryan with whom I have worked this duty

for the last four years.                   The    two other members of the Control Box team

are    PC    1370    Bichard    and    Superintendent          Murray       and   the    four of us       have

worked together for the               full season.          There are specific duties allotted

to the members of the Control Box, I control all the radio messages.                                        PC

Ryan has the tannoy and telephones of which there are three viz.                                   Internal
 club phone, Police phone for internal and external use and a private phone

 for external use only.

 PC   Bichard     is    assigned        to   the    video   recorders               and    cameras    within        the

 ground and to the use of a VHF hand set which has direct access to Force

Operations Room.

All the tasks mentioned are interchangeable.

During the early morning Roger Holdsworth tested camera 5 which is on the

West    Stand/Leppings           Lane    terraces     due       to   a    fault       on     the   camera.      The

picture    quality         he    obtained      although     was          not    of        normal   standard     was

acceptable.        Work was also going on on a Tannoy which is situated on the

boundary wall at the rear of the north side of the West Stand.                                         A test on

the tannoy was carried out and it was found to be working satisfactorily.

Other tannoy tests were made by PC Ryan within the ground and were found

to be in order, one of which was to :                                          the groundsman.          He is in

the centre circle and the words used to him were to the effect                                                       [

thought you would have             cut the         grass by now'                                     cknowledged

receipt    of     the   tannoy     message.          Also   in use             in    the    Control    Box     is    a

message book in which any incident during a game would be noted.

However    on     Friday    14    April      1989,    I   had    seen Superintendent                  Murray    who

informed     me    that     the    Chief      Superintendent,             Mr        Duckenfield      required        a

specific message book.              I discussed this with Superintendent Murray re an

additional      officer being present in the book to log such messages but we

came to the joint conclusion that this was not feasible due to the size of

the box and that we would do the log between us.

On the morning of the 15th I opened the log but it was later taken over

solely by Superintendent Murray because of individual duties by myself and

the   two others.         All     this was very quiet and officers began to assemble

for the briefing at 10.00am.                  I believe that I timed the opening at 0959
                                                   - 3 -




hours and ending at 1018 hours.

At     10.00am    PC     Bichard          came    to     the       box     and       at   the     conclusion        of   the

briefing Superintendent Murray arrived.                                  I was informed by Superintendent

Murray that many serials were having their meal break but all would be out

on their respective points by 11.15am.                                   With that in mind I delayed the

test calls to all the Serial Sergeants and Inspectors.

Prior     to    11.00am        a     Tango       mobile        came       through         stating     that       Liverpool

supporters       were     outside          the    Fox    pub       in Foxhill Road waiting                    for    it to

open.      I was       aware       that     in the       1988 Semi Final                  the Fox had run out of

drink    and     there    was       quite    a lot        of publicity in local papers about                             it.

Similar with Middlewood Tavern.

At     11.20am I began radio                checks       to Serial Sergeants                    and Inspectors.            I

remember being constantly interrupted during this check and didn't finish

it until approximately 11.45am.

It   became      apparent          that many       spectators             had    arrived          early    but    were    in

public    houses.         I    am     aware       that       the    gates       at    Leppings       Lane     opened      at

11.45am    and        there    was    a trickle           of       spectators         on to the           terraces,      all

being behind          the Leppings Lane                 goal       in   the     central      pens with the large

majority of these spectators being young persons.

Between    approximately              12    noon       and     2pm       there       were    many    radio        messages

received and transmitted, most of them being in relation to fans at public

houses    and the ones that stand out                          include        the Royal Hotel              on Penistone

Road/Bradfield          Road       where     Notts      Forest          supporters          had    gathered up        to a

point where the pub closed because of the damage being done by supporters.

I believed       that Serial 60 had a lot of contact re this and a number of

Tango mobiles attended because of things getting out of hand.                                               Traffic was

received       that    the Special Constables                      were    having difficulty               in Neepsend

Lane    with    Forest        fans.        Tangos       despatched            and    the matter was              resolved.
There was an ambulance call to the White House pub, Halifax Road where a

Liverpool        fan    had     sat       on a broken bottle             or glass.            Reports     were    also

received        from    the     Tango        mobile      to     the Wisewood/Wadsley             arear     re    large

numbers        of Liverpool           fans      in the Horse           and Jockey,          Beehive     and Wadsley

Jack pubs.

At this stage things were no different to the previous years semi final.

At     an unknown       time but          certainly        after the          gates    had been opened Chief

Inspector       Creaser         came       into    the        Control    Box     and    asked     Superintendent

Murray      about        the     Leppings              Lane      terraces       and      it     was      stated     by

Superintendent Murray that                      the standing fans would find their own levels

in the pens rather than trying to fill one pen at a time.

At     approximately 2pm Superintendent Murray left the Control Box in order

to see the referee which is normal practice.

He     returned        around       2.15pm        and     was     followed        into        the box      by Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield and the ACC,                           Mr Jackson.

I    noticed     that     the    Notts          Forest     end    (Spion Kop          and     South    Stand)     were

filling    well        and    coming       to    capacity        but    the    Liverpool        and    North,     West

Stands    on    Lepping        Lane       terraces       were     COMPARATIVELY             empty andI assumed

there should have probably been more people in those areas at that time.

I did see that the centre pens directly behind the Leppings Lane goal were

filling quite well but there was ample room in them.                                    This observation was

mentioned in the box because I believe we all felt that in comparison to

the Forest end, Liverpool seemed empty.

By 2.30pm PC Bichard I believe made mention of large                                        crowds      in Leppings

Lane    outside     the      ground        and    on    looking upwards           at   the TV         screen I saw

large    numbers       of Liverpool              supporters       outside       the ground which I              would

estimate at 3 - 4,000.

Only    once    before       have     I    seen     such       numbers    and that was           when Sheffield
                                              - 5 -




 Wednesday played Coventry City in an FA Cup 6th Round match in 1987 when

 the Coventry fans came to Sheffield in their thousands.

Around       this time radio messages were coming thick and fast and                             any times

 from this point can only              be estimated approximately.

A request came             from the    Leppings Lane end asking for Leppings Lane                   to    be

 closed to traffic due to              the volume of persons in the road.

The radio system was operating on talk through and at around 2.35 - 2.40pm

I received          calls    that my radio transmissions were                 poor and breaking up.

Within       seconds      of hearing       this   a civilian communications              officer was at

the    control       and    began     looking     at   the     equipment.      He   changed the Tulip

Microphone         for a telephone handset but the fault remained.                         After a very

short     time      the     back-up     set     with     the    telephone      handset    with    central

depression was taken into use by myself.                         The fixed ariel lead meant that

the base station had to be placed under the desk.                              As a result the base

station had to remain under the desk and this meant                             that the microphone

lead would not reach above the level of the desk top making it difficult

to use.        After only two or three calls with the handset,                           which were not

acknowledged,         1 believed       that     it was       faulty and 1 remember throwing the

handset on to the control desk.                   I took a normal hand held radio and from

that time all transmissions were relayed in that fashion.                             We were on talk

through so the use of a hand held radio provided the same service.

In    view    of    the     above     difficulties       I     asked   the   Communications       man     to

arrange for the Home Office Engineer to test the equipment on Monday.

2.40pm?        A    call    came    from    Superintendent Marshall             requesting       that    the

Leppings Lane gates be opened because of the volume of persons outside.

Further      call    from Superintendent Marshall                 asking     for gates    to be opened

(means Gate C).             Stated that people were being crushed against turnstiles

and if gates were not opened someone would be killed.
                                               - 6 -




    I remember something being said about large numbers of non ticket holders

who would get in and cause serious problems                           for legitimate ticket holders.

Mr Marshall          again came          through asking         for gates         to be opened.        This was

not a request but an order.

Mr Murray asked Mr Duckenfield for his decision and he okayed the gates to

be     opened.       'C'     gate was        opened but      believed        at    this   time    it had been

forced and someone said "They've broke through" I cannot remember if this

was a radio message or said in box.

Mounted       officers           retrieved    the   situation         and     only    a   few     persons       got

through.           More manpower          deputed to Leppings Lane                 including mounted.            Mr

Marshall again asked for gate to be re-opened a second time.                                          Gates were

opened       and    many    more     people     went    through       than    the     first      time.     Would

estimate many hundreds went through this time.

Radio traffic heavy and much distortion.

At approximately 2.52pm Sergeant Higgins                         of 'F' C & V             came through                saying

"The       gates    at     'A'    have    got to       be    opened    as     if    not somebody         will    be

killed."       On receipt of that I said words over the radio, "If that is the

case we have no option open the gates."

The    'A' gate was opened and access to North Stand only was gained.                                     By the

time 'A' gate opened the gates at 'C' had been closed.

During      this    time     I am unable        to say whether it was before                     or after the

gates being opened PC 1863 Buxton came through asking for the kick off to

be delayed.          As he said this the Liverpool team took to the field and I

replied "It's too late one team is already on the field."

I    saw    that    in   the      Leppings Lane        end   there     was    ample room         in      the    pen

nearest the control box and the centre pens appeared full but not out of

the    ordinary for a             big match         ofthis kind.             I did see             swaying in those

pens but again this               is a regular occurrence on big match days.                       I     was not
                                                      - 7 -




    aware that the game had started when a track officer on the Leppings Lane

    end     came       through       with    an unreadable message.                I    then saw a few people

    climbing the fencing in the                       central pens area to get on to the pitch                    and

    at that time my first thought was "Christ                           there's a pitch invasion."

    Within seconds people started coming on to the track via a perimeter gate,

    although          there    was     not     a   large      flood.    Even       at    this   stage    I    did not

    realise          the enormity          of the problem and made comment about a Policewoman

    who was on the track serial by                         Gate 1.      I      would have anticipated thatshe

    would have          opened this gate toput the persons on the track back                                 into the

    outer pen.           Chief Inspector              McRobbie was in the Control Box at thistime

    and said words to the effect                       "I'll go and sort it out."

    It     was       about    this    time     that    I   saw Superintendent             Greenwood      behind   the

    Leppings Lane goal.                    It was obvious he was trying to transmit but without

    success.          I saw then he was waving his arms in a cross, across his body.

    Many     officers         were     now    on   the     perimeter track         helping      people       from the

    central pens.

    It    was    approximately              3.05pm    when    Superintendent            Greenwood   came     through

    "Stop the match, Stop the match" and I saw Superintendent Greenwood run on

    to the       field       of play.         I didn't        see    the match      stopped      nor the players

    leave the field.

    All personnel            were     directed to the perimeter track at the Leppings Lane

    end.         I    recall     PC    Bichard        going    via VHF        to   Force    Control      requesting

    ambulances - a fleet of ambulances.

    Inspector Charles                'C'    came   through requesting deployment                 of 5 and 50 at

    his disposal.             I directed him to the tunnel Leppings Lane end to enter the

    rear of the terraces.

    A request came through for bolt croppers.                               I phoned Claywheels Lane asking

    for some, to be told there was none.                            On completion of the call I said "No




I
I
bolt     croppers,"    and   PC    Bichard    said    "Shall    I   get    the    Fire    Brigade"      I

didn't answer but just stuck my thumbs up.

Operation       Support    was    requested    and    I   remember    a    telephone       call   from

Operations saying "Is it you that's requested Operation Support" to which

I replied "Yes."

By    now   there   were   many    hundreds    of people       on   the    playing       area   and    it

appeared      to be   total mayhem.          I saw Chief Superintendent Nesbit by                     the

goal at Leppings Lane and it was obvious he was in the midst of organising

things      in that a tunnel was formed and persons were being brought on to

the pitch.

I saw Police helmets in the rear of central pens making their way to the

front and my thought was "John Charles and his teams."                           People were still

climbing the perimeter fencing and many were being lifted up into the West

Stand    and my     thoughts     re the access to the stands was not one of being

rescued from the crowd but getting up there so they could have a seat.

A Tango mobile which I believe was T.G. came through stating manpower was

required     in   Leppings Lane      outside    the   ground    because      of    the numbers         of

hostile Liverpool supporters and he assisted fire and ambulance personnel

with injured persons.

Throughout      this time PC Ryan had been on the tannoy at the Liverpool end

requesting repeatedly that the supporters in the central pens move back to

allow injured persons to be brought from the terraces.                       His pleas appeared

to be ignored.

I    remember     a sole   supporter   dressed       in a black      'T'    shirt run down            the

length of the pitch towards the Notts Forest end.                     He stopped on the edge

of the 18 yard area and appeared to be gesturing to the Forest Supporters.

A Police Officer appeared and brought the youth down.

A cordon of Police formed across the central line and was only broken to
allow      injured and dead            spectators          being carried -on hoardings                   through to

the Spion Kop end.               I remember PC 2988 Burkinshaw coming through on two

occasions asking if control had any ideas where a temporary mortuary could

be     set up.       In   the    second      occasion I believe Chief Inspector Beal                              came

through saying that the gymnasium would be used.

I would estimate          that many hundreds of people were on the pitch most of

whom were        being attended          to by Police            and St John’s Ambulance Personnel

and    I   saw     a number      being      given mouth          to mouth resuscitation.                   At     some

stage      Chief     Superintendent            Duckenfield            and    ACC     Mr    Jackson        left     the

control, Mr Duckenfield saying words to the effect "I've got to go to the

boardroom."

He did return some time later because the announcement that the match was

abandoned had to be made                 and it had been decided not to say anything to

the crowd so as to enable ambulances carrying the injured to have a clear

run.       I remember Mr Nesbit             coming through stating "You have got to tell

the crowd that the match is abandoned and to go" and it was Superintendent

Murray who went on tannoy                 and announced to the crowd that the match was

abandoned.          I   cannot       remember        his    exact      words    but       it   started     "Please

retain      your    tickets..."           At        the    end   of    the     announcement          I    heard    an

applause throughout the ground.

Prior to this both Brian Clough and Kenny Dalglish had been in the Control

and Mr Clough asked certain questions of Chief Superintendent Duckenfield

and    stated      if there      was    anything you want,              you know where           I am.          Kenny

Dalglish      attempted         to   talk      to    the    Liverpool        fans     via      tannoy      but    was

unsuccessful        and PC Ryan took him down to the DJ's box where he made an

announcement.

The front areas of the centre pens were cleared and I saw what I thought

was    part   of    a barrier          having       been    broken     and     was    lying     on   the    track.
                                         - 10 -




 However,    this could have been a piece of hoarding.                 The pitch was finally

 cleared of the dead and injured and the crowds left the stadium.

 There    were   isolated reports       of    fighting between rival supporters in the

 Hillsborough Park area but           nothing     untoward and       supporters   went   quickly

 home.      A message      had earlier been passed         that     the Liverpool   supporters

 were to be treated with sympathy and understanding.

 I remained in the Police Control until approximately 10.30pm that evening

 attempting for much of the time to relay messages to the Northern General

 Hospital    (officer on duty there PC 3082 Fletcher).                I was then informed I

 was required to attend a meeting at Headquarters.                     On leaving the box I

went     to the gymnasium where I saw a number of Senior Officers                    including

the Chief Constable, Mr Wright,              plus many, many officers dealing with the

lines of deceased on the gymnasium floor.                 I then saw Chief Superintendent

Nesbit and informed him that I               would      be going toHeadquarters.         He stated

that a meeting at          that time of night           after such aday was pointless.        I am

aware that he sought the advice of the Chief Constable on this matter and

he informed me the meeting would not go ahead.

I have     always   held   the belief and still do that the SWFC stadium is as

WELL POLICED as any ground in the country and is MUCH BETTER POLICED than

most with consideration given to away supporters who on normal matches are

not    shepherded    into a quiet       corner of    the ground nor       are they detained

after    the match    as   is   the   case    in many    football    grounds throughout the

country.

The question therefore is why did such a disaster occur and I can only put

it down to three causes :

lt will be seen that I have not included the opening of the gates because

I believe         that Superintendent Marshall                     had no alternative other than to

ask     them     to be      opened        and    the     Chief Superintendent          who    gave   the order

obviously and rightly believed that the gates required to be opened.

One thing does come to mind                       here and thatis stewards or should I say lack

of stewards in the                 standing areas of SWFC.

From the Control Box it                    is easy to see around the ground and the South,

North and West Stands are more than adequately stewarded with the stewards

being easily identifiable by their yellow tabards.                                   However, on the Spion

Kop    and Leppings             Lane     terraces       there    are no stewards        or should I say I

have never seen a steward.                        I know this matter has been brought up with

the   Club       in    earlier years and attached                   to this     report is a typewritten

agenda      prepared        I       believe by          Inspector    Calvert     when he      organised       the

football duties at Hillsborough.                          Certain points on that agenda have been

implemented by the Club.

In    relation         to      (a) it     is obvious       that      the   supporters used       the       centre

tunnel     to     gain      access.           Ido not     even remember       the    tunnel    gates       being

closed     before        and       the    only times       a serial manned          the tunnel       was a few

years      ago    when      both       home     and     away    supporters    were    allowed    to use       the

Leppings Lane terraces and West Stand.                            The reason for the Police presence

was segregation of fans                   and had nothing to do with safety.

In relation to (b) and                    (c) there is nothing I can say except hopefully the

public     inquiry          will make           their    findings    known.         When one    talks       about

feelings,        it    is only after            the event can       one realise the scale yet              whilst

it was happening I felt a feeling of total disbelief witnessing the events

before my eyes - that                    this    can't happen at Hillsborough but with things

going on at such a pace I do not believe that I had the time to take it

all   in    and       the   events        and    incidents I have          outlined     form only      a    small

portion of what took place that afternoon when a minute seemed an eternity

and an hour a split second.

One thing that does remain vividly in my mind is the actions of the Police

Officers,    the   Special      Constables        and    the    St   John's    Ambulance      plus    all

unknown persons who ferried the dead and injured away from the perimeter

track.

I have always been proud of being a member of the South Yorkshire Police

and   I   feel   humble    that    I     could    be    associated      with    those    persons      who

performed    heroics      not     just    on     the    field    but    in     the   gymnasium,       the

hospitals    and   the    centres        for     the    relatives      throughout       the   night    of

Saturday 15 April 1989.

I have been a member of Fl Sub Division, for some eight years and

throughout that time have worked football duties as a Serial

Sergeant, the Police Room Sergeant and for the last four years

have worked as the Police Control Sergeant at the Sheffield

Wednesday Football Ground at Hillsborough’under the command of

Superintendent Freeman (now retired) and Superintendent Murray.

I peformed this duty for the 1987 Semi Final Coventry v Leeds,

the 1988 Semi Final Liverpool v Nottingham Forest and was again

in the Control Box for the 1989 Semi Final between Liverpool and

Nottingham Forest.               In addition to the three above mentioned

games I have performed the same duties at ALL the big matches

held at Hillsborough over the past four years.

My duties at Fl Sub Division are as supervision of Community

Constables and I share an office with Inspector Sewell.

Therefore I am very aware of the planning and requirements
necessary to Police matches at Hillsborough.

On Saturday 15 April 1989, I commenced duty at 8.00 am in Ground

Control which is situated in an elevated box between the South

and West Stands and which overlooks the Leppings Lane terraces.

Present at this time was Police Constable 1035 Ryan with whom I

have worked this duty for the last four years.                The two other

members of the Control Box team are Police Constable 1370 Bichard

and Superintendent Murray who was in command of the Control Box

and the four of us have worked together for the full season.

There are specific duties allotted to the members of the Control
P O L I C E S E R G E A N T 616 M I C H A E L G O D D A R D                       PAGE 2




Box, I control all the radio messages.                         Police Constable Ryan has

the tannoy and telephones of which there are three viz.                            Internal
club phone, Police phone for internal and external use and a
private phone for external use only.

Police Constable Bichard is assigned to the video recorders and

cameras within the ground and to the use of a VHF hand set which

has direct access to Force Operations Room.

All the tasks mentioned are interchangeable.

During the early morning Roger Holdsworth tested camera 5 which

is on the West Stand/Leppings Lane terraces due to a fault on the

camera.       The picture quality he obtained although not of normal
standard was acceptable.

Tannoy tests were made by Police Constable Ryan within the ground
and were found to be in order.

Also in use in the Control Box is a message book in which any

incident during a game would be noted.



* Where is this book now and at the time exactly what was in it?



However on Friday 14 April 1989, I had seen Superintendent Murray

who informed me that the Chief Superintendent, Mr Duckenfield,

required a specific message book.                         I discussed this with

Superintendent Murray regarding an additional officer being

present in the box to log such messages but we came to the joint

conclusion that this was not feasible due to the size of the box
P O L I C E S E R G E A N T 616 M I C H A E L G O D D A R D                                                       PAGE 3




and    that       we would          do    the       log     between       us.

On the morning                of    the        15th       I opened       the lo g         but    it    was     later

taken       over       solely       by    Superintendent                Murray        because          of    individual

duties       by myself             and    the       two    others.

At    10.00       am Police          Constable             Bichard        came       to the       box       and    at    the

conclusion             of    the    briefing             Superintendent              Murray       arrived.

At    11.20       am     I began         radio          checks     to S e r i a l     Sergeants             and

Inspectors.                 I remember             being    constantly           interrupted                during this

check       and    didn't          finish          it    until     approximately                11.45       am.

Between       approximately                   12    noon    and      2.00 pm t h e r e           were       many radio

messages          received          and       transmitted,            most      of    them       being       in r e l a t i o n

to    fans    at       public       houses.

Throughout             the m o r n i n g       things       were      no d i f f e r e n t       to    the    previous

year's       semi       final.           At    an       unknown time         bu t     certainly             after       the

turnstiles             had    been       opened          Chief    Inspector           Creaser          came       into the

Control       Box and          asked          Superintendent             Murray           about       the    Leppings

Lane    terraces             and    it    was       stated       by S u p e r i n t e n d e n t       Murray       that       th e

standing          fans       would       find       their    own      levels         in    the    pens       rather       than

trying       to    fill       one    pen       at a tim e .

At    approximately                2.00       pm    Superintendent              Murray       left       the       Control

Box    in    order to          see       the       referee       which     is    normal          practice.

He    returned          around       2.15          pm together with              Chief       Superintendent

Duckenfield.

I noticed          that      the     Not t i n g h a m Forest            end     (Spion K o p           and       South

Stand)      were        filling well                and    coming      to c a p a c i t y        but    the       Liverpool
P O L I C E S E R G E A N T 616 M I C H A E L G O D D A R D                      PAGE 4




and North, West Stands on Leppings Lane terraces were

comparatively empty and I assumed there should have probably been
more people in those areas at that time.                           I did see that the

centre pens directly behind the Leppings Lane goal were filling

quite well but there was ample room in them.                           This observation

was mentioned in the box because I believe we all felt that in
comparison to the Forest end, Liverpool seemed empty.



* Was he or anyone else in the Control Box asking for or

receiving figures from Police Constable Guest in Club Control

Room, is it usual for him to do so.                           How is it done radio or
phone?



By 2.30 pm Police Constable Bichard I believe made mention of

large crowds in Leppings Lane outside the ground and on looking
upwards at the TV screen I saw large numbers of Liverpool

supporters outside the ground which I would estimate at
3 - 4,000.

Only once before have I seen such numbers and that was when

Sheffield Wednesday played Coventry City in an FA Cup 6th Round

match in 1987 when the Coventry fans came to Sheffield in their
thousands.

Around this time radio messages were coming thick and fast and

any times from this point can only be estimated approximately.
A request came from the Leppings Lane end asking for Leppings
P O L I C E S E R G E A N T 61 6 M I C H A E L G O D D A R D                   PAGE 5




Lane to be closed to traffic due to the volume of persons in the
road.

The radio system was operating on talk through and at around 2.35

- 2.40 pm I received calls that my radio transmissions were poor

and breaking up.              Within seconds of hearing this a civilian

communications officer was at the control and began looking at

the equipment.            He changed the Tulip Microphone for a telephone
handset but the fault remained.                         After a very short time the

back-up set with the telephone handset with central depression

was taken into use by myself.                        The fixed ariel lead meant that

the base station had to be placed under the desk.                         As a result

the base station had to remain under the desk and this meant that

the microphone lead would not reach above the level of the desk

top making it difficult to use.                         After only two or three calls

with the handset, which were not acknowledged, I believed that it

was faulty and I remember throwing the handset on to the control

desk.     I took a normal hand held radio and from that time all

transmissions were relayed in that fashion.                        We were on talk

through so the use of a hand held radio provided the same
service.

At 2.40 pm? a call came from Superintendent Marshall requesting

that the Leppings Lane gates be opened because of the volume of
persons outside.



* Was any action/conversation made on this request?
 P O L I C E S E R G E A N T 616 M I C H A E L G O D D A R D               PAGE 6




Further call from Superintendent Marshall asking for gates to be
opened (means Gate C).



* How does he know Gate 'C '?

Stated that people were being crushed against turnstiles and if
gates were not opened someone would be killed.

I remember something being said about large numbers of non ticket
holders who would get in and cause serious problems for

legitimate ticket holders.                     Mr Marshall again came through asking
for gates to be opened.                   This was not a reguest but an order.



* Can he assist as to order of these events which he clearly has
got wrong.



Mr Murray asked Mr Duckenfield for his decision and he okayed the
gates to be opened.



*How long did this take?                   Was there any other conversation
between Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and Murray?



'C' gate was opened but believed at this time it had been forced

and someone said "They've broke through." I cannot remember if
this was a radio message or said in box.

Mounted officers retrieved the situation and only a few persons
P O L I C E S E R G E A N T 616 M I C H A E L G O D D A R D                        PAGE 7




got through.           More manpower was deputed to Leppings Lane

including mounted.               Mr Marshall again asked for gates to be

opened a second time.                 The gates were opened and many more people

went through than the first time.                             Would estimate many hundreds
went through this time.



* Who gave the order - ie did he and how quickly - was there any

conversation regarding consequences?                            Enhance regarding Lord

Justice Taylor Day 1, Page 85 A—D.                            Was the location of any

ground commanders requested, advice sought on consequences or

instructions given to control influx of supporters either prior

to or subsequent to the order being given to open the gates?                             Was

there any warning to anyone that the gates were about to be                              -
opened?



Radio traffic was heavy and there was much distortion.



* The order to open the gates was given immediately by myself.

No one in the Control Box queried the location of the relevant

ground commanders or the concourse serials either before or after
the order had been given.

* Similarly no contact was made with the Sheffield Wednesday

Football Club or its officials either prior to or subsequent to
the opening of the gates.

* No one in the Control Box countermanded my decision to carry
P O L I C E S E R G E A N T 616 M I C H A E L G O D D A R D               PAGE 8




out Mr Duckenfield's decision immediately.



At approximately 2.52 pm Sergeant Higgins of 'F ' C and V came

through saying "The gates at 'A' have got to be opened as if not

somebody will be killed."                    On receipt of that I said words over

the radio, "If that is the case we have no option open the
gates."

The 'A' gate was opened and access to North Stand only was

gained.        By the time 'A' gate opened the gates at 'C' had been
closed.

During this time I am unable to say whether it was before or

after the gates being opened Police Constable 1863 Buxton came

through asking for the kick off to be delayed.                   As he said this

the Liverpool team took to the field and I replied, "It's too
late one team is already on the field."



* Was there any comment on his decision by those in the box?

Enhance as per answers to Lord Justice Taylor Day 1, Page 80 D
onwards.



I saw that in the Leppings Lane end there was ample room in the

pen nearest the Control Box and the centre pens appeared full but

not out of the ordinary for a big match of this kind.                    I did see

swaying in those pens but again this is a regular occurrence on

big match days.             I was not aware that the game had started when a
P O L I C E S E R G E A N T 616 M I C H A E L G O D D A R D                   PAGE 9




track officer on the Leppings Lane end came through with an

unreadable message.                I then saw a few people climbing the fencing

in the central pens area to get on to the pitch and at that time

my first thought was that there was a pitch invasion.

Within seconds people started coming on to the track via a

perimeter gate, although there was not a large flood.                        Even at

this stage I did not realise the enormity of the problem and made

comment about a Policewoman who was on the track serial by Gate

1.    I would have anticipated that she would have opened this gate

to put the persons on the track back into the outer pen.                        Chief

Inspector McRobbie was in the Control Box at this time and said
words to the effect, "I'll go and sort it out."

It was about this time that I saw Superintendent Greenwood behind

the Leppings Lane goal.                   It was obvious he was trying to transmit

but without success.                I saw then he was waving his arms in a

cross, across his body.                  Many officers were now on the perimeter
track helping people from the central pens.

It was approximately 3.05 pm when Superintendent Greenwood came

through "Stop the match, Stop the match" and I saw Superintendent

Greenwood run on to the field of play.                        I didn't see the match
stopped nor the players leave the field.

All personnel were directed to the perimeter track at the
Leppings Lane end.

It was obvious that the supporters used the centre tunnel to gain

access.       I do not even remember the tunnel gates being closed
P O L I C E S E R G E A N T 616 M I C H A E L G O D D A R D               P A G E 10




before (was it recorded in previous years log?) and the only

times a serial manned the tunnel was a few years ago when both

home and away supporters were allowed to use the Leppings Lane

terraces and West Stand.                    The reason for the Police presence was
segregation of fans and had nothing to do with safety.

Mr. Michael J. C. Burgess,
Coroners Society for England & Wales,




Dear Michael,

                                     Hillsborough

I enclose a copy of the letter I have sent to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith for your
information. In addition to the matters raised at the meeting there were some
additional questions which I have attempted to deal with. In fact there has been a
further issue about an alteration to the coronerâ€™s certificate which was done in 1994.
Mr Dorries will I believe write a reply on this though I have expressed some views to
the Sir Murray.

You will see that since the meeting I discovered that I had seen the statement of Dr.
E. Walker and indeal it is on the Holmes system.

Thank you very much for coming to the meeting.

I would also like to thank you for your kindness to me and for the lunch which I
enjoyed with you after the meeting.


Yours sincerely,



S. L. Popper,

COURTS across the country
halted yesterday to hear trib­
utes to Lord Taylor of Gos­
forth, the judge whose report
into the Hillsborough disaster
changed the face of English
football.
   Lord Taylor, who retired sud­
denly last year as Lord Chief Jus­
tice to fight the cancer that
afflicted him, died on Monday.
He was 66.
  When he became the country’s
most senior Judge in 1992, Lord Tay­
lor was determined to sweep away
the fustiness associated with the
judiciary. One of his first actions
was to hold a news conference —
something his predecessors would
never have done.
  He said: ‘I would like to think that
I’m not thought to be wholly out of
touch — that I am in the main­
stream of life in the country.*
  When once reminded about the               Lord Taylor: Hillsborough report

Beatles, he remarked: ‘Oh, that old         strong and fearless champion of

Courts pay
 tribute
 to Lord

    LEGAL CORRES PONDENT

 COURT hearings were halted
 yesterday as judges and law­
 yers gathered to pay tribute to
 Lord Taylor of Gosforth.
    Lord Taylor, who changed
 the face of football with his
 report into the Hillsborough
 disaster and went on to be­
 come an outspoken Lord Chief
 Justice, died of a brain tumour
 at his home in Guildord,
 surrounded by his four child­
 ren on Monday evening. He
 would have been 67 tomorrow.
    The Lord Chief Justice, Lord
 Bingham of Comhill, led the
 tributes to his predecessor,
 saying: “He spoke out fearless­
 ly and eloquently, but without
 being factious or petty. As
 leader of the judiciary he
 commanded, effortlessly, the
 affection and respect of his
 fellow judges, and of many
 others throughout the world.
 He was loved and admired by
 those who worked for him. He
 was above all a wise, just and
 humane judge.”
    Lord Taylor was also
 praised by the football com­
 munity and the Hillsborough
 Family Support Group, whose
 chairman Trevor Hicks said
 he had broken down barriers
 between the judiciary and the
 public. “He will be remem­
 bered for his. perspicacity, his
 professionalism, dignity and
 bravery. We and football will
 be forever in his debt."
    Lord Taylor had been
 charged with ensuring the
 future safety of football
 grounds after 95 people were
 killed at a 1989 FA Cup semi­
 final. He recommended the
'removal of perimeter fences
 and the introduction of all-seat
 stadiums. Graham Kelly of
 the Football Association, said:
 “Quite simply he changed the
 face of football.”

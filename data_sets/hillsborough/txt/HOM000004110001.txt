          TAYLOR REPORT: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEW OFFENCES AND PENALTIES:

          (i)          TICKET TOUTING OFFENCE                              [70]
          (ii)         OFFENCES IN THE GROUND                              [71]
          (iii)        USE OF ATTENDANCE CENTRES                           [72]
          (iv)         USE OF ELECTRONIC TAGGING                           [73]



          The Home Secretary has seen your submission of 11 July.

          2     He considers that there is a case for a ticket touting
          offence limited to football, where there is a particular
          problem of people travelling without tickets and then causing'
          trouble.  He is also in favour of the three proposed offences
          #                                  t
          m the ground, which he considers would have a greater
          deterrent effect than the one offence of disorderly conduct.

   3    He would like to discuss all the proposals but
   particularly the question of attendance centres.    He has
   noted that ACPO considers the use of attendance centres a good
   idea. He would like to know a little bit more of their
   thinking. He has asked whether it is because they are less
   starry eyed than we are about "constructive activities" at
   attendance centres.

   4    I have asked Miss Murray to put in hand arrangement for a
   meeting to discuss these issues.

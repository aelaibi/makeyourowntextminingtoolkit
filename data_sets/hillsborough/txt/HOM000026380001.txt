           SATURDAY 30TH SEPTEMBER 1989           CHELSEA   -V-   ARSENAL




     This is Chelseas’ first big home match of the season and although the match
is all ticket we are still expecting a large amount of disorder. The hard core
of the Chelsea hooligan element are going all out today to show the remainder of
the country that their enforced rest in the second division last season was just
that - a rest, and not a retirement from the hooligan league.  It should be a
busy afternoon for us. Not only will we have to deal with the large crowd
expected but with the stupid idiots who want to fight.

                                   c.fi.
     Expect a crowd of about thirty five thousand. At the time of writing,
tickets were still being sold. Arsenal are hoping to sell up to six thousand.
For those of you who have not had the pleasure of being on duty at Stamford Bridge
before, the North Terrace is for the visiting supporters only. They should not
have tickets for any other section of the stadium. Unfortunately the touts have
been busy this week buying up tickets at Chelsea and Arsenal. One tout wa_s
arrested at Wembley on Tuesday and had one hundred away tickets with him. If these
are sold to trie wroftg people we could get serious problems inside the stadium.
If any of these characters are seen, let's see if we can arrest them before they
can do any damage.    If you receive any information about touts selling tickets,
inform 'Control' immediately. We have a serial out working the Fulham Road.to
deal with touts.


     Please ensure that each officer on your serial understands his duties and has
read the 'Emergency Evacuation.' and 'Fire' procedures. They will be asked during
the course of the afternoon so let's not embarrass ourselves.  Please ensure that
you fully understand your duty at the end of the match when the cordon is put in
place along Fulham Road.   If you don't please ask. Do not leave your post until
told to do so by either 'Control' or the Inspector in charge of that sector. When
returning to 'FF' please hand in your Form 3166's (A8/10's) into the Chief
Inspector Ops office and ensure that they are signed by either one of the 'FF'
Inspectors or your sector Inspector.




INFORMATION, RUMOURS OR MINOR TRIVIA


     We have received information regarding the hooligan elements from various
sources and their meeting places. Apparently the h^rH pgra fir~m Arm m l hnvri 1"t
it be known that they are going to get off the underground system at Sloane Square,
have a couple oi glasses of the lcoal wine and then march along either Kings Road
or Fulham Road attacking all the pubs. The other meeting place for The Arsenal
hooligans is Earls Lourt koad. Two hundred plus 'Gooners' (Arsenal hard core
hooligans) are going to meet up in two pubs in EarfsJUourt at about 11am. They
are^going to have a good drink and then make their way via the back streets to
North End Road and Fulhanr BroadWay causing as much damage as possible. The majority
of this glOUp have tickets for the North Terrace but fif_tx^f__them apparentl^_have
ggt hold of tickets far the unaar tier of the East Stan d . W e must attempt to stop
these characters before they cause any trouble.   The last thing we want is to try
and stop a full scale fight on the top tier. The Chelsea hooligan group have not
been seen all season until last Saturday when one of our 'spotters' came upon them
in a pub which is off the beaten track. All the main hooligans were there and
they were obviously discussing tactics for today.   It has been suggested that
Arsenal have made known their meeting place in Sloane Square to ensure that Chelsea
turn up at this location. Will they all meet at Earls Court and march down, knowing
that Chelsea will be at Sloane Square scratching their heads wondering where the
opposition is. We'll soon find out.
THEY NEED YOUR HELP


     Wanted by SV for a very serious assault is an IC1 male, 5'8", brown hair with
faint blonde streaks, sleeper stud in one of his ears and one of his front teeth
is described as being half gold. He is called either Tony or Anthony. This
character who is apparently very stocky enjoys punching females for no reason and
is a regular Chelsea supporter. Will he attend? If you know or spot him please
call 'Control' as soon as possible.




FORWARD RECEPTION AND CHARGE CENTRES


     Because of the anticipated number of arrests we have a slightly different
system working today.  The normal F.R.P. will still be in operation behind the
East Stand.  If for any reason you are unable to get your prisoner to this
location we have a smaller version running from 'FF', but please make every
attempt to get to Stamford Bridge. Two Charge Centres will be running.   Chelsea
fans will be dealt with at 'FF' and Arsenal at 'FD'. Do not take your prisoners
direct to the Charge Centre, use the F.R.P. system.


     The security arches will be in operation at the away gate this afternoon.
For those of you who have never seen them in operation they work on the same
principle as the Airport arches. We will also have some hand held metal detectors
for use at the other turnstiles.


     Two spotters will be attending from Arsenal. They will be working in full
uniform and know all their main hooligans.  If you need their assistance regarding
identification of any groups please call them via 'Control1. Any information or
overheard rumours collected on your day out at Stamford Bridge please can you
pass to me.  It all helps.


     Last but not least Lord Justice TAYLOR will be visiting Stamford Bridge this
afternoon. He is hoping to visit all the football grounds before he publishes his
Sinai report on the Hillsborough tragedy.  Please give him any assistance and
answer any questions.

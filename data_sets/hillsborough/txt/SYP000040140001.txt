             Mr Trevor Hicks of                                   Pinner, Middlesex has
             complained that at the football match between Liverpool and Nottingham
             Forest on the 15th April 1989 at the Hillsborough Football Ground you
             neglected to discharge your duties in that you:-
             (a) failed to prevent a dangerous build up of supporters outside of the
                  gates;
             (b) failed to control the movement of supporters subsequent to the opening
                  of Gate 'C'; and
              (c) failed to respond to the developing tragedy and were slow to effect a
                  rescue operation.
             If established, these complaints could disclose possible offences against
             the Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985.

               you so desire - make a written or oral statement concerning the matter to me or to the Deputy Chief
               Constable. (The. Chief Constable has delegated his authority under Regulation 15 of the above Regulations
               to the Deputy Chief Constable)

               YOU ARE HOWEVER. WARNED TH A T IF YOU MAKE SUCH A STATEM ENT TO ME OR TO THE
               DEPUTY CHIEF CONSTABLE. THE STATEMENT MAY BE USED IN A NY SUBSEQUENT DISCIPLIN-
               ARY PROCEEDINGS.

               You have the right to consult a friend at all stages of the investigation and service of this form does not
               necessarily imply that disciplinary proceedings will follow. It is served to safeguard your interest.

Q18

 G52

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO.

 Q53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 I THINK THE POLICE WERE MORE CONCERNED WITH CROWD BEHAVIOUR RATHER THAN

 ASSISTING INJURED FANS AT THE P E N S .   THE POLICE WERE SO SLOW IN REACTING TO

 THE TRAGEDY.     IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE ORDINARY POLICEMAN WAS NOT GIVEN THE

 CWRECT     INSTRUCTION FROM HIS SENIOR OFFICERS AND ALTHOUGH THEY MAY WELL HAVE

 WISHED TO HELP THEY SEEMED TO BE WAITING FOR ORDERS.          THERE WAS AN OBVIOUS

 LACK OF COMMUNICATION.               /

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WIQfi TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THE POLICING OUTSIDE THE GROUND SHOULD BE PRESENT IN SUFFICIENT NUMBERS TO

SEGREGATE FANS, CHECK TICKETS, ORGANISE QUEUES AND ORGANISE ITSELF MORE

 TOWARDS THE FANS SAFETY FEATHER THAN VIEWING IT FROM PURELY CROWD BEHAVIOUR

 S^JATION.      THERE WAS Ai^ OBVIOUS LACK OF POLICEMEN ON THIS OCCASION.

 AS I CAME OUT OF THE TUNNEL AND INTO THE CROWD I JUST GOT STUCK           IN THE MASS OF

 PEOPLE AND LOTS MORE CAME IN BEHIND ME.      I WAS SLOWLY FORCED FORWARD WITH THE

 CROWD, UNABLE TO MOVE, UNTIL I. EVENTUALLY CAME TO A STOP WITHIN THE CROWD, AT

 DID YOU ASSIST ANYONE WHO WAS DEAD OR INJURED r IF SO, BRIEFLY EXPLAIN

 NO, WHEN I GOT ON THE PITCH I WAS TRYING TO GET MY BREATH BACK AND GET MY

 BEARINGS.


Q 17

 G49

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR IN THE DEATHS OR THE

 INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 THE PEN DIVIDING FENCES TRAPPED PEOPLE BETWEEN THEM AND THE PITCH FENCE.

 WHEN THE PRESSURE BUILT UP IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO ESCAPE.     THERE SHOULD HAVE

 BEEN BETTER SIGNS AND EITHER POLICE OR STEWARDS TO DIRECT THE FANS TO OTHER

 A a S AS THE PENS GOT FULL AND THERE WERE NO DIRECTIONS OVER THE TA&fNOY
 w                                   o k     t o   v't              ^ / i s r W C r
 SYSTEM.    FOR SOME TIME PEOPLE IN THE CROWD WERE SCREAMING AT THE FpLICE ON THE
 o o m f L / n /v                                                7
 PITCH TO OPEN THE PITCH GATES TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO ESCAPE.    THE P OLICE WERE

 VERY SLOW IN REACTING.    IT WAS THE FINAL OPENING OF THE GATES WHICH RELEASED

 THE PRESSURE, ALLOWING ME TO GET OUT.                      C O M M £ k J |

 850

 WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 I ’M NOT SURE OF THE TIME,   IT WAS AT LEAST AN HOUR AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED.

 <351

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER,    A STEWARD, A LOUD

 SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 THE ONLY TANNOY ANNOUNCEMENTS I HEARD WERE KENNY DALGLEASH AND ABOUT THIRTY

 MINUTES LATER AN ANNOUNCEMENT SAYING THAT THE MATCH WAS ABANDONED AND THAT WE

 SHOULD KEEP OUR STUBS.


Q18

 Q52

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO.

 Q53
                                                                                PAGE      9

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 IT SEEMED OK AFTER THE GAME WAS STOPPED,       THE FIRE BRIGADE, AMBULANCE AND

POLICE SEEMED TO HAVE IT IN HAND.

 Q53A

 DID YOU ATTEND THE 1988 MATCH?

YES.
                                                   1        i
 Q53B

 C A N ’T YOU COMPARE THE POLICING OPERATION?

LAST YEAR   IT WAS EASIER TO GET IN, BUT I REMEMBER ALSO THAT PE         3 WAS PACKED

 AT HALF TIME I MOVED AND WENT TO THE FAR LEFT.



 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 IT SEEMS THAT THERE HAVE BEEN PREVIOUS PROBLEMS OF OVERCROWDING IN LEPPINGS

LN WITH OTHER TEAMS SUPPORTERS,    SO I C A N ’T UNDERSTAND WHY LIVERPOOL WERE GIVEN

 THE SMALLER END, CONSIDERING WE HAVE AN AVEREAGE G A T E , DOUBLE THAT OF NOTTS

FOREST.

 052

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 SAW A POLICE OFFICER PUNCH A FAN AS HE TRIED TO GET OUT OF THE GATE ONTO THE

 PITCH   (CAN’T DESCRIBE OFFICER).

 I THINK,   BUT W A S N ’T THE ONE SHOWN ON TV.



 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THE MATCH SHOULD HAVE BEEN STOPPED EARLIER, BUT ONCE EVERYONE REALISED HOW

 SERIOUS IT WAS EVERYONE ACTED WELL.        THE FIRE OFFICERS WERE S U P E R B .

 THE CORDON OF OFFICERS ACROSS THE PITCH REALLY ANGERED THE FANS WHO KNEW

 WHAT WAS HAPPENING.


019

 (354

 Ie^THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THE POLICING 0/S LAST YEAR WAS BETTER WITH A CORDON CONTROLLING THE FLOW TO

 THE GROUND.

 ANOTHER GROUND SHOULD HAVE BEEN USED AND OBVIOUSLY THE TICKET ALLOCATION.

 I SPOKE TO TWO YOUNG OFFICER MALE & FEMALE ON THE PITCH.            I ASKED THEM HOW IT

 HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO HAPPEN.      THEY SAID THEY H A D N ’T DONE CROWD CONTROL BEFORE

 BEING FROM ROTHERHAM 8> DONCASTER AND THE DAY WAS GOOD FOR OVERTIME.

 THE KICK OFF SHOULD HAVE BEEN DELAYED AND THE PA SYSTEM SHOULD HAVE BEEN USED

 TO BETTER EFFECT.     THERE WAS OBVIOUSLY NO COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE POLICE &
                                                                        PAGE:.  !

 STEWARDS.

 THERE WAS A LACK OF FIRST AID EQUIPMENT TO HELP THE DOCTORS ON THE PITCH.

 THE ATTITUDE OF THE S YORKS POLICE TOWARDS LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS BOTH LAST YEAR

 AND THIS WAS OFF ? THEY OBVIOUSLY D I D N ’T LIKE US.

 AFTER    I HAD TAKEN THE FIRST INJURED PERSON BACK THROUGH THE TUNNEL I NOTICED

 A LINE OF POLICEMEN STANDING ACROSS THE MOUTH.                  ONE OF THEM SAID TO ME,       ’YOU

 C A N ’T GO BACK IN T H E R E . ’   I SAID,    ’S O M E O N E ’S GOT TO CARRY THEM O U T ’, AND I

 WALKED PAST THEM BACK DOWN THE TUNNEL.                THEY DID NOTHING TO HELP.

 I ALSO HELPED TO PULL DOWN THE HOARDINGS BELOW THE WEST STAND TO USE

 AS STRETCHERS.             /\ __ __    ^(STT               -K

          HAMMOND SUDDARDS - REQUEST FOR MATERIAL

          I have pleasure in enclosing a letter dated 8 September 1989 from
          Hammond Suddards asking for further copies of material that they have
          already received during the course of the public inquiry.  I have no
          objection to supplying such materials, but would look to you for the
          appropriate approval.  The supply of this material will in no way
          compromise the criminal inquiry.




   PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE AT         Lloyd, House x'.Birmingham

Dear Sir,

Hillsborough

^Ji^you may know, we are acting on behalf of the South Yorkshire
 Police in relation to the civil claims arising out of the
 Hillsborough disaster.

In connection with this matter, it would be most helpful if we
could have six further copies of the compilation video and six
further sets of the two composite photograph albums prepared by
your Officers for distribution to the inquiry and referenced as
RAH/Hill/l-L and RAH/Hill/2-N.

We shall be greatly obliged if you can arrange for these further
copies to be provided to us as soon as possible.

We shall be pleased to pay your charges in this connection.


Yours faithfully




                                                                                 J, A-dL                                          '• A * '

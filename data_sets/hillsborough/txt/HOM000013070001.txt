        HniSBORDDGH:   CHIEF CONSTABLE



♦       I suggest the following draft text for the short statement ^tfiich the
        Heme Secretary wishes to make, given Mr Wright's announcement that he
        has offered his resignation to the South Yorkshire Police Authority


              Mr Wright, the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, is an
              outstanding chief officer of police with a distinguished record
              of achievement and service.   His acceptance of responsibility, on
              behalf of his farce and those individual members of it whose
              shortcomings are identified in Lord Justice Taylor's interim
              report an the Hillsborough tragedy, and his offer of resignation
              to the South Yorkshire Police Authority, is a typically dignified
              and hcncurable response to the report.    It will now be far the
              South Yorkshire Police Authority to consider his continuance in
              office in the light of his offer to resign.

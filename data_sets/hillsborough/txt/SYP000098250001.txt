                 when alterations were being made to th* ground
                 in the summer of 1985.

In connection with these matters, I have the following further comments

         1.       I would not suggest that a lot of work is
                      done on this but if work has already
                      been carried out which casts doubt cn
                      the H.S .E.- figures then I would like to
                      know.

         2.       The officers who gave statements about this
                      matter to the West Midlands Enquiry were
                      P.C. 2981 Barnes, P.C. 205 Beardshall,
                      P.c. 78 Booth, P.C. 229 Cable, P.C. 1157
                      Castleton, P.C. 451 Cooper, P.C. 120
                      Harris, former P.S. Trevor Higgins, P.C.
                      1051 Hobson, P.C. 2528 Hughes, P.C. 138
                      Saunders, P.C. 2517 Shelton and P.C. 3017
                      Smalley. There may be others.   It can be
                      seen that some of these officers indicate

                        and some
                        'What interests me is the cross-reference
                        to evidence given by a Mr. Eccleston to
                        the enquiry, recorded at t r a n s c r i p t ^ d a y . . .     ..
                        page 21E and page 26£ to the effect that
                        there was a joint cordon of stewards and
                        Police with, in the witness' vi ew, more
                        stewards than Police. This is tc some extent
                        borne out by the evidence of the witness
                        May hew (day 5 , P.. 150D), although this is
                        not as cogent. This is particularly
                        significant because the Taylor report is
                        quite critical of our alleged failure to
                        pick up the blocking of the tunnel on
                        a debrief.   If stewards were also involved,
                         then the failure on the part of the club
                         is at least as great and if the instruction,
                        or request,to block the tunnel came from
                        stewards or from Hr. Lock then the club *s
                         responsibility is correspondingly increased.

         3.        There may be something in these remarks which is
                       of interest or which could be usexul in cross-
                       examination of the club.

          4.       The preparation of such a plan Is an essential
                       part of our case that the collapse of th*
                       barfler was th« factor which turned an already
                        serious incident into a major disaster,            it
                                  den*ed tl?at there w u l d have been
                       fatalities and serious injuries in the absence
                       or that collapse because it is cles^ that
         v            there were some fatalities in p*n a* The
    '10° x            evidence which we already have does ’tend to
                       f*0*- hoever, that much of the fatal!tv occurred
                       in the area in front of the col lapsed' barri«r
                      At present our          ce c o n s i s t s ^ ^ h e r S t h f r " ^ " "
                       limited plan placed before the Enquiry a£d the
                       factual statements of the officers directly
                      concerned in the rescue. My feeling is that
                       this evidence would be stronger if presented
                      as a single plan prepared from the material
                      produced at the Inguest • We have an Order that
                      such material can be received in evidence at
                      the trial and it would be much raore difficult
                      for our opponents to attack a plan prepared
                      directly from the Inquest material than it
                      would be in respect of « case dependant
                      principally on oral evidence.

        liewThe refirencf here is to a letter of 2nd May 1985
                   from South Yorkshire C.C. to Eastwoods ^h^ir

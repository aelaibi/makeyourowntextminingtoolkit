Thank you very much for your letter of 8 May, and for your kind comments on
my recent appointment.

I agree that a meeting would be useful to discuss the matters which you raise
and I shall ask my office to find a mutually convenient time. It would be helpful
if you could let me know in advance of the meeting of any particular issues
which you would like to discuss.




                                                  /
                                   /

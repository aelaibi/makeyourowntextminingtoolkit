Whilst        on      the     pitch        I saw         t h e xpkn w h o              h ad     fallen            on my        shoulder

earlier,           it w a s        now     obvious/that                     he    had      died          as    he    had       b e e n il a i d         out

to    the     right         hand      side       of/the            goal.              I met        up with|_________ a g a i n                         while

on the        pitch,          andkwe        3Vft         the       ground             together            about          ten minutes                   after

the     l ou d     speaker          annoucernent               saying             the      match          had       b e e n a b a n d o n e d . It's

my    opinion          that        Liverpool             should             have       had      the       la r g e       end       of    the

ground,          it    being        obvious          that          we       would       have         the       more          supporters.                  The

by o f f i c e r s .          My    main       point          is    the          tot a l      lack        of      direction              once          inside
                                                                                                                               PAGE

             the     ground      everyone       j us t     went         for       tunnel   thinking     they     could    f i11 e r t 1

             the     side.       Stewards       signs       and         Police       Officers    directing         people      away

             from     the     tun n e l    would     have       prevented            this.     I myself      didnt      want    to

             stand     behind        the    goal.         The      police          reacted

             incredibly          slow when          the    incident               happened,    and when      it w a s    realised

             what    was      happening        there       seemed            total    confusion       from   the    police      and

             everyone         alike.        Some     of    the       police         officers    acted    brilliantly           but

             s ome   were      j ust      in the     way,       o nce       the     incident    had    happened.

             I would         like    to    cl ear    one    p o i nt        from     earlier    that    people      drinking

             canned     be er       outside     the       ground          were      only   drinking     them with        their

             sandwiches.            There     was     no    drunkeness               around    the    ground,,     or   inside,.

                  I am a m a rr i ed man and              I have a 2 1/2        (half)     year old daughter,               i

                  live at      the above a d d r e s s .



                  I support Liverpool               Football      Clu b and have held a season ticket                       for

                  the Hop at A n fi el d for              two years.



                  On S a t u rd a y    15th April         1989    <150489),     Liverpool       were    to      play N ot ti n gh a m

                  Forest      in the semi-final             of the F.A,       Cup Competition,               The game was           to

                  be    played at H i l l s b o r o u g h S t ad iu m     in Sheffield-         I had a £6„00p

                  Le ppings Lane          Terrace     ticket       that   I had obtained from Liverpool

                  Football      Club.         I got   this       ticket as     I am a season ticket               holder.



                  I had been at H i l l s b o ro u gh S t ad iu m only once                before      that day and that
                                                                                                          page        e
r                                                                                                         S3571

    was again the semi--final                   of the F .A . Cup      in 198S    (000088) , between the

    same     two teams.



    On S at ur d ay          15th April    1989    (150489)       I t ra velled on the         m atch day to

    S h e f f ie l d    in my own Ford Sierra             car.     I had 4 friends          in my car as

    passengers.               We all    had tickets       for    the L ep pings Lane T e r r a ce.         This

    was    the end of t he ground                set aside       for Liverpool       Supporters,     iiy______

    We    left about           11am    (1100)    on the morning        of the m atch for Sheffield.

    We did not              stop on the way to Sheffield,              arriving      there about 2 . 15pm

    (1415).            My    car was    parked at a point at           the top of a hill,          near

    coaches,           in a side       street.     This    side    street    had a phone       bo;-; at    the

    corner.            I do not know the name of this street.



    We walked towards                 the ground.    The street was          quite    busy with

    supporters,             who were     in a relaxed mood.            The a tmosphere was         generally

    good.        I never        saw any signs       of di st ur ba nc e     or drunkenness.         Our     route

    was    quite        busy wit h P ol i ce m en standing at the sides                of the     roads.



    The Police were              not having       to do anythi ng and ware            not    checking      the

    crowds for              people without       tickets.



    The weather was              perfect,       it was    sunny and d r y .      We got outside           the

    turnstile           entrance about 2.45pm             (1445).      The scene      outside was         totally

    unorganised.               There was a lot of P o l i c e me n about who            could have

    o r ga ni se d the         people    into queues,       but they didn't          do so.    There was         no

    recognisable              queues    that you    could join,        it was just a mass          of people

    ftutside the turnstiles.                    It was    crowded.

          My friends and         I made        our way towards              the    right hand side         turnstiles,

          where    the    crowd was      not     so tightly             packed./'A P ol i ce m an on horseback

          shouted down to us,            " D o n ’t rush,         t h e r e ' / a gate open        round there," and

          he    indicated further         round the             car net/'to the          right.,
                                                                      /
                                                                   /'
                                                                       /

    t /   We walked quickly around to the Ire a ths p ol i ce m an had i ndi c a t e d ,

          where I saw a large gate open./ I d o n ’t know who opened this gate,
                                                           f

          This would        be about 2 . 5 3 o m       (/455)      or just afterwards.                Wit h my friends

          we were     the first        people        through this open gate.                  Once    inside      I was
                                        f
          looking     round for someone/to                 take my ticket            but    no one was         in this

          a re a to   check your        tickfts.


                                           i

          A h e a d of us    I saw a tinnel,            through w hich             I could see the         goal     net

          that was       nearest      to sieppings Lane,



          I walked down this            tunnel with my friends.                      At first      the    tunnel       was

          not too busy,         but the further along you wa lk ed the busier                              it b e c a m e .

          I remember        it was     dark     in the tunnel,



          Once    into the terrace             our group and             I moved     into the      right       hand si d e
|\or'h
          of the terrace.             It was     oacked tight              in the terrace at the               back.        I

          only got       into   the    crowd at the back a short way,                        it was      too    busy to

          get    further     down for a better                 view.       The    players were out on the fiel-

          and wi t h i n what      seemed       like seconds,              the m atch kicked off.



          There was       continual      pressure building                  from the back,         and    1 got

          s e p arated from my friends,               as       I was     forced further        to my      right.        I

          thought about         getting        out    of the terrace,              but    it was   too busy to get

          out.
                                                                                                      PAGE        4
                                                                                                      S3571



I was    being       s qu as he d    in the     crowd.        My feet were          sometimes    off the

ground.



I remember       that as        I first       entered the            terrace.       I was    faced with a

girl,    aged about          18 years,        who was       lying on the terrace,              her feet were

higher       than her head.            This girl        was    screaming        hysterically,       shouting

out    for    people     not    to    crush her.          1 got hold of this girl's               arm and

together with the help of another                         fan,       that   I d o n ’t know,    we managed

to get this          girl    back     onto    her feet.             I was   being    pushed    c ontinually

and    edged towards           the    right and further               down the terrace,         by the

crowd    pressure a r ou n d me.



I never       saw any of the game.                 I was      not     paying a tt e nt i on to the game.

I realised that             I was     in a very bad situation.                  The     crowd was    surging

forward and backwards,                 it was just         so tight.          I ’m sure      I ’ve never   been

in such a crowd as that                 before.         The heat was          increasing as       it was

just    so tight.           I was     by now panicking a bit.                   I was    sweating

heavily.        The     crowd       pressure     turned my body ar ou nd              in a sideways

direction.           At one     point my        right     side was being            forced against       the

side of one of the metal                    barriers.         This     scraped my skin         in that area,

and    resulted       in bruising.



All    around me        people were          in d i s t r e s s .     I could hardly breath.             I saw

people       in the     crowd,       just    using all        their     energy to breath and you

could see the effort                 on their faces,           as they s tr uggled w it h their

eyes    closed.         You did not have the               energy to shout            out.



I could see P o I i c em e n on the               perimeter          track and some fans were

shouting       for    the gates        to be opened.
                                                                                                            PAGE         5
                                                                                                            S3571



     I was        stuck    on this       barrier    until     two or three         lads     put their

     feet     on this       barrier and f orced the               people     behind them back a bit

    a n d this a l l o w e d me          to get under        their      legs and free of the barrier.

     The     game    had stopped by now.



     I saw        people    climbing       the    perimeter       fence,     not very many.             The Police

    were      standing          outside    the fence        urging      people    to move     back.



    Once      I was       free    of the       barrier    I put my foot          on it and       pushed back,

    and this a l l o we d             people    to move     from the front         to the back          of the

     terracing.            This       barrier was about          half way down the terracing                 in pen

    3 and         close to the fence             separating       pen 3 from       pen 2.



     I saw fans           helping       others    by cupping        their    hands and       letting      people

     c limb out of          pen 3 over          the fence,       into    pen 2.     1 climbed over           in this

     w ay    into    pen 2.           I found pen 2 shallow,            you had plenty of            room in

     the re .



     Once     inside       pen 2,       I cupped my hands           to a llow other         fans   to    climb over

>    the     fence,       out    of    pen 3,    into    pen 2.



     I d o n ’t have a clue of the                 time but       I remember a - man being              passed o v e r

     the fence        into       pen 2 from       pen 3.      This man was about 30 years                  old.     He

    xwas     heavily b u i l t , wit h a large stomach.                     He had black         hair and a

     moustache.            This man was          d ressed    in a    ’T * s h i r t , and    1 think a pair of

     jeans.         I helped          lift this man       into    pen 2.      He was      then     passed to

     other f a n s , and          lifted over       the     perimeter       fence.     This man was

     laid     inside       the & yard bo:-: to the            right of the goal             post as      I looked

     at     it,    from the terrace.              I saw a man,          I took to be this man's mate,
          trying     to revive him.        He was with an a m b u l a n ce m an or a Policeman.

          After a while        they gave up and         1 saw his face          covered up.



g/Q              scene was a bs ol ut e      chaos all around.              It was d ifficult      to take           it

           ill in.     I remember a P ol i ce m an on the track hitting                   out with his
C       , ‘
OJ)W   I ®*''J'r un c heon, as fans tried to climb over the perimeter fence.



          People were       being    passed over ail          the    time    into   pen 2.      I think a few

          others may also        have      been dead.        I can't    describe       others,    except         for

          one young     girl.



          I first     saw this      girl   when     I was    in pen 2 and she was            lying on her

          back    in pen 3.      There was about three               people    lying    in this area,            the

          girl    is the one     that      I remember.        She     was    lying just above          the

          half way     point of      the terrace,       quite       close    to the fence adjoining

          pen 2.     The girl was aged about                15 years    old,    she was a white             girl.

          Her    face was a terrible          colour,       it was    greyish blue,



                       can't    remember      her    clothing,       it was    the girl's       face    I

          remember.        She a p p e a r e d to me to be dead.



          This    girl was     e ve n tu al ly also    passed over          the fence    into    pen 2.          I

          went    to assist,     but    1 just      froze and       couldn't.       I never     saw the gir!

          after    that.     I presume       she too was       passed forward onto the             pitch.



          The man     I helped over,         who d i e d , 1 have seen on film clips               on       f.

           .     I saw a p hotograph of him            in a newspaper,          I'm not sure w hich

          newspaper     this was.          T think    this man was the first             person to be

          placed on the field at that                right    hand side       of the ground.
                                                                                                 PAGE        ■;
                                                                                                 S3571

I saw ambul a n c e s arriving           onto the     pitch,

I saw a pressman on the             pitch p ho tographing         the scene,       and    lifting

jackets      etc off the     faces       of the victims and then           photograph the face;

of the    people who       had died,



I also saw a pressman enter                pen 3 through the gate and              photograph

the almost      vacant     terrace.        He was     taking    pictures    of d iscarded

shoes and other         property on the terrace.                Some fans took       the    camera

off    this man.     The Police          removed this man from the terrace.



I saw the Liverpool          Manager,       K en n y D AL GL I SH go    into the Police

Control      B o x , at first    I couldn't        hear him,     but    later    I did hear       him

make an anno u n c em en t      from there,



I w ould not go onto         the    pitch as       it was a l re ad y    crowded,        1 was

looking      for my friends        by now and saw                           in the W e s t

Stana,             then got      lifted down to where            1 was.     We w ai t ed on

the terrace       for a while       longer,     until    it was    v irtually empty,



       and    I left the ground,           going    back out through the tunnel

The    tunnel   was empty,         The    ground was almost        empty by now,                   and   I

 met            and the others           just outside     the football          ground.     We all

returned to our         car and drove        to a little        country    pub,    about    one mile

from the ground.



1 got home about 9 . 4 5 p m        (2115)     that    night.

I never      lost any    property that day,




As a result       of the    crushing       in the     crowd,    my sides and       chest were

           bruised,      as were   both my arms.     I had      a painful   back   for some    time,

           but   it seems to be alright      now.        I never went to my doctor.       I never

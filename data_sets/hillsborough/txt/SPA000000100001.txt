1       Matter for Consideration
         Initial account received from West Midlands Police Authority for costs of
         investigation in to the Hillsborough Disaster.
2       Background Information
         Attached are
         (a)     Briefing note prepared for members for the meeting with Lord
                 Ferrers on 20 June 1989. This sets out the stance of the
                 Authority at that time.
         (b)     Letter from Lord Ferrers dated 27 June setting out the Home
                  Office’s position including the offer of special Government grant
                  of up to 90% of all costs with South Yorkshire’s contribution
                  pegged at 3/4 p rate (approximately £975,000).
         (c)     Letters to Lord Ferrers and Home Office dated 31 July seeking
                 clarification of applicability of this offer to continuing
                 investigations by the Chief Constable of West Midlands beyond
                 their service to the Taylor enquiry.
          (d)     Letter from Home Office dated 9 August in answer to (c).
          (e )    Letter to Home Office dated 10 August bringing into account the
                  possibility of damages costs beyond the Authority s insurance
                  cover.
          (f)     Letter from West Midlands Police Authority dated 11 August
                  enclosing interim account.
    3     Comment
          The work now being performed by the Chief Constable of West g l a n d s
          goes beyond that initially envisaged in discussions with the Home Office.
          The investigations relating to the Coroner’s inquest are such as would
          unquestionably have fallen to be carried out by the Chief Constable of
          South Yorkshire and been a charge to the Authority.
          The Chief Constable’s assessment is that had this work been carried out
          internally it would certainly have generated a M U i Q M l expenditure in
          excess of £lm which would have been met from the operational contingency.
          Given the Home Office assurance that the c°rresPonding expenditure by West
          Midlands would qualify for special grant arrangements t is now the case
          that the Authority will not lose financially by accepting the Home
          Office’s proposals.
     Recommendation
     In the new circumstances members are recommended
     (i)       To reiterate their initial view that the costs incurred by the
               Chief Constable of the West Midlands at the service of the Taylor
               enquiry are properly chargeable to the Home Office.
     (ii)      To accept that the costs incurred by the Chief Constable of the
               West Midlands in connection with the preparation of evidence
               the Coroner’s inquest which may also be relevant to f^ure
               complaints, disciplinary proceedings or criminal or JiviJcourt
               cases, are properly rechargeable to the South Yorkshire Police
               Authority.
     Hii}      To aaree as a matter of practical expediency to reimburse West
               Midlands Police Authority the total costs of the
               Chief Constable subject to confirmation from the Home Office that
               the grant arrangements set out in their letter of 27 June should
               apply to all such expenditure including any interest charged by
               West Midlands Police Authority and any interest incurred by South
               Yorkshire Police Authority arising from any delay betweeni the
               rendering of accounts by the Authority and receipt of payment from
               the Home Office.

         Bear Mr Johnston,

                                            HTT,T.SttOBOTTGH INQUIRY

         We seem to have madeno progress in persuading the Home      Secretary to accept
         costs of the Hillsborough Inquiry should be paid direct by the Home Office and
         the position appears to rest with the offer in Lord Ferrers’ letter of the 27th
         June to your Chairman      and your Authority resolving to consider the matter
         further after receiving legal advice.

         Here in the West Midlands we are naturally increasingly concerned that
         substantial costs continue to be incurred with no immediate prospect of
         reimbursement and I think it now appropriate to render an account to you of our
         costs to date and to request your Authority to pay this interim account for
         £1,677,402 as the Home Office suggest.

         It should be noted that the attached account is based on actual payments made
         and   there are a number of large outstanding accounts on computer and
         communications equipment and accommodation etc. which will be charged in the
         near future.     It is also intended that a charge for interest incurred by the
         West Midlands Police Authority from the dates of payment to the dates of
         reimbursement will be included in future accounts in accordance with the Home
         Office advice that no costs of the Inquiry will fall on the West Midlands.

         No doubt your Authority willconsider this along with the legal advice you have
         sought on the issue. I awaithearing from you.

         I am informing         the Home Office of this action and enclose a copy of my letter
         to them.

Dear Mr Addison
HILLSB0R0U6H : COST OF INVESTIGATION BY WEST MIDLANDS POLICE
Thank you for your letter of 9 August the contents of which I will reDort to
the Authority at the earliest "*?oortunity. However, I have to advise you
that, tomorrow's meeting has been cancelled as a result of th^ HAL GO action.
T w^uld also take this opportunity to refer again to the question of damages
wM'-h was raised by the Home Office at our first, meeting. At the time, on
the basis of discussions which had then +i»kcn piece .wUh our Insure-s, I
stated that I felt that the. total Insurance cover of £2}n wnuld be adequate
for any eventuality. I can ' &2 X£tr\ n furth*-.- at present than to say that
the Insurers have radically changed their advice 1n the light nf the
progress of the inquiry and the p u b H c a M o -  the rw^r*. u «nay         be
that +hc Authority will bzy? *' naV.e                         *''r   .-un s for

    I enclose a copy of a letter that Sir John Layden has written in response to
    Lord Ferrers’ letter of 27 June following the meeting at the Home Office on
    20 June.
    In order to enable the Authority to take in to account the latest situation when
    it meets on 11 August will you please let me know
    (a)     to what extent West Midlands Police are undertaking work other than for
             Lord Justice Taylor’s enquiry and for what purposes; and
    (b)     whether any expenditure on such activities which is legitimately
             chargeable to South Yorkshire Police Authority would be covered by the
             terms of Lord Ferrers letter of 27 June.

Dear Lord Ferrers
HILLSBOROUGH : COST OF INVESTIGATION BY WEST MIDLANDS POLICE
Thank you for your letter of 27 June in which you confirm your stance on the
cost of the West Midlands Police inquiry as previously explained to us at our
meeting on 20 June.
I have discussed your proposal further with members of the Authority and have to
say that we also are still of the view which we explained at that meeting.
I now understand that the West Midlands Police inquiry is perhaps being further
extended in a way that the Police Authority has not previously considered. I
have asked the Clerk to the Authority to clarify this with Mr Addison and will
write to you further when we have received this information.
Yours sincerely

     H I L L S B O R O U G H;   C O S T OF INVESTIGATION BY fcffiST MIDLANDS SPLICE

     I said that I would write to you following our recent meeting on
     this subject. I much enjoyed meeting you and the other members ot
     your Police Authority and I am o*ly *o sorry that it should have
     been the distressing events at Hillsborough which occasioned the
     meeting. May I again express my sympathy for all of you at this
     difficult time.
      I was very grateful for the clear end courteous way in which you
      explained your Authority's position.
     you  agreed that the Chief Constable Pf„ South Yorkshire
      decided that another force should be celled in to investigate the
      events at Hillsborough, because it was fiegifibie ihat the
      investigation should be seen to be independent of South Yorkshire
      police.
      You also take the view that, when it^as subsequently <
      establiah the enquiry und«c W f d                »na to fljc. the
      results of the investigation at the *ff*lce     thJ
      so changed the character of the investigation, and ij*         that
      as a matter of principle the South Yorkshire Police Authority
      should no longer be expected to bear the costs.
      You also made the point that the expected scale of costs could be
      such as seriously to .threaten .the ,*f!iflifncy of the South Yorkshire
      police force and could not be absorbed within the Authority s own
      resources.


                                                                /I explained that.

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM TRAGEDY - FINANCING OF WEST MIDLANDS POLICE ENQUIRY
MEETING WITH LORD FERRERS ON TUESDAY. 20 JUNE 1989
Briefing Note for Members
1    Introduction
      This meeting was set up pursuant to the resolution of Police F and G P
      Committee on 21 April 1989 that "any costs incurred by the South Yorkshire
      Police Authority in consequence of the public enquiry (including the
      associated West Midlands police inquiry) be met from central resources."
      An officer level meeting was held at the Home Office on Thursday, 18 May
      1989. Members have previously received a note of this meeting but a
      further copy is attached.
2    Establishment of Enquiry
      The Chief Constable of West Midlands was initially invited by Mr Wright to
      conduct an enquiry into the policing of the match at Hillsborough on 16
      April on the basis that the magnitude of and publicity surrounding the
      disaster made it essential that an independent view of the police action
      was obtained. In taking this decision Mr Wright had not identified any
      specific Chief Constable and it was only after Mr Dear had been identified
      by the Chief HMI and his suitability personally approved by the Home
      Secretary that the formal invitation was made.
      Following discussions that same day involving the Home Secretary, both
      Chief Constables, and the Chief HMI, the Home Secretary announced in the
      Commons on Monday the establishment of an enquiry to be headed by Lord
      Justice Taylor with the following terms of reference
      "To enquire into the events at Sheffield Wednesday football ground on 15
      April 1989 and to make recommendations about the needs of crowd control
      and safety at sports grounds."
      In answer to questions Mr Hurd stated that "the work to be carried out by
      the Chief Constable of the West Midlands force will be at the service of
      Lord Justice Taylor
3     Assistance between Forces
      The following circumstances for enlisting the aid of an external police
      force can be identified under present legislation:-
      (a) Under Section 14 of the Police Act 1964 "The chief officer of police
          of any police force may, on the application of the chief officer of
          police of any other police force provide constables or other
          assistance for the purpose of enabling the other force to meet any
          special demand on its resources.”
       (b) Under Section 85(3) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, if
           it appears to the chief officer that a complaint is not suitable for
           informal resolution he shall appoint an officer from his force or
           some other force to investigate it formally.
           Where the investigation is supervised by the Police Complaints
           Authority they may approve the officer from the other force.
2’          It is apparent that neither of these clauses covers the circumstances of
            the West Midlands enquiry.
\           View of Home Office
            In the officers meeting on the 18 Hay Hr Addison argued that the enquiry
            was started at the initiative on the Chief Constable          YJ ^ S 1re
            and that the principal focus of the enquiry was on          !n Sout
            Yorkshire and the actions of some of the members of the South Ycnrksnir
            force. Therefore the financing of the investigation                  at
            least in the first instance, by South Yorkshire Police Authority.
            While the basis of the assistance provided by West Midlands could not be
            said to fall under the normal mutual aid arrangements thes®
        "   most useful basis for sorting out the financing. This would Involve SYPA
            reimbursing the West Midlands and the Home Office financing SYPA s
            expenditure after a certain threshold had been             h sSuthXYorksh1re
            the context of the miners’ strike the cost remaining with South Yorkshire
            County Council had been limited to 3 / 4 p (approximately £1 m).
5           View of SYPA
            Our response was that the enquiry was concerned not only "J|;h
            issues but also with matters that were not solely to .do              ‘
            cafetv at sports grounds etc. The Home Secretary had quite properly
            subsumed the West Midlands enquiry under that to be headed by
            Taylor and the conduct of Hr Dear’s officers made it quite plain that they
            were reporting to Lord Justice Taylor. South Yorkshire Police were
            incurring significant expenditure on their own internal 1"v®      1°"*
            preparation for the enquiry and to answer any writs served on the force.
6            Financial Resources
             The current year’s budget assumes balances as at 1 April of £l*895m.
             This includes an operational contingency of £lm leaving an estimated year
             end balance of only £895,000.
                 It is already apparent that provisions for pay awards for APT and
                 uniformed staff will be insufficient to meet the settlements which in the
                 case of police officers are linked to wage inflation.
                 To meet any other than a small proportion of the cost of the West Midlands
                 enquiry, currently estimated to run to several m i l l i o n pounds would leave
                 the Authority with no resources t o f i n a n c e contingencies a^J^ng during
                 the year and with no balances for the first year of community charge.
    7            Conclusions
                 We must obviously therefore resist the suggestion that the Police
                 Authority should pick up the bill for the West Midlands enquiry. It may
                 be appropriate that South Yorkshire should contribute a small amount
                 towards the ful1 cost but it is important that the Government specifically
                 accepts their b a s i c responsibilities for an enquiry of national
                 importance.

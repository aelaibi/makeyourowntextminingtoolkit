2.    Call-out protocols.
      It was generally felt that it was useful for the different agencies to be in
      regular contact so that they werefamiliar   with each others responsibilities
      -,n ,q        ~   £■ ;>•*. 4*? t**! ^ «   \n             3 -3i S 3 s t e r «

      There was much discussion about the merits of making radio appeals to get
      staff to an incident,     Some felt that this should not happen and that
      the District emergency plan should beadhered to.Others felt       that in
      certain circumstances such an appeal was beneficial.
      It was felt that it would be useful if District officers had some highly
      visible form of identification, (eg. tabards) when they turned up at an
      incident so that the Police could help them get through.   There is a danger
      that if too many people think they can help then roads and access points get
      clogged up.   The Police may be needed to get both local authority staff and
      equipment through to the scene of a disaster.
      In general the Police Officers on the ground are not aware of the Districts'
      plans or arrangements.    However, they should contact the South Yorkshire
      Police Operations Room in the      event ofa disaster as   all of    Malcolm
      Edmundson*s  staff are aware of the Districts’ emergency arrangements.
      Malcolm Edmundson is trying to make sure that middle ranking officers are
      also aware of these arrangements.
      District liaison officers emphasised that Police contact should primarily be
      with their main call-out points who will alert all other council staff.
      Malcolm Edmundson agreed to call a meeting to discuss lessons learnt
      following the Hillsborough disaster once the Inquiry report has been
      released.

                  but local Divisional Police would probably be involved as well.


           Resources

           The District representatives emphasised that different departments in eac*
           Distrie, may have different responsibilities and resources. Therefore it was
           important for police contact to be through the District Controller.   It was
           felt that resources could not be listed in any great detail i„ plans as they
           were constantly changing.                                      e      s zne?


 5.       Rest Centres

          i h i i ^ StFiCtSJ iaVe rSSt °entreS earrnarked in their emergency plans.    The
          choice of exact centre to be used would be made when it was needed taking
          into account the prevailing circumstances.      The Sheffield experience is that
          it is preferable to co-locate rest centres with feeding centres

          s e ' £ ^     f presentatives s^ t e d that they did not want the voluntary
           ervices to take over setting up rest centres as this created many problems.


fi.       Church Initiatives

          Archdeacon Lowe of Sheffield is currently preparing a call-out plan for the
                  ^ h      ®Vent of a disaster where counselling is required          At
          Hillsborough many priests had problems getting into the ground    T h is p la n

          denominations, etc.                                   energy, eg. different

          There was some debate as to whether the District controllers should alert the

8.   Chief Executives' Seminar
     ‘ Simon Turney passed a copy of a letter from Somerset County Council to the
       District            representatives   concerning the   response to  an emergency in
      M e t r o p o l i t a n areas.    District representatives were asked to forward any
       comments to Simon Turney for incorporation in an Emergency Planning College
      exercise.


9.    Role of the Hazrdous Waste Unit
      Following the meeting between the District     liaison officers and    the, Fire
      Service Susan Small had investigated the role   of the Hazardous Wast- O m
      an emergency.    The Hazardous Waste Unit is now based m Rotherham.         They
      should be called out via any of the four Chief Environmental Health Officers,
      but in practice they are often contacted directly.       Their role is purely
      advisory.  They will provide information about waste materials but they wi
      not remove them or dispose of them.


10. Cycle For Future Meetings.
    It was agreed that the group should aim to meet once per year.   Malcolm
    Edmondson agreed to call a further meeting once the Hillsborough Inquiry
    report was released to discuss lessons learnt.

        Dear Sirs,

        Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.


        If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
        of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent,
        on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m. Details of venue will be notified in
        due course.

        I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
        evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
        coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
        inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

       Subject to the Coroners’ Act 1988 and the Coroners' Rules, the Inquest is
       under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
       witnesses who wish to give evidence.  I am at present engaged in considering
       this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

       Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
       to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
       appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me to
       consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

       May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
       attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

       I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
       names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision as
       to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

       I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
       heard from you by the end of September I will assume you have no names to
       submit.

       Yours faithfully,




HS&AAw H .M .Coroner.

Dear Sir,

Re: James Robert Hennessy

Thank you for your letter of the 16th instant, the contents of which
we note.

The correct spelling of Hennessy is as shown and obviously our letter
of the 30th instant must have been a clerical error.

We have now received legal aid in respect of our client and as such
we are acting in connection with the inquest.

At present we are about to make an application for grant of letters
of administration but in the meantime, would you please accept a copy
of the marriage certificate as documentary evidence of our client's
name.

Could you please release the post-mortem report on our client and we
do of course undertake to agree your terms and conditions set out in
your letter of the 31st July.

We hope to hear from you soon.

Yours faithfully

        Dear         s ir e ,
        Re: James R.Hennesaar (deceased)* Ho,2._
        As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
        Disaster stand adjourned to a date to he fixed. You may also
        he aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
        on the 15th of January 1990.

        I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
        has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
        behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not- to resume the
        Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

        I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
        Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
        he may wish to undertake.

        I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
        or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
        matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
        a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
        on this matter further.

         I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
         is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
         fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

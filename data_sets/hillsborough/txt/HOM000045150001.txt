Date:       September 1997

To:       Lord Justice Stuart-Smith



 attach

                  the Alun Jones QC opinion o f 13 March 1997, with its accompanying Annexes
                  A to G (blue folders - your annotated copies);

                  the South Yorkshire police material which you have seen before (in the grey
                  ringbinders);

                  a letter which I have had from M r Wardrope, Accident & Emergency
                  consultant, and my draft reply ;

                  a fax we have had from Ann Williams, mother o f Kevin Williams (the boy
                  with throat fractures who is said to have sat up in Special Constable Debra
                  M artin’s arms at 4 p.m. - the theory is that it was the throat fractures which
                  killed him, slowly, rather than the crush on the terraces which did so quickly^
                  I don’t think Mrs Williams’s fax adds much to our knowledge o f how and why
                  Kevin died. But it tries to construct a case - as the recent submission from the
                  Family Support Group did - for there having been some kind o f conspiracy to
                  conceal the truth. Mrs Williams, from w hom we will hear more, asks you to
                   advise the Attorney-General to permit a new Inquest on Kevin);

                   a letter from|               | who was in pen 2 on the day - this is a decent
                   eye-witness account, but I would not have troubled you with it except that it
                   says that the tunnel under the W est Stand had gates - 1 can t recall a mention
                   o f these in Lord Taylor’s report (though they can be seen on the W est
                   Midlands police compilation video).

                                                     separately. But could you please let m j know
 I will reply to Mrs Williams and Mr
 whether you are content with my re

G43

DID YOU WITNESS ANY CROWD CRUSH?

 NO.

 G44

 WERE YOU INVOLVED IN ANY CROWD CRUSH,   IF SO, CAN YOU SAY WHAT TIME THIS

 HAPPENED?

 ONLY WHEN I WAS OUTSIDE BY THE TURNSTILES - TO AVOID IT WAS THE REASON I

 CLIMBED OVER THE WALL - THAT WAS ABOUT 2.20 PM (1420).

 NO.

 NO.


G17

 G49

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR IN THE DEATHS, OR THE

 INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 I THINK THE FACT THAT THERE WAS NO POLICE CONTROLLING THE CROWD OUTSIDE THE

 TURNSTILES & THE OPENING OF THE GATE WAS A FACTOR.

 4.30 PM <1630)

 G51

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A STEWARD, A

 LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 INSTRUCTIONS OVER THE LOUDSPEAKER SYSTEM.


G18

 G52

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO.

 G53

^      YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS   ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED? a ,                 JL              /

 THERE WAS A DISTINCT LACK OF CO-ORDINATION & NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE WHO KNEW         WHAT

 TO DO     - THERE WAS NO DIRECTION GIVEN   TO THE YOUNG BOBBIES - THE FIRE &

 AMBULANCE TOOK TOO LONG TO GET THERE.

 G54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THE POLICE WERE STOPPING THE COACHES & TAKING THE DRINK OFF & NOT FAR FROM THE

 GROUND THEY WERE STOPPING WALKING SUPPORTERS WITH CANS & NOT LETTING THEM GO

 FURTHER - BUT THE RIDICULOUS THING WAS - THEY WERE ALLOWING THEM      TODRINK       IT

 THERE IF THEY DID N ’T WANT TO GET RID OF IT.


G19

 G55

 DID NOT ATTEND THE MATCH LAST YEAR.

 G36

 THERE WAS OBVIOUSLY A LACK OF COMMUNICATIONS      BETWEEN THEPOLICE OUTSIDE     &

 THOSE INSIDE & THE KICK OFF SHOULD HAVE BEEN      DELAYED.

<3^|

 <333 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS

 1,    IT SEEMED VERY POORLY ORGANISED,        THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE p H   THE PITCH

 HAMPERING ACCESS OF A M B U L A N C E S .

 2 .     LACK 0 F DIRECT10N BY SEN10 R P0 LICE OFF”ICERB.

                                                               /
       LACK OF CONSTRUCTIVE USE OF THE PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM.            IF THE FOREST FANS

 0 b   BEEN MADE AWARE OF THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE SITUATION THEY WOULDN'T HAVE

 BAITED THE LIVERPOOL FANS..         AND HENCE THE LARGE NUMBER OF POLICE WHICH WERE

 USED IN A CORDON COULD HAVE BEEN USED TO HELP F#NS WHO REQUIRED FIRST AID,


Q19

 Q54 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WjftlCH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL    INQUIRY?

 1.,   LIVERPOOL WERE GIVEN THE SMALLER END l b       AVOID MI SING TWO SETS OF FANS

 PRIOR TO THE GAME.        WELL WE TOOK A WRONG /TURN AND WENT THROUGH THE ROUTE

 ALLOCATED TO THE FOREST FANS.           WE ENC0U HfT ERED NO TROUBLE WHICH TENDS TO SHOW

 THIS REASON AS NONSENSE REALLY.
                                                                                 page:   :
,*                                                           QSL359S

 IN ANY CASE WE TRAVELLED ON A SPECIAL BUS SET ASIDE FOR LIVERPOOL FANS FROM

 THE RAILWAY STATION AND WHEN WE GOT ON,       IT WAS HALF FULL OF FOREST F A N S „

 WHICH AGAIN SEEMS TO MAKE A MOCKERY OF THE SEGREGATION PLANS.

 IN FACT THE FORST FANS WOULD HAVE BEEN DROPPED Q j j t f AT THE LIVERPOOL END WHICH

 IF ANYTHING WAS WORSE IE ACTUALLY MIXING THEyfilO SETS OF FANS.

 THERE SEEMED NO CROWD CONTROL OUTSIDE TH E/ SR OU N D.

 THE GATES HAD TO BE OPENED REALLY ONCE ?HE SITUATION HAD DEVELOPED BUT A BIT

 OF FORSIGHT EVEN COMMON SENSE WOULD j ^ K E    IT OBVIOUS THAT SOME FORM OF CONTROL.

 WOULD HAVE TO BE SET UP AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE TUNNEi.

 LAST YEAR WHEN I ENTERED THAT ^Ai^T OF THE GROUND THERE WERE POLICE OFFICERS




 AND STEWARDS POSITIONING AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE TUNNEL AND THEY ACTUALLY

 STOPPED ME FROM GOING DOWN THE TUNNLE AMD DIRECTED ME ROUND TO THE SIDE.

 JUST AFTER ENTERING THE GROUND I TOLD A SGT HOW BAD IT WAS OUTSIDE THE

 TURNSTILES HE SAID IT WAS NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM AND GESTURED TOWARDS A

 SENIOR OFFICER SAYING THAT I SHOULD REPORT TO HIM IF I ’D GOT SOMETHING

 TO COMPLAIN ABOUT.

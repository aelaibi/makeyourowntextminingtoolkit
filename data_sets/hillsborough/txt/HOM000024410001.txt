            5.1. Proposal of the Study Group regarding safety

                  The Executive Comiuittee and the Committee of the Club Competitions have
                  dis.-M.cse-i  question of safety in stadia and have decided to set up a
                  otudy group.

                  After a lengthy discussion and on the basis of the attached FIFA
                  Resolution of July 26 1989 regarding safety, the Study Group at its
                  meeting on September 12 1989 in Vienna decided to submit the following
                  proposals to the Executive Committee:

                  1) As a new provision, all quarter final matches of the UEFA club
                     competitions vill also be considered as high-risk matches.

                  2) The qualifying matches for the European Championship final tournament
                     in 1996 have to be played in stadia vhich are fitted vith seats only
                     or, failing this, no standing tickets may be sold, .as is the case for
                     World Cup matches.                                 *

                  3) As from 1993, high-risk matches may be staged only in stadia fitted
                     exclusively vith seats. As far as the other matches are concerned, as
                     from the 1990/91 season only 80 X of the standing tickets may be sold,
                     this figure is to be reduced every season by 10 X until 1999. This
                     means that in the year 2000, football in Europe vill be vatched by an
                     all-seated public.

                  4) With regard to the FIFA Resolution concerning safety, the contents of
                     item A5 and item B3 shall be communicated to all national associations
                     i n xa circular.

                  5) Item B5 shall be incorporated inasmuch as the stadia of those clubs
                     participating at the European competitions have to be inspected every
                     three years. A copy of an appropriate certificate vill have to be sent
                     to the General Secretariat vith the entry form.

                  6) Item C2 vill be incorporated into the regulations of the UEFA club
                     competitions.

                  7) Item £3 already exists and is to be considered as imperative. Hovever,
                     FIFA should be asked to delete the vords "in principle" in order to
                     avoid any ambiguity.

                  8) The idea of the President of UEFA of introducing a permanent Fair Play
                     Committee can only be fully supported.


                  The Executive Committee is kindly requested to accept these proposals.

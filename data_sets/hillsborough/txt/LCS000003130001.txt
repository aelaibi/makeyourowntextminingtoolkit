Dear David
Following our discussion earlier this week I promised to find out                                               if
your application for assistance under the 'Bellwin scheme" had to                                               be
submitted in any particular format.   The answer is no.    It is up                                             to
you to submit a case to the Department putting in as much evidence                                              as
you think appropriate to substantiate your case for assistance.

I have also followed through your request for a contact in the Home
Office whose division has responsibility for civil emergencies.     His
name is               knd he is the Assistant Secretary in charge of F6
Division (.Emergency Planning) - telephone number 01-273-2577.

Please let me know if I can be of further help.

Yours sincerely

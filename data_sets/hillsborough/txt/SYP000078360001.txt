minutes.        At this   time    one of the P ol i ce m an said that anyone                  without         a

ticket would have         to get       off the    coach.

W he n we got back onto          the    road the traffic was end to tail                   all    the way

into She f f i e l d which was         not helped by the        road works          down the      centre

of the    road.

on route      cud we have any Police             escort    to the ground. Outside                 tne

ground there were         very few Police          outside     the ground.            ihere was a lot

of    people outside      the    turnstiles       but there was        no problems and we

entered    the ground through a turnstiles                 handing       our tickets         to the

steward.        As we went      through the turnst i les^tTe” two                children were

searched      by a P o l i c em a n but my h u sb an ^K an d    I were      not.Once       inside       the

our   seats     in the West Stand,         we only saw si;-; stewfcnsHT on the                staircase

who were      checking tickets.           The    children went        on to find the          seats

whilst my husband and            I went    to get a cup of            coffee and during           this

time we    only saw one         policeman and       in fact we        remarked on the            low

number    of Police O ff icers and O ff icials at               the ground bearing               in mind

the    number    of   people    that were       expected    to attend the match.

We went    up to our      seats and found the two              children we were sitting                  in

the    second    row from the front,            directly behind        the goal at the

we all went       up to the wall         and    looked over we        could see that we were

                 drop a penny from here                  in between          the    people.        The shoulders         of the

                 no mo r e ?         and people were        starting         to come        into   the stand waiting           for

                 stood up as we               realised s omething was wrong                     below,     I myself      saw the

                 first supporters               run onto       the    pitch,       the m atch was still            going    on,    a

                 Policeman            ran up to him an d knocked                him to the floor and e sc orted him

                 from the            pitch.

Whe n we        looked below         into    the       pens,        we    could see that       iA,was absolute

chaos,         people were        d e sp e ra te ly scaling               the    perime^ST    fence,     we were

all    shouting       in vain for the m atch to be stop<fJed. We were shocked to
                                *rT ~ 'P B jZ a M -
see    that       people on top of the fences wsj^e being pushed back by the

P olice      on the other          side.         As    pe a \u *e    ran out onto the          pitch they also

were    being       pushed back          by the Police.                   It was    obvious    that    the Police

did not u n derstand what was happening and did not know what                                            to do.

At about          -1.506 hrs     I saw a P o l ic e ma n            run onto       the    pitch and speak       to

the    referee who             inturn st opped the match,                        I was struck    by horror and

the    fact       that we were        helpless and              could do nothing             to help and just

had to stand and w atch an d by now comfort                                     those who had been lifted up

from    below.           The    people    in the front               row had bejs*rt pulling          people    up

for a while,

I could by now see a number                       of people Joying on the                   pitch some

obv i o u s l y a l r e a d y dead and many inoj/ s                  injured.        At this time a loud
   CAr ann o u n cI  TVr-WN/OV ,
speaker           e m en t requested irhat                          all Liverpool         s u pporters    should

clear     the      pitch       I could notyjrelieve what we heard.

By now many Police Officer s                      had     rushed over             from the other       side    of the

ground and where mixing w i th                        the fans on the              pitch helping       the

injured,           I saw Police Officers                  trying          to open the gates and           people

trying       to    rip down the fencing                 to get           people    out.

I w ou l d      like to say that            if    it had not been for the heoric acts                          that    I

saw by many supporters                   that many more w ould have died.

E v e n t u a l l y as    the terraces           cleared below              I could see the       bodies       of

psop1e 1yi ng in piles stacked against the inside of the perimeter

f e n ce s .

The sit u a t i o n       in the stand we were                  in was          now becoming    unbearable,          and

infact         I was     being    crushed because               of the          number of people       that had

been     pulled from below,                 I was starting                 to w orry for the safety of my

family and decided                it was     time to          leave,        and made      our way slowly out

             I felt that there was a total                lack of jXJnirnunication between the Police

 C   rr      inside    and outside        the   ground,    ancj/'they did not     realise    quick   enough

22 .   LOCAL OMBUDSMAN
       Raising of Level of Roadway
                 The Chief Executive reported on and submitted a report
       received from the Local Ombudsman on her investigation of a complaint
       alleging that the City Council had allowed or failed to prevent a
       roadway adjacent to the complainant's home being raised to a level equal
       to the top of the boundary wall of her home and that the complainant had
       not been given the opportunity to comment on the development before the
       Council gave permission. The ombudsman had concluded that the council's
       failure to request details of the proposed carriageway levels from the
       developer was maladministration, which had resulted in injustice to the
       complainant in that she lost the opportunity to object to the resulting
       loss of amenity.
       RESOLVED: That as suggested by the Local Ombudsman and as a fair remedy
       for the injustice caused in the case now reported, authority be given
       for the payment of compensation to the complainant in a sum representing
       50% of the loss of amenity caused by the development as assessed by the
       District Valuer and that the Chief Executive be requested to obtain the
       views of the District Valuer on the value of the loss of amenity to
       enable the level of compensation to be calculated.

       the city council in dealing with their application to purchase their
       dwelling. The Ombudsman had concluded that (a) the Council's failure to

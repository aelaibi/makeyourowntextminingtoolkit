            An     officer          f r o m our         serial       greeted        each      coach       and       t h e y w e r e all

At     1425       hours       we       were      further             deployed         to      the     junction             of C l a y w h e e l s

Lane     with Penistone                      Road North.

We     positioned             outside            a    public            house       named       The      Ga te,       and       our    duties

were     defined             as    supervising                    th e a r r i v i n g     fans       who were             walking         down

H a 1 if a k R o a d         towards            us.

We     were       instructed               to    form a            filter       lane       of      officers           and       to    inform

t he    supporters                t ha t     all      alcoholic               drinks       would         be    left        at    this

Io cat ion.

F'rom this          position               you       can see            a good       distance            up    this        Halifax         Road

and     as    far       as    the       ey e     could            see    I saw       t ha t     there         wa s    a    continuous

flow     of L i v e r p o o l           supporters                  in g r o u p s    a p p r o x . "10 a b r e a s t            on    both

sides        of    the       carriageway»

The     majority             of    these         were         males          in the       lower       a ge     bracket,              it wa s

very     apparent             to me          t h at      a    large          amount       of a l c o h o l       ha d      been       consumed

by     the    v as t     majority               of    these          men.

A    large        number          of    them were                 s ti l l    drinking          on    t h ei r       way    towards          the

ground        and a          large         number            of    them were          halted          and asked             to       leave

their        intoxicants                at      t hi s       location.              Some      of     them      left        their       drinks

others        insisted             on      consuming               t h e m at       this      location.

Generally           they          were       all      of      good       b e h a v i o u r , they were                drunk          but   not

incapable           or       disorderly.

from     me       and    the       other         officers               taking       up    t hi s     position             the       thing     that

became        most       apparent               to me         other          than    their         drunken           states          was   how

late     thousands                of    them         had      left       it    to    go    to      get     into       the       ground.

This     heavy          mass       of      persons            continued             without          any      significant              gaps

appearing           u n til        about         1 51 0       hou rs .

At     1453       hours       1 went            with         other      officers           to T h e        Gate      Public: H o u s e           as

a    result        of    a    report            of    fighting               inside.          The     premises             were       locked
                                                                                                                                      P Auh.

and     entry        was    found with             s om e      difficulty.

Upon     entering           I saw          that    it w a s         full        of    football           supporters             all

sporting         red a n d w h i t e             colours,           th e    atmosphere              wa s    hostile.             The

L a nd l o r d was         approached             and       the     persons           present        requested             to    leave

the     premises.

Our     serial        then       returned          to       its     static           point.         At     t h is    time       the

passage         of    fans       had       now    thinned           out     but       there        was     st ill     a    number          of

Liverpool            fans       s t il l    making          their        way     to     the     ground.

About      1310 as          a    result          of a       request         by P S       Sherratt           we      returned          into

this      public       house          and    there          assisted            in    clearing           the     premises.

About      15 1 5 we        were       able       to    resume           from        these      premises            and    upon       doing

s o , I w a s i n f o r m e d of             r a d i o m ess a g e s o f t r o u b 1 e i n s 3.d e t h a g r o u n d .

At     this    PC     Goss       returned          to       join     us a n d         informed           us all       to a t t e n d at,

t he    ground.

Our     serial        then       proceeded             to     the    ground           and     we    entered          via    the       large

gates      adjacent             to    turnstiles             77     to     78.

It w a s       there       that       I saw       two       ambulances               parked        in the        corner         c l os e       to

the     corner        of    the       S p i o n Kop.

There      were       two       persons          being       deposited               beside        these       ambulances             and       I

s aw    that     an a t t e m p t          was    being made               at    c h e st     massage,              I observed             that

t h i s f a x l e d X o r e v i ve           t h i s pe rso n .

We w e r e      then       directed          to    the        pathway            into     the      Spion       Kop     a n d it was

there      that       I was          approached             by a     number           of N o t t s . f o r e s t          supporters

w b o o f f e re d t b ear            s e r vices.

With     members           of    our       serial       I     then went with                these          volunteers           to     the

passageway            between          the       North        s t a n d a n d the         Spion Hop            and     it w a s        there

where      I sa w a n u m b e r             of    bodies          being         carried        up    t h at      passageway

towards        the     gymnasium             a r e a,       by s u p p o r t e r s       and also           police         officers.

At     th is    I went, w i t h            other       officers            onto       the     playing          area.        There          1

saw     bodies        of    dead       and       injured          laying         all     o v er     the     pitch.          Th e
                                                                                                                                            PAGE
                                                                                                                                            R449


majority         of     them were               b l ue     in the         f a ce     and were             dead.

There     were        loads        of       fans      running           about        the       pilch.

I then assisted                   as    best         as    I could           and made           a    large        number          of    carries

with     the     deceased              taking         them       up to         the       g y m area,            it go t      to      the     s t ag e

where     the        area was           so      littered           that        space          ran    out       and   there           was

nowhere         to    put     the       injured.

After     this        1 went           o ve r    to       the L e p p i n g s        Lane       en d      I saw       that        there       were

still     pi l e s      of    bodies            s t il l     trapped           behind          the       fencing        a r e a-        I was

unable      to       go a n d a s s i s t            them any           further           due       to    the     l a rg e      number

already         in a t t e n d a n c e .

  movement          of    the        ambulances             carrying         away       their        injured.

  None     of     these         so    called          fans      seemed       concerned with                  assisting         such

  m o v e m e n t , they         seemed             bent    on a b u s i n g      the    Police.

  After       a while           a Police             Inspector         ordered          me    into      his P o l i c e      van and

noticed a large no of           casualties both dead and alive laid on the

ground.      As we passed       one of these indicated that there were signs           of

life in someone presumed dead.            With F i r e m e n __________________ I treated

the indicated casualty with            oxygen and he was placed in the recovery

position,       the casualty soon came round.



               We then continued along the riverside lane under the South

stand onto the pitch checking casualties to see whether anyone was in

need of oxygen.           I also assisted an unconcious     young      female with a

asthmatic condition she was            being attended to by an         offduty nurse.

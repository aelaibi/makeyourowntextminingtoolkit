supporters         still      trying        to enter the ground.                I couLd see and hear a

P.A.    o p e rating      from      a police L a nd Rover,              requesting       the crowd to       stop

        T0:      CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT NESBIT                 DATE:            28 APRIL 1989

                SUBJECT:    F.A. SEMI-FINAL, 15 APRIL 1989


                  On Saturday, 15 April 1989, I commenced duty at Main Street Traffic
                  Garage, at 8.00 am in company with Inspector Scholey and Pc Leake,
                  using Rover saloon, Reg No E66 LAC.
                  After commencing patrol we attended at Woodall Police Post at 8.30 am
                  for a briefing of motorway personnel. I spoke to the officers prior
                  to the briefing concerning their conduct and attitude.
                  At about 8.45 am we travelled to the Driving School, arriving there
                  just after 9.00 am.      A further briefing took place there of
                  motorcyclists and the officers on static point duty. I again spoke
                  to the officers concerning their conduct and attitude. Inspector
                  Scholey then gave a detailed briefing as per the Operational Order,
                  assisted by Inspector Walker. The briefing finished about 9.50 am.
                  The officers on point duty then left in 5 Personnel Carriers followed
                  shortly afterwards by the Motorcycle Wing. Inspector Scholey spoke
                  to the officers on reserve duties and those on stand-by Personnel
                  Carrier duties. All officers were deployed by 10.10 am.
                  At about 10.25 am I commenced patrol in company with Inspector
                  Scholey and Pc Leake. Football traffic was immediately in evidence
                  from Upwell Street to Fir Vale. At Fir Vale we queried the signing
                  of the car route for Nottingham Forest.      We continued towards
                  Hillsborough via Herries Road, checking traffic points. We then
                  checked traffic points from the football ground to Grenoside,
                  speaking to all officers en route.
                  At about 11.20 am, we met Chief Superintendent Nesbit on Penistone
                  Road outside the football ground and briefed him re traffic arrange­
                  ments .
                  At approximately 11.45 am we travelled to the Ml(S) via Upwell
                  Street, Wincobank and Tinsley Viaduct. Travelling south to Woodall
                  we noticed heavy traffic on the northbound carriageway, there being
                  large amounts of Nottingham Forest supporters. At Wbodall we turned
                  north and came back to Junction 33 Catcliffe. From about 12.05 pm to
                  12.30 pin we assisted at Catcliffe regarding the implementation of a
                  traffic 'diversion via the Parkway.      Chief Inspector Lax, Chief
                  Inspector Shaw and Inspector Cawthorne were also seen at Catcliffe.
                  We were all satisfied at this stage that traffic was flowing well.
                  Chief Inspector Shaw stated that the new A616 Stocksbridge by-pass
                  was assisting traffic flow on that side of the ground enormously and
                  that traffic was well distributed between all routes. He added that
                  Junction 35 (the emergency diversion route) was available for use by
                  Notts Forest traffic as there were no problems on Liverpool routes.

                  At about 12.30 pm we left Catcliffe and travelled down the Parkway to
                  Prince of Wales Road where we left and went towards Darnall. At this
                  location Inspector Scholey spoke to Pc Zalad and asked him to do
                  point duty at Darnall lights owing to congestion. This was quickly

eliminated by. the officer and our vehicle continued to Brightside
Lane.

At Driving School Inspector Scholey checked on the situation re the
deployment of reserve officers (all had been deployed, mostly to the
City Centre). We then had a cup of tea and resumed patrol.

At about 1. 30 pa we returned to the motorway and travelled north to
Dodworth where we turned round and travelled south to Woodall
checking, signing on routes.    At this time we noticed that the
motorway was very quiet and was carrying little traffic, both north
and southbound. At Woodall we spoke briefly to Inspector Steele who
was cm Public Order detail. We then went back onto the northbound
carriageway and whilst travelling north, just prior to Tinsley, we
checked a coach full of Notts Forest supporters and advised them re
their conduct.

We continued north and left the motorway at Tankersley travelling
along the A61 towards Sheffield. The route was clear until we came
to Burncross where we turned off after seeing the tail end of
traffic. I would estimate the time as shortly after 2.00 pm, perhaps
five past.     We then went through Chapeltown, Ecclesfield and
Sheffield Lane Top and eventually returned to the A61, rejoining it
at Southey Green Road. The road at this point was now clear (2.20 pm
ish).

I was monitoring the radio messages concerning traffic movement. It
was clear by now that with the exception of the Neepsend area, all
traffic on routes to the ground had returned to their normal levels.
There were no reports of any delays whatsoever on the Liverpool
routes at this time.


We patrolled the area of the ground travelling along Penistone Road,
and eventually into Rutland Road. By the time we arrived in this
area (about 2.40 pm) traffic had also cleared from the Neepsend area,
I therefore passed a message to Operations Rocm stating that all
routes were now clear of traffic and asking that ground control be
informed of that fact.

Whilst we were in Rutland Road, Operations Rojsm requested a car,
equipped with P.A., to go to Leppings Lane and ask fans to step
pushing. At first there was no reply so after checking our car was
equipped with P.A., Inspector Scholey passed a radio message to the
effect that we would attend.    We then went to Leppings Lane end of
the ground. En route via Penistone Road, we remarked to each other
about the number of supporters still making their way on foot to the
ground and others still drinking outside public houses.
On turning into Leppings Lane we were confronted with heavy
pedestrian traffic, our driver, Pc Leake, drove slowly and gave a few
short horn warnings which seemed to incite resentment of our
presence.   I advised Pc Leake not to use the horn any more than
necessary and Pc Leake responded to this. We stopped outside the
Leppings Lane entrance where there were a large number of Liverpool
supporters still trying to enter the ground. I could see and hear a
P.A. operating from a police Land Rover, requesting the crowd to stop
pushing. Inspector Scholey spoke briefly with Pc Trcek and whilst he
was doing this I was watching the supporters.          There was an
atmosphere of resentfulness towards the presence of our vehicle and
many of the supporters appeared the worse for drink. It did not
appear we could be of any further assistance, I therefore instructed
Pq^f Leake to leave and turn left into Catchbar Lane. I did this
because our presence seemed detrimental to the situation.
We then travelled to Fir Vale via Penistone Road and Rutland Road
intending to return to the Driving School. At Fir Vale, Operations
Room began requesting the attendance of Dog Handlers at the ground.


As we entered Upwell Street, Operation Support was implimented. We
made haste to Driving School where I turned all the personnel out.
All Personnel Carriers were directed to the ground with Ps Lightfoot
escorting them with a Range Rover.

The Motorcycle Wing was sent to Claywheels Lane. After a short
liaison with Chief Inspector Wall, we also went to Claywheels Lane.
On arrival Pc Leake was instructed to act as conmunications vehicle
and keep a log.     Pc Somerset was deployed as reception officer.
Action therefore is recorded on logs (copies attached).

I feel the following comments are relevant

1. Traffic problems on the day were almost exclusively restricted to
   the Notts Forest routes, the one exception being a build up of
   traffic at the junction of the A616/A61 at about 1.00 pm, which
   was quickly alleviated by the introduction of a diversion via
   Oughtibridge.
2. The Nottingham Forest supporters had to travel by far the most
   difficult of the two routes, i.e. across the city. Despite this
   vehicular traffic arrived in the vicinity of the ground in
   sufficient time for supporters to get there before the kick-off.

3. The suggestion that Liverpool supporters arrived late at the
   ground owing to traffic delays in South Yorkshire is totally
   without foundation. I am absolutely certain that the Liverpool
   traffic routes were clear by 2.20 pm and the vast majority had
   arrived long before that time.

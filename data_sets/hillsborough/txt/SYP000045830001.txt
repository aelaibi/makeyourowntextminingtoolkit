             HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

              Thank you for your letter of 1 February 1990 acknowledging the proposed
              timetable for the submission of the final report on completion of the
              criminal investigation. I have sent copies to
              as well as the Police Complaints Authority.

              I also acknowledge receipt of your copy letter from Mr Patnick MP.
              Whilst I do not believe any useful purpose is likely to come from a
              meeting - we have had previous communications with this MP - I have
              arranged for one of my senior officers to see him in the very near
              future.

                                                                  (,)

       HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER
       Thank you for your letter of 25 January 1990, setting out the
       proposed timetable for the submission of the Final Report at
       the completion of the criminal investigation.

       I trust that you have sent a copy of this letter direct to
                                  I have no comment to make on the
       timetable and I have pencilled the p r o v e d meeting at 11.00am
       on 12th April into my diary.

       The Director has recently received a letter and report from
       Irvine Patnick MP.  I enclose copies for your attention.   I
       assume that you have already seen the report as it is said to
       have been put before Lord Justice Taylor's public enquiry.
       However, I should be grateful if you would give consideration
       to Mr Patnick's offer of providing further information.

       The Director is writing to Mr Dear personally, and formally
       providing him with copies of the correspondence.

SHEFFIELD HILLSBOROUGH   fISASTER.
I enclose a photo-copy of my report on the above disaster
which was sent to Lord Justice Taylor and to the then
Chief Constable of West Midlands Police.

I am concerned that some of the points raised in my report
have been raised by other sections of the Sheffield
community involved at the time of the disaster and I inquire
if it would be possible to place before you some of these
details?
I am aware that West Midlands Police have not yet completed
their inquiries, but purely place before you my offer.

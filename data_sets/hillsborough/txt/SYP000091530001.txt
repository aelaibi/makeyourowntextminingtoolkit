           I am a Police Constable       in the South Yorkshire Police stat ioned at

           Barns 1e y .



           At 1.00 pm (1300)      on Saturday            April    1989 (150489)   I commenced a

           tour of duty at Oakwell f^erotball Ground where I was assigned duties                        in

           relation to the Barnsley v Birmingham City football match.



           At approximately 3.10 pm (1510)             that same date as a result of/a

           message    received I went with other officers to Hi 1 lsboro>f^n Football
                                                               >
           Ground, Penistone Road, Sheffield in relation to a major incident

           which had occurred at the Liverpool                versus Nottingham Forest FA Cup

           Semi-Final      resulting   in a large number of fatalities.
                                                                         PAGE         2
                                                                         S3579

I Was    informed that the gymnasium which is situated at the rear of the

main stand was being usrd" as a temporary mortuary and my initial duty

was as part of a y a r d a ' n w hich prevented members of the crowd from

entering this/ are a.



Whilst engaged on this duty I saw Inspector T j / n q 1e , an officer with

whom I had served at a previous Division arfKl other officers carrying

filing    cabinets and other items of offi/ce furniture    into the gymnasium

via the small fire escape       door which is situated near   to the corner      of

the building and gives access to the area at the rear         of the stand.       I

also assisted in this task.       These   items were placed inside the

gymnasium a short way from this door.



I would describe the inside of the gymnasium as follows;

It was sub-divided into three equal sized areas due to the fact that

the nets used for cricket practice had been pulled across for

approximately 3/4    (three-quarters ) of the gymnasium width.       The first

area    (nearest to the door)   contained a large number of dead bodies

each of which had a separate number.        These bodies were    placed on the

floor in rows.



The centre area contained a number of Police Officers,          each of whom

had been assigned to deal       with a particular body.



The third area, which was       the one furthest away from the entrance used

by myself was    later used to identify the bodies and obtain statements

regarding the identification.       I am unable to state   if it was occupied

when I entered the gymnasium.



My duties    inside the qymnareium can be divided into three separate
                                                                                  PAGE     3
                                                                                  S3579

     phases and when each phase was completed the next phase was              commenced.

     I describe the phases as follows!             „



                 Catalogui ng       property found on and in the area of Leppings

     Lane terrace.     T>Ts duty consisted of listing the description of each

     piece of jj^rtspe rty in a register then placing the property into a

     numbered plastic bag for onward t rans po rtat ion to a property store.

     The bag number was also placed in the register



     2.          Cataloguing property and j/tljthing f ound with e a ch bo d y ,

     This duty cons isted of examinLrfg each b o d y , 1 ist ing the clothing on

     the body,   then sear chi ng>Cne body for jewellery,        cash and other

     property.    All theseyaetai Is together with the bg^iy number were

     entered in a property other than found r e q ^ t e r and the         "green copy'

     was left with each body.        More than jWfe register was used for this

     purpose due to the fact that tw                   of officers were   involved.

+0

                 I dent if i cat ipKi of bodies.   This duty consisted of the team

     with whom I was wording being approached by officers who requested a

     body by its number.        This officer was from the identification area

     where relatives examined the photograph board.             The body requested

     was then placed on an ambulance stretcher and,            together with the

     officer assigned for Co r o n e r ’s purposes,      taken to the area set aside

     for identification.        After identification the body was returned to the

     Mortuary area prior to being removed to the Medico Legal Centre by

     South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service.



     I am unable to state the number of bodies            I was involved with except

     to say that it was a large percentage.

         At-approximately 5.00 am (0500) on Sunday 16 April     1989 (160489)   I was

         released from the incident and returned to Barnsley Police Station

                                                            3 September 1990




Dear Sir

HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

I have this day received a letter from Dr Stefan L POPPER, H M Coroner for
South Yorkshire West District in which he sets out a number of objections
to the submission of my reports, the statements, and documentary evidence,
in respect of the complaints lodged against a number of your officers.

I am in urgent consultation with the Police Complaints Authority but it is
unlikely that process will be completed before 10 September 1990.   I will
be in contact with you again as soon as possible but for now, in view of
the Coroner’s objections, I shall not be forwarding the relevant papers to
you. As soon as the matter is resolved I shall be in touch by telephone.

I have written a similar letterto your Police Authority    in respect of the
complaints against Mr Walter JACKSON, your Assistant Chief Constable.

I hope you will agree with me      that there   is no need for the Coroner’s
objections to be made public at this stage.

Yours faithfully




Chief Constable
Investigating Officer

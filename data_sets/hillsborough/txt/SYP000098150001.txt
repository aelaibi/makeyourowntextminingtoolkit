                            FINAL SUBMISSION TO THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

                        ON BEHALF OF THE FOOTBALL SUPPORTERS ASSOCIATION

                                              RESUME

          Mr Jackson, Counsel for the Football Supporters Association, was,
          throughout Phase I of the Inquiry, an unpredictable advocate. To put this
          submission into some kind of context, Mr Jackson was not taken very
          seriously by the Bench or by fellow Counsel. Neither, it is suggested,
          should the more venomous sections of his jumbled submission be paid much
          regard.

          The submission, whilst not so arranged by Mr Jackson, falls into two
          sections : i) General comments and ii) Event of the day.

          i)   Generally.

               The unruly behaviour of some football supporters, including Liverpool
               supporters on 15th April 1989, is accepted. He attacks the
               'Conspiracy Theory' put forward by the Police as 'fanciful' yet,
               paradoxically, alleges that the South Yorkshire Police were aware
               of the presence of 'lots' of ticketless fans and took no positive
               steps.

               The Police, it is said, are pre-occupied with control not safety and
               yet, again somewhat paradoxically, Mr Jackson states that the Police
               failed in their duty to safely pack the pens (p.9).

               The closing statement in this section does have some credibility
               however :

               " .... when segregation and hooliganism are an issue, the (safe)


••
                packing of the terraces is considered. However, when safety alone
                is Ihe concern apparently no one considers the problem of ever.
                 .... distribution" (p9)

         i i ) Events of the Day :

               Leppings Lane turnstile area do not lend themselves to easy access ,
               however, the Police did not i) filter people or ii) take account of
               late arrivals.

               Insufficient attention paid, by all, to the people outside the ground
               at 3pm approached.  Consideration should have been given to delaying
               the kick-off.

               Queries why more was not done to accommodate those let in through
               Gate C.  "Why didn't Chief Superintendent Duckenfield cause the
               tunnel to be closed as a method of crowd control?" Jacksons
               submission is that the Commander 'froze'.

               It is suggested that the Police saw what was obviously overcrowding
               in central pens but found it acceptable 'for football fans'.
                                    - 2 -




         He alleges delayed reaction at perimeter fences - this caused
         resentment amongst his clients - but Jackson feels the delay arose
         from a 'genuine misunderstanding'.

         Somewhat ironically Mr Jackson, on behalf of his clients, passes his
         ’wholly inadequate1 thanks to the Policemen who gave of their best.




H




    There are, in addition to the subjective statements, two factual
    inaccuracies in this submission which will be communicated to Mr Woodward.

    a)   p.13 - It is alleged that the South Yorkshire Police had a statement
         from ex-Sergeant Higgins 'before the Inquiry started' which described
                                            .
         the blocking of the tunnel in 1 9 8 8

         This is untrue. The statement was obtained on 2nd June 1989, during
         the third week of the Inquiry.  It was retained to clear up an
         ambiguity. An additional statement was obtained on 8th July 1989
         (Higgins had been working away in Newcastle) and the two statements
         handed over to the West Midlands team.

    b)   p.14 - It is said to be ’unfortunate’ that PC Smith, a perimeter
         track officer, was absent at lunch until 2.50pm.

         Mr Jackson is ignoring the well established evidence that Smith was
         replaced by PC Helliwell during his refreshment break.

••
SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE FOOTBALL SUPPORTERS ASSOCIATION
 AT THE CONCLUSION OF PHASE 1 OF THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY
               AS TO THE CAUSE OF THE DISASTER


                           SUMMARY


The Disaster was wholly avoidable.


95 spectators died as a result of overcrowding in pens 3 and 4
of the Leppings Lane Terraces.


The overcrowding was caused by the failure of those responsible
to take sufficient care to ensure the safety of the crowd.
Spectators;were allowed to enter the central pens without any
mechanical monitoring of their numbers. They were allowed to
pack without any sufficient observations being made as to their
distribution and without any attempt being made to distribute
them evenly and safely.


The effect of the overcrowding was exacerbated both by the
layout of the barriers in pen 3 and the size of the perimeter
gates which became the only possible means of escape.


The apparent indifference of the police to the overcrowding was
caused by an over-emphasis both during their training and in
their matchday approach to the problem of crowd disorder.


Distress and injuries but “not necessarily fatalities, were
caused by the delay in appreciating that the problem was one of
overcrowding and not a pitch invasion.


The evidence revealed a number of deficiencies in both the long
and short term plans and preparation for staging events at
Hillsborough in general and the 1989 F.A. Cup Semi-Final in
particular.


The problems that arose out of the deficiencies were
foreseeable.   Further the build up of spectators outside the
Leppings Lane turnstiles was not only foreseeable but was
almost inevitable.



The allegations of misbehaviour made against spectators were
exaggerated.   Such misbehaviour as occurred was not causative
of the disaster, but undoubtedly contributed to the
difficulties of policing the Semi Final.


By April 15th’1989 the problem areas were already the subject
of a number of rules, regulations and guidelines.     More careful
consideration of such matters would have resulted in steps
being taken that would have averted the tragedy.



At the outset may I concede that repeatedly over at least the
 last 20 years a proportion of the people attending football
matches, and in some cases a sizeable proportion, has behaved
quite disgracefully. "Football Supporter" has become a term of
abuse.


After years of unsuccessful attempts to eradicate the problem
of hooliganism, by 1989 the policies of policing and
stewarding were almost invariably designed with restraint and
control uppermost in mind.   Perimeter and radial fences and
thus pens were amongst the weapons used in the continuing
conflict between the Authorities and the hooligans.
Important as the problem of hooliganism was and regrettably
still is, the emphasis upon it has contributed to there being
occasions when less than sufficient attention has been paid to
the safety aspects of crowd management.


Before I deal with the events which preceded the tragedy and
the Disaster itself, may I further concede that none of the
allegations made against some of the supporters are
inventions. People arriving late, drunk, without tickets and
anxious to get into the ground and prepared to invent all
kinds of excuses as to why they should be admitted and on
occasions stooping to improper methods to gain entry are
     nothing new.   Indeed, such matters are commonplace.    If the
     S.Y.P. were genuinely as surprised about such matters as their
     evidence would have us believe then their knowledge of
     football crowds and'thus their ability to police properly is
     severely limited.


CONSPIRACY THEORY


It may be appropriate at this point to deal with the only positive
explanation put forward by the police for their inability to
police the crowd.   Whilst accepting the presence of some ticketless
and drunken fans, I completely reject and indeed deplore the
S.Y.P.'s attempts to develop a "conspiracy theory" to explain the
sudden change in atmosphere of the fans at around 2.40 p.m.     Any
change in atmosphere was much more likely to be due to the fans'
complete lack of patience and faith in the police's ability to
handle the situation.    Delays escalated from 2.20 onwards and by
2.40 the crowd had simply had enough.


P.S. Morgan (Day 15 Page 123 at Page 130) describes people
remaining outside the gates after 3.00 p.m.     If there had been a
conspiracy amongst Liverpool fans to force an entry, those clearly
ticketless fans would have been inside the ground and not outside
resigned to missing the game.     Witnesses describe hundreds of fans
displaying their tickets as they walked calmly through Gate C.


In any event and whilst the "conspiracy theory" is rejected, I
would submit that, such a theory can be no excuse for the police's
failure to perform and can at best be described as an attempt by
the S.Y.P. to deflect criticism to other quarters and thereby save
face and avoid civil liability.     Inspector Calvert (Day 3 0 Page 7
at Pages 40) described the system adopted in 1987 for the Leeds -v-
Coventry City game, of how the police had their plans laid down for
the expected invasion of ticketless Leeds fans.     He described the
steps taken to keep ticketless fans away from the turnstile areas.
Several fans described similar steps being taken in 1988.
To support their theory, the S.Y.P. have produced a history of
alleged misbehaviour by Liverpool fans.     If information is so
crucial to the manner in which*the game should be policed, then
why did the police not arm themselves with it before hand?      I would
submit that the reality is that the police were aware of the
problem of ticketless fans but took no positive steps to deal with
it and, that in any event, the number of ticketless fans was
nothing like that which would support any "conspiracy theory"
whatsoever.


EVENTS OUTSIDE THE LEPPINGS LAKE TURNSTILES -


4.    In any event, the evidence as to the misbehaviour of the fans
outside the turnstiles will have to be carefully considered.       It
would appear that a number of each of the undesirable categories
mentioned above was present, and contributed to the difficulties
encountered by the police.   Nevertheless, when all the evidence is
considered and in particular:-


i.    The contents of the video;
ii.   The S.Y.P. composite album of photographs of the crowd
      outside;
iii. The evidence of P.S. Proctor, Day 16, Page 38, at Pages 39
      and 45.
      P.S. Morgan, Day 15, Page 123, at Day 16, Page 4.
      Mr Kay Day 25, Page 1 at Pages 2-7.
      Mr Garrett Day 4, Page 58 at Pages 59, 64 and 70.


The Inquiry may well come to the conclusion that in this particular
tragedy hooliganism was not a major factor but merely an
aggrevating difficulty for the police.      (No doubt in Phase 2 of
the Inquiry the question of hooliganism will be more relevant and
submissions will be made to the Inquiry by the Football Supporters
Association).
THE ATTITUDE OF THE POLICE


5.   The final general submission concerns the approach by the
police to the question of safety and comfort of the paying
customers who entered the Leppings Lane Terraces.     I emphasise only
once the true status, that is of paying customer, of those
described as either fans or supporters or perhaps dismissively as
"the crowd".   Clearly there is no question of mal-fides, but
perhaps because of their pre-occupation with control, there was a
total disregard of the possibility of overcrowding and consequent
crushing, until far too late.


6.   Regrettably I cannot make the same concession at to mal-fides
about the approach of the South Yorkshire Police to the Inquiry.
The evidence given by a number of Police Officers as to whether
or not they knew or should have known of the clear overcrowding of
pens 3 and 4 was at best less than satisfactory and at worst
intended to mislead.     Throughout the Inquiry the Police seemed
unable to make the slightest concession even when faced with
overwhelming evidence.     Time and again Counsel for the S.Y.P was
compelled to cross-examine on a basis clearly unsupported by the
evidence of the senior Police Officers called to give evidence.


CHOICE OF HILLSBOROUGH AS THE VENUE


7.   As all provincial stadia were designed originally for
non-segregated crowds and thereafter adapted for "home" and "away"
segregation with' large imbalances of numbers, there is always a
problem in seeking venues for F.A. Cup Semi Finals.


A matter complained of by many Liverpool supporters and by
Liverpool Football Club was the choice of Hillsborough as the
venue, because of the consequent allocation of the Leppings Lane
end with the lesser number of tickets to the better supported club.
Although Mr Kelly of the Football Association made a concession
that there was an element of unfairness in the choice, the choice
of venue and the allocation of ends was not in itself a
contributing factor.     There were, however, two unfortunate effects
                                 - 6 -


both foreseeable of allocating the Leppings Lane end to the better
supported club. Firstly more fans would arrive without tickets and
more fans with "Kop" tickets would appear at the Leppings Lane end
seeking entry.


The choice of Hillsborough as a Semi Final venue really only
becomes questionable when the configuration of the Leppings Lane
turnstiles and the allocation of turnstiles as a whole is taken
into account.    The rate at which the turnstiles were expected to
operate at various sections of the ground does not appear to have
been the subject of sufficient consideration by the organisers.


8.   In two respects the Football Association could properly be
criticised.     First the members of the Challenge Cup Committee were
not informed of all the facts surrounding the choice of
Hillsborough and in particular only Mr Kelly and Mr Wiseman were
made aware of Liverpool's representations.     Secondly, too much
importance was attached to Mr Evans' report on the 1988 Semi-final.
Clearly, there had been no in-depth investigation of Hillsborough
by Mr Evans, certainly insufficient to justify the report
outweighing all other considerations.


9.   The Inquiry has investigated in depth all the relevant matters
not only the events of the day but the history of Hillsborough.
Many areas of concern have been revealed but these submissions deal
principally with those aspects which more directly concern the
supporters.


10. In essence the main cause of the tragedy can be simply
expressed.    Ninety-five people were crushed and in an area which
was overcrowded.     People had been allowed to enter the central pens
without any mechanical monitoring of their number and allowed to
"pack" without any sufficient observations being made as to the
density and without any attempt being made to distribute them
evenly and safely.
HISTORY OF HILLSBOROUGH


11. The bcickground to the staging of matches is a catalogue of
errors and omissions which coupled with the deficiencies of
policing and stewarding on the day led to the deaths of 95 fans.


12. The possibility of uneven packing and consequent danger to
spectators should have been in the forefront of the organisers'
minds.


(a) Beginning in 1981 (see page 127 Inquiry bundle) the debriefing
of the police after the Semi-final mentions allegations of
overcrowing, the usual packing problems and the operation of safer
limits.


(b) The letter to the Chairman of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
(page 140 Inquiry bundle) 5th June 1981 states;


    "The Leppings Lane end is not constructed to give maximum aid
    to the packing and control of the crowd and the accepted crowd
    capacity is such that there is no safety margin".


(c) Thereafter there has been the introduction of radial fences
which created initially a central pen.    Subsequently further
alterations created the present layout of the terraces.    Finally a
barrier (144) was removed.


Clearly these changes should have been reflected in the safety
certificate but they were ignbred.    More importantly insufficient
consideration was given to the effect of all the changes on the
capacity of Lepping Lane Terrace as a whole or to the proper limits
of the separate areas.    Just how little attention has been paid to
such matters was reflected in misunderstandings during the Inquiry
as to appropriate limits.    Only when the H.S.E. reported was the
level of overcrowding finally revealed.
                               - 8 -


LICENSING AUTHORITY


13. There have been no amendments to the Safety Certificate since
it was originally issued in 1979 to take account of the structural
alterations that have occurred.


ADVISORY GROUP


A wholly unsatisfactory arrangement existed.     The
representative of the Sheffield City Council, Mr Bownes, considered
that it was appropriate for the "advisory committee" to discuss
certain matters, and for him at the conclusion to make
recommendations. The discussions concerning the removal of barrier
144 ended with Inspector Calvert's views outweighing the
reservations of Mr Strange.   In the event, Mr Bownes made the
decision on this very important issue.     I would submit that careful
consideration should be given by the Inquiry to recommending
greater control at a higher level by Licensing Authorities,
although the members of the advisory committee are wholly
professional, they represent particular standpoints    and thus it is
important that the final decision should be made by    someone with a
sufficient knowledge, expertise and experience to balance all
factors.


The position was that by April 1989 the Local Authority in the
shape of Mr Bownes was unaware of the possible effect of the radial
fences or safe capacities or that the question had been raised and
not dealt with on a number of occasions.


RESPONSIBILITY FOR POLICING S STEWARDING THE TERRACES


14. As the Inquiry px'ogressed and the Senior Police   Officers
gave their evidence and Counsel for the police cross-examined, one
could have been forgiven for concluding that there was an element
of misunderstanding between the police and the club as to whose
responsibility it was to monitor the distribution of the fans.
However, after consideration of all the evidence and particularly
that of Mr Lock (Day 31 Page 45) and that of Mr Calvert (Day 30
Page 7) the matter would seem to have been settled.    The Police
failed in their duty and lamentably tried to blame others.     As Dr.
Eastwood said (Day 26 Page 75) the Leppings Lane Terraces were
perfectly safe if the packing was properly controlled.


15. However, by April 15th 1989 the astonishing position was that
the supporters were left "to find their own level".    No submission
of mine can condemn sufficiently this appallingly dangerous
practice nor what I can only describe as the disgraceful and
pathetic attempts by some witnesses to justify the policy.     Despite
having to concede that one of the methods of re-distribution was
for supporters to climb over fences, the S.Y.P. still failed to
make any concession at all as to the inadequacy of the method of
distribution.


LEPPINGS LANE TURNSTILE AREA


16. During 1985/6 there had been various discussions and plans
prepared with a view to re-organising the turnstiles at the
Leppings Lane end of the ground.   The Plans were prepared with
segregation in mind and when they were abandoned apparently
interest in the loading of the individual pens was also abandoned.


17. On semi-final day oniy turnstiles A-G were in use for both
the West and North West *■
                         Terraces. Even if no account is taken of
the creation of pens 3 and '4 by the construction of the radial
fences, the Safety Certificate could not be complied with as there
was no way of monitoring the numbers in the North West Terrace.     In
itself not a vitally important matter, but very important as an
indication that the distribution of the fans was hardly considered.
Exactly the same conclusion is arrived at when one considers the
Operational Orders for Semi-Finals, which differ from the orders
for League Matches.   Quite clearly when segregation and hooliganism
are considered the packing of the terraces, is also considered.
However, when safety alone is the concern apparently no one
considers the problem of even and safe distribution.
EVENTS OF APRIL 15TH 1989


The history of Hillsborough has resulted in a configuration at
the Leppings Lane turnstiles which can only be described as
unsatisfactory.   The most cursory consideration of the
configuration and the turnstile allocation would have revealed the
danger of problems arising outside the grounds. The police
apparently ignored the lesson of the 1923 Cup Final.      However, the
evidence of Mr Walker (Day 24 Page 128) about 1988 and Mr Morath
(Day 28 Page 99 at Page 100 ) about 1987 seems to show that a
filtering system useful at all grounds but essential at the
Leppings Lane end of Hillsborough had been used but the police
previously but for some reason was abandoned in 1989.


19. The organisers claimed to have grounds for expecting the fans
to arrive early and at a steady rate.   How exactly they came to
that conclusion was never satisfactorily explained.     All the other
warning signs were ignored.   There was a half hearted attempt to
encourage people to arrive early, not assisted by the information
on the tickets, but surely the authorities should have realised
that standing on the terraces for longer than is necessary is less
attractive then sitting on the park wall with a can of lager.


20. Almost everyone connected with football knows that virtually
every attempt to encourage people to arrive early-has failed.
Despite the events of 1981, of 1987, the knowledge that Sheffield
fans themselves were starting to arrive later, apparently because
                *
there were no problems in 1988 no contingency plans were made.


21. There was clearly insufficient consideration of the Green Guide
at paragraph 46 which deals with contingency plans, paragraph 47
which deals with turnstile flows and the ACPO Guide to Policing of
Football Matches, Entry to Grounds at paragraph 1.40 to 1.45.


22. Despite the number of officers from serials 14-15-16-17 who
were assigned to perform the duty by the Operational Order no
attempt was made to organise orderly queueing.   The disappearance
of Sergeant Payne and a number of serial 16 was not properly
explained by the length of time allegedly taken to process a
prisoner, nor has the whereabouts of Inspector White been revealed
to the Inquiry.   The absence of Sergeant Morgan was unfortunate and
the nett result was the absence of an effective police presence at
the turnstile area.


23. Many spectators gave evidence of the abnormally slow rate of
admission, no doubt caused by a combination of factors, which
included in addition to those set out above, the searching of fans
and on some occasions searching fans twice, the crushing itself,
people without tickets, people with tickets for different
turnstiles to the one through which they were seeking entry.     No
doubt the insufficient and misleading signs-outside the grounds
did not assist. The evidence was of a lack of police presence at
around 2.20 and attempts to inform the police of the situation met
with a cool response.


Perhaps the evidence of Inspector Hand-Davies (Day 13 Page 22
at Pages 29,31,48-49) and his attitude when giving evidence best
illustrates the unfortunate relationship between a few of the
police officers and a number of the supporters.


DELAYING THE KICK-OFF


24. The result was that by the latest 2.40 consideration should
have been given to delaying the kick-off.   If the situation was so
grave as to necessitate Superintendent Marshall seeking permission
to open the gates then clearly the kick-off should have been
delayed.   It would appear that the decision not to delay was made
bearing in mind every aspect of the problem other than safety.        A
wholly improper approach was taken and a suspicion arose that the
fans were in some way being punished for arriving at a time which
the senior police officers considered "late".     There are many very
goods reasons why kick-offs should not be delayed, but safety
factors should outweigh all other considerations.
EVENTS INSIDE THE STADIUM


25. In addition to the intelligence from outside the ground,
the computer, the CCTV and visual observation of the crowds inside
of the ground should have led to an early realisation that the
crowd would not be in the ground by 3.00 p.m.     There are many
unfortunate direct conflicts of evidence about these matters, most
notably between Mr Kirton and Mr Mackrell.     Whatever the Inquiry's
finding about the conflicts it is quite clear that insufficient
attention was paid to the possible effect of many people being
outside the ground and anxious to enter by kick-off.


26. There is little reason to dwell on the arrangements inside the
turnstile area.     All the evidence points to a total disregard of
the necessity of sufficient directional signs.     In the event,
coupled with the insufficient and misleading directions on the
tickets, these were important matters.    The evidence of a number of
fans was to the effect that they believed the tunnel to be only
means of entry to the terraces.     Not surprisingly, therefore, when
gate C was opened the resultant flow was down the tunnel towards
the already overcrowded central pens.


POLICE CONTROL ROOM


27. The actions and reactions of these in the control room between
the first request from Superintendent Marshall and the visit by
Messrs Kelly and Kirton are difficult to explain.     Suffice it to
say that apparently between the time of Mr Marshall's first request
and final demand Chief Superintendent Duckenfield apparently froze.
Despite being encouraged by his Officers to make decisions none
were forthcoming.     In the 6-7 minutes immediately prior to all
gates being opened there was a total failure of the police to
consider the effects of so doing.     It is quite clear from the
evidence - Dr. Eastwood, Mr Eccleston and Mr Lord and others - that
closing the tunnel has been an effective method of crowd
distribution but apparently it was not even considered.     Indeed for
many weeks of the Inquiry attempts were made to suggest that such
a method has never been used; and was inappropriate and even
impractical (the Inquiry was never shown the statement of former
Sergeant Higgins which apparently described the blocking of the
tunnel in 1988 and was in the possession of the S.Y.P before the
Inquiry started). No attempt was made to inform the club or indeed
Superintendent Greenwood of the intention to open the gates.
Whether it was the recent promotion of Chief Superintendent
Duckenfield and his consequent lack of experience which alone
caused the problem is a matter perhaps for the Inquiry.     What is
absolutely clear is that the performance of those in the control
room was less than satisfactory.


28. A matter of grave concern to the supporters was the behaviour
of Chief Superintendent Duckenfield     when Mr Kelly visited the
control box.   A full if somewhat belated apology for what happened
is not sufficient.   It would clearly have been sensible for Mr
Duckenfield to make no comment as to the cause of the tragedy,
indeed that would have been the appropriate action. To allow and
deliberately allow Mr Kelly to leave the room with the
understanding that the fans were responsible for forcing open the
gates was a deliberate attempt to avoid the criticism that he
expected for opening the gates.     The misleading of Assistant Chief
Constable Jackson will no doubt be considered elsewhere.


EVENTS INSIDE THE STADIUM


29. By 2.45 p.m. despite there being a very substantial number
of Liverpool supporters outside the ground, pens 3-4 were full.       It
is perhaps indicative of the attitude of the police as to what was
acceptable in terms of packing that despite there being
overwhelming evidence of overcrowding and discomfort, no one in
authority seemed to notice.   The compelling and disturbing evidence
of Mr Hicks (Day 4 Page at Page 12 ) will have to be carefully
considered. It accepted, his evidence reveals the most blatant and
total disregard for the spectators.     It is difficult to accept that
despite the position of the police control box, despite the
presence of officers and stewards on the perimeter track, no one
noticed the obvious overcrowding.     Perhaps the true explanation is
that the police did see what to others is obviously
overcrowding, but at the time considered it acceptable.       The
absence at lunch of PC Smith was another unfortunate and avoidable
coincidence.     The evidence of the level acceptable to the police
and hitherto tolerated by the fans was disturbing.       Apparently
little short of screams for help or actual casualties would have
caused action to be taken.     Indeed at 3.00 there is evidence that
such screams failed to bring a response.


POSSIBLE DELAY


3 0.. Many hours of evidence were heard on this subject, but perhaps
consideration could be given to three particular pieces of evidence
that support the submission that by the latest 2.55/2.56 should
have been realised that there was a serious overcrowding problem.


(a) Inspector McRobbie (Day 20 Page 12 at Pages 13, 18-19)


    From a position in the control room he noticed that
    supporters were being let out onto the track,       that action was
   presumably taken by an officer who by that stage had noticed
   overcrowding. Inspector McRobbie left the control box and went
   to the track. Video evidence shows him by the track at 2.59.
   Thus the observation of the overcrowding by the officer on the
   track must have been at the latest      2.55/2.56.


(b) Mr Towler (Day 19, Page 86 at Page     87) r
                r

   Mr Towler describes being summoned      to Gate 4 by a colleague
   some 5 minutes before kick-off and      then describes people being
   crushed against the perimeter fence.


(c) P.C. Illingworth (Day 17 Page 130 at Pages 133-5)


   P.C. Hooson (Day 29 Page 14 at Pages 17-19)


   It would appear that PC Illingworth arrived first at Gate 4 and
   opened the gate at a time when people were able to spill out.
    He then moved to Gate 5 intending to assist people to transfer
    to a less crowded area.    Gate 4 must then have been closed
    because when it was opened by PC Hooson he remained at the
    gate for some time.


    Photograph 212 from the Liverpool Echo shows that at, 2.59 gates
    3,4, and 5 were all open and according to PC Hooson his arrival
    at the track was before 2.59.


31. There was evidence that not all the police officers realised as
quickly as they might have done what was happening.    As a result
some spectators trying to escape were returned to the pens and the
gates closed on more than one occasion.     Such actions caused
feelings of resentment but were clearly caused by a genuine
misunderstanding of the situation.


32. Overall there was an unacceptable     delay probably arising in
fact from the training of the police which concentrated on the
control aspect of crowd management (P.C. Bichard Day 19 Page 39 at
Page 52).


33. The adequacy or otherwise of the emergency plans and
possible improvements will no doubt be the subject of submission
from others. Nevertheless the F.S.A. wish sincerely but wholly
inadequately to thank all the individual policemen, fireman,
ambulancemen and volunteers'“Who heroically gave of their best.


PERIMETER FENCESr


34. Although submissions as to possible recommendations are to be
made by the FSA in Phase 2, immediate action must be taken about
perimeter fences.   Any consideration of the problems of crowd
management reveals the difficulty of balancing the approach needed
to both detect control and eradicate disorder and to ensure safety.


The primary function of a perimeter fence is to prevent
encroachment onto the pitch.   The nature of the Hillsborough fences
was such that the pens became traps.    Clearly such fences must be
                                 - 16 -


immediately removed.    Although bolt cutters on site may sound
initially attractive and can do no harm, as was said by the Fire
Brigade, if you need bolt cutters, you have got the wrong type of
fence.


35. With some reservations the F.S.A. accept that perimeter fences
are necessary for crowd control.      Clearly the Inquiry will have to
assess the expert evidence available and thereafter make
recommendations which balance t h e t w o   conflicting aspects.
SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE FOOTBALL SUPPORTERS ASSOCIATION

 AT THE CONCLUSION OF PHASE 1 OF THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

              AS TO THE CAUSE OF THE DISASTER
SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE FOOTBALL SUPPORTERS ASSOCIATTON
 AT THE CONCLUSION OF PHASE 1 OF THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY
               AS TO THE CAUSE OF THE DISASTER


                           SUMMARY


The Disaster was wholly avoidable.


95 spectators died as a result of overcrowding in pens 3 and 4
of the Leppings Lane Terraces.


The overcrowding was caused by the failure of those responsible
to take sufficient care to ensure the safety of the crowd.
Spectators were allowed to enter the central pens without any
mechanical monitoring of their numbers. They were allowed to
pack without any sufficient observations being made as to their
distribution and without any attempt being made to distribute
them evenly and safely.


The effect of the overcrowding was exacerbated both by the
layout of the barriers in pen 3 and the size of the perimeter
gates which became the only possible means of escape.


The apparent indifference of the police to the overcrowding was
caused by an over-emphasis both during their training and in
their matchday approach to the problem of crowd disorder.


Distress and injuries but not necessarily fatalities, were
caused by the delay in appreciating that the problem was one of
overcrowding and not a pitch invasion.


The evidence revealed a number of deficiencies in both the long
and short term plans and preparation for staging events at
Hillsborough in general and the 1989 F.A. Cup Semi-Final in
particular.


The problems that arose out of the deficiencies were
foreseeable.   Further the build up of spectators outside the
Leppings Lane turnstiles was not only foreseeable but was
                                - 2 -


     almost inevitable.



     The allegations of misbehaviour made against spectators were
     exaggerated.   Such misbehaviour as occurred was not causative
     of the disaster, but und'oubtedly contributed to the
     difficulties of policing the Semi Final.


10 . By April 15th 1989 the problem areas were already the subject
     of a number of rules, regulations and guidelines.      More careful
     consideration of such matters would have resulted in steps
     being taken that would have averted the tragedy.



1.   At the outset may I concede that repeatedly over at least the
      last 20 years a proportion of the people attending football
     matches, and in some cases a sizeable proportion, has behaved
      quite disgracefully. "Football Supporter" has become a term of
     abuse.


2.   After years of unsuccessful attempts to eradicate the problem
      of hooliganism, by 1989 the policies of policing and
     stewarding were almost invariably designed with restraint and
      control uppermost in mind.   Perimeter and radial fences and
      thus pens were amongst the weapons used in the continuing
      conflict between the Authorities and the hooligans.
      Important as the problem of hooliganism was and regrettably
     still is, the emphasis upon it has contributed to there being
      occasions when less than sufficient attention has been paid to
     the safety aspects of crowd management.


     Before I deal with the events which preceded the tragedy and
     the Disaster itself, may I further concede that none of the
     allegations made against some of the supporters are
      inventions. People arriving late, drunk, without tickets and
     anxious to get into the ground and prepared to invent all
     kinds of excuses as to why they should be admitted and on
      occasions stooping to improper methods to gain entry are
     nothing new.   Indeed, such matters are commonplace.    If the
     S.Y.P. were genuinely as surprised about such matters as their
     evidence would have us believe then their knowledge of
     football crowds and thus their ability to police properly is
     severely limited.


CONSPIRACY THEORY


It may be appropriate at this point to deal with the only positive
explanation put forward by the police for their inability to
police the crowd.   Whilst accepting the presence of some ticketless
and drunken fans, I completely reject and indeed deplore the
S.Y.P.'s attempts to develop a "conspiracy theory” to explain the
sudden change in atmosphere of the fans at around 2.40 p.m.     Any
change in atmosphere was much more likely to be due to the fans'
complete lack of patience and faith in the police's ability to
handle the situation.    Delays escalated from 2.20 onwards and by
2.40 the crowd had simply had enough.


P.S. Morgan (Day 15 Page 123 at Page 130) describes people
remaining outside the gates after 3.00 p.m.     If there had been a
conspiracy amongst Liverpool fans to force an entry, those clearly
ticketless fans would have been inside the ground and not outside
resigned to missing the game.     Witnesses describe hundreds of fans
displaying their tickets as they walked calmly through Gate C.


In any event and whilst the "conspiracy theory" is rejected, I
would submit that such a theory can be no excuse for the police's
failure to perform and can at best be described as an attempt by
the S.Y.P. to deflect criticism to other quarters and thereby save
face and avoid civil liability.     Inspector Calvert (Day 30 Page 7
at Pages 4 0) described the system adopted in 1987 for the Leeds -v-
Coventry City game, of how the police had their plans laid down for
the expected invasion of ticketless Leeds fans.     He described the
steps taken to keep ticketless fans away from the turnstile areas.
Several fans described similar steps being taken in 1988.
To support their theory, the S.Y.P. have produced a history of
alleged misbehaviour by Liverpool fans.      If information is so
crucial to the manner in which the game should be policed, then
why did the police not arm themselves with it before hand?      I would
submit that the reality is that the police were aware of the
problem of ticketless fans but took no positive steps to deal with
it and, that in any event, the number of ticketless fans was
nothing like that which would support any "conspiracy theory"
whatsoever.


EVENTS OUTSIDE THE LEPPINGS LAME TURNSTILES -


4.    In any event, the evidence as to the misbehaviour of the fans
outside the turnstiles will have to be carefully considered.        It
would appear that a number of each of the undesirable categories
mentioned above was present, and contributed to the difficulties
encountered by the police.   Nevertheless, when all the evidence is
considered and in particular:-


i.    The contents of the video;
ii.   The S.Y.P. composite album of photographs of the crowd
      outside;
iii. The evidence of P.S. Proctor, Day 16, Page 38, at Pages 39
      and 45.
      P.S. Morgan, Day 15, Page 123, at Day 16, Page 4.
      Mr Kay Day 25, Page 1 at Pages 2-7.
      Mr Garrett Day 4, Page 58 at Pages 59, 64 and 70.


The Inquiry may well come to the conclusion that in this particular
tragedy hooliganism was not a major factor but merely an
aggrevating difficulty for the police.      (No doubt in Phase 2 of
the Inquiry the question of hooliganism will be more relevant and
submissions will be made to the Inquiry by the Football Supporters
Association).
THE ATTITUDE OF THE POLICE


5.   The final general submission concerns the approach by the
police to the question of safety and comfort of the paying
customers who entered the Leppings Lane Terraces.     I emphasise only
once the true status, that is of paying customer, of those
described as either fans or supporters or perhaps dismissively as
"the crowd".   Clearly there is no question of mal-fides, but
perhaps because of their pre-occupation with control, there was a
total disregard of the possibility of overcrowding and consequent
crushing, until far too late.


6.   Regrettably I cannot make the same concession.at to mal-fides
about the approach of the South Yorkshire Police to the Inquiry.
The evidence given by a number of Police Officers as to whether
or not they knew or should have known of the clear overcrowding of
pens 3 and 4 was at best less than satisfactory and at worst
intended to mislead.     Throughout the Inquiry the Police seemed
unable to make the slightest concession even when faced with
overwhelming evidence.     Time and again Counsel for the S.Y.P was
compelled to cross-examine on a basis clearly unsupported by the
evidence of the senior Police Officers called to give evidence.


CHOICE OF HILLSBOROUGH AS THE VENUE


7.   As all provincial stadia were designed originally for
non-segregated crowds and thereafter adapted for "home" and "away"
segregation with large imbalances of numbers, there is always a
problem in seeking venues for F.A. Cup Semi Finals.


A matter complained of by many Liverpool supporters and by
Liverpool Football Club was the choice of Hillsborough as the
venue, because of the consequent allocation of the Leppings Lane
end with the lesser number of tickets to the better supported club.
Although Mr Kelly of the Football Association made a concession
that'there was an element of unfairness in the choice, the choice
of venue and the allocation of ends was not in itself a
contributing factor.     There were, however, two unfortunate effects
both foreseeable of allocating the Leppings Lane end to the better
supported club. Firstly more fans would arrive without tickets and
more fans with "Kop" tickets would appear at the Leppings Lane end
seeking entry.


The choice of Hillsborough as a Semi Final venue really only
becomes questionable when the configuration of the Leppings Lane
turnstiles and the allocation of turnstiles as a whole is taken
into account.    The rate at which the turnstiles were expected to
operate at various sections of the ground does not appear to have
been the subject of sufficient consideration by the organisers.


8.   In two respects the Football Association could properly be
criticised.     First the members of the Challenge Cup Committee were
not informed of all the facts surrounding the choice of
Hillsborough and in particular only Mr Kelly and Mr Wiseman were
made aware of Liverpool's representations.     Secondly, t‘oo much
importance was attached to Mr Evans' report on the 1988 Semi-final.
Clearly, there had been no in-depth investigation of Hillsborough
by Mr Evans, certainly insufficient to justify the report
outweighing all other considerations.


9.   The Inquiry has investigated in depth all the relevant matters
not only the events of the day but the history of Hillsborough.
Many areas of concern have been revealed but these submissions deal
principally with those aspects which more directly concern the
supporters.


10. In essence the main cause of the tragedy can be simply
expressed.    Ninety-five people were crushed and in an area which
was overcrowded.     People had been allowed to enter the central pens
without any mechanical monitoring of their number and allowed to
"pack" without any sufficient observations being made as to the
density and without any attempt being made to distribute them
evenly and safely.
HISTORY OF HILLSBOROUGH


11. The background to the staging of matches is a catalogue of
errors and omissions which coupled with the deficiencies of
policing and stewarding on the day led to the deaths of 95 fans.


12. The possibility of uneven packing and consequent danger to
spectators should have been in the forefront of the organisers'
minds.


(a) Beginning in 1981 (see page 127 Inquiry bundle) the debriefing
of the police after the Semi-final mentions allegations of
overcrowing, the usual packing problems and the operation of safer
limits.


(b) The letter to the Chairman of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
(page 140 Inquiry bundle) 5th June 1981 states;


    "The Leppings Lane end is not constructed to give maximum aid
    to the packing and control of the crowd and the accepted crowd
    capacity is such that there is no safety margin".


(c) Thereafter there has been the introduction of radial fences
which created initially a central pen.    Subsequently further
alterations created the present layout of the terraces.    Finally a
barrier (144) was removed.


Clearly these changes should have been reflected in the safety
certificate but they were ignored.   More importantly insufficient
consideration was given to the effect of all the changes on the
capacity of Lepping Lane Terrace as a whole or to the proper limits
of the separate areas.    Just how little attention has been paid to
such matters was reflected in misunderstandings during the Inquiry
as to appropriate limits.    Only when the H.S.E. reported was the
level of overcrowding finally revealed.
LICENSING AUTHORITY


13. There have been no amendments to the Safety Certificate since
it was originally issued in 1979 to take account of the structural
alterations that have occurred.


ADVISORY GROUP


A wholly unsatisfactory arrangement existed.     The
representative of the Sheffield City Council, Mr Bownes, considered
that it was appropriate for the "advisory committee" to discuss
certain matters, and for him at the conclusion to make
recommendations. The discussions concerning the removal of barrier
144 ended with Inspector Calvert's views outweighing the
reservations of Mr Strange.   In the event, Mr Bownes made the
decision on this very important issue.     I would submit that careful
consideration should be given by the Inquiry to recommending
greater control at a higher level by Licensing Authorities,
although the members of the advisory committee are wholly
professional, they represent particular standpoints and thus itis
important that the final decision should be made by someone with a
sufficient knowledge, expertise and experience to balance all
factors.


The position was that by April 1989 the Local Authority in the
shape of Mr Bownes was unaware of the possible effect of the radial
fences or safe capacities or that the question had been raised and
not dealt with on a number of occasions.


RESPONSIBILITY FOR POLICING & STEWARDING THE TERRACES


14. As the Inquiry progressed and the Senior Police Officers
gave their evidence and Counsel for the police cross-examined, one
could have been forgiven for concluding that there was an element
of misunderstanding between the police and the club as to whose
responsibility it was to monitor the distribution of the fans.
However, after consideration of all the evidence and particularly
that of Mr Lock (Day 31 Page 45) and that of Mr Calvert (Day 3 0
Page 7) the matter would seem to have been settled.    The Police
failed in their duty and lamentably tried to blame others.     As Dr.
Eastwood said (Day 26 Page 75) the Leppings Lane Terraces were
perfectly safe if the packing was properly controlled.


15. However, by April 15th 1989 the astonishing position was that
the supporters were left "to find their own level".    No submission
of mine can condemn sufficiently this appallingly dangerous
practice nor what I can only describe as the disgraceful and
pathetic attempts by some witnesses to justify the policy.     Despite
having to concede that one of the methods of re-distribution was
for supporters to climb over fences, the S.Y.P. still failed to
make any concession at all as to the inadequacy of the method of
distribution.


LEPPINGS LANE TURNSTILE AREA


16. During 1985/6 there had been various discussions and plans
prepared with a view to re-organising the turnstiles at the
Leppings Lane end of the ground.    The Plans were prepared with
segregation in mind and when they were abandoned apparently
interest in the loading of the individual pens was also abandoned.


17. On semi-final day only turnstiles A-G were in use for both
the West and North West Terraces.   -Even if no account is taken of
the creation of pens 3 and 4 by the construction of the radial
fences, the Safety Certificate could not be complied with as there
was no way of monitoring the numbers in the North West Terrace.       In
itself not a vitally important matter, but very important as an
indication that the distribution of the fans was hardly considered.
Exactly the same conclusion is arrived at when one considers the
Operational Orders for Semi-Finals, which differ from the orders
for League Matches.   Quite clearly when segregation and hooliganism
are considered the packing of the terraces is also considered.
However, when safety alone is the concern apparently no one
considers the problem of even and safe distribution.
EVENTS OF APRIL 15TH 1989


The history of Hillsborough has resulted in a configuration at
the Leppings Lane turnstiles which can only be described as
unsatisfactory.   The most cursory consideration of the
configuration and the turnstile allocation would have revealed the
danger of problems arising outside the grounds. The police
apparently ignored the lesson of the 1923 Cup Final.      However, the
evidence of Mr Walker (Day 24 Page 128) about 1988 and Mr Morath
(Day 28 Page 99 at Page 100 ) about 1987 seems to show that a
filtering system useful at all grounds but essential at the
Leppings Lane end of Hillsborough had been used but the police
previously but for some reason was abandoned in 1989.


19. The organisers claimed to have grounds for expecting the fans
to arrive early and at a steady rate.   How exactly they came to
that conclusion was never satisfactorily explained.     All the other
warning signs were ignored.   There was a half hearted attempt to
encourage people to arrive early, not assisted by the information
on the tickets, but surely the authorities should have realised
that standing on the terraces for longer than is necessary is less
attractive then sitting on the park wall with a can of lager.


20. Almost everyone connected with football knows that virtually
every attempt to encourage people to arrive early has failed.
Despite the events of 1981, of 1987, the knowledge that Sheffield
fans themselves were starting to arrive later, apparently because
there were no problems in 1988 no contingency plans were made.


21. There was clearly insufficient consideration of the Green Guide
at paragraph 46 which deals with contingency plans, paragraph 47
which deals with turnstile flows and the ACPO Guide to Policing of
Football Matches, Entry to Grounds at paragraph 1.4 0 to 1.45.


22. Despite the number of officers from serials 14-15-16-17 who
were assigned to perform the duty by the Operational Order no
attempt was made to organise orderly queueing.   The disappearance
of Sergeant Payne and a   number of serial 16 was not properly
explained by the length   of time allegedly taken to process a
prisoner, nor has the whereabouts of Inspector White been revealed
to the Inquiry.   The absence of Sergeant Morgan was unfortunate and
the nett result was the   absence of an effective police presence at
the turnstile area.


23. Many spectators gave evidence of the abnormally slow rate of
admission, no doubt caused by a combination of factors, which
included in addition to those set out above, the searching of fans
and on some occasions searching fans twice, the crushing itself,
people without tickets, people with tickets for different
turnstiles to the one through which they were seeking entry.     No
doubt the insufficient and misleading signs outside the grounds
did not assist. The evidence was of a lack of police presence at
around 2.20 and attempts to inform the police of the situation met
with a cool response.


Perhaps the evidence of Inspector Hand-Davies (Day 13 Page 22
at Pages 29,31,48-49) and his attitude when giving evidence best
illustrates the unfortunate relationship between a few of the
police officers and a number of the supporters.


DELAYING THE KICK-OFF


24. The result was that by the latest 2.40 consideration should
have been given to delaying the kick-off.   If the situation was so
grave as to necessitate Superintendent Marshall seeking permission
to open the gates then clearly the kick-off should have been
delayed.   It would appear that the decision not to delay was made
bearing in mind every aspect of the problem other than safety.        A
wholly improper approach was taken and a suspicion arose that the
fans were in some way being punished for arriving at a time which
the senior police officers considered "late".     There are many very
goods reasons why kick-offs should not be delayed, but safety
factors should outweigh all other considerations.
EVENTS INSIDE THE STADIUM


25. In addition to the intelligence from outside the ground,
the computer, the CCTV and visual observation of the crowds inside
of the ground should have led to an early realisation that the
crowd would not be in the ground by 3.00 p.m.     There are many
unfortunate direct conflicts of evidence about these matters, most
notably between Mr Kirton and Mr Mackrell.     Whatever the Inquiry's
finding about the conflicts it is quite clear that insufficient
attention was paid to the possible effect of many people being
outside the ground and anxious to enter by kick-off.


26. There is little reason to dwell on the arrangements inside the
turnstile area.     All the evidence points to a total disregard of
the necessity of sufficient directional signs.     In the event,
coupled with the insufficient and misleading directions on the
tickets, these were important matters.     The evidence of a number of
fans was to the effect that they believed the tunnel to be only
means of entry to the terraces.     Not surprisingly, therefore, when
gate C was opened the resultant flow was down the tunnel towards
the already overcrowded central pens.


POLICE CONTROL ROOM


27. The actions and reactions of these in the control room between
the first request from Superintendent Marshall and the visit by
Messrs Kelly and Kirton are difficult to explain.     Suffice it to
say that apparently between the time of Mr Marshall's first request
and final demand Chief Superintendent Duckenfield apparently froze.
Despite being encouraged by his Officers to make decisions none
were forthcoming.     In the 6-7 minutes immediately prior to all
gates being opened there was a total failure of the police to
consider the effects of so doing.     It is quite clear from the
evidence - Dr. Eastwood, Mr Eccleston and Mr Lord and others - that
closing the tunnel has been an effective method of crowd
distribution but apparently it was not even considered.     Indeed for
many weeks of the Inquiry attempts were made to suggest that such
a method has never been used; and was inappropriate and even
impractical (the Inquiry was never shown the statement of former
Sergeant Higgins which apparently described the blocking of the
tunnel in 1988 and was in the possession of the S.Y.P before the
Inquiry started). No attempt was made to inform the club or indeed
Superintendent Greenwood of the intention to open the gates.
Whether it was the recent promotion of Chief Superintendent
Duckenfield and his consequent lack of experience which alone
caused the problem is a matter perhaps for the Inquiry.     What is
absolutely clear is that the performance of those in the control
room was less than satisfactory.


28. A matter of grave concern to the supporters was the behaviour
of Chief Superintendent Duckenfield     when Mr Kelly visited the
control box.   A full if somewhat belated apology for what happened
is not sufficient.   It would clearly have been sensible for Mr
Duckenfield to make no comment as to the cause of the tragedy,
indeed that would have been the appropriate action. To allow and
deliberately allow Mr Kelly to leave the room with the
understanding that the fans were responsible for forcing open the
gates was a deliberate attempt to avoid the criticism that he
expected for opening the gates.     The misleading of Assistant Chief
Constable Jackson will no doubt be considered elsewhere.


EVENTS INSIDE THE STADIUM


29. By 2.45 p.m. despite there being a very substantial number
of Liverpool supporters outside the ground, pens 3-4 were full.       It
is perhaps indicative of the attitude of the police as to what was
acceptable in terms of packing that despite there being
overwhelming evidence of overcrowding and discomfort, no one in
authority seemed to notice.   The compelling and disturbing evidence
of Mr Hicks (Day 4 Page at Page 12 ) will have to be carefully
considered. It accepted, his evidence reveals the most blatant and
total disregard for the spectators.     It is difficult to accept that
despite the position of the police control box, despite the
presence of officers and stewards on the perimeter track, no one
noticed the obvious overcrowding.     Perhaps the true explanation is
that the police did see what to others is obviously
overcrowding, but at the time considered it acceptable.      The
absence at lunch of PC Smith was another unfortunate and avoidable
coincidence.     The evidence of the level acceptable to the police
and hitherto tolerated by the fans was disturbing.      Apparently
little short of screams for help or actual casualties would have
caused action to be taken.     Indeed at 3.00 there is evidence that
such screams failed to bring a response.


POSSIBLE DELAY


30. Many hours of evidence were heard on this subject, but perhaps
consideration could be given to three particular pieces of evidence
that support the submission that by the latest 2.55/2.56 should
have been realised that there was a serious overcrowding problem.


(a) Inspector McRobbie (Day 20 Page 12 at Pages 13, 18-19)


   From a position in the control room he noticed that
   supporters were being let out onto the track,       that action was
   presumably taken by an officer who by that stage had noticed
   overcrowding. Inspector McRobbie left the control box and went
   to the track. Video evidence shows him by the track at 2.59.
   Thus the observation of the overcrowding by the officer on the
   track must have been at the latest     2.55/2.56.


(b) Mr Towler (Day 19, Page 86 at Page    87)


   Mr Towler describes being summoned     to Gate 4 by a colleague
   some 5 minutes before kick-off and     then describes people being
   crushed against the perimeter fence.


(c) P.C. Illingworth (Day 17 Page 130 at Pages 133-5)


   P.C. Hooson (Day 29 Page 14 at Pages 17-19)


   It would appear that PC Illingworth arrived first at Gate 4 and
   opened the gate at a time when people were able to spill out.
    He then moved to Gate 5 intending to assist people to transfer
    to a less crowded area.     Gate 4 must then have been closed
    because when it was opened by PC Hooson he remained at the
    gate for some time.


    Photograph 212 from the Liverpool Echo shows that at 2.59 gates
    3,4, and 5 were all open and according to PC Hooson his arrival
    at the track was before 2.59.


31. There was evidence that not all the police officers realised as
quickly as they might have done what was happening.         As a result
some spectators     trying to escape were returned to the pens and the
gates closed on     more than one occasion.     Such actions caused
feelings of resentment but were clearly caused by a genuine
misunderstanding of the situation.


32. Overall there was an unacceptable         delay probably arising in
fact from the training of the police which concentrated on the
control aspect of crowd management (P.C. Bichard Day 19 Page 39 at
Page 52) .


33. The adequacy or otherwise of the emergency plans and
possible improvements will no doubt be the subject of submission
from others. Nevertheless     the F.S.A. wish sincerely but wholly
inadequately to     thank all the individual policemen, fireman,      — -
ambulancemen and volunteers who heroically gave of their best.


PERIMETER FENCES


34. Although submissions as to possible recommendations are to be
made by the FSA in Phase 2, immediate action must be taken about
perimeter fences.    Any consideration of the problems of crowd
management reveals the difficulty of balancing the approach needed
to both detect control and eradicate disorder and to ensure safety.


The primary function of a perimeter fence is to prevent
encroachment onto the pitch.     The nature of the Hillsborough fences
was such that the pens became traps.      Clearly such fences must be
immediately removed.   Although bolt cutters on site may sound
initially attractive and can do no harm, as was said by the Fire
Brigade, if you need bolt cutters, you have got the wrong type of
fence.


35. With some reservations the F.S.A. accept that perimeter fences
are necessary for crowd control.   Clearly the Inquiry will have to
assess the expert evidence available and thereafter make
recommendations which balance the two   conflicting aspects.

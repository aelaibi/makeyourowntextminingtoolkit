Dear Sir

Hillsborough - Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield

As you will be aware,      we are instructed by Chief Superintendent
Duckenfield with regard to his position in relation to the criminal and
disciplinary aspects arising out of the Hillsborough case.

Now that the decision has been taken by the DPP that no criminal charges
are to be pursued against our client, there remains outstanding, the
question of disciplinary proceedings.   In this regard, we trust that you
were advised by Mr L Sharp, that when Chief Superintendent Duckenfield
attended Sheffield on 3rd July for interview, he reserved his position as
to the making of any statement in response to the alleged breaches of
discipline regulations, until such time as the decision of the DPP was
known.  As that time has now come, it is likely that Chief Superintendent
Duckenfield may wish to make such a statement.

In the circumstances,     therefore,   can you please advise how the
disciplinary matters are to proceed.    It would be helpful if you could
provide the anticipated timetable of events in relation to the
disciplinary matters to assist us in advising our client.

The writer Mr Coughlin looks forward to your early reply.

Dear Sirs

Hillsborough - Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield

Thank you for your letter of 31 August 1990 which has been passed to me as
disciplinary authority for the Force. You will appreciate that matters
touching on the investigation of possible disciplinary offences are the
responsibility of the investigating officer.  If Chief Superintendent
Duckenfield wishes to make a statement respecting the disciplinary aspects
the way ahead would be for him to contact Mr Sharp, the investigating officer,
so that an interview can take place.

Once any statement made by Mr Duckenfield has been considered and any
consequent investigation has been completed I would expect the evidence to
feature in Mr Sharp's report which will fall eventually for my consideration.

When I have made my decision as to disciplinary matters it will be for the
Police Complaints Authority to decide whether they agree with me. At this
stage the number of imponderables makes it impossible to draw up a timetable
but be assured that the need to proceed with all reasonable dispatch is well
recognised.

I will forward a copy of this correspondence to Mr Sharp for his information.

Yours faithfully

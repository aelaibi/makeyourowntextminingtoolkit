AS ALTHOUGH IT WAS CROWDED AT THIS STAGE IT WAS NO WORSE THAN ANY OTHER
FOOTBALL CROWD. UPON ENTERING THE GROUND I WENT TO THE TOILET, FROM THE
TOILET WINDOW I SAW A BIG GATE BEING OPENED AND PEOPLE JUST SURGED THROUGH.
FROM WHERE I WAS SITTING AT 2.45PM I NOTICED THAT THE AREA ON THE TERRACES
WAS PACKED FULL BUT THAT THE WINGS WERE EMPTY.

I DID NOT SEE AQNY STEWARDS. I SAW NO REFLECTIVE JACKETS. LOOKED FOR ENTRANCE
INTO GROUND. THERE WAS ONLY ONE BEHIND THE GOAL SO WE WNT THROUGH. NOONE WAS
DIRECTING US AND THERE WERE NO DIECTIONAL SIGNS. WE WENT IN THE ENTRANCE
BEHIND THE GOAL AT APPROX 1340HRS WHICH WAS TIGHTLY PACKED. WE DID NOT GO IN
THERE BECAUSE IT WAS SO PACKED WE WENT INTO PEN A. IT WAS EMPTY HERE. STOOD
BY PARTITION SEPERATING THE CENTRE FROM PEN A TO BE CLOSER TO MAIN CROWD. AT
ABOUT 1445HRS OUR STAND WAS STILL EMPTY BUT PEOPLE WERE JUMPING OVER FROM THE
C^fcRE BUT FINDING GREAT DIFFICULTY IN DOING SO. AT ABOUT 1455HRS LOTS MORE
PEOPLE CLIMBING OVER INTO PEN A SUFRFERING FROM EXAUSTION. THE GAME STARTED
AT 1500HRS AND BY NOW EVERYONE WAS TRYING TO JUMP OVER INTO PEN A. THE GAME
KICKED OFF AND I THOUGHT THAT THERE A FIGHT IN THE CENTRE BUT ON LOOKING I
COULD SEE THAT THERE WAS A CRUSH AND EVERYONE WAS LEANING FORWARD. I WAS
CONCERNED ABOUT ACTION IN CENTRE. PEOPLE NOW CLIMBING ONTO PITCH AND TRYING
TO STOP PLAY. OTHER PEOPLE ON THE PITCH CLIMBING BACK ONTO MAIN GATE AND
TELLING PEOPLE TO PUSH BACK BECAUSE OF CRUSH. AS MORE OF CROWD ENTERED PITCH
THE GAME WAS FINALLY STOPPED I NOTICED THAT IT WAS NOW 1506HRS. PEOPLE STILL
CLIMBING INTO MY PEN AND ALSO ONTO PITCH LOOKING VERY DISTRESSED BECAUSE OF
CRUSH. I STAYED FOR ABOUT ANOTHER 15 MINS AND KENNY DLGLISH MADE AN
ANNOUNCEMENT SAYING THAT FANS SHOULD STAY WHERE THEY WERE AND HELP THE POLICE
IN THEIR EFFORTS TO CLEAR THE GROUND. WHILST ALL THIS WAS HAPPENING I NOTICED
THAT THERE WAS NO EXITS FOR THE CENTRE CROWD TO GET OUT BUT HALF AN HOUR
AFTER THE GAME STOPPED A GATE ADJOINING PADDOCKS A AND B OPENED. INJURED
CARRIES TO PEN A TO ESCAPE. ALSO GATE IN PEN A WHICH ON POLICEMAN WAS MANNING
LETTING PEOPLE OUT ONTO THE FIELD. THERE WERENT ENOUGH STEWARDS IN THE
GGROUND AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE TO DIRECT PEOPLE.

COMMENTS I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE...THERE WERE PROBLEMS LAST YEAR.AT HALF TIME
FANS ALL ALONG TERRACE WERE BEING HELPED UP INTO STAND TO RELIEVE PRESSURE

POLICE BLOCKED OFF CENTRE TUNNEL LAST YEAR TO STOP MORE FANS ENTERING THAT
PEN ONCE IT WAS FULL

SIDE FENCES STOP THE SPREAD OF FANS ONCE A CRUSH STARTS..CAUSING PROBLEMS

SHOULD HAVE BEEN LONGER QUEUING FURTHER ON DOWN LEPPINGS LANE AWAY FROM THE

I DIDNT SEE ANY STEWARDS INSIDE THE GROUND DIRECTING THE PEOPLE WHERE TO GO I
HAD A LOOK AND COULD SEE THAT THE CENTRE PART OF THE TERRACE WAS PRETTY FULL
AT THAT TIME 1415HRS SO I WENT WITH SOME OTHER LADS UP TO THE HIGH PART OF
THE LEFT HAND SIDE . I COULD SEE PEOPLE CLIMBING OVER THE SIDE FENCES TO GET
OUT OF THE CRUSH AND INTO THE WINGS WHICH WERE EMPTY COMPARED WITH THE MIDDLE
PART THEN THE MATCH STARTED AND PEOPLE STARTED CLIMBING OVER ONTO THE PITCH
 AND WE KNEW THEN THAT SOMETHING WASNT RIGHT. YOU KNOW THE REST. THE ORGANISA
T ^ WAS BAD THERE JUST WASNT ANY. I DIDNT SEE ANY POLICE BEHIND THE GOAL AT
Al !TAND I CANT REMEMBER ANY MOUNTED POLICE OUTSDIDE WHERN I ARRIVED AT THE
GROUND.
ON THE WAY TO THE MATCH A MINI BUS WAS STOPPED BEHIND US BY THE POLICE AND
SEARCHED AND I THINK THAT THIS COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE LATE ARRIVAL OF
THE FANS AND ALONG WITH THAT WE CAME ACROSS A LOT OF ROADWORKS ON THE
JOURNEY.
I TRAVELLED THERE WITH A MATE AND HIS FATHER WHO I THINK HAVE ALREADY

WE MADE OUR WAY THROUGH THE TUNNEL AND AS I LOOKED AROUND I NOTICED THAT THE
TURNSTILES WERE CLOSED AND THE GATES WERE OPENED. ONCE THROUGH THE TUNNEL
THERE WAS A LOT OF PUSHING AND SHOVING BECAUSE THERE WERE TOO MANY PEOPLE IN
THE PEN. THE PEOPLE AT THE TOP SHOUTED TO US TO TELL US THAT THERE WERE TOO
MANY PEOPLE IN THERE. THERE WAS A LOT OF CONFUSION. THERE WAS A SUDDEN
SURGE AND NOBODY COULD BREATH OR MOVE. I WAS TRAPPED FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES
AND COULD NOT GET FREE. I COULD NOT GET AWAY TO THE SIDE TERRACES AS THERE
IS NO GATE TO GET THROUGH. THERE WERE NO STEWARDS ABOUT TO HELP AND THE
POLICE SEEMED CONFUSED AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON. THE PUBLIC
A S S E S S SYSTEM WAS NOT USED EITHER TO TELL PEOPLE WHAT WAS GOING ON.

I WENT WITH MY BROTHER         I.

WERE CLIMBING OVER THE FENCE ONTO THE PITCH.I SAW POLICEMEN AND FIREMEN
TRYING TO REVIVE PEOPLE LYING ON THE PITCH.AT 15.40 HOURS WE LEFT THE GROUND

LEAVING THE GROUND I SAW PEOPLE STRETCHED OUT ON THE FLOOR AND IT SEEMED THAT

I DECIDED NOT TO GO THERE. AS I HAD BEEN TO THE GROUND THE YEAR BEFORE I KNEW
BASICALLY THE LAYOUT OF THE GROUND AND KNEW THAT THERE WAS THE SIDE AREA
WHICH DOES NOT GET AS FULL. THERE WERE NO POLICE OR STEWARDS IN THE GROUND TO
DIRECT PEOPLE WHERE TO GO, SO UNLESS THEY KNEW WAY TO SIDE AREAS PEOPLE WOULD

WE ARRIVED AT THE TURNSTILE AT 225PM AND THERE WAS A TERRIBLE CRUSH AND NO
ATTEMPT WAS BEING MADE TO FORM A QUEUE. THE POLICE WERE VERY POORLY
REPRESENTED. THREE MEN ON HOUSE INSTEAD OF TRYING TO FORM A QUEUE WERE
FORCING THE CROWD TOWARDS THE TUNSTILE. ON ROUTE TO THE GROUND THERE WERE
THREE HORSMEN WHO WRE VERY ABUSIVE TO THE CROWD. LAST YEAR I WENT IN THE
CENTER STAND AND IT WAS VERY CRUSHED SO WE WENT TO THE LEFT. AT 230PM THE
CENTER WAS OVERFULL. I WOULD ADD THAT THERE WAS A VERY YOUNG PC AT THE
TIHSTILE SEARCHING THE FANS BUT HE COULD NOT COPE ON HIS OWN.

 AT THE MATCH WITH A GROUP OF MATES
AS SOON AS WE GOT THROUGH THE GATES THEY ALL HEADED FOR THE TUNNEL BECAUSE IT
WAS THE FIRST THING THAT YOU COULD SEE WHEN WE GOT TO THE END OF THE TUNNEL I
MANAGED TO MAKE MY WAY TO THE EDGE SO THAT I DID NOT GET IN THE CRUSH I COULD
SEE THAT THERE WERE LOTS OF PEOPLE ON THE PITCH RUNNING AROUND.

             ARRIVE AY 230PM AND CRUSH OUTSIDE VERY BAD. RIGHT DECISION TO
             OPEN THE GATE. I BELIEVE IT WAS SHUT AGAIN AS I WENT THROUGH THE
             TURNSTILE. WALKED IN EASILY. VERY CROWDED BUT NO MORE THAN I HAVE
             BEEN USED TO. FANS ALREADY CLIMBING OVER BARRIERS WHEN I GOT IN
             BUT I WAS UNAWARE OF THE PROBLEM INFRONT OF ME. I BELIEVE THAT
             LACK OF POLICE MANNING OF THE GATE PRIOR TO THE TURNSTILE WAS
             WRONG.

I WAS AT THE REAR OF THE STAND BUT I DID NOT FEEL ANY DANGER AND I THOUGHT
THE THE FANS CLIMBING AT THE FRONT AND UP TO THE SEATS AT THE BACK WAS DUE TO
THEM FAINTING AS IT WAS QUITE HOT. I ATTENDED THE MATCH LAST YEAR AND THE
POLICE PROCEDURE WAS NOT A LOT DIFFERENT THIS YEAR. THE CENTRAL TUNNEL WAS
CLOSED LAST YEAR HOWEVER AND AS IT IS OPPOSITE THE TURNSTILE EVERYONE GOES
DOWN THERE AS YOU ARE NOT AWARE OF THE SIDE ENTRANCES.THE OTHER THING THAT
     IED ME WAS THAT THE PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM WAS NOT USED AND THE FANS WERE
     IE DARK AS TO THE SITUATION, EVEN I WHO WAS ON THE SPOT DID NOT KNOW WHAT
WAS HAPPENING.I WOULD LIKE TO BE REPRESENTED AT THE PUBLIC ENQUIRY.

WHEN THE MATCH STARTED JUST AFTER LIVERPOOL HIT THE BAR THE FANS WENT MAD. I
THEN SAW THE GATES OPEN AND IT SEEMED AS THOUGH THERE WAS A PITCH INVASION.
THERE WAS NO INFORMATION OVER THE TANNOY. I SAW THE YOUNG LAD WHO WAS GIVEN
MOUTH TO MOUTH AND THE OXYGEN ARRIVE BUT THE BOTTLE SEEMED TO BE HALF EMPTY
BY THE WAY OT WAS BEING CARRIED. I SAW LOTS OF PEOPLE LAYED OUT AMD ALSO ONE
DEAD PERSON BEING CARRIED AWAY.WE LEFT THE GROUND AT APPROXIMATELY 163GHRS. A

I HEARD A LOT OF PEOPLE SHOUTING I WAS CONFUSED BECASUE IT WAS A LOT OF NOISE
FOR SUCH A NUMBER OF PEOPLE. LATER ON IN THE DAY I REALIZED IT WAS OUTSIDE
THE GROUND.
BEFORE THE GAME KICKED OFF I SAW FANS CLIMBING OVER THE FENCE. I THOUGHT THAT
THEY WERE BEHAVING BADLY. I DID NOT KNOW THAT THERE WAS ANY PROBLEM I COULD
SEE THAT THE PENS WERE PULL BUT NOT THAT ANY ONE WAS CRUSHED.
THE MATCH KICKED OFF WHEN LIVERPOOL HIT THE BAR THERE WAS A SURGE AND THEN
WHEN FOREST HAD A CORNER I SAW THAT PEOPLE WERE INVADING THE PITCH. I SAW
THEM LYING ON THE PITCH BUT I STILL COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHY.
I SAW TWO POLICEMEN CARRY A LITTLE BOY IN FRONT OF US. THEY TRIED TO
RE^CITATE HIM BUT I DON'T THINK THEY SUCCEED.
THE LIVERPOOL FANS WERE SHOUTING ABUSE AT US. WE WERE TWO ROWS BACK AND A
LIVERPOOL FAN WAS SCREAMING AT MY FACE TORRENTS OF ABUSE. THIS WASWHILST THE
POLICEMAN WAS TRYING TO SAVE THE LITTLE BOY.
THE POLICE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS HAPPENING BECAUSE ON ONE HAND HE WAS
TRYING TO SAVE THE BOY AND THEN THE LIVERPOOL FANS WERE TRYING TO GET AT US.
SOME LIVERPOOL FANS CAME OVER AND TRIED TO DRAG THEM AWAY.
IT WAS APPROX 1555HRS WHEN I HEARD THE TANNOY FROM KENNY DALGLESH
WE STAYED IN OUR SEATS AND EVENTUALLY RETURNED TO OUR CAR 1655HRS
MY HUSBAND TOOK SOME PHOTOGRAPHS OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED.FOUR ALL TOGETHER.
I TRAVELLED WITH MY HUSBAND , MY SON AND HIS FRIEND.
II       H SAME ADDRESS
21----- H23YRS (HE WAS AT THE SPION KOP)
31            23YRS (FRIEND OF SON) HE WAS SITTING AT THE FRONT. HE WAS SO
UPSET THAT HE CAME UP TO US. HE WAS CRYING. I HAVE NOT DISCUSSED THIS WITH
HIM YET BUT WHEN THE POLICE 'PHONE I WILL GIVE THEM HIS DETAILS. HE PROBABLY
HAD A CLEARER VIEW THAN US.
**** PLEASE CONTACT TO ARRANGE FOR VIEWING OF PHOTOGRAPHS     ********
I WENT TO LAST YEARS MATCH. AT THE END THE LIVERPOOL FANS INVADED THE PITCH.
I THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS HAPPENING AT THIS YEARS MATCH AND I THINK THAT WAS
WHAT A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE INCLUDING THE POLICE THOUGHT.
THERE WERE ALOT OF POLICE PRESENT AND PLENTY OF STEWARDS TO SHOW US WHERE TO
GO.

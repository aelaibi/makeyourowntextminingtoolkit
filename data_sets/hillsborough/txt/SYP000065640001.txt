                               will say as follows



            •1.     I was born on



            2.      I am a Qualified A m b u l a n c e m a n , and joined the ambulance service

                    1968, and I am based at D o n c a s t e r .



            3.      I have been based at this Station throughout my career with the

                    ambulance service.



            4.      I was   initially trained at Cleckheaton Ambulance School and

                    undertook a residential       training    course over a six week period.
                                                                                PAGE     2
                                                                                S990

     5.   I became a qualified ambulance man after        completion of this course

          in or about    1969.   Subsequently,    I have attended a number of

          refresher    courses at Markfield Training School at Leicester,          but

          I have no paramedic training.



     6.   I was on duty on Saturday 15th April        1989, when my shift was

          0900 to 1630.     I drove to work directly from home.       Prior to

          my involvement with the Hillsborough        inci den t, my day was fairly

          routine,    with a couple of emergency calls,     some transfers and one

          house fire.



     7.   I was at Doncaster Station when I became aware of the Hillsborough

          incident.     Leading ambulanceman            took a telephone call from

          Control    some time between 1500 and 1530,                 informed me
A.
          that I was required at Sheffield Wednesday Football         ground, at

          the Leppings Ln end.
                                                                        W rzM*-
                                    My co1 l e ag ue , qualified ambulanceman

          and I got into our vehicle and left the Station immediately.

          I was attendant at this point in time whilst                was driving,

          We had travelled approximately one mile when our vehicle broke

          down due to overheating.      We informed Control who told us to

          return to base and pick up another vehicle.         It took us

          approximately 5 minutes to return to base and pick up another

          ambulance vehicle, at which point in time Control         informed us to

          go back to Hillsborough.



     8.   The journey back to Hillsborough took approximately 20 minutes

          and we approached the ground via Herries Rd S o u t h .     Even though

          there was a sizeable     crowd leaving the ground up along Herries

          Rd,   our access through the crowd was relatively unhindered.           At

          the junction with Penistone Rd,        our vehicle was directed across
                                                                           PAGE        3
                                                                           8990

       the central     reservation, and we turned right on to Penistone Rd,

       A little further up Penistone Rd,                 reversed the vehicli

       into the ground through the entrance marked A on the attached

       plan,             manoeuvred the vehicle to one side to allow other

       ambulance vehicles      inside the ground to leave at point A.



9.     I got out of the vehicle and I d i r e c t e d t o         a point whereby

       other vehicles were given sufficient access          into the ground.

       After directing our vehicle to a point marked 8 on the attached

       plan, and on walking a couple of paces I was able to see the

       football    pi tch itself.



•10.   I initially recall seeing a number of supporters either sat up or

       laid down, alongside the north stand and against some nearby

       railings.       I went over to some of the supporters and asked them

       how they were feeling, and all were         capable of telling me their

       relative    conditions.       I considered that none of these supporters

       were in grave danger.



•11.   There   is a tunnel going underneath the north stand at point

       marked C on the attached plan.         At the entrance to the tunnel,       I

       noticed police officers stood two or three deep across the

       entrance.       I returned to my vehicle some ten or fifteen yards

       away,   where    I rejoined          who had been requested to stay with

       the vehicle.      As I returned, a number of police officers had

       brought out two stretcher        cases from the   pitch itself,   through

       the gap between the North Stand and the Spion Cop.           One casualty

       was   laid on a hoarding,      whilst the other was on "scoop"

       stretcher.      The police officers asked me      if I could take both

       casualties, and upon a quick examination I decided that they both
                                                                             PAGE         *
                                                                             S990

       required immediate hospital treatment.           I believe both casualties

       were    conscious to some degree, and they were quickly transferred

       onto the vehicle        cots inside the ambulance with the assistance of

       the police.



 12.   I remained in the back of the ambulance with both casualties

       w h i 1st           drove the vehicle.     I continued to monitor both

       patients and made them as comfortable as possible.            One of the

       casualties was extremely distressed,          and continually coughed and

       reared up whilst        laid on the cot.    From inside the back of the

       ambulance,       one can see into the drivers    cab itself, and when I

       glanced up as we were        leaving the ground,    I saw another    casualty

       sat    in the attendants seat.



13.                 had a police escort up to the Royal Hallamshi re h o s pi t al,

       and I would say there were probably another three ambulance

       vehicles with polic escorts travelling to the Royal Hallamshi re

       at the same time as ourselves.           On arrival at the hospital,

              drove the vehicle to the orthopaedic entrance.         When the rear

       doors were opened,        I noticed that medical    teams were waiting to

       receive the       casualties on board our ambulance.                and I

       helped to off load the patients on the cots, and took them into

       the hospital       one at a time, where a doctor     checked each patient

       before transfer onto hospital trolleys.            The doctors asked me

       what    I believed the casualties      injuries to be, and I indicated

       that they appeared to have mainly chest injuries.            In particular

       I recall seeing marks on the chest of one of the casualties.                 The

       other       casualty who was sat in the attendants seat was checked by

       a doctor whilst sat in the         cab and was presumably taken into the

       hos pi t a l .
                                                                                 PAGE         5
                                                                                 S990



14.             and I reloaded the cots into the back of the ambulance,

                radioed Control    for further   instructions.        I am not

      sure whether we received a reply from Control.



15.   Two Police officers,    one male and one female, asked me if they

      could have a lift back to Hillsborough,         which I agreed t o .         On

      leaving the entrance of the Royal Hallamshi re hospital,              our

      ambulance vehicle broke down and we pulled up on to some waste

      ground.     The Police officers then left the ambulance and

      presumably made their own way down to Hillsborough.               We informed

      Control    of our situation and our    location.    By chance,       two

      mechanics from a garage       around the corner appeared         on the scene,

      and asked if they could help.       After twenty minutes or so,             the

      mechanics had managed to repair our ambulance.             We then

      radioed Control, who    informed us to standby at the Royal

      Hallamshire hospital.        As we were virtually stationed outside the

      hospital, we    remained where we were.       It was envisaged that we

      were going to have to transfer patients to the king Edward VII

      hospital    in Sheffield.



16.   After approximately 15 to 20 miry^tes, Control advised us to drive

      round to B road at theJ2t€ya.\ Hallamshire Hospital          in order to

      collect som^ CfryCTalties     for transfer up to the King Edward

      hospital.     There were a    number of other vehicles     in

      front of us waiting to collect and transfer         patients.                     and

      I picked up one casualty from a ward, who was a stretcher                  case,

      and transferred this patient on to one of the vehicle cots.                   Two

      other casualties were put into the back of our ambulance with our

      assistance,    although they were not stretcher      cases.        It should be
                                                                                   PAGE   6
                                                                                   S990

                noted that these three patients had not been involved with the

                Hillsborough in ci d e n t .       and I then drove up to the King

                Edward hospital,     and transferred the three casualties   into

                various wards as directed.



         •17.   Thereafter,    we radioed Control asking for further instructions

                and were told to return to Doncaster     base.   Upon arrival back at

                our station, we informed Control again that we had arrived, and I

                would say the time was approximately 1950.       There was nothing

                further to do, and so we locked up our ambulance,      signed off and

                I went home.

                                                                               SIGNED

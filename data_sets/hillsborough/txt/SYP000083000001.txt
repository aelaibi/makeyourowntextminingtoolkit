               at H i l l s b o r o u g h on        13th April        1969     (130489),       and this S t a t e me n t       is

               made with the               int en ti on of      clarifying matters              in respect       of

               deceased          persons       I had dealings           with.



               Just after 3             pm (1500),        I was d i re ct ed          to go to the tunnel             that    runs

               under      the West S ta nd and                into the L ep pi ng s          Ln/terracing.        It was about

               I saw a male                person     lying    on the       concourse        area a hojdx   15-20 ft         from

               the entrance             to the        tunnel.     There was           fio one with him.          I assumed

               that      he had been d r a g g e d            through       the     tunnel    by s upporters and          left

                  and    put him       in the      prone       position,          JSy this      time,     other Offic ers

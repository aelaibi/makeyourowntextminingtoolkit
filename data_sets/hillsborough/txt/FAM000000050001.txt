F.A.O.

Dear

RE:      HILLSBOROUGH G ROUP - BULLETIN 2

The Public Inquiry opens on Mo n d a y at Sheffield Town Hall, and we
have briefed             Ben Hytner QC and Tim King on behalf of the bereaved
and injured.                 We had a very helpful site inspection at
Hil l s b o r o u g h y e s t e r d a y followed by a Conference at which the
evidence available todate was considered and the approach to the
Tribunal.

Lord Justice   Taylor has made it clear that he intends to find
facts and not apportion   blame, although it is of course, on those
facts that liability will ultimately be determined.

Our m ain task at the Inquiry is to ensure that all facts do come
out and to concentrate upon issues which will affect civil
liability.         As you know the Football Supporters A s s o c iation are
sepa r a t e l y represented and Counsel has agreed with their Counsel
that to avoid duplic a t i n g c r o s s - e x a m i n a t i o n ,we will leave the more
general issues of behaviour and ticket allocation to their Counsel
and we will o a l c u l at-e on issues of safety and crowd control.
                <^cv\ccurUrrate.

As u ndoubtedly the p o t ential Defendants will be seeking to lay the
b lame on each other - and ma y have in-house or outside experts -
the logic is to follow their Counsel and cross examine later in
the order.   This should both be most effective method to protect
our clients' interests.

We will have a better idea of the likely witnesses and order after
M o n d a y and we will let you know as soon as the position is
clearer.

Transc r i p t s of evidence will be available and we will keep one
c o p y at the Law Libr a r y for easy reference.  Dependant on the
logistics of getting the copies from the Inquiry to Liverpool
these m a y be two days behind but we will try to ensure they are
ava i l a b l e as soon as possible.




                                                                                           ;'./i

Wit n e s s e s

A l s o p Wilkinson has been appointed by the Treasury Solicitors to
take statements from those witnesses who do not wish to give their
evidence through the Police, if any of your clients or witnesses
would prefer to give statements in this way please contact Keith
Lewin at Alsop Wilkinson (051-227-3060) wit h the details.

Conference with Counsel

As the m a j ority of clients live within reasonable travelling
distance of Liverpool we have arranged a conference for members of
the Group and any of their clients, who wish to attend (who must
be identified and accompany their Solicitor on the n i g h t ) .      The
Conference has been arranged for 7.30pm on W e d n e s d a y the 24th May
at the Moot Hall Faculty of Law Liverpool University.           (Plan and
park i n g facilities a t t a c h e d ) .

By then the Inquiry will be into the second week and we should be
in a good posit i o n to review developments.

To assist with numbers I would be glad if you could confirm as
soon as possible whether you will be attending and the names of
any clients who will accompany you and we will then let you have
an admission ticket.

As I expect we will have a large number at the Conference, we
p r o p o s e to take questions only from Solicitors, so if your clients
have any particular points that w orry them could you clear this
first.

Ben Hytner has agreed to hold a separate Conference in London at a
later date for those members and their clients who find it
d i f f i c u l t to travel to Liverpool.

C i v i l Liability

W e are already in touch with the two major Insurance Companies
involved here - The Sun Alliance (for the Club and F.A.) and the
Mun i c i p a l Mutual Insurance (for the Police and Sheffield City
C o u n c i l ) . They have agreed in pr i n c i p l e to a meeting but wish to
l e a v e it until the first part of the Inquiry (finding the facts)
is complete - expected to be approximately three weeks.
E v erything we learn re-inforces our view that it will not be
di f f i c u l t to establish liability but that the apportionment
be t w e e n Defendants m a y be the stumbling block - we aim to move the
c i v i l liability aspects by negotiation or proceedings or both
w i t h o u t delay once the 'facts' part of the Inquiry are complete.

H i l l s b o r o u g h Trust

The Trustees ask for details of claimants - through Mike
R e d d i n g t o n - and p a r t i c u l a r l y request details of children
affected.


                            f:
No payments will be made on the case of deceased without Grant
of P r obate/Letters of Administration.

Grant of P r o bate/Letters of Administration

We have spoken on the telephone with Mr Fox.         Chief Clerk to
Liverpool District Registry.

Mr Fox told us that he normally expects Grants to be issued within
seven days of application.   if applications are submitted under
reference "HILLSBOROUGH" with a request that they be expedited he
will do his best to see that applications are dealt with even
quicker

G roup members are reminded that in the case of net estates under
£10,000 only the e x e c u t o r s /administrators oath need normally be
lodged (together with any will and codicil) and there is no fee
save for 25p for each office copy required.

All good wishes.

Yours sincerely.

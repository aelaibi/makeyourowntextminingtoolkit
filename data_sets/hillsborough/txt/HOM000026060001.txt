             has     ... They ' v e    c o l l a p s e d the gates          and there's    ..."

     whatever       it is.     Our    tran s c r i p t   is r o u g h l y    the same.
     A.  Yes.

Q.   Yo u see, Mr. D u c k e n f i e l d told the I n q u i r y that the only
     source of i n f o r m a t i o n at Snig Hill w o u l d be the g r o u n d
     control?    A. That is right, via me, or the t e lephone
     system, obviously.

Q.   Yes.  But can y o u recall             telling       that    to Snig       Hill?
     A. No, sir, not at all.

Q. D i d you have any requ e s t for i n f o r m a t i o n from the BBC,
   Mr. Bichard, in the course of this a f t e r n o o n ?        A.  Did
   I have an y re quest from the BBC or for the BBC?

Q.   F r o m BBC?      A.    Not personally.

Q.   Are you aware of any coming through to the Police Control
     R o o m a s k i n g for i n f o r mation? A. Not that I can r e m e m b e r .

Q.   Can y o u acco u n t not only for the fact that the A m b u l a n c e
     Se rvice w e r e told at 1508 the incorrect story, but also
     the Fire Service I think at 1511, and a lso on the BBC
     c o m m e n t a r y at 1513 Mr. M o t s o n has p r e c i s e l y the same
     story?            Can yo u acco u n t for that?       A. No, I can't say
     at all, sir.             W h e n that gate opened, Gate 'C', initially,
     I be li e v e that the gate h a d bee n forced and m y co mments
     w e r e d i r e c t e d a l o n g that line.

Q.   Yes, but they w e r e c o m ments in the box,                   were      they not?
     A.  They w e r e to Mr. Ducken field.

Q.   Yes,   but they wer e not b eing r e l a y e d to Snig Hill?
     A.     C e r t a i n l y not, no.

            L ORD J U S T I C E TAYLOR:    But it b e c a m e p e r f e c t l y
     clear, did it not, w i t h i n a short time that that was
     not wha t ha d h a p p e n e d ?  A.    I w o u l d n ' t say p e r f e c t l y
     clear, sir.        It was an a s s u m p t i o n that wa s m a d e at that
     time w h i c h has be c o m e mor e a p p a r e n t afterwards.

Q.           Mr. KA LL IP ET IS :        Mr. D u c k e n f i e l d has told us that
     he wa s qu ite clear w i t h i n a short space of time that the
     initial i m p r e s s i o n w h i c h he sh a r e d w i t h y o u he no longer
     h eld ?    A.   A g a i n I can't speak for him, but those wer e
     m y th oug hts and m y fe eli ngs of w hat I wa s e x p e r i e n c i n g
     at that time.

Q. W h a t e v e r the p o s i t i o n was - and Mr. G i b s o n - W a t t , the
   g e n t l e m a n here, wa s ask i n g y o u q u e s t i o n s a m o m e n t ago -
   y o u we r e c e r t a i n l y a w a r e that the gate h a d b e e n closed?
   A.      Yes.

Q.   Certa inl y, w h a t e v e r y our initial thoughts w e r e  before
     ki ck- off , y o u no longer h e l d those t h o ughts?     A. Yes.

                                                                       T. BICHARD


                 LOR D J U S T I C E TAYLOR:         That is correct, is it?
     A.      M y initial thoughts w e r e that the gate h a d bee n
     forced.         People h ave come into the g r o u n d and we have
     closed the gates.               M y a s s u m p t i o n w o u l d be that the gate
     has not bee n a c t u a l l y broken.                  W h e n we refer to ' f o r c e 1 ,
     are we talking on the lines of a c t u a l l y p h y s i c a l l y
     b r e a k i n g the gate?         That is not w h a t I thought.            I
     thought that the gate ha d bee n fo r c e d m e a n i n g that the
     gate ha d bee n o p e n e d         by the fans to a l l o w the m access.

Q.               Mr. KALLIPETIS:     W h a t was b e i n g said to the
     A m b u l a n c e Service, Mr. Bichard, was that the gate had
     collapsed.           A. I n ever told O p e r a t i o n s R o o m that.

Q.    It was, in fact, a bit mor e p o s i t i v e than that.               It was,
     "They have c o l l a p s e d the gate s . "     A. I n e v e r p a s s e d
     that m e s s a g e to O p e r a t i o n s Room. If I did, it w o u l d
     be on VHF Ch annel 1, w h i c h is recorded, and o b v i o u s l y
     it w o u l d be in this transcript.

Q.   Y o u see, at 1513 Mr. M o t s o n says "The gate lead i n g into
     that T e r r a c e was broken.             People w i t h o u t tickets got
     in, the r e f o r e o v e r c r o w d i n g the pe o p l e w i t h tickets and
     that is w h y the c rush occurred. '                   That is at 1513.
     A.    No idea w h e r e Mr. M o t s o n got that from, sir.

Q.    At some stage, Mr. Bichard, I think a t t e m p t s w e r e m a d e                    to
     contact the senior a m b u l a n c e offi c e r in the ground?
     A.  Yes, sir, on m ore than one occasion.

Q.   Well,     Ihave found two.           Are y o u aware of any m o r e than
     that?      A.  In m y mind,         sir, it was three occasions.

Q.   And h o w did yo u do it?               A.   VHF,   Chan n e l     1.

Q.   If the tape is a c c u r a t e and the t r a n s c r i p t i o n is accu rate,
     there w e r e only two?        A.  A g a i n I ac c e p t that as b e i n g
     the truth of the matter, that m y c o n v e r s a t i o n s w ere
     recorded.

Q. W h y did yo u use the VHF c o m m u n i c a t i o n ?              A.    That   is w h a t
   I was deal i n g with, sir.

Q. Did n o b o d y su ggest that yo u should use                      the ta n n o y in
   the gr ound?        A.  N o b o d y s u g g e s t e d it.           I w o u l d n ' t hav e
   even thought a bout using the tannoy.

Q. W h y not?         A.  O p e r a t i o n s R o o m co ntrol cont a c t b e t w e e n
   o u r s e l v e s and the other e m e r g e n c y servi c e s i n i t i a l l y
   until senior o f f i c e r s a t t e n d at the scene, liaise and
   then act on w h a t is h a p p e n i n g in front of them, so they
   can, if y o u like, b u i l d up a c o m m u n i c a t i o n s base b e t w e e n
   all the services w h o are arriving.

                                                                     T. BICHARD

         Q.   That is v e r y noble, Mr. Bichard, and it is h o w plans
              should operate, but in fact the first requ e s t was not
              until 1531, by w h i c h time the D e p u t y Chief A m b u l a n c e
              Offi c e r h a d b een in the g r o u n d ten m i n u t e s and was
              a l r e a d y o r g a n i s i n g things at the P e n i s t o n e R o a d end,
              w h e r e he is s u p p o s e d to be?        A. Well, I think I w o u l d
              d i s agree w i t h yo u there, sir.

         Q. Why?          A. I w o u l d have to d i s a g r e e w i t h you. If the
            Police Co ntrol w a s the initial place w h e r e this
            o p e r a t i o n is set up from, that w o u l d be the p oint of
            contact for the other services.                    The senior Fire
            O f f i c e r w h o a t t e n d e d did come to the Police Cont r o l box.

         Q.   That, if I m a y say so, Mr. Bichard, is beca u s e he wa s
              d i r e c t e d to the L e p p i n g s Lane end via P e n i s t o n e R o a d
              and p a r k e d his fire          engine i m m e d i a t e l y b e h i n d the
              Police Co ntrol box. A.             An d the A m b u l a n c e S e r v i c e   was
              ini t i a l l y a s k e d to att e n d at L e p p i n g s Lane as well.

         Q.   That is correct, but wha t should an a m b u l a n c e do w h e n
              it arri v e s at L e p p i n g s Lane and finds bodies in n e e d
              of a t t e n t i o n ? A. I w o u l d  ass u m e that it w o u l d try and
              find the people w h o           are in command.

         Q. Was a senior o f f i c e r sent down to L e p p i n g s Lane to liaise
            w i t h the a m b u l a n c e officer? A. Not by me, sir.

         Q.    Was a m e s s a g e r e l a y e d to the L e p p i n g s Lane end to any
              officer down there to ask an a m b u l a n c e of ficer to come
              up to the Police Control?                A.    A g a i n I can't a n s w e r
              that, sir.

         Q. Not by y o u      is the answer,         I think?        A.    Again,     yes,   not
            by  me.

         Q. Nor did y o u hear such an               order b eing g i v e n in the
            Control Room?     A. No, I               didn't hear it.

         Q. Just one other matter, Mr. Bichard.               On the tape r e c o r d i n g
            of this p a r t i c u l a r channel, w h i c h is  w h a t yo u  h av e told
            us y o u h a d access to and        w e r e using, there is a m e s s a g e
            either to or from M r . M a r s h a l l after 3 o'clock, a s k i n g
            for the gates to be closed.             Now, can y o u recall that?
            Yo u w ill not find it on the transcript, in fact.                  A. I
            re m ember --- On w h a t page w o u l d that be, sir?

         Q.   Y o u will not find       it on the      transcript.        A.    Sorry.

         Q.   Can you recall that?     A. There was some m e n t i o n about
              cl osi ng gates some time a r o u n d 3 o'clock.

         Q.   By wh om?       A.    A g a i n I can't recollect.           Have    I actually
              inc lu de d   that   in m y statement, sir?

Q.   If yo u have, Mr. Bichard, forgive me;     I wil l look at
     it.     I have page 20 of you r statement.   Do yo u h ave it
     in   front of you?    A.  These pages are not numbered,
     sir.

Q.   Are yo u looking at your log                or at your statement,           Mr.
     Bic ha rd?  A.  I am looking                at the sta t e m e n t that     I made.

Q. Y o u are being g i v e n a p a g e n a t e d copy of the statement ,
   if that assi s t s you.         (H a n d e d to the w i t n e s s ). At the
   top       of that page, you are deal i n g w i t h the r e q u e s t by
   Mr. M a r s h a l l to ope n the gates?          A.        Can y o u r e a d out
   the      first line, please, sir?

Q. Have y o u got page 20 at the b o t t o m of the page?                       A.      Again,
   no n u m b e r s on this page, sir.

Q.    Go b a c k one p a g e . I think y o u have b een g i v e n 21 by
     mistake.      Have y o u got page      20 now?  A. I have got page
     20 now, sir.

Q.    At the top of the page y o u deal w i t h the part w h e r e Mr.
     M a r s h a l l is a s k i n g for the gates to be opened? A.Yes.

Q. A n d then the m i d d l e paragraph, "I r e m e m b e r that a bout
   the time the gates wer e o r d e r e d to be opened, m o u n t e d
   o f f i c e r s ou tside L e p pings Lane t u r n s t i l e s h a d m a n a g e d

Q.    A n d then, "About 2.55 p.m. Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t

Q.   I am just c h e c k i n g your log to see wheth e r , by any

                                     T. BICHARD


      MR. KALLIPETIS:  You tell me> Mr. Bichard, because I
put to you that Mr. Marshall was concerned in this message
which has not been transcribed and you have already told us
that he was concerned that Gate C? — A. That is what is in
my mind, yes.

But it is true to point out in fairness to you that Gates A
and B at some stage were also open? - A. I was aware certainly
of the request for Gate A to be opened and again in relation
to Gate B I have no knowledge.

You weren't aware of the request for A to be shut? - A. No,
I can't say I was aware of a direct order or comment being
made to shut Gate A.

In connection wit h your attempts to contact the Ambulance
Officers, Mr. Bichard, did anybody suggest that Inspector
Sewell should be contacted, he being the Liaison Officer
between the Police and the Ambulance Services? - A. Not to
my knowledge.

Lastly this please, Mr. Bichard, the incident log that was
being maintained at one stage in the Control Room, did you
have any part in keeping that log? - A. No sir.

      MR. KALLIPETIS:   Thank you.


              Cross-Examined by MR. G L A S G O W :

Mr. Bichard, have you still got Photograph 48 in front of
you.  Could you just help us as to this:  communications
with the Club is organised from the front row as we look
at that photograph, I think? - A. Yes, that is right, sir.

Either by the telephone that we see on the desk, one of
those two telephones? - A. Yes, that is right.

Or by the Club's radio set which is also kept on the front
clssl'v'? A* Yss •

You have told us, and of course I accept, that you had no
contact with the Club Control yourself? - A. That is right,
sir.

 Sergeant Goddard has told us that he did and I just wanted
 your confirmation of this.  You have no reason to doubt
 that Sergeant Goddard is accurate when he says that he
 had contact with the Club? - A. No reason at all.

 During the course of the afternoon? - A. No reason to doubt
 it.

 One other matter on that, Mr. Bichard.  Did you know that
 anybody was having difficulties, if they were, in making
 contact with the Club that afternoon? - A. Again not to
 my knowledge.
                             81

                                       T. BICHARD


Q. You did not hear any conversation specifically from Inspector
   Murray about a difficulty making contact wi t h the Club? -
   A. Again I can't, obviously it is a very active time.    I
   have no recollection of any conversation.

Q. Mr. Bichard, is that the position that a number of people
   were doing different things and not everybody would have
   known what everybody else was doing? - A. Once we were aware
   about the fullness of this incident each individual took
   upon themselves their individual tasks, so you would not be
   fully aware of what was happening elsewhere.

Q. Mr. Bichard, I am sure we all sympathise w it h that, but the
   conversation that I was putting to you as to whether you could
   help was somewhat earlier.   Mr. Murray thought that he had
   tried to get in touch with the Club before the decision to
   open the gates was made.   Again I can only ask you this:   if
   in fact there were difficulties at that stage, something let
   us say at about a quarter-to-3 ....   A. Again it is not
   in my recollection.

Q. And the last matter, and forgive me there is only one question
   on the question of the opening of the gates.  Can I just
   ask you to clarify this:  Mr. Duckenfield and Mr. Murray have
   both told the Inquiry that they had expected all the gates to
   be opened? - A. I would accept that if that is what they are
   saying.

Q. That is what they expected and you have told us that your
     expectation was different? - A. That is right, G&te C.

Q. And I think you have also said that the reason for that you
     believe, from recollection, is that because your camera
     happened to be looking at Gate C at that time, you had
     assumed that was the gate about wh ich Superintendent Marshall
     was speaking? - A. The actual scene is available on that
     camera.  It shows a clear picture of Gate C.   Gate B is out
     of view.  Gate A is out of view.

Q. And that is what you were concentrating on personally? - A.
   That is right.

Q.    And you were unaware of the fact that Mr. Duckenfield and
     Mr. Murray wanted all the gates opened? - A. I am unaware
     of that, yes.

Q.    It is just this question in the light of that background,
     Mr. Bichard.  After the order to open the gates was given
     on the first occasion, we can see on the video that you
     zoomed in on Gate C first of all? - A. Yes.

Q. iDo you remember that? - A. I don't actually, because I have
   !not had an opportunity ....    I have seen a compilation tape
   1
   v
     but I have not seen the tapes  I produced.

Q. All I wanted your help with was when you did zoom in on Gate C

            you said this morning that you drew that to"his attention"?
            - A. Yes.

         Q. Whose attention did you draw to the fact that Gate C was
            being opened? - A. When I made the comment about it being
            forced open?

         Q. Yes? - A. It would be directed at Mr. Duckenfield, but also
            to everybody who was in the Control Box.

         Q. But are you saying that you have a specific recollection
            of drawing Mr. Duckenfield's attention to the gate which you
            were zooming in on at the time when the first entry was
            made? - A. When the gate was, as I believed forced, and I
            have shouted out the comments that I have put in my statement
            and it has been directed to Mr. Duckenfield who has been
            stood just in front of me.

         Q. A nd likewise approximately five minutes later when there was
            conversation specifically about Gate A, and I think we can
            tell you without fear of contradiction that you zoomed in
            on Gate A as well? - A. Yes, I have got that recollection
            now of seeing two lines of Police Officers behind Gate A.

         Q. And zooming in on them? - A. And moving in on that scene, yes.

         Q. When you zoomed in on Gate A, those minutes later after
            the initial zoom on Gate C, can you recall whether anything
            was said at all inside the Control Box about why Gate A
            had not been opened earlier? - A. No, I know wh y I zoomed
            in on Gate A because of the radio message from Sergeant
            Higgins, that is why I went there, but I have no idea of
            any conversation after that.

                  MR. GLASGOW:    Thank you very much.       Thank you sir.


                           Cross-Examined by MR. W O O D W A R D :

         Q. Mr. Bichard, may I ask you about the monitoring at Snig
            Hill.   Until the major incident was declared, was Snig Hill
            listening in to the communications that were passing?
            - A . To ray knowledge they were listening to Channel 25,
            personal radio.

         Q. During the time that you were in the Control Roo m up to the
            moment that Gate C was opened and caused you to shout out,
            had you been expecting that gate to open? - A. Certainly
            not.

         Q. When you observed what was shown on the television screen,
            was it a matter of surprise to you? - A. Yes.

         Q. Did you shout it out? - A. Yes.

         Q. However,   did you make any specific communication to Snig Hill
\

                                     83
                                                 T. BICHARD


        or to anybody to the effect that the gate had been forced
        open? - A. Not to my recollection, again it will be in the
        transcript.

      Q. Because it would appear somehow at Snig Hill they had got
         that impression.  Do you follow? - A. Yes, I understand that.

      Q. Do you know how that had come about? - A. I have no idea at
         all sir.

      Q. Are you aware of any specific message having been relayed
         to them to that effect? - A. Not via VHF.

      Q. You have been referred by Mr. Kallipetis to the transcript
         which is marked 13.19.17, which I think is a transcript of
         Police Constable Rook's radio transmissions and you were
         looking at page 9 of that.  Have you got it in front of you? -
         A.Was it a telephone conversation this one sir?

      Q. Well is it telephone or radio? - A. Again I would have thought
         that it would be telephone.

      Q. Whatever it was on page 9, you see at 15.08 an observation
         there:  "I understand and one of the gates has, they've
         collapsed the gates and there's."  - A. Yes.

      Q. Do you to this day know how that came to be understood by
         Mr. Rook? - A. No idea at all.  It is the first I am aware
         of it.

      Q. May I ask you about the television monitors that the Police
         have.  They can be viewed, can they, in the Club's Control
         Room? - A. Yes, that is right.

      Q. And the Club can watch whichever video it wants to? - A. Yes,
         it can select one of the five.

      Q. It is not restricted to the ones you happen to be recording?
         - A. No, they select which one they want to view.

      Q. They have got no control over the direction of the cameras?
         - A. No.

      Q. But they can call upon you to direct the cameras, can they?
         - A. They can do and I have on occasions done that, yes.

      Q. And if you are able to you will do? - A. Yes.

               MR. WOODWARD:     Thank you.


                           Re-Examined by MR. C O L L I N S :

      Q. Just one thing.    It is probably my fault and I did not quite
         understand you.
                                      T. BICHARD


      When you were being asked who Alf was you said it had
occurred to you that that might be picking up background
chat? - A. Yes.

Background chat where? - A. In Operations Room.   My thoughts
were brought to that because I remember when I was using the
VHF radio that day and I was speaking to Operations Room, I
can remember hearing Channel 25 in Operations Room in the
background and again that is why I am aware that they were
monitoring Channel 25.

If one just looks at page 8 of that first transcript you were
looking at, not the second? - A. Yes sir.

I just want to test that because I don't think it is very
likely, that is all.  Have you got page 8? - A. Yes sir.

There is a reference at 19 minutes 4 secs, to telephone call
to ground control.  "I don't know whether we need any yet.
No, I am ringing ground control.” Do you see that? - A. Yes.

That comes from Snig Hill, as I understand it, being on the
left-hand side.  Then on the right-hand side we have your
Ground Control:  "Ground Control P.C. Ryan"? - A. Yes.

And then:  "Yes, its Alf, do you want any ambulances?"      That
is clearly someone called Alf speaking to Ground Control,
isn't it? - A. Again it was just an offer.      I have no idea.
I don't fully understand  the system that o p e r a t e s .

      MR. COLLINS:    All right.     Thank you.    That is all I
wish to ask.

       THE WITNESS:   Would I be open just to make one comment,
sir?

       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Yes.

      THE WITNESS:  In relation to the ambulances.  I intially
directed ambulances to Leppings Lane and then decided through
experience of watching what happened at Kings Cross in London,
that they should not amass in one place, for obvious reasons
so that they can leave the area.

      I am quite happy that the Senior Ambulance Officer
should have attended that Police Control as did the Senior
Fire Officer.  A suggestion that everybody should have gone
to another place I feel is out of context.

      MR. COLLINS:   Do you remember what the Senior Fire
Officer was told when he did attend? - A. He came in and
he offered us communications with his Fire Officers. He
said:   "I have got my radio" and he was asking who was in
charge.

Effectively he was told he was not wanted, wasn't he? - A.
                                   T. BICHARD



I have no idea of what anybody said to him.  I can remember
what he said though and he was offering his services to us.

They did not appear to be very welcome? - A. Again I have no
idea of what perception he took of the scene that was in
there.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Thank you.

      MR. COLLINS:  Sir, I propose now to finish off the
three St. John's Ambulance people who have been waiting
very patiently all morning, since they are volunteers and
one at least, I know, has been on night duty.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Very well.

But you could not see w h e t h e r or n o t they w e r e v e r y full?
- A. Not really.               We saw p e o p l e j u m p i n g over the b a r r i e r s
to get into the side ones.                  I just b e l i e v e d they wer e
pe o p l e m o v i n g a r o u n d the ground, not a c t u a l l y g e t t i n g

In your e x p e r i e n c e is it r e l a t i v e l y c o m m o n then for

Not.  An y w a y you, I think, r e m a i n e d at y our post and

ag ai n s t the fence b a s i c a l l y s h o u t i n g to get them out.

C ould you    see a n y t h i n g    looking in as to the e m o t i o n s of
the people in that pen?              - A. Yes. P i c t u r e s of fear really.
Onl y w a y I can d e s c r i b e    it.

Was Gate 4 open w h e n you b egan to w a l k across,        can you
r e member? - A. No, not w h e n w e b e g a n to w a l k across, no.

Di d   it open     at some stage? - A.            It did, yes.

Can you r e m e m b e r w h o op e n e d it? - A. I think it was the
Po l i c e m a n that was on dut y b e h i n d the goal there, to let
pe o p l e out.

A n d w h e r e ha d you r e a c h e d w h e n that h a p p e n e d ? Ha d you
r e a c h e d the gate or .... - A. Yes, w e h a d r e a c h e d the
gate, yes.

I see.   Di d you h e a r an y o n e sa y a n y t h i n g to the O f f i c e r
before he o p e n e d the gate? - A. Cannot r e c o l l e c t a n y b o d y
saying a n y t h i n g to him.

W h e n he o p e n e d the gate did p e o p l e come out            from the pen?
- A. Several people, yes.          Yes.

W h e r e did   they go? - A.        B e h i n d the goal and spread           out

                                                                       J.E. TOWLER

     along    towards    the co r n e r w h e r e w e h a d s t a r t e d off from.

Q.   C o u l d you see w h e t h e r or not they w e r e in d i s tress w h e n
     they came out? - A. Yes.            We s t a r t e d g i v i n g first aid
     st ra ig htaway, yes.

Q.   B e c a u s e they w e r e b r e a t h l e s s ? - A. Q u i t e a few of them
     were, yes, a n d there w a s one that I thought h a d got a
     b r o k e n ankle.

Q.   Di d a n y of those coining out go dow n towards     the side
     pe n gate, gate 6 or .... - A. Yes, they        all came dow n
     towards the co r n e r flag.

Q.   To wards the co r n e r flag?        - A. Yes.

Q. Was that of their own v o l i t i o n or wa s that b e c a u s e the
   Police w e r e u s h e r i n g them? - A. I think they w e r e g u i d e d
   that way.

Q.   By the Police?       - A.   I think so,yes.

Q.   L e a v i n g those w h o w e r e not able to get there for you             to
     a t t e n d on the side of the grass area?        Is that the
     pi cture? - A. Yes.

Q.   On ce the gate ha d b e e n open did it r e m a i n open? - A. I
     do not think so.    I t hink they c l o s e d it fairly q u i c k l y
     afterwards.

Q. Yes.       Now,   y o u h a d seen the state of a f f a i r s     in the pen?
   - A.      Yes.

Q. Di d you react w h e n the gate cl osed? - A. I m u s t be honest.
   I d i d not see it c lose b e c a u s e I h a d s t a r t e d d e a l i n g w i t h
   ca su a l t i e s by that time.        I w o u l d think it m u s t hav e
   cl o s e d m o r e or less s t r a i g h t a w a y w i t h the n u m b e r s that
   w e r e on the field.

Q. Yo u mean, the n u m b e r s - there w e r e no t a n y e xtra n u m b e r s
   initi ally? - A. That is right.         P e r h a p s two dozen.

Q.    I see.        But w e r e you aware the gat e w a s ope n some time
     a ft er that again?           We k n o w it d i d o p e n again. - A. Yes.
     I think the m a t c h ha d s t a r t e d by this time a l t h o u g h I
     n e v e r saw a n y t h i n g of the match.       You c o u l d h e a r the
     n o i s e w h i l e we w e r e treating people.          The n all of a
     su d d e n people se e m e d to be all r o u n d us.

Q.   I see.       So w h e n you say the gate shut that is an a s s u m p t i o n
     on yo ur part b e c a u s e of the lack of bodies, as it w ere?
     - A. That is right.                If it h a d not hav e c l o s e d I w o u l d
     h av e e x p e c t e d pe o p l e c o n t i n u i n g to come out.

Q.   Yes.     But at a later stage,         a n d you cannot put,       as   I

Q. Mr. Towler, it w o u l d be at about                     2.55 w h e n yo u looked up

Q.Across      the terrace and saw pe ople?                    -A.   About   that   time,   yes.

Q.   So you tend to go off duty to                Lea gue m a t c h e s but on duty
     on a big o c c as io n? A. On a                big occasion, yes.

Q.   On this p a r t i c u l a r occasion, w h i c h was your post? A. I
     was in the corner b e t w e e n the Wes t Stand and the South
     Stand.

Q. W h i c h w o u l d be r o u g h l y by Gate    1 in the    terracing,    is
   that      right?       A. Yes.

Q.   Did you notice, b e t w e e n about h a l f - p a s t - t w o an d twenty-
     to-three,        h o w the terraces se em e d to be fill ing up
     or not filling up?           A.     Yes, I k n e w w h i c h end to_
     a ll o c a t e it to the L i v e rp oo l fans, and it wa s obv iou s
     that there was some delay in them ge t t i n g in the gr ou nd
     b e ca us e there wa s quite a bit of r o o m e s p e c i a l l y in the
     side w i n g s and also in the N o r t h Stand.

Q.    At about 10 to 3, did you hear s o m e t h i n g over your
     radio, your St. Joh n's radio? A.            Just be f o r e 3 o'clock,
     yes, I ha d the ra dio w i t h me and there was a m e s s a g e
     that came over w h i c h said that there was some d i s c u s s i o n
     taking place r e g a r d i n g de la y i n g the start of the match.

Q.   That, no doubt, did not surpr ise you, h a v i n g r e g a r d to
     wh a t you ha d seen?           A. No, I tur ned r ou nd an d told two
     Li v e r p o o l sup po rt er s b e h i n d me that they we r e g o i n g to
     have a bit longer to wa i t to see the match.

Q. An d was that the m e s s a g e that was sent out by M r . Wel ls?
   A.   I've no idea.    I just h e a r d this vo ice on the radio.

Q. At about this stage,           we r e you aware of h o w the two central
   pens se em ed to be?           A.    They see med quite full, yes.

Q.   You say "quite full"?   A. Well, they w e r e                fuller than
     the side wings.  They see med to be n e a r i n g            capacity.

Q.   You thought they we r e at ca pac ity ?      A. N e a r i n g capacity.
     W h e n you stood look ing fr om the side, there we r e all
     peo ple in b e t w e e n in Pen 1, but it lo ok ed a lot fuller
     than the one b e h i n d me.    In the one b e h i n d me, there
     we r e five or six steps spare, you know, in the corner.

Q. As far as you c ou ld see, we r e the fans at this stage all
   sta yin g in the pens in w h i c h they ha d start ed? A. No.
   Some fans we r e cli mi ng out of Pen 3 into the pe n at the
   s i d e ; is it Pen 2?

Q.   1 and 2, yes.     A. They we r e cl im bi ng into Pen 2, and
     I kept an eye on them b e ca us e I was c o n c e r n e d that they would
     c atc h their trous ers on top of the spikes and fall and
     hurt themselves.     In fact, some we r e b ei ng li ft ed up
     at this time into the Wes t Stand up a b o v e .

Q.   You w o u l d obs er ve this be c a u s e c e r t a i n l y the ones cl im bi ng

            h a i r and a p on y tail?    A.    Well, it was taken up like
            a pony tail at the back, yes.

       Q. W h e r e was the ne x t p o l i c e m a n a lo ng that yo u cou ld spot?
          Was there, for example, a p o l i c e m a n at Ga te 3?           A. The
          ne x t po liceman, as I can recollect, if yo u look at the
          b ac k of the goal area, was at Pen 3 at the gate;                  an d
          if you look do w n the So uth Stand, I can't re me m b e r
          seeing one.

       Q.   I see.         A.     There w e r e some of fi c e r s that came b e h i n d
            into the S ou th Stand.            There ha d be e n some peo ple
            cli mb i ng over from Pen 1 into the South Stand, and some
            po lic e o f f i c e rs mu st hav e bee n told to come and they
            w e r e s t an d i n g right un der the con tr ol bo x in the So ut h
            Stand.

       Q. Di d you have a s s i s t a n c e w i t h you        in the for m of two
          ladies?       A. No, there we r e mo r e             than two ladies in
          that c o r n e r .

       Q. Yes, I know, but we r e there in p a r t i c u l a r ---   A.  Two
          ladies came, yes.        T he y ha d be e n to the toil ets and they
          w e r e coming b a c k from b e h i n d the goal area, com ing ba c k
          to our corner.

       Q. Are they two of your St.                Joh n's   am b u l a n c e   p er so nn el ?

       Q. W h e n they re turned, did they say s o m et hi ng to you?
          A.     Yes, they did.   They said that they h a d just come

          a big pu s h an d all the peo ple w e r e sc r e a m i n g at the

           L O R D J U S T I C E TAYLOR:    I am sorry, they h a d come
     backalong the front of the terrace, ha d t h e y ?              A. Yes,
     they  w e r e w a l k i n g on the p i t c h side of the p e r i m e t e r
     fencing.

q.           Mr. COLLINS:       Can yo u r e m e m b e r r o ug hl y w h a t time
     it was that they got bac k to you?                A.    It m u s t have
     be e n just be f o r e kick-off.

Q. H a v i n g h e a r d them say this, did you look up? A.                      Yes,
   I looked up and looked to b e h i n d the goal area.

Q.   W ha t did you n o t i c e ?   A. At this time there w a s a few

Q.   Did the p o l i c e w o m a n app ear to no ti c e them ar ri vi ng ?
     A.      Yes.    The y we r e coming to the corner.              Some wer e
     just a little bit out of breath.                       They could see that
     we we r e f i r s t - a i d er s and a p p r o a c h e d us.  Some of them
     sat dow n and st a r t e d to look at the pitch.                 The p o l i c e ­
     w o m a n h a d op e n e d the gate into P e n l and there was
     still p l e n t y of room.         She was as ki ng them to go ba ck
     into Pen 1, some of them.

Q.   Did you de cide at this stage to g o a n d see w h a t was
     h a p p e n i n g for yo u r se lf ? A. At this stage, yo u know,
     you lose track of time, but it was a short p e r i o d of
     m a y b e 30 or 40 seconds and I was w a t c h i n g wh a t was goi ng

     Lth ere was still too m u c h a c t i v i t y at the ba c k of the

                                                        P. M. SAXTON

Q. A n d w h a t did you n o t i c e as you a p p r o a c h e d ?     A. I wer e
   just as tonished.            I just co ul dn' t be l i e v e my eyes.
   Th er e w er e pe o p l e c r u s h e d a g ai ns t the front fence,
   r e a l l y tight, tighly packed;                some we r e screaming;
   some w er e a l r e a d y u n c o ns cio us; some we r e co nsc iou s
   but not saying a word, just feel ing their eyes and
   their       faces.       One p a r t i c u l a r m a n took m y immed iat e
   attention.            He was tr ap pe d at the fence w i t h his face
   in a d o w n w a r d p o s i t i o n and in a ve ry pale blue state.
   I i m m e d i a t e l y thought, "Well, the ma n's dying", but it
   w e r e ha r d to sink in;           you just thought, "My God, he's
   dy in g. "      So I put my han ds t hr ou gh the fence and tried
   to p u s h the cr ow d b a c k w i t h one of them and then push
   his h e a d b a c k w i t h the other so as to try and get an
   airway.         I th ought if I could at least op e n his airway,
   I m a y at least have a chance of g e tt in g some air into
   him.       I p u s h e d and p u s h e d and p u s h e d his he a d b a c k but
   I just c o u ld n' t m o v e him, his h e a d was that tight aga in st
   the f e n c e .

Q.   Tell me, at this stage as you app roa ch ed , can yo u he lp
     us as to w h e t h e r Pen 3 gate was op en or shut?           A. I
     w a s n ' t loo ki ng at the gate. I was mor e c o n c e r n e d about
     the m a n in front of me.

Q.   I fo ll ow that, but be f or e your a t t e n t i o n wa s dr aw n to
     the man, did you n o t i c e the state of the gate?               A. No,
     I w a s n ' t looking. I di dn't no ti c e at all.           Once I had
     seen w h a t was at the fence, I just w a n t e d to hel p that man.
     A f t e r that, I r e m e m b e r s t a ndi ng up, and there was some
     pol ic e o f f i ce r doing the same, and we w e r e sh ou ti ng to
     get back.        I was saying, "Please mo v e back, pl ea s e mo ve
     back, there's peo ple dying here. Mo v e ba ck ."                Everybody
     w as sh ou tin g in a heap.           They we r e sh ou ti ng back, "We
     can 't. "      In a nor mal football m a t c h they surge for wa rd
     and then they drop back, but for some r e a s o n they w e r e n ' t
     d ro p p i n g back.

Q.   I am sorry to ha rp on the gate, Mr. Saxton.            It o b v i o u s l y
     was not i m po rt an t to you;   it is, as yo u p r o b a b l y
     a ppr eci at e, impor tan t to us.  Can you h e l p ---       A. I
     didn't n o t i c e the gate.

Q.   Did you n o t i c e   the gate at any stage?          A.   Yes,   I did
     later.

Q. W h a t did you no t i c e later?           A. Well, this is p r o b a b l y
   two or three m i n u t e s later and the gate was open.                  Wha t
   h a d happe ne d, in m y view, is that as the gate ha d be e n
   o p e n e d and w i t h the p r e s s u r e of people behind, they ha d
   all just c o l l a p s e d in a heap.         There w e r e about four or
   five peo pl e in a heap, and there was one m a n w h o was
   tr ap p e d w i t h his legs and his bo d y laid out on to the
   pitch.        Pol ice O f fi c e r s we re trying to pu s h the fans
   b a c k so as to re li e v e this m a n and get h i m out, so they
   c ou ld get e v e r y b o d y else out of the n a r r o w doorway, and

       there was      that m u c h pressure.

 Q.    I am g oi ng t o t a k e this fairly quickly, Mr. Saxton.          I
       thin k yo u d e c i d e d that since you c ou ld not do m u c h in
       the front, you w o u l d try to see wh a t     you co uld do from
       inside the pen?          A. Yes, I did.

Q.     Did y o u go r o un d    thr oug h Pen 2?            A.     No.

Q.     Or did you go t h r o u g h the gate?                A. No.

Q.     H o w did you get       into the pen?           A.    Cl i m b e d over.

Q.     You c l i m b e d over the p e r i m e t e r fence? A. Yes.        People
      w e r e c l i m b i n g out on to the p i t c h and I cl i m b e d the ot her
      way.

Q. W h e n you got into the pen, I think yo u tried to he l p as
   best yo u could a n u m b e r of people w h o we r e dying or, as
   sadly tu rn ed out, dead?       A.  Yes.

Q.     I think you r e a l i s e d after a time that the s i t u a t i o n re al l y
      w a s _such in the pen that you we r e not able to give m u c h
      a s s i s t a n c e - is that right?               A.      I tried to r e s u s c i t a t e
      and rev iv e three people.                 One of them, to this day I am
      still not sure w h e t h e r I did rev ive h i m or not b e ca us e
      of the c o m m o t i o n that was go ing on.                     He did re act w h e n I
      was g i vi n g m o u t h - t o - m o u t h r e s u s c i t a t i o n an d he v o m i t e d
      back, but w h e n I turned h i m into the r e c o v e r y p o s i t i o n
      the n o i s e was so great that I co ul dn 't he ar h i m br eat hin g,
      if he w a s b r e a t h i n g shallow, and you ha d to m a k e the
      d e c i s i o n that y o u had g i v e n h i m a cha nce for life and
      you ha d to mo v e on be ca us e there c ou ld be s o m e b o d y b e h i n d
      you that m a y n e e d your hel p and you co ul d save them;
      seconds are vital.

Q. Mr. Saxton, you m u s t have bee n at some ris k y o u r s e l f as
   you  c l i m b e d into that pen? A. Well, I did n't think of
   that  w h e n I c l i m b e d in.

Q.    I think e v e n t u a l l y you did m a n a g e       to get       some one out at
      the back, did yo u not?          A.   No.

Q.    Up at    the top of      the terrace?           A.     No.

Q.    Did you not? I m u s t have m i s r e a d      your statement.  A.   I
      think you are tal ki ng about a m a n          that I got out at the
      front w h o was in a s e v e r el y s h oc ke d state.

Q.    That was at the front, was it?            A. Yes, and I told the m
      to put h i m down on the floor and I r e a s s u r e d h i m and then

    Q. Don't you as a matter of course just tell      the Superintendent
       in the Control.Box that you are coming up      to full capacity?
       - A. Yes, it has been known, yes sir, but      apart from such
       as all ticket matches on semi-finals then      it is not very
       often that we do get this.

    Q. Do I understand from this, then, that you have not been
       given specific instructions to tell the Superintendent that
       you are coming up to full capacity? - A. It is done as an
       automatic thing sir.

    Q. When it is done at all? - A. When it is done, yes, but as I
       say on normal matches it is not very often that happens and
       I do inform them, but on the semi-final on this occasion we
       knew that every Department would get to within capacity because
       we knew that every ticket had been sold for each area.

    Q. Well how there we are, Penistone Road very nearly full, hardly
       anybody outside? - A. Yes.

    Q. Then you looked,   did you, at Leppings Lane? - A. I did sir.

    Q. Now before we go into the figures in Leppings Lane, had you
       seen any indication that people were jumping over the turn­
       stiles, in other words had the check numbers come up on the
       Leppings Lane turnstiles? - A. No, the pulsating had not
       started on Leppings Lane at that stage.

    Q. That is a different matter.  I am asking you now about the
       check numbers where you told us that a red cursor appears
       if somebody leaps over a turnstile and does not go through
       the turnstile.  That is right, isn't it? - A. Yes.

    Q. Now what I want your help on is whether this check number
       or any of these check numbers appeared against any of the
       Leppings Lane turnstiles? - A. I do know we had several
       during the match but to be specific whether any had happened
       on Leppings Lane I could not be 100% certain on that, but I
       do know there were checks made with someone coming over the
       turnstile.

    Q. You see, Mr. Guest, there seems to be plenty of evidence
       that people were going through the turnstiles without the
       turnstile itself operating? - A. That is a possibility, sir,
       but I would not like to say exactly how many came through
       or jumped over.  There was a number, and if I could go a
       little step further from that, at the end of the match or
       on this particular day, the computer then adds a prin t­
       out and on that print-out it will show the checks that are
       made and where these people have jumped over the turnstiles.

    Q. But the point is that that information comes up to you first
       of all there in the Club Control Room, doesn't it? - A. It
       does, yes.

       Q. And where you see evidence of people getting through the
          turnstile without the turnstile operating, what do you do
          about it? - A. I 'phone Control again or if Mr. Lock is
          with me in the Control Room I explain:   "Look, we have had
          a jumper on say Gate 44" whatever it m ay be, and he will either
          go round himself and try and find if there is anyone
          jumping over turnstiles or what the problem has been at
          that turnstile.

       Q. Did you do that on this day in relation to Leppings Lane?
          - A. I did mention it to someone that was in Control at
          the time.

       Q. To someone in the Control Room? - A. Yes,     in our room, yes.

       Q. Did you tell the Police Control Box? - A. I didn't sir, no.

       Q. Why not? - A. Because usually that is a matter for the Club
          to sort out, not the Police.

       Q. That is a matter for the Club, is it, if people jump over
          the turnstile? — A. Yes.   If I can just explain a little bit
          further on to that.   As a public relations thing we have
          seen in the past where moihave been bringing their children
          to the ground and they have actually carried them over the
          turnstile and that will sometimes operate this check point
          and if it was a public relations thing then obviously there
          is no action taken in that matter.

       Q. You see we have actually got the print-out of these p a r t ­
          icular check numbers.  This is in the Sheffield Wednesday
          bundle of documents, a black bundle and it is at page 167
          and 166.  The North Stand, do you see, page  166, page nos.
          1-8.  There are a total of 8 on those particular turnstiles.
          Is that right? — A. The West Stand has 4; Leppings Lane has
          1.

       Q. Go to the previous page? - A. Yes, on the North Stand there
          is 8.

       Q. And then if we go to the next page again we     find Leppings
          Lane A-G only one? - A. That is correct.

       Q. And the West Stand,   9-16, a total of 4? - A. That is
          correct.

       Q. That is all there seems to have been on this particular day?
          - A. Yes, on the next page on 168 it shows a total yes sir
          of 15.

       Q. The check total altogether was only 15 including two in the
          Spion Kop? - A. Yes.

        Q. That is how it appeared to you? - A. Yes.

        Q. Were those figures anything for you to be concerned about?
           - A. On a semi-final day, no sir.

        Q. That is the sort of figures you would expect, is it? - A.
           We can even get that figure, sir, on a normal match day.

        Q. Were you satisfied that all the check mechanisms were
           working? - A. Well I don't do a physical check, sir, that
           is obviously left with Mr. Holdsworth who was the engineer
           for the Club.

        Q. So you are just assuming that the check mechanism does work?
           - A. Yes sir.  I can only just say on previous matches, the
           build-up to the semi-final, there is a double check made
           in respect of attendances at the football ground.  There
           is the normal turnstile click which is a mechanical operation
           and there is the electronic one which is used on the computer
           and I do know on the previous matches that one figure has
           been in correspondence with the other and they have been
           found to be correct.

        Q.l All right, now 20-to-3.   You have told us about Penistone
           i Road end and the Spion Kop.  W hat was your computer showing
             so far as Leppings Lane was concerned? - A. I can't remember
             the exact figure but I have reason to believe it was some­
             thing in the region of about 7,0 00.

        Q. Were you getting any pulsations on the figures for the
           Leppings Lane end? - A. No sir.

        Q. I have your statement here which says:  "The figures for
           the West Stand were pulsating and showing near to capacity"?
           - A. You just said "Leppings Lane" sir.

        Q. Leppings Lane end? - A. You said Leppings Lane.  There is
           two parts of that Stand, there is the Leppings Lane and
           the West Stand, you said Leppings Lane.

        Q. By "Leppings Lane" you mean the terraces? - A. Yes.

        Q. so the Leppings Lane West Stand was showing near to capacity?
           - A. Y e s , it was pulsating s i r .

           Did you look at the video monitor which shows the West Stand?
           - a . Not at that stage, no sir.
            q g jn —   .... ............................... .................... .................................................................. ....... .



        Q . W e i 1 when did you look at it? - A . It was l a t e r .

        Q.- How much later? - A. After looking at the situation on the
            Penistone Road end and inside the ground on to the Kop
            itself, then I changed to the camera whi ch covers the
            outside of Leppings Lane, the camera which is situated on
            the South Stand looking across towards the turnstiles.

                                        H. GUEST


QJi   Wha t did you see then? - A. I could see there was a large
      gathering of the crowd on the outside of the ground of the
      tu rn sti les .
1
Q.    Did you continue looking at this for some time? - A. I did
      look at it for quite a while, sir.  Exactly I would not like
      to say how long.

Q. Did you see that the crowd was increasing all the while? -
   A. It was sir.

Q. Then you say you find figures for the West Stand starting to
   pulsate? - A. Yes sir.

Q. Did it cross your mind that a number of those people out
   there mig ht be for the W e s t Stand? - A. No sir, it did not
   at that stage, although when it does intially start to
   pulsate, as I said on that particular day we did expect
   that there would be a crowd capacity so we knew all d epart­
   ments would start to pulsate and tell us that we were getting
   near to capacity at some stage during the afternoon.

Q.    What   about the terrace figures? - A. They were not flashing
      at all for Leppings Lane.

Q. What do you say the figures were for the terrace? - A. S o m e ­
   where in the region, this was approximately 20-to-3, quarter-
   to - 3 , which shows approximately 7,000.

Q. 7,000 people? - A. Yes.

Q. That is not far off the point when it is going to start to
   pulsate, is it? - A. Well it would certainly pulsate at
   about 8,500 because it actually holds above 10,000 in the
   Leppings Lane t e r r a c i n g .

Q. You could see w hat was outside the Leppings Lane end?      A.
      I could sir.

Q. You could see how many were supposed to be in there? - A. Yes,
   a p pro x i m a t e l y .

Q. Didn't these two matters appear to you not to fit together?
   - A. Well I estimated when I first looked at the crowd o u t ­
   side there was somewhere in the region of approximately 3,000.
   Obviously the W es t Stand was pulsating. It was not to
   capacity, but exactly wha t that figure was I would not like
   to say, but it was not near to capacity.   Leppings Lane
   was somewhere in the region of approximately 3,000 away
   from capacity which meant, in my opinion, that the people
   that were still wanting to get into the ground, there would
   be room and sufficient room for them to get in that part of
   the ground.

 Q.|Did you not tell the Police Control Box what you could observe
    from your computer screens? - A. Well no because they can
    only see the same monitor as I see from their Control Box.

                                           H. GUEST


Q. They can't see your computer screens? - A. Yes, I agree on
   that, but same as I say I did telephone them and explain
   to them exactly what ....  If they were asking or I was
   telling them in the Leppings Lane end we had X number of
    people in the ground and working on the capacities, we
   were not up to capacity at that stage.

Q. You did telephone them you say? - A. Yes.

Q.      And told them that? - A. Yes.

Q.      What time was this? - A. This was somewhere in the region of
        about 20-to-3 and at that stage, same as I say, we were
        approximately 3,000 short of capacity inLeppings Lane
        terraces alone, not including the We s t Stand.

        A n d as the next ten minutes or so progressed, did you keep
Q
    I   an eye on Leppings Lane? - A. Yes sir, I did keep an eye
        on Leppings Lane but also I changed the camera over to see
        v^hat was happening over on the North Stand and also back
        in the Spion Kop and in Fenistone k o a d .

Q. Well Penistone Road was not causing any trouble, was it? -
   A. No sir, it wasn't.

Q. Whereas Leppings Lane quite plainly was, wasn't it? - A. It
   was sir, yes.

Q. And as the next ten minutes went by, did you see the crowd
   on Leppings Lane getting greater? - A. I did sir, yes.

Q. Is that your impression that it was greater than it had been
   at 20-to? - A. Yes.

Q. A nd you then had more up-to-date figures presumably? - A.
   Yes.   Same as I say there is only a ma tter of a couple, two
   or three minutes later and it was probably showing just over
   7,000 then.

Q. Did you pass any messages about figures to the Control Box
   after 20-to-3? - A. Not that I can recollect.

Q. Why not? - A. Because it was at that situation where things
   were obviously getting out of hand when I heard the first
   commentary from Superintendent Marshall.

Q. I am sorry? - A. It was at that stage then when I first
   heard a commentary on the personal radio from Superintendent
   Marshall and I could see obviously at that stage things were
   getting out of hand at Leppings Lane.

Q.      Didn't you think that might be the time when your input could
        be valuable? - A. Yes, what I actually tried to do at that
        stage when I heard Superintendent Marshall asking for assistance
        at Leppings Lane, I tried to get through actually on my
        personal radio to the main Control Room, but there again

                                                   H. GUEST


               I was obviously blocking someone else who was already on the
               radio.  It was obvious I was not getting through to the
               Control Room, so I thought there m ay have been a possible
               fault on my radio, so I left the radio on a y desk and I
               tried to get through then on the internal telephone system
               to Control.  There again I found that each time I dialled
               the number for the Control Room it was blocked, it was
               engaged, so it was just impossible to get through under any
               circumstances because at that stage then when things were
               getting out of hand, Mr. Lock also left the Control Room
               to go and see to his Stewards.

          Q. Can you say what time it was that Mr. Lock left the Control
             Room? - A. I would imagine there again somewhere between
             20-minutes-to and q u a r t e r - t o - 3 . I could not be exact on
             the time.

          Q. Were you able to keep in contact with Mr. Lock? - A. No,           I
             wasn"t.

          Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: What were you going to say if you
               had got through? - A. To Mr. Lock, sir?

          Q. No, to the Control Room? - A. I was more or less going to
             duplicate what Mr. Marshall had already said by saying
             that he required further assistance at Leppings Lane and
             for them to organise some further Police Officers to go to
             Leppings Lane area.

          Q.         MR. PHILLIPS: Were you going to tell them about the
               numbers you had got on your computer screen? - A. Yes.

          Q. Had anybody asked you at any stage wha t your numbers were?
             - a . They said they had asked me earlier on, yes sir, about
             three or four times during the afternoon, somewhere between
             quarter-past-2 and 20-to-3.

          Q. But after 20-to-3/ and this is the period we are dealing with
             now, you say nobody asked you for any numbers? - A. No sir.

          Q. And you weren't able to get through? - A.        I was not able to
             get through at all sir.

          Q . iY o u could see perfectly well what was happening on the
              Iscreen, couldn't you? - A. Yes sir.

          0. And you could also overhear the radio traffic that was going
             on from outside the ground to the Control Box? - A. I could
             hear some of the messages.  I thought there was a problem
             on my personal radio and I was only sort of listening and
             hearing parts of messages.

          Q. Did you hear the requests for gates to be opened? - A.         I
             did sir.

          Q. Did you hear any requests for the kick-off to be delayed?
               - A. I heard part of a message,    something to do with kick-off,
\s
                                  1 15

                                            H. GUEST


          that was all I heard just "kick-off" and I presumed it was
          a delay for kick-off.

     Q. Can you say when you heard that? - A. I would think it would
        be in the region of 10-minute s-t o- 3, 5 -m inutes-to-3, something
        of that time, but I could not be exact there again.       Obviously
        I was not keeping an eye on my watch.

     Q. Did you know whether the teams were yet out on the pitch
        when that request was made? - A. No sir.     Where I work then
        I d o n ’t see the ground itself, the actual playing surface
        at all.

     Q. You c a n ’t tell what is happening on the pitch? - A. No sir.

     Q. Unless you happen to have one of the ground facing inward
        cameras pointing at it? - A. That is correct, sir.  If one
        of the cameras which have been controlled by the main Control
        Room, if they do happen to turn their cameras round and point
        them on to the pitch, then that is the only time I do see
        any football at all sir.

     Q. You could hear these requests.  Were you able to do anything
        about them yourself? - A. No sir.

     Q.   You would not expect to, would you? - A. No sir.

     Q.    You would expect them to go through to Control and for them
          to deal with them? - A. Yes sir, the persons who were in
          that position at the time, i.eS. in the Leppings Lane area,
          I expected them to be transmitting messages like Superintendent
          Marshall was in respect of requesting further assistance etc.

     Q.   Was your failure to get through to the Control R oo m due to
          any fault in the radio or just because there was so many
          people trying to talk at the same time? - A. I think it was
          probably so many people trying to get through on the radio
          at the same time and obviously it was just causing a blockage
          of messages, so I thought the best thing I can do in the
          position I am in, is to leave the radio alone.

     Q. Now the internal telephone line  you have got to the Control
        Room, does that go through the Club's switchboard? - A. I
        would not be exactly certain on that, sir, but I do have
        a list of numbers where I can dial to various areas of the
        ground, but more often than not I only use the main Control
        number, which is 145.

     Q. That is right, you have to dial a number, 145 to get to it.
        You don't have a direct line between yourself and the Control
        Box? - A. No.

     Q. Of course if you had had such a direct line you could have
        got through at any stage, couldn't you? - A. Of course sir,
        yes.
                                                H. GUEST


Q. Did it occur to you that since you were having such difficulty
   in getting through to the Control Box and yet you had some
   apparently useful information, you might leave your post and
   go round to the Control Box? - A. No, I wo uld not do that.

Q.   You would not do that? - A. No sir.

Q.    W hy not? - A. Because the valuable amount of equipment that
     is in that room.     There is a hell of a lot of valuable equ ip ­
     m ent in that room.

Q. Valuable equipment? - A. Yes sir, and I am instructed that
   I must stay in there at all times.

Q. That is your instruction? - A. That is m y instruction,                  yes.

Q. But of course it is equipment belonging to the Club,                   isn't it?
   - A. It is sir, yes.

Q.    And they have their own security staff in there with you? - A.
     Yes, but on that occasion Mr. Lock had  to go outside actually,
     or he left and so there was only me in the Control Room at
     that time.

Q.ftwhat about the other gentleman who was there before? - A.
   Well when Mr. Hold swo rth saw the s i t u a t i o n as it w a s d e v e l o p i n g
   b n L e p p i n g s Lan e he a lso left. Where he w e n t I d o n ' t know,
   mat" he Jrryt w a l k e d o u t T

Q. So that was leaving you alone in that room? - A. Leaving me
   alone in that room, yes.

Q. And you thought that was more important that you should stay
   there than try to get in touch wit h Mr. Murray? - A. Well yes
   because there was obviously messages being passed through
   to Mr. Murray.  I could hear broken messages through the
   radio so I knew they were receiving information.   The only
   thing that I could assist with was probably as you say was
   figures and at that stage vie were not up to capacity and
   that I would have thought was secondary compared to the
   seriousness as regards the injured persons or possible injuries
   that we could have received out on Leppings Lane.

                        Mr    . HYTNER:      He   said that        there was ?

               it not?

                        Mr.   HYTNER:       It is Mr.      B i c h a r d ---

               not   de aling w i t h it.

                      L OR D J U S T I C E TAYLOR: Because              it was       on the
               te lephone, Mr. G o d d a r d said.

                        Mr.   HYTNER:        I am sorry, m y          recollection         is wrong.

                          The WI TNESS: Sir,       the on ly thing I can say on that
               is that I do k n o w there wer e c o m m u n i c a t i o n s m a d e b e t w e e n

           LOR D J U S T I C E TAYLOR: I do not thi nk we hav e ha d

             Mr.   COLLINS:       That    is at 2.41.

             Mr.   HYTNER:      No,     it is just be f o r e       2 o'clock.

           Mr. COLLINS:         I do not recall a n y t h i n g b e i n g g i v e n

     not think we hav e a c t u a l l y ha d it in evidence.

             Mr.   HY TNER:     We wil l      try a n d     find it,     sir.

                       C r o s s - e x a m i n e d by Mr.   JACKSON:

Q. Mr. Guest, I h ave b een tr ying to w o r k on these figu re s
   for some time.   Are yo u the right m a n to ask?    A. Well,
   I can onl y supply yo u w i t h the figures.

Q.   Can we b e g i n w i t h the o b s e r v a t i o n tak en up by Mr. H y t n e r ?
     E v e r y b o d y else has to w o r k m u c h h a r d e r on s e m i - f i n a l day
     except yo u - am I right?            Yo ur task, b e c a u s e of the ti cket
                                                                     H. GUEST

a l l o c a t i o n an d the ticket e x p e c t a n c y a n d the like, m a k e s
the job of m o n i t o r i n g the crowds easier on s e m i - f i n a l day
than on oth er days?            A.  Tha t' s ne ga tive, that, sir.
It m akes it eve n m o r e work.

If that is right, y o u say, w h y is there any d i f f e r e n c e
b e t w e e n m a x i m u m a p p r o a c h i n g on a League game a n d m a x i m u m
a p p r o a c h i n g on to the final day?              A. Beca u s e of tickets.

Yes.     It   is easi er ?       A.     Provided everything            else ---

P r o v i d e d e v e r y t h i n g else is as it is on a League game,
you r task on that aspect is eas ie r?                 A. It de pends on
the m a t c h itself, sir. If y o u get a large m a t c h and you
are e x p e c t i n g a large crowd, y o u are then e x p e c t i n g the
num b e r that y o u are e x p e c t i n g on a semi -f in al , w h i c h is
v i r t u a l l y k n o w n to a c e r t a i n extent; it's the u n k n o w n
that        y o u don't k n o w abo ut on a m a t c h that isn't a ti cket
match.

Indeed, it is the u n k n o w n e l e ment?            A.   The u n k n o w n q u a n t i t y
that's right, sir.

If yo u look at page 168 of the Cl ub's bundle, y o u w i l l find
that s o m e w h e r e in the order of 49 , 0 0 0 people o n l y u s e d
tickets on that day?            A.  Tha t' s c o r r e c t sir, but, h a v i n g
said that, as I said earl i e r on, the c r o w d c a p a c i t y for
t h e g r o u n d is 57,0 00 or 54,000, but I am not sure ---

Mr.    Guest,   first of all,         onl y 49 , 0 0 0 pe o p l e u s e d   ticke ts ?
A.     That's   correct, sir.

Not only that, the Spi on Kop, the su bject of no p r o b l e m
at all, was u n d e r - u s e d to some 5 per cent? A. Yes, there
was 19,90 0 an d something.

Ju st let's take it very, v e r y slowly, Mr. Guest.         Un l e s s
we hea r of mor e than 5,000 people g o i n g thro u g h w i t h o u t
usi ng tickets, there do not app e a r to be too m a n y pe o p l e
there that day w i t h o u t ticke ts ?   A.  Well, e a c h s e c t i o n
dete rm in es , do esn't it, in resp e c t of ---

Fo rget about sec ti on s for the mom en t, Mr. Guest.            Y o u see,
we are g o i n g to hea r of p o s s i b l y 3,000, 3,5 00 or 4,000
pe ople w h o w e n t thro u g h the ga tes w h e n they w e r e opened,
A, B an d C?        A.  Yes.

I do not thi nk          an yone has s u g g e s t e d m o r e than 4,0 00
people.          The two figures t o g ether m e a n s that people
a t t e n d i n g that game that day onl y came to about 52, 00 0
or 53 ,000 peo pl e?          A.  H o w can y o u be so s p e cific on
that n u m b e r w h e n all that c r o w d w ent      in w i t h o u t a c t u a l l y —

Mr. Guest, I did        not count them.   We wil l hea r e s t i m a t e s
from h u n d r e s of people w h o did. A. V e r y good, sir.
                                                                    H. GUEST

It does not see m as though anyone is j u s t i f i e d in sayin g
that a m a j o r ca use of this incid ne t was a large n u m b e r
of people w i t h o u t tickets, does it?    It seems that we
can get rid of that.        There m a y be 200 or 300, but the
thought of there bei ng tho us an ds is not s u p p o r t e d by
any evi d e n c e ?     A.  Yes.

So we can go to a dif f e r e n t aspect.                At 20 to 3, yo u
r e a l i s e d that there was a pr oblem?               A.  Yes, sir.

Mr. M a r s h a l l is ask i n g for som e t h i n g t e r r i b l y unusu al ,
i.e., the gates to be opene d?               A.     Yes, sir.

Yo u can see of ficers           b eing p u s h e d on their h o r s e s ?        A.   Yes
sir .

An d y o u saw the crowd outside L e p pings                Lane?        A.   Yes,
sir.

I m a y h ave m i s h e a r d you, but did y o u tell us that w h e n
y o u saw the Le ppings Lane c rowd and y o u saw the figures

a c c o m m o d a t e d in the gr ound? A. Tha t w o u l d be at
a p p r o x i m a t e l y 20 to 3.

Is that w h a t y o u told us?              A.   Yes,   sir.

Are y o u sure that is wha t yo u r e a l l y thoug ht ?   A. Oh
yes, sir, beca u s e look in g at the compu te r, it was
a p p r o x i m a t e l y 7,000 that it was showing, but it was
u nder 7,000.

I am not as k i n g yo u to r e m e m b e r w h e t h e r it was 7,000.
I am m e r e l y as k i n g yo u to say this:         U s i n g all the

that at 20 to 3 y o u tho ug ht that the g r o u n d c o u l d
a c c o m m o d a t e those peo pl e?   A.  Yes, sir.

W o u l d y o u look at you r       st atement,      ple as e?      A.   Yes,     sir.

I w o u l d like yo u to look at the b o t t o m of the                  second
page, five lines fro m the bottom, at 20 to 3:

          "It was        obvious that looki ng at the c r o w d fro m
          outs i d e     trying to get in that there w o u l d not
          be s u f f i c i e n t r o o m for all to be a c c o m m o d a t e d . "

A.      W h i c h page   is this,    sir?

The b o t t o m of   page 2, five lines fro m the bottom.        You
have     m a d e two st at ements.    One of the m is typ ed and
one is hand- w r i t t e n .    The typed one is d ated the 29t h
April, Mr. Guest.            A.   Yes, this is the one.
                                                                H. GUEST

Five lines from the bottom.               If it assi s t s you, I wil l
take y o u b a c k t h r o u g h the para gr ap h:   "I m ade a check
of the com p u t e r " -----        A. C ould I hav e a copy of that
s t a t e m e n t , sir?

It is you r s t a t e m e n t dated 29t h April, page 2. (Han de d
to the wi tness).         I wil l take yo u t h r o u g h the para gr ap h.
Y o u say:

        "I m a d e a c heck of the c o m p u t e r and saw that the
        figures for the W est Sta nd w e r e p u l s a t i n g and
        sh owing n e a r to c a p a c i t y and the L e p pings Lane

        w o u l d be n e a r to c a p a c i t y an d the c o m p u t e r w o u l d
        be at a p oint w h e n it w o u l d start pulsa ti ng .

That     is y our sta t e m e n t d ated 29t h April?             A.      Yes. I thi nk
the w o r d 'excess' there is a c t u a l l y wrong ;             I thi nk it
s hould be 'approximately.''

Mr. Guest, as I hav e          said before, I am not taking yo u
to task on the exa ct          figures.  You r n ext s e n tence says
this :

         "It was obvious that look in g at the c r o w d from
         ou tside try in g to get in, that there w o u l d n ° t i(
         be s u f f i c i e n t r oom for all to be accom m o d a t e d .

Now,   w h a t did that tell you, Mr. Gu e s t ?          A. As it says
here, to kee p w i t h i n limits of g r o u n d c a p a c i t y , (o b v i o u s l y
there w e r e mor e out si de in m y opinion, and that's onl y
m y estim at io n.

Mr. Guest,        that is wha t y o u said in y our statement.
H ow ev er , y o u hav e said som e t h i n g q u i t e d i f f e r e n t w h e n
I a s k e d y o u a bout it be f o r e I showed y o u y o u r stat em en t. ^
W h i c h is the c o r r e c t p o sition?    A. I thi nk there w o u l d n t
be suff i c i e n t r o o m for these peop le to e nter the ground.

 As I see it, y o u        are the m a n in charge of the c o m p u t e r
 an d y o u re alise that there is a p r o b l e m outside;                yo u
 think, r i g h t l y or wr ongly, that the people o u t s i d e _cannot
 be accom m o d a t e d .   W hat do yo u thi nk w o u l d h a p p e n if the
 gates w e r e open?        A.    This was l a t e r . At 20 to 3 w h e n
 I first e s t i m a t e d there w e r e a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3 ,000 outside,
 that c r o w d did b u i l d up to p o s s i b l y 5,000 at the time
 w h e n the gates w e r e opened.

 Mr. Guest, I w a n t to take it as s h o r t l y as I can but,
 in fairn es s to those I repr es en t, w o u l d yo u c o n s i d e r
 that an s w e r again?       R e a d as m u c h of you r sta t e m e n t as
 yo u like.     Yo u k n e w that there was g o i n g to be a c r u s h
 inside, did y o u not?           A.   There wa s g o i n g to be a c r u s h
 outside, due to the rema rk s that h a d b e e n m a d e by Mr.
 Marshall.
                                                             H. GUEST


N o b o d y is as k i n g y o u about the c rush outside.        Y o u we re
the only p e r s o n w h o h a d the c o m p u t e r fi gures in front of
you?        A. Yes, sir.

Yo u k n e w that there was g oing to be a c r u s h in side -
that was y o u r be lief?           A. Not r e a l l y because, as I say,
at 20 to 3 there was in m y o p i n i o n s u f f i c i e n t r o o m to
a c c o m m o d a t e the peo pl e that was outside.

Yes.      R e a d y our statement.         A. Can I just m a k e a co mment
on this, if yo u don't mind, sir?                    It was a p p r o x i m a t e l y
10 to 3 w h e n them gates was a c t u a l l y b r o k e n down, w h e n
I r e a l i s e d that the c o m p u t e r w o u l d be irre l e v a n t b e c a u s e
of the am o u n t of figures.

I beg you r pa rdon?           A. Well, w h e n the gate was o p e n e d
or w h a t e v e r an d the c rowd a c t u a l l y w e n t thro u g h the
gates, that mor e or less m a d e the c o m p u t e r irre l e v a n t
re a l l y in r e s p e c t of the act ua l people and numbers.

I am not a s k i n g y o u a n y t h i n g m o r e a b o u t c o m p u t e r figures.
I a m m e r e l y sayin g this:        Is it the p o s i t i o n that w h e n
the offi c e r w h o was m o n i t o r i n g the c r o w d took the v i e w
that the c r o w d outside c ould not be a c c o m m o d a t e d inside,
yo u p a s s e d no m e s s a g e ?   A. Tha t' s correct, sir, b e c a u s e
I couldn't.           As I said ea rlier on, the r adio wa s b r o k e n
down and I c o u l d n ' t tra ns mi t thro u g h the t e lephone
system, and m y p e r s o n a l rad io w e r e just b l o c k i n g e very
other m e s s a g e that w ere b eing passed.               T here was just
n o t h i n g I c o u l d do.     I was m o r e or less m a d e u s e l e s s , a s
y o u m i g h t say, really.           The re wer e just n o t h i n g I could
do there.

So we hav e got to the p o s i t i o n that the m a n in the co ntrol
ha d formed the v i e w that there was g o i n g to be a c r u s h
inside an d he was v i r t u a l l y useless b e c a u s e          the e q u i p m e n t
that        he was u sing was not up to the job?                   A. No, I
wouldn't- say that, sir.                 The e q u i p m e n t was  u s a b l e but
I could n ' t get t h r o u g h on it;         I c o u l d n ' t use it b e c a u s e
o b v i o u s l y s o m e b o d y else was u sing it an d no m a t t e r h o w
I tried, I just c o u l d n ' t get a m e s s a g e            through, so the
e q u i p m e n t was working, I w o u l d say, but ---

        L OR D J U S T I C E TAYLOR:  Mr. Guest, was the r e a s o n that
yo u did not 'phone thro u g h that yo u c o u l d not get through,
or was it becau se , as y o u said before, "I saw the c r o w d
increasing" - and this is at 20 m i n u t e s to 3 _ "I e s t i m a t e d
the c r o w d at 3,0 00 and I tho ug ht there was r o o m for them
to   get in"?          A.    Yes, at 20 to 3, sir, yes, a c c o r d i n g
to the c o m p u t e r figures at that time, but, as y o u say,
e very m i n u t e the c rowd is incr e a s i n g tr emendously.

         L ORD J U S T I C E TAYLOR:       Yes,    all   right.
                                                                    H. GUEST


           Mr. JACKS ON :       Mr. Guest, is it that- y o u hav e come
to that c o n c l u s i o n beca u s e y o u hav e h e a r d the e v i d e n c e
since, b e c a u s e you r s t a tement has bee n an a b s o l u t e
c o n t r a d i c t i o n of that?   A.    No, sir, that's m y fee li ng
of the situation.

So you r sta t e m e n t was wholl y, w h o l l y w r o n g ?       A. Same as
I said, there was b e t w e e n 3,0 00 and 5,000.                 X ca n't
e s t i m a t e exactly, sir, h o w m a n y there was outside, but
in m y o p i n i o n I thoug ht we c o u l d a c c o m m o d a t e the peo pl e
at 20 to 3.

So you r   sta t e m e n t   is w h o l l y wrong?

       L O R D J U S T I C E TAYLOR: Mr. Jackson , it is no t h e l p f u l
to put that w h e n there is a great long st atement.         You
are as k i n g a bout one matter.

        Mr.   JACKSON:         I am indeed,          sir.

        L ORD J U S T I C E TAYLOR:        T hen     w h y no t put that.

        Mr. JACKSON :      W h e n yo u say in you r s t a t e m e n t that
yo u th ought the g r o u n d c ould not a c c o m m o d a t e the people
outside, y o u w e r e w h o l l y wr o n g ? A.  Tha t' s correct, yes,
if y o u put it that w a y because, as I say, in m y o p i n i o n
there wer e 3,0 00 ou tside an d that was i n c r e a s i n g t r e m e n d o u s l y
by the m i n u t e .

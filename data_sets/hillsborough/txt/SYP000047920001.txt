Dear Captain Taylor



HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY



I enclose a copy of a letter which 1 have sent, by facsimile message,

to   Hi! Coroner,   South    Yorkshire   West District.       The   contents    are

self   explanatory,   I     believe,   and   I   will   telephone   you   at   your

office on Monday 3 September 19P0 at about 9 am.



Yours sincerely




Chief Constable

                                                             30 August 1990




Dear Doctor Popper

HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY


I write following our telephone conversation of 30 August 1990 during which
you requested that I delay sending my report and supporting evidence to the
Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police.

You are aware that my report and all supporting evidence has been sent to
the Director of Public Prosecutions and to the Police Complaints Authority.
You are also aware that the DPP has decided that there is insufficient
evidence to prosecute any person or organisation for any criminal offences,
and that the PCA has issued a statement certifying satisfaction with the
manner in which the investigation has been carried out.

What I must do next is submit my report and the supporting evidence to the
Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police so that he, or his Deputy Chief
Constable,  can consider whether any officer should face disciplinary
c har ges.

Of course, it is possible to delay any disciplinary action until any civil
proceedings, including the inquests, are concluded, but such a delay needs
careful consideration.    Possible effects on the proceedings, on force
discipline,  on the interests of complainants,     on the welfare of the
officers, and the general public interest, are just some of the issues
involved.
For the moment I have delayed sending my report and supporting evidence, to
South Yorkshire Police, but it would be helpful if you would write to me
setting out your reasons for seeking the delay.

I shall be seeking the advice of the PCA on Monday 3 September 1990 so an
early   reply from   you  would  be  appreciated,  perhaps  by  Facsimile
Transmission.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours sincerely




Chief Constable
Cumbria Constabulary

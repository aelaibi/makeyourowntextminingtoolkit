           I am a single person living at the above address on alternate weekends

           with my mother and father,    I live in London during the rest of the

           period of time, where




           When I'm at home I work on a Saturdayyfs a turnstile operator for

           Sheffield Wednesday Football C l u b ^ a / Hillsborough,   I have done this

           for a period of four seasons now.



                                                           was on duty as a turnstile



                                                                                             was

           posted to turnstile number
                                                                                                     PAGE
                                                                                                     SI 625

             had a brief lectufl from a Police Officer as to safety aspects,                          then

              I. took up my pgf%t at approximately 12 am             (1200).    It was gone       1 pm
                             ^
              (1300)   befqn# anyone came through my turnstile it was very slow u n t i 1

             2 pm (1400) then people came into the ground in a steady trickle,

             until 3 pm (1500) there was no build-up at my part the ground to get

              in .



             All the fans we re we 11 behaved/and pleasant comi ng into the ground,

              but at about 2.15 pm (1415)J® had one person push through my
                             -----------
            ' t u r n s t i l e without a tick§ff, I told the two Policeman stood inside                 my

             turnstile and p o i n t ^ ^ ^ p e r s o n out as he ran up the stairs         to the        top

             of the S Stand.         The lad was    in his early twenties, white,          five foot

             ten inches to five foot eleven inches,               brown hair,    th a t ’s all   I    can

             remember apart from he had jeans on possibly.                  Two Policemen went

             after him up onto the Stand,           but I saw t h j t h   come down again a short

             time a f t e r , but they had got anyone w^fh them.



     p       I also jnad a person offer me t e n f o u n d s      to coifie through niy turnstile

n c tj& r    this was about 2 pm (1400),        I   sfcaid he I   cannot do it, he asked me

             about three times,            % refjfeed.      The bloke opposite me on the other

             turnstile heard what tnis y(an was saying and told him to get                       lost and

             he w e n t .   This man waslaJwut twenty-one - twenty-two years of a g e ,

             white,    black hair as I     remember with an anorak hanging over his

             shoulde r s .



              I d o n ’t know why or what     caused me to do it, but I left my turnstile

             to go and have a look at what was going on as far as the match was

              concerned.         It was about 3 pm (1500) or one or two minutes after as

             they were still playing.          I saw no people on the pitch at this stage,

              but I saw people literally clambering over people’s heads in the
                                                                                                      PAGE         3
                                                                                                      SI 625

               Leppings L.IjK'Stand, I saw people being helped up into the seating part

               above >yffeopie attempting to climb over the fencing at the front,                       there

               w s r j f quite a few Police stood behind the goal,                 they seemed to

                 itially trying to keep people back and calm the situation down,                         I

               think there were some Police c 1 imbejdKonto the fence or stood on an

               advertisement board,             I saw the p o l i c e   pull one man over the fence,         but

               it seemed more the case t h e V w e r e           trying to get people to stay in.


                c* r T  O r* m £ z> A
               I saw the gate at the/front behind the goal                    into the Pens was open,

               but people d i d n ’t jj/eem to be coming out of it,                it was obvious the

               pens were too full,             there were quite a few Police around the gate who

               was saying stay in, but I think this                     was there section,   but the gate

               that was open was I think to pen two.



               Then I was asked to go back to my post by one of the ground security

               type of people and I returned to the turnstile.



               I was checked off the turnstile at about 3.10 (1510)                      to 3.15 pm

               (1515),    then I j s f e n l   back up in the Stand,        but this time I was in the

               top of the Jb Stand by the half way line and as I went to look I passed

               Jimmy Hl^L who looked very solomn and worried as if something

               serious was going on.



               The game had been stopped by this I remember seeing a fan climbing up

               the goal    post at the Leppings LN end and being pulled down by a

         killed,    people had died and     he was joined by a blonde haired

         Policewoman who I have seen at the ground before.            My Dad said    he had

         heard a gate had gone,     so we took the tickets to the office.           My Dad

         wanted to go home,     I wanted to see what the situation was.       I went back

         into the S Stand this time past the half-way line towards the Kop end,

         I realised people being stretchered away an ambulance going down the

         side of the pitch      and loads   of people on the pitch,    I stayed about a

         minute,    I decided   the game was going to be played and it was      a    serious       ,

         incident,    I went back and joined my Dad and left through a sliding

         door at the back of the Stand and away from the Ground towards the

         Penniston RD,    it was about 3.20 <1520)    to 3.30 pm (1530) at this s t a g e . ,■



         I saw a large number of ambulances going into the ground.            I went to

         the car with Dad and at this stage all the Forest fans were leaving

         the ground.

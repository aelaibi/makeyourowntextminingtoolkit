I have now seen Mr Pugh’s submission of 8 May and noted his recommendation. I
agree with both Alun Michael and Mike O’Brien’s comments, and believe that the
latter’s suggestion on an Inquiry to hear publicly any new evidence and comments on
it would be a politically sustainable approach.

I have taken the liberty of talking in confidence and informally to Peter Kilfoyle since
we have both been heavily lobbied by the families over several years. He agrees that
this option is a potential way forward.

He also informed me that Jimmy McGovern’s drama, together with the recent Airfield
fund-raising concert is to be screened at some point in the near future by Granada.
This would obviously be worth taking account of in terms of the timing and conduct
of any announcement as to your decision.

It is further worth noting that, as a result of the concert, the families probably have
several hundred thousand pounds available and might consider taking out a private
prosecution against South Yorkshire Police.

I cannot stress strongly enough the political sensitivities which exist locally on this
matter.

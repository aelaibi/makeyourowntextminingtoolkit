                              states:
1.    I was born on the 23rd November 1962.
2.    I am a qualified Ambulanceman.          I have been with SYMAS since
      October 1979.          I joined from school as a Cadet. I did two
      years training and qualified in October 1981.                 I did my
      Miller Course at Leicester and also a driving course.               For
      the last eight years I have been at Parkway Station on
      shifts just doing emergency and urgent work.
3.    On the Thursday and Friday I worked 1000 to 1800 hours.             On
      Saturday I was to work from 1400 hours to 2200 hours.
4.    I arrived at about 1330 hours. My ambulanceman was
                         We took an admission to the Northern General

      gymnasium entrance on Penistone Road.              Ne— further data-ils
      wore-given.
6.    As we went down Herries Road we put on the emergency mode
      and were escorted by a police bike.           It led us down to the
      roundabout at the bottom of Herries Road.                The bike then
      went straight on to Leppings Lane and at this point I saw a
      police -offioer on the roundabout.         We stopped and asked him         ■
      where the incident was.           He said it was at Leppings Lane/^
      We then continued to follow the police bike to the Leppings
      Lane entrance.         We arrived at about 152& eg 1530 hourct
7.     -i— cirtiTjr           Iepuiled In when we aii1Vbd .          We parked
       next to the fence^(-o o g plan) and saw that there were a lot

       of people around and some of them very upset.                There were
       also a few police/along the fence.  I noticed that there
                 Avo
       were aAso a couplo of bodiec laid in front of our vehicle
       against the fence.      There were two pther ambulances near

8.                    left the vehicle to assess the situation and I
       stayed with the vehicle to keep radio watch.          I didn't make
       any calls and I was still on Channel 2.        0w    call ia-Siorra
       209-r~
       After a few moments                 came back to the vehicle and
       said that he had seen at least ten dead but he did not say
       where.  He said that it was a, serious incident.   I radioed

                lS2i        ft      0)
       ControlAto say that there were at least ten dead at Leppings
       Lane.      They told us to change to ERC.           We received no
       further instructions.               then went back to look again.
10 .   I spoke to a policeman to ask what had happened and he did
       not give me any information.        The ERC reception was very bad
       and so we were not gaining any information from the radio.
       I decided to get out and see if there was anything I could
       do within the vicinity of the ambulance but I wanted to stay
       nearby in case the ambulance needed moving.
11.    The     two    ambulances    already present     appeared       to be
       unattended.       I had first contact with ambulanceman
                and he asked if we had a bag and mask on our vehicle.
       I then saw one large gate was open but there were so many




                                           tJ
             people around that I couldn't see anything clearly.                           A
             patient was brought over by two policemen and put on the
             floor. I examined him and found that he was blue but that he
             did have a pulse.     I got the patient's friend to do mouth to
             mouth resuscitation while I got the resuscitation equipment
             out of the ambulance.           After a few moments                        came
             back.     I asked him to get a suction unit to clear vomit from
             the patient.     I said that the patient had a good pulse and
             asked             if we should get going with him.                   He agreed.
             We then loaded the patient onto a cot and the police got
             into the ambulance as well.                               then took over the
             driving while I continued with the treatment.
12.          I have no idea what time it was by this stage.
             reversed out and we left along Leppings Lane onto Middlewood
             Road heading towards Hallamshire Hospital.                       From where we
             were this seemed to be the nearest hospital to go to.                        We
          had a police escort and it took about seven minutes. -When
          ojj       I^*3 S
         -we got— ttierw-we unloaded the patient.        told Charge
             Nurse Smith what he had seen.                  He said that we were the
             first vehicle to arrive from Hillsborough. ^                     ,

         Control told us tO/vge> back to Penisrono Road ontranee.                         We
             d±djndt   have a police escort on the way back down but the
             journey was okay. At the bottom of Netherthorpd Road the
             police had stopped the traffic.               We got back to the ground
             in about seven minutes.           We came along Penistone Road and




                                                   43
there were thousands of people on the road so we realised
the game had been abandoned.      We went through the first
entrance and were stopped by Trevor Dale from Parkway.      He
told us to back into the courtyard.        I asked him if he
wanted us at Leppings Lane but he said that             as bad
hese^end he wanted us here.
I then saw Station Officer Higgins who came up to us to ask
if we had any resuscitation equipment.        There were two
ambulances parked in the yard and he said there was a young
lad next to one of the ambulances who needed treatment.      I
went over and found that the lad was already being treated
by two civilians.       We loaded him onto the back of an
ambulance and the crew then left with the lad.     Once he had
gone we were able to back into the space left by the
ambulance.
The next thing I recall was a lad being carried to us on a
bill board. One of the people with him introduced himself as
a doctor. I looked at the lad and he was slightly blue. We
loaded him onto a cot and put him into our vehicle.     I gave
him oxygen.     There was no-one around that looked so serious
so we decided to put a couple of shaken people onto the
ambulance and then go.       We did not radio to say we were
going.   We were not picking anything up on the ERC except
for crackling.
We went to the Northern General Hospital/^    We had a police
cycle escort.     I do not know what route we took as   I was
tending the patient.
17.   We unloaded the patient.       There were already about four
      ambulances there unloading patients.     When we had unloaded
      the patient we radioed to say that we were clear^ This time*-'
      the reception was alright.    We asked whether they wanted us
      to go back to the ground again.      Control said that we were
      to go to Penlstone Road.
18.   We went down Herries Road and decided to take the same route
      as we had the first time which was to go via Leppings Lane
      to make sure that everything was alright.       David Jones was
      at Leppings Lane and he said that everything was clear and
      that we should now go around to Penistone Road.     When we got
      to Penistone Road we noticed that ambulances were queuing up
      and that things looked quite organised.          We were then
      directed to join the queue by Station Officer Eason.      There
      were about five ambulances in the queue.     The vehicles were
      being loaded with patients.       When it was our turn they
      brought a patient to us and a doctor climbed in as well.      I
      was told that the patient had pelvic and leg injuries.      We
      waited for a couple of minutes but no further patients were
      brought to us so we decided to take this patient.      I again
      did not use the radio.     We passed on the information about
      the Northern General and the Hallamshire to Station Officer
      Eason when we joined the queue of ambulances.
19.   It took us about seven minutes to get to the Hallamshire.
      We unloaded and then called Control to say that we were
      clear.   We were told to stand by at Netherthorpe Road.       I
      think it was now about 18.00 hours.      It took us about two




                                     496
      minutes to get to Netherthorpe Road.      There were already
      three other ambulances there.    At about 18.30 hours we were
      told to return to the station.     We were not told to go to
      Herries Road Bus Depot.   We asked them if they wanted us to
      take any information to the Bus Depot and they said that
      they did not.   We returned to the station for 17^50 hours
      We tidied the vehicle and finished our shift at 22^00 hours.
20.   I knew about the Major Incident Plan but I did not know
      anything about a Hillsborough Plan.   We did not realise that
      the gymnasium was the casualty clearing point until
      afterwards and did not realise that Penistone. was the best
                                                     'A

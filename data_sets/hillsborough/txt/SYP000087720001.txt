            by POL. INS LAYTON and POy^PC BROWN of the West Midlajxsfc Police,                     I was

            shown several videgyj>«fcordings and pho t o gr.a^Dhji— flaken at

            Hillsborough football ground on the 15th of April                    1989 (150489).

            On a video recording            referenced (MAPI)      (Ex       ) between t ime

            references        1450.39.11 to             47.15 I identified my husband Ga

            his brother Stepheif ijjr the top left of the picture,

            On photographs          referenced PR 1/9a I also saw what         I think is possibly

            Gary and Stephen in the bottom centre of the photograph although I

            cannot be absolutely sure about the photograph.

            I also viewed a photograph referenced PR5/21 and I saw someone who was

            wearing Lee Jeans and a blue jumper w ho could be Gary but there i s n ’t

            enough detail        for me to be sure.

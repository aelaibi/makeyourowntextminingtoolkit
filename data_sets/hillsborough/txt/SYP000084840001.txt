We drank and ate           1 n / t h i s public    house,       and at about 2 .00            pm my

brother,                               arrived,    and stated            he had     problems a r r iving

from Liverpool.            He    stated that       in a d d i t i o n to the volume            of traffic

on the       road there were           problems with          road works          on the M62 motorway.

Due    to the fact        that my brother was                in posse s s i o n of 2 seat         tickets,

for    the West S t a n d he decided to have                   som e t h i n g    to eat and travel         to

the ground a short              time    later.

were     parked at this          location and         I d e c i d e d to do the        same.

We    left my vehicle at             this   location and          pro c e e d e d to travel       a long

The    volume     of mobile         traffic was       heavy,      an d   pede s t r i a n traffic was

also    very heavy.           The    p e destrian traffic was m a i n l y N o t t i n g h a m Forest

It was at this         point,        last year,       that a cordon of Police O f f i c e r s were

present,        checking      that     supporters       had m a t c h tickets         in their

possession.         If the       people     had no ticket,           then they were           not a l l o w e d

ground.           This area,        was     completley full           of s u f ^ o r t e r s .W hen     I arrived

at this          locatiM,        I jdould estimate           the    time as       being

about       2.4 0 jm      t pyg ■45       prn.    The volume        of    people was so great, that                   the

two m o u l d e d Police O f f i ce rs who                I saw by the Ma i n je fn t ry gate, had no

control of the numbers, and njKparti cular queue f o r mation was evident...
   /                                              --------------
It was a total mass of su'fJporters who had-*rto d i rections from an y o n e in



Once     I got to the m a in gate,                  I would say that            the     crowd became           static

for some          four or five minu t e s without                  no one app e a r i n g     to move.

The m ou n t e d Police O f f i c e r s            tried to m a n o u v r e     people      into       some    sort    of

order       but     in doing       so,     caused        people    to become js^frea n n o y e d at

them,       because due          to the         lack of Police           o f f icers   in the a r e a , what          the

Officers         were     trying      to do,       became    v e r y ineffective.

Whe n    the moun t e d Po l i c e         officer        tried to move         in the      crowd,       he

o bv io u s l y trod on people and then they became                             very upset at            him,    and

in return,          the Offi c e r        then shouted back at them.                     His a c t i o n s were

tota l l y useless and              I was        still    in the    position of being              in a static

p o s i t i o n outside       the m a i n entrance.

Although          I was    p hy s i c a l l y    involved    in a crush of             people,     I never       felt

that     I was      in any danger               of injury and       I did      not witness any            person

who was,          or a p p e a r e d to be        injured as a result             of the volume           of    people

outside.           The m o ve me nt       of     people    outside       the   turnstiles        was     so slow

that at about 2 .5 5              pm I had m oved only about                   20 yards      forward          since

a r r i v i ng   at 2 . 4 0   pm to 2.4 5          pm,    which    left me about          15 yards        from    the

t u r nstile ma r k e d A--G on the map.

At this          point,    I think        the m o u n t e d Po l i c e    officer a l t h o u g h       I cannot       be

certain who           said this,          told the group           of people       to move       over     towards

the     right      of the     t ur n s t i l e s A-G where         the    gate,    I believe           to be Gate C

was a pp ar e n t l y open.

It was at this              point       the    natural     movement       of    people      outside    this      gate

area,        m o v ed towards        the      right and an opening              of about        '15 feet wide was

a p pa re nt       the stream flow of               people    passed thro u g h          it.

'May I point           out,    that      I w a l k e d through this            opening with the           other

people,         who also       did the same.              I was    not    injured walking           thro u g h this

entry        point,      and to my k n o wledge            no one else was              injured as a       result

of entering            t h r o t h i s         point,

When        I e n t e r e d ^ f h r o u g h this    point,    I did      not    sejj^any Police        officer         or

anyo n e .

Once        I had entered t hr ou g h this entry                   point       I was    in an area what           1

d i r ec tl y      behind the West Stand.

I cannot           recall     what was         to the side        of me,       on the    left    hand side        or

my    r i g h t ha n ds i cle .

I can see directly                 in front         of me,    a tunnel,         where     I could also        see

the     playing area.

Ot h e r     than seeing          the    tunnel and        n at u r a l l y seeing      the     playing a r e a and

terracing,           I did not see any sign i n dicating                        e ntry to the       terracing.

Th e r e was        no one di r e c t i n g        us to any      par t i cuJ>M^par t of the terracing,

and     together with            the     rest of the         peo^fe who         entered the        ground,       at

the     same       point as myself,             I t h e ^ went     into the       tunnel,        and gained

access        to the t e rracing              a r y e marked Pens 3 an d           4 on the m a p .The v o 1ume

of    the      people     in the        tumnel     was    such    that    it was almost

black,        and totally jfla c k e d          to such a degree           that     if you w a n t e d    to go

back,        you    could     not,

It was a t e rrifying               expe r i e n c e and     I w o u l d not     like to be          in that

position again.

The    only       reason    I carried on was              because      I believed             it w o u l d be okay

once we got further                 along.        At one     point,     my sister         in law,       stated she

was    not going any further                 because       she was      so frightened.               I had to

comfort       her by saying            it w ould     be okay,         once we had gone further

along       the tunnel.

The   tunnel        was sloping         d o wnwards       but due      to the vast             number   of    people?

wi t hi n    it,    movement        along    it,    was    e x t r e m e l y slow.

I w o u l d say that          it took       us about       five m i n u t e s    to travel          along     its

entire       length.

I believe          that    indicates        how    compact      the    people were             together      in the

tunnel      at this        time.                                                          ^

                   T! 1aw                            I was      pushed forward towards                       the middle         of the Pen

                 a n d rny s ister         in Law was          forced over to                 right    side of the           pen.

                 Although         I say      I w a s .forced forward,                   at   no stage        in my mind was             there

                 a surge.            The sheer       volume       of      people w i t h i n         the   pen and the           volume    of

                 The     volume       of   people w i th in         this a^ea,               I could only describe as                   being

                 chock a block.
           A l t ho ug h there was movemen t               I felt      I could not           control my    individual

           m ov em e n t s »

           During my m o v ements              I was    forced to a point what                 I can only describe

           as about        seven steps          from the front          perimeter        fence,    at a point        in the

           middle      of the         pen.

           As    I m oved       closer,       to the front,        the a t m o s p h e r e    changed dramatically.

           With     people       panicking and they were                shouting at the top of their

           voices      to people         in the front          of them,      and ar o u n d them,      to stop

           pushing and to try and open the                       pen gate at the front,              to a l l o w    people

           out    of the        situation.

           I. can recall              one particular          incident, a fter      I had been       in the     pen for

      ^    about     three      ar f our m i n a t e s ,that a girl            I c o u 1d only      des cr i b e as    a
      iA
           teenager and               she had short       fair hair, was standing                 in front    of me.

           This    girl was           crying and she was obv i o u s l y            in a very distr e s s e d

qJ*        c o n d 1 1 io n .

           Although        she was also          shouting       out    I cannot      recall      exactly what was

           being     said.

           This     girl,       was struggling          to stand upright,            and      I did in fact     see her,

           m oving     towards         the terraci ng         floor.     She    d i s a p p e a r e d out of sight.

           The    people around us,              were so tightly           packed together          that     no one

           could do anything                 to assist    this     girl.

           I cannot        say what h a p pened to this                girl.

           By this       stage,        the area was a mass             of people who were           in total        panic.

           People were           screaming       out with fright.

           The    people wit h i n this area,                 who were at the side of the dividing

           fence and at the front                    of the    perimeter       fencing,       were by this      time

           starting        to climb over             the f e n c i n g, and gaining access            into pens 2 to

           the side and the              pitch       playing area to the            front.

           Although        I didn't          shout    out to panic for myself                 I can recall     thinking

           that     sooner       or    later,    someone w ould open the gates                   to allow     people       to

                    , I am    led to         believe     that        the two f o o t b a l 1 teams          left the    playing a r e a ,

                     at 3 . 0 6    p m (15-06h r s ) .         May     I point out       that      1    cannot recall        any of the

                     football          in play,      nor the time            that    the    teams       left the playing area.

                     O nce    I was      static       in the mid d l e        of the       pen,    an d     1 saw people       leaving

                     the a r e a via the            fencing       I felt,         eventually       that      I was   in no     immediate

                     danger and           I remained          in this       position       looking aro u n d for my sister                 in

                     1a w .

                    Although           I cannot      give      precise       times,     advertisement           boards were       being

                     passed onto             the    pitch,      from behind a l t h o u g h I           cannot give      reasons     as

                     to wh y this            was    h a ppening at this time.

                     I realise         that a serious            incident was           o b v i o u s l y taking     place,    but    I.

                     cannot       say what was          hap p e n i n g     on the     pitch      in front      of me.       Whe n the

                     c i r curnstanes allowed,                I then started to walk a r o u n d the                   pen   in order

                    to find my sister                in law.          At    the same       time,       my   sister   in law w as

                     looking       for me,         and w h e n we       e v e n t u a l l y found each other           I saw   that

                               was     very e m o t i o n a l l y distressed.

                    W h e n we     located each other we sat on the                          ter r a c i n g and began to

                    obse r v e what was             h a p penin g     ar o u n d us.

                    I can      recall        almost     e v e ryone        in the    pen,    trying         to assist    or console

                    e ach o t h e r .

         numerous       persons at the front, of the                   pen,    who were

         apparently        dead,    a lthough         I cannot     describe any          individual.

         B oth Police O f f icers          and a mb u l a n c e    staff were         checking     these a p p a r e n t

         dead    people and at           this    time,       I appreciated        the    spectators       verbal

         statements        of    people are          dying    in here.

         At about _4 .00 p m ( 1 4 . 0 0 h r s ) together w i t h my sister                   in law,     we   felt

         that    it was      pointless      staying          in this area,        to witness       this     occu r r e n c e

         so we       decided to     leave a nd go back to the                  car,     where we e v e n t u a l l y

         met    up wit h our other          friend,

         Although       there were other              events    taking       place w i t h i n   the a rea of the

         te r racing and the         playing area,             with    regard to        injured and d e c e a s e d

         person,       I cannot     e l a borate a n y more           than    I have a l r e a d y said.

         I have      views      on the    events       of    13th April       1989    (130489)     w hich      led up to

         this    disaster.

         I have       f or wa r d e d a letter        outlining       these     views    to Lord Justice           Taylor

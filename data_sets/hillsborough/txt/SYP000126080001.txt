PEOPLE WERE ALREADY ON THE PITCH AT THAT STAGE, AND I SAW A YOUNG LAD BROUGHT
OUT AND PEOPLE STARTING TO WORK ON HIM. THERE WAS A GREAT CRUSH JUST BEHIND
THE GOAL AND THERE WAS ONE GATE OPEN WHICH THEY WERE TRYING TO PULL PEOPLE
THROUGH. I COULD SEE PEOPLE BEING PULLED UP INTO THE STAND. I COULDN'T SEE
ANY POLICE. I COULD SEE SOME WHO WERE OBVIOUSLY DEAD WHEN THEY WERE PULLED
OUT AND I COULD SEE PEOPLE WITH CLOTHES TORN OFF. THERE WERE A FEW PEOPLE ON
THE PITCH WHO WEREN'T HURT BUT WERE OBVIOUSLY DISTRESSED - I SAW ONE HIT A
COPPER, BUT NOT OUT OF MALICE, JUST FRUSTRATION. ONE LAD CLIMBED INTO OUR
STAND WITH HIS SON, AND SAID HE HAD BEEN PUSHED INTO THE LEPPINGS LANE END BY
A^OLICEMAN ON A HORSE, AND THATS WHAT CAUSED THE PROBLEM. I LEFT AFTER ABOUT
HiHF AN HOUR WITH A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PEOPLE. PEOPLE WERE JUST LEAVING
WITH NO PROBLEM, NO AGGRAVATION. THE NOTTS FOREST FANS WERE BAITING THE
LIVERPOOL FANS WHO WERE ON THE PITCH, BUT I THINK THE MAIN FEELING WAS
AGAINST THE POLICE, AND I FELT THAT WAY MYSELF, BECAUSE THEY CAUSED THE
PROBLEM.

I HAD A TICKET FOR THE MATCH AND I GOT INTO THE WEST STAND FOR ABOUT 2PM.
I FIRST WENT THROUGH THE TUNNEL TO THE MAIN STAND PEN THREE BUT NOTICED IT
WAS VERY CROWDED SO I MADE MY WAY TO THE PEN BEHIND THE RIGHT OF THE GOA
POST. THE ARE NO GATES FOR PEOPLE TO GET FROM ONE PEN TO THE OTHER SO THE
ONLY WAY AROUND IS TO WALK BACK ON YOURSELF, OUT OF THE PEN AND THEN WALK TO
THE PLACE WHERE YOU WANT TO GO. THE FIRST THING I NOTICED WAS THAT THE SIDE
PENS WERE COMPLETLEY EMPTY AND THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH ROOM FOR A LOT OF
PEOPLE. ABOUT 10 MINUTES BEFORE THE MATCH KICKED OFF THE MIDDLE PEN WAS VERY
CROWDED AND PEOPLE WERE ACTUALLY BEING LIFTED FROM THE PEN TO THE STANDS
ABOVE. AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS PEOPLE PLAYING ABOUT BUT LOOKING BACK ON IT
THERE WERE SO MANY PEOPLE IN THAT PEN IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE.      I REMEMBER AT ONE
STAGE SOMEBODY SHOUTING THAT THE GATES HAD BEEN OPENED BUT I CAN NOT RECALL
T ^ T I M E . ANOTHER THING I NOTICED WAS THE LACK OF SUPERVISION IN THAT THERE
WERE NO SIGN POSTS ANYWHERE AND NOBODY AVAILABLE TO TELL YOU WERE TO GO.

I AM WILLING TO MAKE A STATEMENT REGARDING THIS BUT WILL ONLY BE AVAILABLE ON
WEDNESDAY EVENINGS AND SUNDAYS DURING THE DAY.

THE COACH I TRAVELLED ON IS ORGAINISED BY THE CLUB SECRETARY... I THINK SHE
WILL BE ABLE TO FORWARD ON FURTHER DETAILS FOR YOU REGARDING WHO ELSE WAS ON
THE COACH.

INFO          >> I GOT THERE AT ABOUT 2.45 BECAUSE THE TRAFFIC WAS VERY BAD
                 LEADING TO THE GROUND. THERS A CAR PARK JUST ROUND THE CORNER A
                 SHORT WALK FROM THE GROUND. THERE WAS A MASSIVE CRUSH OUTSIDE
                 LEPPINGS LANE. THE POLICEMAN WAS SHOUTING MOVE BACK, MOVE BACK,
                 AND WE DID AS FAR AS WE COULD. THERE ARE A SET OF IRON GATES IN
                 FRONT OF THE TURNSTILES, AND A POLICEMAN SHOUTED FOR THEM TO BE
                 SHUT, PREVENTING...

ACCESS TO THE TURNSTILES, BUT THE WEIGHT OF NUMBERS WAS SO MUCH THAT THE
GATES WERE FORCED OPEN AGAIN OR THE POLICE OPENED THE GATE. MY FRIEND HAD
TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS A CRUSH IN THE CENTRE PENS LAST YEAR, SO YOU
DELIBERATELY AVOIDED THAT AREA, BUT THERE WAS NO-ONE TO TELL US WHICH AREAS
WERE CONGESTED OR TO TELL US WHERE TO GO - WE WERE JUST GOING BY PAST
EXPERIENCE. THE POLICE HAD TO OPEN THE GATES OR THE SAME CRUSH WOULD HAVE
HAPPENED, JUST IN A DIFFERENT PLACE. AT ANFIELD THERE IS MUCH BETTER
ORGANISATION, BUT THERE WAS NO ORDER AT HILLSBOROUGH. THE POLICEMAN OUTSIDE
W A POWERLESS TO ACT BECAUSE OF THE EXTENT OF CROWD - HE WAS ONE MAN ON A
HORSE AMID A SEA OF PEOPLE, AND HE HAD NO CHANCE. WE AVOIDED THE TUNNEL,
GOING ROUND THE BACK OF THE TOILETS TO THE VERY RIGHT HAND PEN AS YOU LOOK
OUT ONTO THE PITCH. IT WAS QUITE COMFORTABLE WHERE WE WERE WITH PLENTY OF
SPACE AROUND US. MOST OF THE PEOPLE MUST HAVE JUST HEADED FOR THE TUNNEL.
ALTHOUGH THE MAIN CRUSH HAPPENED INSIDE OF COURSE, THE TROUBLE HAD STARTED
WELL BEFORE, OUTSIDE THE GROUND DUE TO THE VAST CROWD.
WE GOT TO SHEFFIELD EARLY ENOUGH, BUT THE GREAT DELAY WAS IN TRYING TO
NEGOTIATE SHEFFIELD.

INFO          » WE WENT UP TO THE GAME AND PARKED WITH THE LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS.
                 MY FRIEND AND I COMMENTED AT THE TIME ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF BOOZE
                 THAT PEOPLE WERE CONSUMING. WE COLLECTED OUR TICKETS FROM A
                 FRIEND IN VERE STREET, AND AGAIN COMMENTED ON THE NUMBER OF FANS
                 WITHOUT TICKETS. WE TRIED TO GET IN AT THE LEPPINGS LANE END AT
                 ABOUT 2.30. WE MANAGED TO WORK OUR WAY ROUND THE GROUND AND GOT
                 TO OUR SEATS.

<< WHO_WITH           »

WE COMMENTED ON HOW PACKED THE TWO CENTRE SECTIONS WERE WHEN THE END SECTIONS
BEHIND THE LIVERPOOL GOAL WERE EMPTY. WHEN PEOPLE STARTED TO CLIMB OVER THE
FENCE IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM AND WE COULD SEE THE CRUSH. WE
COULD SEE THAT THE POLICE WERE TRYING TO MAKE THE FANS MOVE BACK. THE FANS
SEEMED TO US TO BE UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE POLICE, WHICH WE THOUGHT WAS
PROBABLY BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF ALCOHOL CONSUMED. THERE SEEMED TO BE A LOT
OF ACTIVITY, PARTICULARLY BY THE POLICE, BUT NOTHING CO-ORDINATED. THEN THEY
s o r t e d to br in g out people wh o were clearly v e ry i l l , including a little boy
WIW WAS LAIN IN FRONT OF US, THAT PEOPLE WERE WORKING ON, TRYING TO REVIVE
HIM. THAT'S WHEN I REALISED THAT SOMETHING REALLY AWFUL WAS HAPPENING, BUT I
DIDN'T KNOW EVEN THEN WHAT WAS HAPPENING. THERE WERE A LOT OF BODIES LAIN OUT
ON THE PITCH IN FRONT OF ME. WHEN THE FIRST AMBULANCE ARRIVED IT WASN'T CLEAR
WHERE HE WAS TRYING TO GET TO, AND THERE SEEMED TO BE VERY LITTLE QUALIFIED
MEDICAL ASSISTANCE. IT THEN APPEARED THAT IT WAS BUNDLES OF RAGS, NOT PEOPLE,
WHO WERE BEING PULLED OUT OF THE PENS. I WAS THEN AWARE THAT THE FIRE BRIGADE
HAD ARRIVED WITH WHAT APPEARED TO BE OXYGEN CYLINDERS. THAT WAS THE FIRST I
HAD SEEN OF ANY PROPER EQUIPMENT OR FIRST AID. AFTER A CONSIDERABLE TIME, AN
ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE THAT THE MATCH WAS ABANDONED AND THE GROUND WOULD BE
CLEARED. LEAVING THE GROUND WAS THE WORST PART, WALKING THROUGH THE LIVERPOOL
FANS WHO WERE OBVIOUSLY STUNNED BY WHAT HAD HAPPENED. WE HAD NO WAY OF
KNOWING THE FULL EXTENT OF THE TRAGEDY. MY CONCLUSION AS I WALKED AWAY WAS
THAT NO-ONE WOULD COME OUT OF THIS WITH ANY CREDIT: THE POLICE WERE
DISORGANISED AND UNCO-ORDINATED, AND THE LIVERPOOL FANS WERE IN A STATE WHICH
I'M SURE CONTRIBUTED TO THE PROBLEM DUE TO THE EASY AVAILABILITY OF ALCOHOL.
AS WE WALKED TOWARDS THE GROUND AT 2.30, WE WERE STILL BEING STOPPED BY
LIVERPOOL FANS WHO WERE LOOKING FOR PUBS - IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THEY WOULD GET
TO THE GROUND AFTER THE KICK-OFF. EVERYBODY WAS IN THE CENTRE BLOCKS, AND I
WAS SURPRISED AS THE SIDES WERE STILL EMPTY. I DON'T HONESTLY BELIEVE THAT
THE INITIAL CROWDING IN THE CENTRE PENS THIS YEAR WAS AS BAD AS YEAR.

WE THOUGHT IT WAS STRANGE THAT NO-ONE WAS GOING TO THE EXTREMITIES OF THE
PENS, AND WE REMARKED AT 2.45 THAT WE DIDN'T THINK THEY WOULD START THE GAME
ON TIME BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE ALREADY CLIMBING OUT OF THE PENS. WHEN THE MATCH
WAS STOPPED, WE COULD SEE THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM, BUT THE POLICE WENT OVER
AND TOLD THEM TO CLEAR THE PITCH, AND THE TANNOY KEPT SAYINGTO CLEAR THE
PITCH. I THINK THEY THOUGHT IT WAS JUST A PITCH INVASION. IT WAS      VERY
DISTRESSING FOR US TO WATCH FANS TRYING TO GIVE OTHERS THE KISS OF LIFE WHILE
POLICE OFFICERS WHO I AM LED TO BELIEVE ARE FULLY TRAINED IN FIRST AID WERE
D Q H G NOTHING. IN THE PAST I HAVE ALWAYS TENDED TO SIDE WITH THE   POLICEIN
T H * E INSTANCES, BUT HILLSBOROUGH HAS CHANGED ALL THAT.

                 WAS NO VIOLENCE OR TROUBLE OUTSIDE THE GROUND THE REASONS FOR THE

SEE THAT THE WEST STAND WAS GETTING VERY PACKED. I SAW FANS CLIMBING OVER THE
FENCES ONTO THE PITCH AND THOUGHT IT WAS AN OVERSPILL. THE POLICE WERE
PUSHING THEM BACK INTO THE CROWD. I REALISED SHORTLY AFTER THAT IT WAS MORE
THAN AN OVERSPILL AND FANS WERE TRYING TO RIP DOWN FENCES BUT THE POLICE WERE
STOPPING THEM. IT WAS ABOUT 30 SECONDS BEFORE THE POLICE REALISED WHAT WAS
HAPPENING BUT THEN THEY JUST STEPPED BACK AND ALLOWED THE FANS TO CARRY ON
AND HELP PEOPLE WHILE THEY WATCHED.

SHOWN ON THE TV. I DON'T KNOW IF THERE WAS A LOT OF PRESSURE ON THE GATE THAT
WAS OPENED BU THERE WAS ALOT OF PRESSURE ON THE TURNSTILES. NOBODY ASKED TO
SEE MY TICKET. I WENT TO MY SEAT AND THE GAME STARTED. WHEN PEOPLE FIRST
STARTED TO CLIMB OVER THE FENCE I FIRST THOUGHT LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE THAT IT
WAS A PITCH INVASION. IT WASN'T UNTIL THE FIRST STRETCHER CAME OUT THAT I
REALISED WHAT WAS HAPPENING. I HELPED CARRY PEOPLE ON MAKESHIFT STRETCHERS
MADE OUT OF BOARDS. WE CARRIED PEOPLE TO UNDERNEATH THE STAND ON THE OPPOSITE
CORNER WHERE THE FIRST AID HUT IS. I WAS TOO BUSY HELPING PEOPLE TO NOTICE
        ANY OFFICIALS OR POLICE WERE DOING. HOWEVER, I DID SEE SOME POLICE
C ® T A B L E S ON THE PITCH AND THEY WERE BEING BRILLIANT BUT THE SENIOR OFFICERS
SEEMED TO BE OBLIVIOUS AS TO WHAT WAS HAPPENING, THEY DIDN'T REALLY TAKE IT
IN. SOME POLICE OFFICERS STOOD ACROSS THE MIDDLE OF THE PITCH AND DOWN BY
THE NORTH STAND THERE WAS NO REASON FOR THEM TO BE THERE AT ALL. PEOPLE
HAVE CALLED THE LIVERPOOL FANS DRUNKS ETC BUT I DIDN'T REALLY SEE ANYBODY
DRUNK, IT WASN'T THEM THAT CAUSED IT ALL.

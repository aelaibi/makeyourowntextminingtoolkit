            Statement by Mr R Hadfield



            On Saturday,     15 April   1989,   I attended the football fixture at

            Hi 1Isborough involving Nottingham Forest Football Club and Liverpool

            I was off duty,      in plain clothes, and was accompanied by my son who

                aged 24 and two colleagues.



            We travelled to Sheffield by private car which I parked near to

            Hammerton Road Police S t a t i o n . We walked from there to the football

            ground and at about 2.20pm walked by the L,eppings Lane Stand from the

            western end towards the side of the ground allocated to the

            Nottingham supporters. I therefore walked by the turnstiles where

                sequently a disaster took place. At about 2 . 15pm the road lead to

            the turnstiles was very crowded indeed, and there were mounted

            officers/amongst the crowds trying to get to the turnstiles,                    I would"

            describe the scene as very crowded and congested but this,                  in itself,

             lid not cause me any alarm. What did strike me however is that on

            the periphery of that congested area were hundreds of supporters who

            I would describe as boisterous. There were certainly some who were


                                                  r
                              5                                                   PAGE
                                                                                  R68

    worse for drink.    It was also very noticeable      that there were many

    people who had no tickets and I was asked on         at least    a dozen

    occasions   if I had any tickets for sale.      I did not get the impression

    that the officers at the turnstiles entrance were unable to control

    the entrance, although it was very apparent that there was dense

    congest ion.   I walked alongside the river down to the main road and

    turned left towards the side of the ground allocated to the

    N ottingham Forest supporters.     I made my way through the entrance           into

    the South stand, Gangway 5, Row Y.       I reached   my s e a t , which was    at

    .the very back of the stand, at about 2.35pm.



    I immediately noticed that the Liverpool supporters             in the L e ppings

    Lane stand were e x t r e m ^ j ^ d e n s e and crowded immediately behind the

    g o a l . This was made more noticeably so as the two extremities of the

    stand were relatively quiet and there were certainly open spaces and

    it was very apparent that the crowd needed to b ^ j ^ s p e r » e d more       in

    that stand.



    As it neared 3.00pm I was      conscious that some spectators from the

    centre part of the Leppings Lane stand were being bodily lifted into

^   the air and into the seated stand above them. My first             impression was

    that these people were unlawfully gaining access to the seated area.

    It was equally apparent,      however,   that the area from which they were

    escaping was extremely tightly packed and that the side areas which I

    referred to earlier had by then f i ll e d.



    The game commenced at 3.00 pm but I found that my attention was still

    drawn to that stand where      it was obvious that there was a problem

    and I noticed that the police officers were beginning to stand on the

    perimeter wall    facing the crowd and spectators were trying to climb
                                                                            PAGE
                                                                            R68

over the barrier fence.      It was very clear,   even from where I was,

that this action was not motivated by either figh ti ng or an attempt

at a pitch in va s io n., I say this because   in my experience the

behaviour of the crowd around would have been different. Suddenly

the area at the back of the g o a l was f illed with spectators and

police and I assume that      it was at that point that a gate had been

opened and there was an immediate/incursion on to the playing area

which, again, was quite appan^ntly not a deliberate         pitch invasion

       I saw a s.enior o f f i c e X run towards the centre of the field and

   n the attention of the referee.       The game e n d e d and the pitch

incursion increased.     At no time d id I feel that this was a pitch

invasion or an attempt by Liverpool supporters to stop the g a m e or

antagonise the Nottingham supporters or even fight amongst

themselves. From that point onwards it was difficult to maintain a

clear view of what had taken place behind the goal. My seat was

approximately 50 yards from the scene and there quickly became so

many people involved and police officers that        it was difficult to see

any detail.



There followed a period of twenty minutes or so when the pitch

incursion grew and it was obvious that some people had been injured.

Th*re were undoubtedly some spectators who were behaving in a

disorderly manner and one particular       individual gained the attention

of the entire stadium by approaching the opposite end of the ground

and gesticulating at the crowd. He was arrested and that arrest

caused spontaneous applause from the crowd.



I feel    I can add little further    in terms of individual    conduct which

will    not be adequately described in the television photographs which

were taken.     I have considerable experience    in handling football

crowds having served earlier               in Greater M a n c h e s t e r and policed the   *

First Division grounds             in that area, and having been the Assistant

Chief Constable            (Operations)    in Derbyshire and Policed matches there

which have been the subject of Football League                   Inquiries due to crowd

disorder        involving     clubs like Chelsea and Leeds.         I would not wish to

comment on the manner            in which the policing arrangements unfolded as

I have      insufficient knowledge of what was being transmitted as

information to those on duty,                save to make the following general

o bs er v a t i o n s .



1.      In a very short         period    of time there were a rnple police o f f ic e rs

^3.     on the playing area to            deal with any incidents which may have

      f unfolded.         I would assume their number to have been well           in excess

        of 200. A considerable            amount of their effort was       clearly centred

        upon preventing the pitch incursion moving towards the Not ti ng h am

        end. On at least two occasions they prevented small waves of

        supporters so doing.



         I .left the g r o u n d , as it was apparent there had been a serious

          ncident, at a b o ut 3.30pm.         I particularly felt that some form

        of public announcement should have been made.                 There may be factors

        which prevented this but the Nottingham supporters                  immediately

         close to me were incensed by what they clearly interpreted as a

         pitch invasion and some form of information to them would have

            tered the temperature of the remaining spectators who were

          ot involved.



         In terms of the a ll ocation of sections of the ground to the two

         clubs,      I feel that    it was    correct   in policing terms to allocate

         the stands to Nottingham which were most a c c e s s i b l e from a

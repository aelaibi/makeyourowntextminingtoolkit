            HILLSBOROUGH: COSTS OF INVESTIGATION BY WEST MIDLANDS POLICE



            This submission concerns the request from West Midlands Police

            Authority that the Home Office should meet the costs of their

            investigation into the Hillsborough tragedy.                              It recommends that

            the costs of that investigation should fall initially on South

            Yorkshire Police Authority, whoae Clxlai Const able initiated the--

            2.    The Home Secretary has already accepted,                            in his reply of 28

            April to a Parliamentary Question from Mr Beaumont-Dark and in

            his letters to West Midlands MPs, that the additional costs of
     the police investigation by West Midlands police officers should

     not fall on the West Midlands Police Authority.         He has not given

     any specific undertaking on how the costs should be met.



     West Midlands1 position


                                                                thjij
     3.     Lord Ferrers met the West Midlands Police Authority/on 25

     May.    The members of the Authority sarid that the Home Office

     should meet West Midlands costs directly.       They claimed that the

     investigation was in effect being conducted for Lord Justice

     Taylor's enquiry.    The Chief Constable         at MidiandS 7 -M 3 ? - © « a r ^

    who was also at the meeting, .said that hr, v.-.ni

    Chief Inspector of Constabulary^to eonduuL Llie TlD vesblga%don and

    that in his view he had been asked to conduct it and was

    conducting it on behalf of Lord Justice Taylor, not on behalf of

    Mr                         '
I


    4.      Lord Ferrers explained that it was our understandings/south

    Yorkshire's position that the investigation had been initiated

    by Mr Wright and was-Jui his Leiie£iL7 although it was also being

    placed at the service of the Taylor enquiry.



    South Yorkshire's position



    5.      Home Office officials          poliee—                   manpQS£g£__

    Popartmonks met the Clerk of South Yorkshire Police Authority and

    an Assistant Chief Constable for South Yorkshire Police on 18

    May.    The South Yorkshire position was somewhat different from

    West Midlands in thafc‘s’^hey accepted that Mr Wright had initiated
 the investigation^    ZEfeey claimed however that it had subsequently

 been largely taken over by the Taylor enquiry; Mr Dear was

 reporting directly to Lord Justice Taylor.       They suggested that

 the scope of the investigation was being dictated primarily by

 the needs of the national enquiry and that the whole cost^ should

be borne by central government.       South Yorkshire have since

 indicated that they wish to pursue this case at a meeting with

 Lord Ferrers.



Oricfin and purpose of investigation



 6.   It is fairly clear that, whatever Mr Dear's interpretation

of events, Mr Wright was the initiator in seeking an

investigation by an outside force.       This is borne out by the

terms of South Yorkshire Police's own press notice about the

investigation (copy attached at Annex A ) .



7.    Although the decision was taken early on to place the

results of the investigation directly at the service of the

Taylor enquiry, the main subject of the investigation concerns

the policing of South Yorkshire.    An investigation into the

events of the day would have neeiifii ^to— nn cnndnntrd whether or"

-ftotr there was a public enquiry^and Mr Wright very properly

decided that an investigation by an outside force would be

desirable.

      have been prompted by the needs of the enquiry                       seeking

      evidence on the design of football grounds and the procedure for

      issuing safety certificates^.             It also appears that the taking of

      witness statements for a public enquiry would normally be

      performed by Treasury Solicitors, whereas in this case the police

      9.    Nevertheless              |pp         fart      the investigation as a

      whole is primarily concerned with the policing of the events on

      the day^ and^ bhaU^iL would have been necessary to the Chief

      Constable for his own p u r p o s e ^ ^ i n order to provide evidence to

      coroners1 inquests as well as to Lord Justice Taylor's enquiry,

      and in order to satisfy himself as to the conduct of his police

      as to deal with any possible complaints against his officers fn**.

     meet the costs of the enquiry initially.              There is a strong case

      for a special payment to be made to them in order to assist with

     meeting the costs.



     Costs of Investigations



     10.    The Treasurer of West Midlands Police Authority said at the

     meeting with Lord Ferrers on 25 May that costs were running at

     around £2 million per month in the early stages of the
 investigation (which involved some 350 officers^at that stage) .— -

 Having spoken to the Deputy Treasurer of West Midlands' Police

Authority we understand that their best estimate at present for
                                                   fj&A.aA
the total costs of the investigation, which is M-koly to bc-

 scaled down in—tho next couple--of wooko ^ is some £4-5 million.



 Case for a special payment to South Yorkshire



 11.   Special payments have previously been made in cases of

exceptional and unforeseen expenditure, where the efficiency of

the force would be threatened if no assistance were given.                The

Hillsborough expenditure would certainly have been unforeseen and

is well in excess of a lp rate product for the area (the

threshold which was applied in the miners'           strike) which would        be

£1.^ million.     The costs would a£?so be                       proportion

of the Authority's total budget of £85m and, even net of police

grant, would «wb stantially erode their balances, which at the end

of 1988-89 stood at around £2 million.



12.    If a special payment were made on miners' strike terms, the

police authority would receive police grant on normal terms               (51%)

until the^costs reached the product of a lp rate (£l.f million),

               13.  We have discussed this with the Treasury at official level.

                :he point that single service police authorities iry^particular

               were less well-equipped than councils to absorb excessive and

               unforeseen expenditure and said that we would be advising that a

               payment on miners' strike lines would be appropriate.



                       The Treasury were clear that they would not favour a payment

               direct to West Midlands.



               Issues at stake



          j    v     £      our view there are important issues of principle at

               stake, with implications for funding of policing generally.                                      It

               is accepted that the costs should not fall on West Midlands.                                       But

               if payments were made directly from central funds to West
     Midlands it would imply that the investigation was being

     conducted solely at the behest of and for the benefit of central
                               n
     government.  Since that it not rflTfact the case - the

     investigation having been inafc-
                                    igafced by South Yorkshire and 'S

     dealing with matters which are primarily the concern of South

     Yorkshire Police - a direct payment could leave us open to

     similar claims on any occasion when an investigation was being

     conducted by an outside force and there could be said to be a

     national interest in the outcome.    This could apply to any

     incident of a major scale where possible allegations of police

    misconduct were involved (eg Wapping).



£        Difficulties have already been experienced in a case

    involving allegations of wrongful conviction (Guildford and

    Woolwich bombings) and the lesson drawn that any approach needs

    to be carefully routed via the original investigating force.        In

    vHrtrs case, h-QMgyeru. it was South Yorkshire as the force

    originally involved which made the approach to West Midlands tetrtr"

    x|-t' is^otiXl-~Eoing Buggoajmii (by West Midlands Police Authority^

    (that because of the involvement of HM Inspector of Constabulary

    in the negotiations with West Midlands, and because of the

    decision to make the results of the investigation available to

    the Taylor enquiry, £Jiat South Yorkshire are not even parties to

    the agreement and that therefore payment should be made direct to

    West Midlands.   There would be very wide implications for j&g»3:ice

    funding /goae^aiiy if we accepted that position.
   Recommendations

                                                                   tH
ti JfT''   We recommend that, for the reasons given in paragraphs -Hj

   and 3*6 above, the costs of the Hillsborough investigation should

   fall initially to South Yorkshire Police.        South Yorkshire should

   be offered a special payment to help meet the costs, following

   the formula used in the m i n e r s 1 strike as described in paragraph

   12 above.



           A draft letter soefeing approval- feg- tho-eourse proposed ffgltT

   the Chief Secretary is attached.

    The planning and the operational decisions of South Yorkshire Police

    officers will form a major aspect of the enquiry to be held into the

    events which led to the tragedy at the Sheffield Wednesday football

    ground on 15 April.



    The Chief Constable Mr Peter Wright judges it essential that the

    gathering and assessment of evidence in relation to these matters

    should be carried out by officers from another Force.   He has

    therefore asked Mr Geoffrey Dear, Chief Constable of West Midlands, to

    nominate a senior officer to lead the enquiry.

        overtime worked in West Midlands to cover for their
        absence.         It also includes accommodation costs, transport
        subsistence and the like.              There may be further costs
        associated with the investigation,              such as use of
        computer facilities and helplines, which may add to the

3                It is clearly right that the additional costs should
        not fall on West Midlands Police Authority, which has no
        interest in the outcome of the investigation.                    I have
        therefore given an assurance,             in my replies to members of
        Parliament concerned about the matter, that wherever the
        additional costs might fall, they would not fall to the
        West Midlands.


    ^        I        believe that it is right in principle that the
T
        costs should fall initially to South Yorkshire Police
    Authority.               The investigation was initiated by the Chief
        Constable of South Yorkshire and is concerned primarily
    with matters of policing in South Yorkshire.

                                          teely ooctc of the police
           investigation could not be absorbed within South
           Yorkshire Police Authority's budget without serious
           detriment to the efficiency of the force.             The costs
           could not have been foreseen when the Authority set its
           budget and are likely to place a serious strain upon it.
           The Authority's gross budget is some £85 million and
           they had balances at the end of 1988-89 of around £2
           million.          They need to keep some of that for other
           possible contingencies such as public disorder or a
           criminal investigation.


                        I.     would like to make South Yorkshire an early offer
           of acioiataiice, in an endeavour to persuade them to agree
           to meet the initial costs of the investigationr©nd thus
           relieve West Midlands, which is corioualy resentful of"
           the drain on its own policing resources oa J M u


                     ^ T h e r e is a r isk "that matters could come to a head at
           an early stage ,,<i^ r a t n o f e 3rS-^a complication Arc that the
           Chief Constable of Wost Yorksh-ire has told us that his
          understanding has always been that he was conducting the
           investigation solely on behalf of Lord Justice Taylor.
          This may be in part a confusion which arose because when
          he was initially approached by HM Chief Inspector of
          Constabulary the possibility was raised that he might be
          an assessor for the Taylor enquiry as well as conducting
          the investigation (although it was then decided to
           separate the two roles).           Whatever the reasons,       it would
          be very difficult to find ourselves involved in any
          public dispute over the events which led up to the
           investigation.


          fl-.        We hope that the South Yorkshire Police Authority
         ' can be persuaded to accept responsibility.             I believe
          that our best hope of achieving this is to make an early
     offer of a special payment recognising both the financial
     burden which this places on South Yorkshire and the
     extent to which the investigation serves the purposes of
     Lord Justice Taylor's enquiry.


(0   ^2.      Turning to the possible terms of the special
     payment, I believe that it should be. based on the formula          A
     used in the miners' strike^ namely that for costs above a
     threshold equivalent to the product of a penny rate for
     the a r e a ^ (ie^fil.JP million)^ we should meet 90% of the
     costs     (or 39% in addition to the usual police grant) and
     that we should place a ceiling on the South Yorkshire
     Police Authority's overall contribution, equivalent to a
     3/4p rate product for the’^are^J^B^^^U^ioij).        The
                                                                    4|
     ceiling could be reached if the costs were to reach £4.
     million.


 K            I believe that it would be very difficult to justify
     being less generous than in the miners' dispute in this
     particular instance.


,-2/ lA.      Robin Ferrers is meeting the South Yorkshire Police
     Authority on 20 June.      It is imperative that we should be
     able to say how the Government proposes that the costs
     should be met, and how West Midlands Police Authority is
     to be reimbursed, at the earliest possible date and we
     certainly need to be in a position to make a clear and
     reasonable offer at that meeting.


      j'T'v
          I should therefore be very grateful for an early
     reply.

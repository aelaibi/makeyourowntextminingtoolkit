               W e d n e s d a y Foo tb al l   G r o u n d for just over        twelve jrfonths.       In that     time     I

               have al wa ys         been posted to the S p i o n Ko p                    terraces.     It   is my job

               to make      sure that the ai sl es             on the terraces.            I wear a fl oe ur e s c e n t

               w a i s t c o a t and   carry    identification.

               On S a t u r d a y    15 April     1989    (150489)      I went     to the H i l l s b o r o u g h gro und

               I was     paired up wi t h a S h e f f i e l d Un it e d S t e w a r d who had been dra ft ed

               in for the match.

               After     that       I went to the E terrace w he re a short                   briefing was        held for

i n s t ru ct io ns     to all         the Stew ar ds about                general    crowd control,

emergency         procedures,             a n d also      that       it was    ex pe cte d that a large

number        of L i v er po ol        s u pp or te rs were going to be on the E terraces.                                We

w er e    instr uc te d that            these fans were               not to mix wit h the N o t t i n g h a m

Fo r e s t    fans who had been given the Pe n i s t o n e Rd end,                              the E terraces.

Liverpool         su pp o r t e r s were to go to the                      right hand side of the E

ter ra ce      near to the N S t a n d where they w o u l d be sep ar at ed from the

N o t t i n g h a m Fo r e s t   fans       by a line of Police.                The briefing           lasted some 5

to    10 m i n u t e s an d then we went to our a l l o c a t e d                         positions.

F r o m a r r i v i n g at my          po si t i o n   in the N o t t i n g h a m Fo re st        fans sec ti on of

the E terrace,             approximately               quarter        of the way back from the start of

the terr ac es          by the         pitch at ar o u n d           11.45pm    (1145),        up until

a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2. 3 0 p m     (1430),       there was a constant stream of fans

ar ri/ing.        There was            no tr ouble         in respect of fighting                 but from my

      ition I could see the Li v e rp oo l                          fans    in the E terrace as well,                    and

         d see the same L i ve rp oo l                 fan ejec ted twice             but som eho w kept

get t i n g    back     in,      by what means            I do not know.             He    remained     in the

gr o u n d as far as             I am aware after               getting       back    in three times.

The      last half an hour                before       the m a t c h s t ar te d more          fans a r r i v e d an d

it got a lot busier,                     but the fans           rema ine d well -be hav ed.            I did not see

an y alcohol           or p r o h i b i t e d a r ti cl es          on the E terrace.

     It soon became a p p a r e n t            that a large          number    of    people had been         injured

     an d    I made my way down to the W terraces Le pp i n g s Ln to see                               if I could

e s t im at e    that     I was a s s i s t i n g    in the m o v e m e n t   of casualties

for a bo ut        half an hour,            I then stood down by the             ramp talking     to other

S t e w a r d s a bo ut     the      incident as      I have     pre vi ou sl y stated,     I cannot

d e s c r i b e any of the            casualties      or who was      dead or     injured.    I d o n ’t

movement         of    casualties.

The    next thing            I recall was the ma i n body of supporters                   in the stand

were    leaving and                I came ac ro ss      a Liv er po ol    suppo rte r wal ki ng a r o u n d

Stand and          cont in ue d to talk to the other S t e w a r d s . T h e            ground was

pr et ty m u c h       clear        by then,      there was still a lot of a m b u l a n c e s

around,         but    I don't         recall    seeing any      injured or dead on the          pitch.        I

then m o v e d a n d sat             in the S stand until           I left the ground

about 5.25pm             (1725).

I m e n t i o ne d       to my partner           that     it had been too            quiet    in our area,                I

It was at 3 pm                (1300)        that we were              d i r e c ted b y the F orce O p e r a t i o n s

a s s ^ t a n c e was       u r g e nt ly     required.             I parked my /l/eh iclef on the                    central

A police         officer          was     shouting,           ‘‘Get     the dogs        in qui c k l y . "      I cannot

remember         who      that officer              was     but wit h my Police                dog    I entered         the

ground via Gate 0 a n d went                          onto the          slip w a y betw e e n the H o p end and the

N o r t h Stand,          wit h other           Dog Handlers.                 I was     requested        to standby at

that     location.               1 could see            the g o al mo u t h         in front      of the Hop.            I saw

L i v erpool         s u p p o r t er s    running        up to the Hop frontage,                     s h o uting waving

their      fists and             g e s t ic ul at i n g     to w a r d the N o t t i n g h a m supporters.                   Still

not aware            of what        was     h a p pening at           the L e p p i n g s Lane and unable                to see

that     end,        I thought            supporters          had     invaded        the    pitch a n d were           fighting.

The    behaviour            of    the L i v erpool            s up p o r t e r s was a n n oying         the N o t t i n g h a m

followers,             some      of whom were a t t e m p t i n g s c a l e                    the xierir^eter fence.

the ground             by the same            gate,       man y a p p e a r e d      to be in shock.                 I was

approached             by several,            m a i n ly youths,            who were very a b u s i v e            towards         the

Dog Handlers,               these         people were           drunk.

A m b ul an ce s were a tt em p t i n g               to get        into Gate 0 and were                 obstructed           from

the Hop,         having      f ai n t e d and       in shock.

Wh e n   it was a n n o u n c e d            the game was abandoned,              the N o t t i n g h a m   supporters

left     very q ui e t l y and               were   very well        behaved.

A bu s e was still           f o r t hc om in g     from the N o r t h S tand and as we                 left we were

a g a i n spat       on.

Once     back outside             the    ground, and unable             to move       the Police        vehicles,            I

did a foot           patrol       along       wj/th PC                    a n d our    res pe ct i ve Police

supporters,           but    on our          arrival        the m a j o r i t y had dispersed.              I continued

foot     patrol       until       I was able          to move my vehicle,             when     I took        up a

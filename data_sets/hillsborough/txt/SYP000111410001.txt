             m a j o r i t y of s u p p o r t e r s    had cleared w hen we were then told by other

             officers        coming along Pen i s t o n e R o a d          from the same serial              at about

             4 .3 0   p.m.      to     return to the g r a n d s t a n d w i t h i n the ground w h i c h we

             then did.          On a r r i v i n g     in the gr o u n d   I saw that the        crowds       had

             d i s p e r s e d and we then had de-brief                 by a senior      officer.       At about

             6    p.m.    we then went           to Clay w h e e l s T r a f f i c Depot w here we       remained until

             we    returned to D o n c a s t e r Police Station,                 arriving at about 7. 4 5 p.m.

             wh e n   I then went          off    duty.

             The a t m o s p h e r e    outside        the ground b e t w e e n 3 . 1 5 p.m.     and 4.3 0      p.m. was

             electric and tense giving                     concern as We e v e n t u a l l y t h r o u g h    residents

             learned of the             picture        inside the gr o u n d from fans and            local

             residents        had been w a t c h i n g       television.       That's why we        remained

             outside       the gr o u n d     in case of any trouble              from s u pporters          leaving    or

             a g a i n trying        to get      into the ground.

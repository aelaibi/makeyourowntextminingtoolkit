The     special            train          was    not          expected           until       shortly              after       140Q       hours           but

we     deployed            early          at    about          10=23       hours          and     took        up    duties          in

Penistone             Road,          outside             the    Station.

Between          our       location             and       Hillsborough                 Stadium           was       the    main          coach         park

It    was    a    nice          sunny          day       and    there          became        a    constant              stream          of

Liverpool             supporters                going          up    the       hill       away      from          the    ground          in       search

It    became          a    waste          of    time       telling             them that           they w o u l d have                   a fair

distance          to       go       as    such       advice          was       disregarded.                   I    remember             one

particular                request          for       directions                to    Grenoside            Working             Mans       Club,

which       is    all          of    two       miles       away,          they        still       set        off    walking.

Just    prior             to    the       special          trains          arrival           at    about           13.50       hours          I heard

a    report       of       a    disturbance                in a          Trading          Estate         off       Halifax          Road          just

above       our       location.                 I attended                with       other        officers              and    saw       that        a

grassed          area          in    the       vicinity             of    Gateways           Supermarket                 was       crowded           with

Liverpool             supporters                drinking             from       cans        and    bottles.               There          was       no

disorderly                behaviour             and       we    were       told        to    resume.               I only          got       to    the

entrance          of       the-Trading                   Estate          area       but     that       must        have       contained               in

excess       of       1,000          football             supporters                all     sitting           drinking.                 The

special          train          arrived          just          after       1400        hours       and       we     were       told          that        in

fact    it       contained                only    440          Liverpool             supporters.                   As    they       left          the

train       we    marshalled                   them      as     per       instructions,                 the        first       thing          that

struck       me    was          that       there          were       none       of     the       usual        (idiots)             among          them.

supporters          joined             the     queues            to     enter          the gro u n d.

Because       there          were       no    more             special       trains I              remained with                   my serial

at    the    Leppings             Lane       just          generally             supervising              supporters.                    Because

it    became       progressively                   busier             as    it    approached             kick          off       'time,      we     did

not    go    to    Claywheels                Lane          for    a     meal.

The    area       outside          the       turnstiles                 in L e p p i n g s         Lane       was c r o w d e d          with

supporters          most          of    whom       were          drinking          from       cans       and       enjoying              the

s u n n y "weather.               There       seemed             to    be    a    general          reluctance                to     enter         the

ground,       and       at    about          14.30             hours       mounted          officers           made         an     attempt          to

clear       these       supporters                in       towards          the    turnstiles                but m o s t           just

filtered          back.           There       was          a    disturbance             at    one       stage          towards           the

Middlewood          Road          side       of    Leppings                Lane    but       it    was       brought             quickly

under       control          by    mounted             officers.

I remained          in L e p p i n g s            Lane          towards          the    junction             with       Vere        Ro      dy    c* T1d
as    kick    off       time       approached                   the    flow       of    fans       corning         towards             me    became

heavier.           I became             fully          occupied             in    directing             fans       as       to     which

turnstiles          they          should          use.           They       were       running          up    to       me    and       showing

me    their       tickets,             asking          w h e r e 'they           should       go.        I was          also        aware         of

supporters          approaching                   these          fans       shouting          “H a v e       you       got       any

spares".           The       first          indication                I had       that       things          were       not        right,         was

when    a    woman       came          back       to       me    and       told    me       that    there          was       another             woman

with    a    leg    injury             near       the          outer       gates       at    the    entrance                to     the

Leppings          Lane       entrance.                 I went          to    the       metal       gates        at      the        North         side

of    Leppings          Lane       and       saw       a       mounted       officer          just       outside             the       gates,

his    horse       was       hemmed          in    by          supporters          and       there       was       a    solid          mass       of

people       in    front          of    him,       I told             him    about          the    injured             woman        but      he

already       knew       and       said       it       was       impossible             for       him    to     assist             because          of

the    crush       of    people.            She        was       apparently             reasonably              safe         at     this         time

in    the    Lee    side          of    the       metal          gate.           I then       began          t r y i ng      <-n    nrewTii.               y ,;

people from entering this area but it was useless.    A Police Land

Rover arrived and loud speakers used to try and get the fans to move

back from the turnstiles.    I saw Inspector Ellis with a hand held

loud hailer get on the roof of a Land Rover requesting the fans to

get back.   By this time it was obvious that the game had kicked off,

and there was then no reasoning with the crowd as they pressed

forward toward the turnstiles.    Supporters were going under the

bellies of Police horses to get through.    I was in possession of a

personal radio which I had in the top pocket of my tunic underneath

my Police anorak.    Due to crowd noise it was very difficult to pick

up messages.    Only officers working inside the ground had been issued

with ear pieces.    Some of my officers who are Community Constables

with their own radios had extensiop mikes clipped on the lapels of

their jackets and appeared to have picked up more radio traffic than

I did.   The only messages I can clearly remember hearing was a

request for all traffic to be stopped from entering Leppings Lane

because of the amount of people using it   just before kick off.    I

then heard a voice on the air saying "There's going to be a

catastrophe".

I have no knowledge of the gates being opened just a sudden

realisation that the crush had eased.

The Liverpool supporters had obviously been drinking,   their mood was

boisterous but reasonably good humoured.

As every Police Officer knows it is difficult to reason with someone

who has been drinking.   There was one particular loud roar from

inside the ground which caused the crowd   to push even harder which

could have been when the teams came onto   the pitch at 1^5^-

I have never seen mounted officers so helpless in controlling a crowd

situation, and on foot we were just useless.

I entered          the       ground          with          other              officers         by    Gate       A,     as          we    did       this           we

had    to    prevent          Liverpool                   supporters                from       trying          to     enter             with       us.            I

then    ran       to    the       back       of       the       North           stand      and       went        up    the          first

entrance          to    get       onto       the          pitch.              PC    1429       Bashforth              was          with       me     at

this    time.           When        I got            to    the       playing             area       the    game        was          no       longer           in

progress.              There       were          a    lot       of       Liverpool             supporters              on          the       pitch,           and

a    Police       cordon          was       forming             across             the    pitch          towards           the          half       way        line

I went       towards          the       front             of    the       West       Stand          and    if       I 'h a d        felt       useless

outside       the       ground,             it       was       nothing             compared          to    what        I was             to

experience.                 I approached                   the       central             North       standing              area          of    Leppings

Lane    end       at    its       junction                with       the       North       standing             area.               There          was        a

huge    crush          of    supporters                   in    the       central          North          terrace           area             and     fans

were    pushed          right          up    against                the       perimeter             fence.

At    this    stage          there          was       absolutely                   nothing          we    could        do          to    help        them.

Because       we       were       in    uniform                Liverpool             supporters                were        corning            up     to       us

screaming          and       swearing                at    us       to    do       something.

There       was    nothing             they          could          do'r b u t       they       expected              us    to          do

something.              I     have          never          felt          as    helpless          in m y        life.               Some       of th e

supporters             in     that       area             were       managing            to g e t o v e r        the        dividing

The    perimeter              gates          at      the       Leppings             Lane end are                narrow             only       allowing

one    person          through          at       a    time          and       there       was       only       one* p e r i m e t e r              gate

for    the    central             North          terracing                which          was    further             over           towards           the

centre       of    the       stand.              There          were          already Police                   officers                 there        so       I

remained          where       I was.

Eventually             fans       managed.to                   get       up    to    climb          over       the     perimeter                   fence,

and    I climbed             up    the       fence             on    the       pitch       side          and    begr— *                        ~   ~ v   L-   -jr)

I was          greatly           hampered                in    this       by    the    fact         that       the        strands           of       metal

spikes          which         was      catching                on    their       clothing.                I began              bending           the

this       compound              eased          further             and    I    could        see      the      body        of     a       man     lying

on    the       floor       at        the       base          of    the    perimeter             fence         near        to     the       dividing

fence          to    the    North           terrace.

He    was       apparently                 ded.                                                                       '

We    then          turned        our       attention                to .the      perimeter               fence’which                     consisted

of    a    strong          metal           mesh          welded       to       metal       supporters.                    It    had been

welded          on    the        inside'of                the       metal       supports            so      it      c o u l d n o t be           pulled

outwards             towards           the          pitch.

It    had       to    be    peeled              inwards             towards          the     stand          and      t h i s we           managed           to

do with some difficulty.

Persons             were    then           able          to    escape          through        this        and       bodies            began          to     be

lifted through.

I    remained          on       the        playing             field       and    began          to    give         the        kiss        of    life          to .

casualties.                 I had           no       success          at    all       which         was     absolutely                    soul

destroying.

I was          with    a    woman           aged          about       26    years          who      had     not       responded                 to

resuscitation                   she        had       an       abrasion          over       I believe             her       left           eye.        When

transport             her       to     the          casualty          station          there          weren't             enough           to    carry

her       so    I helped              to    lift          her      onto     the       boards.             She       was        dressed           in

I    covered          her       with        my       anorak         and     helped          to      carry        her       to     the

gymnasium.                 As    we        approached               the     door       to     the      gymnasium                we    had        to       stop

  Police          officers.              This        occurred             while        casulaties            were     lying         all    around

  We    were       unable          to    get       the        hoarding          through           the      doorway       and       I had       to

  lift       the    woman          off    and        carry       her       bodily          through          the    gym.        The    woman

  was    apparently                dead       and     I       remember          seeing          Detective          Sergeant          John

  Smith       who    was          part    of       the        team     receiving               casualties,

  I    returned          to       help    carry           a    body       that       of    a    young       man    aged       about       17    to

  18 y e a r s ,     who          I first          tried        to     resuscitate.                   He    was    slirnly         built,

                                                              dressed          in    jeans        and      ’T * shi r t .

  I have' no         clear          recollections                    affer          this       e v e r y t h i n g , sserns    to    have       been

  done       in a    daze.              I ended           up    outside             the    gymnasium           understandably                  no

  one    seemed          to       have    much        time       for       the       minor        casualties,            sc    I assisted

  them       where       I    could       and       p ut       them       on    the       mini      bus     type    of    ambulance             to

  be    transported                to    hospital.

  I then          assisted          with          persons        who       had       lost       relatives          and    helped          them

  w h e re    I    could,

  I have          worked          several          matches           at    the      Hillsborough              ground          including

  the    last       three          semi       finals,            liy u s u a l        duties          have    been       on    the

FA Cup Semi-Final
Liverpool -v- Notts Forest
Hillsborough - Saturday 15th April 1989

I have only two points I wish to make with regard to the tragic events
at the above fixture.

1.     Several Liverpool supporters asked me personally if they could buy
       tickets outside the ground.

2.     When I took my seat in the Main Stand at 2.20 pm, from that point
       and for the next 20 minutes or so, I observed supporters climbing
       over the outside fences from the sparsely populated side sections of
       Leppings Lane into what seemed to be an already crowded centre
       section of the Leppings Lane. No attempt was evident to stop these
       supporters climbing over.

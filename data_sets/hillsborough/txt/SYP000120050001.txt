seemed         to    be a s t e a d y         flow    of     people        who       appeared                to    be    football

supporters            intending           to    go    to     the     match,          making             their          way along

Halifax         Road        away       from    the    city.          These          people          were          mainly           on    the

opposite            side     of    the    road       to    the      railway          station.                 At       approximately

Adshead         I was        directed          by    Inspector            Ellis          to    go       to    the        opposite             side

of H a l i f a x      Road        a n d we     did    so,        taking        up a       position a                   few y a r d s          away

from     a     public        house       called       The        Station.            As       we     t ook        up     position             there

were     considerable                  numbers       of     peo p l e ,    mainly             men and male                    youths,

walking         along        Halifax          Road away           from     the       city.              Shortly after                    going

to    t h at    location           I noticed a youth                    sitting           on a          b o un d a r y wall              at    the

front        of a w o r k s        premises          surrounded            by a b o u t            seven          other        youths          and

men.         The     youths        appeared          to     h ave    been       drinking                a n d as         I approached

him    he      began        to    stand       up,    as     he    did     so    he was             very       unsteady              on       his

feet     and        stumbled almost                 falling,         them       steadied                himself,               I requested

the    group with                him a man who              appeared           to    be       the       eldest           in    particular,

to    take      car e       of    him    and make           their       way     towards              the      stadium,              if       they

were     going        to     the       ground.        They        did     so.        We       remained              on    that          side       of

the     r o a d u n til          approximately              1.5 0 p m ,    prior          to w h i c h a n               incident             had

occurred            further        along       the    r oad at          which        r a di o m e s s a g e s             I heard             had

directed            s ome    Mounted          officers.

At    approximately                1.50pm we          returned            to    the       entrance                t.o the          ra i l w a y

station          and     shortly          afterwards          the       special          train       passengers             began        to

emerge        from       the       station,           I carried          out       several          searches          of y o u n g       men

as    they       emerged.            I did       not    however          discover           anything          prohibited               in

anyone®          possessions.

As    the     passengers             emerged          they    were       reasonable             and     orderly.             They

were     formed          into       a g r o u p and we         escorted             them       to    the     stadium,            during

this     t ime      they       were       well       behaved and          co-operative.                    On arrival             on

Leppirigs L a n e             at    approximately            2.15pm           I remained with                 other         officers

of S e r i a l s       36 and        37    in the       vicinity          of       the    stadium          entrance.              During

this     period          there       were      many     people          who    were       moving        about         on    the

frontage          of     the       stadium       entrance          and    on       the    pavements           and      carriageway

of L e p p i n g s       Lane.        Also       people       were       sitting          on    the w i n d o w s i l l s         and       on

the    roadside           walls       and       pavements.              There       were       no    distinct          queues          of

people        in the          vicinity          of    the    entrance          and       I would        estimate            t hat      from

an    ini t i a l      number        of a b o u t      a hundred          people          in the        vicinity            of    the

entrance,           the       number       increased          c o n t i n u a l l y as         the    people          making        their

way    towards           the       ground       along       Leppings          Lane       became       greater.              The

people        did      not     seem       to    be    trying       to    enter        the      ground        and many were

sitting          or w a l k i n g     around,          drinking          from       beer       and    l a ge r    cans.

People        were       coming       to me          and asking          for       directions           to    the      various

entrances           and       turnstiles,             many    asking          by    the     reference            letters          or

names       of    the     parts       of       the    ground and          I gave          directions             as    asked        if      I

was    able.

Some     people          were       approaching             others       and       saying       'Have y o u a n y            spares’

or    j ust      ’S p a r e s , s p a r e s ’ .        I thought          at       the    time       t hat    they were             asking

for    beer,        on    reflection             they may          have       been asking             for     spare         tickets.

The    density           of    the     crowd         began    to    become          aggressive             and    it       became

increasingly              difficult             to m o v e    about       amongst           them      for     any      purpose.

walking       onto        th e    c a r r i a g e w a y at       this     time,       vehicles              including             buses

were       stil l    travelling              along       the     road.

The    number        of    people         in the         area     immediately                  in f r o n t      of     the ent r a n c e

increased           over     what        seemed a very             short        space          of     time       until       it was

not    possible           to w a l k      between          people       and     they        seemed          to    begin        to    push

each       other     towards           the     direction          of    the     turnstiles.                  As       the    pressure

of    the    large        crowd        increased           Inspector            Ellis who was                    near       to me,      just

a    few    f eet    nearer         to    the     roa d , shouted               to me 'Tell                them       to    stop

pushing       each        other        and     they will          all     get       in*.         1 tried          to    tell        people

this       but,     due    to     the     crowd       density and              the    level           of    noise       being        made

I was       only able            to m a k e     myself          heard     by    the       people           immediately              next

to me       a n d at      this      point       it wa s         virtually           impossible              to m o v e ,       only      by

forcing       myself         through           the    crowd was           1 able          to     do    so.        At    this        p oint

a man       said      to me       'There's           a woman       in     there       who's           been       hurt       and     they

c a n ’t get        her    out,        c a n ’t y o u      do    something*.                I f o r c e d my way              towards

the    gates and           several           other       people        t o l d me     that          a woman           was    i n ju red.

I then       saw a w o m a n           behind        the    brickwork           of    the        g ate      pillar          being

protected           from     th e      main     body       of    the    crowd        by     several          men.           I managed

to    force       a way      through           the    crowd       to    the     gate and              the    men       forced a way

to me.         I then        brought           the w o m a n      in her        late       forties           out       of    the     crowd

and    directed           her     towards        Vere       Road where              she    told me           that       she       had

injured       her        leg.       She      appeared           almost       hysterical               with       f ear.        I then

continued           to a t t e m p t      to    cause       people       to     stop       pushing           forward          but was

unable       to     do    so.       I was       under       a great          amount        of       physical           pressure

f r o m all       sides     at      this       p o int     and    it w a s      an    extreme              physical          effort          to

remain       standing.              Several          Mounted       officers           then          began        to    form a        line

across       the     front        of     the    entrance,          apparently              to       prevent           the    pressure

increasing           s t ill      fur the r .         As    they       did     so    people           were       forcing          a way

between and              even     underneath             the     horses        towards          the        turnstiles,

I then       had     the    definite            impression             that     the       s i t u a t i on w a s        o u t of

control          and      that       it w o u l d         not      be    possible             to    regain any              control            over

the    people            as    they       seemed          to    be m o r e         intent          on    getting          into       the

ground         than       they       were        concerned about                    their          own     or a n y o n e        elses         safety

I was       then         pushed          in the          direction            of    the       turnstiles             by     the      pressure

of    the      crowd and             had       to    fully         concentrte             on       remaining           standing.                It

was    not       possible            at     this         stage      to    t ake         any    action          to    prevent             the

crowd       pressing               forward          towards         the       turnstiles                and    I was        then acutely

aware       of    feeling            f ear       for      my    own      s a f e t y as        the       surrounding                pressure

on me       became            greater          and       greaer.          The       crowd          pressure          then        seemed         to

lesson and within                        seconds          I heard         a message                to go       into       the       g r o u n d as

there       was      a    problem           on      the      pi tch.          I entered             the       ground        by      the    left

hand       side      gate          and    ran t o w a r d s         the       rear       of    the N o r t h S t a n d ,             through

the    first         tunnel          entrance             across         the       terrace          and       over     the       s ide     w all

onto       the    pitch.             As     I went           onto       the    pitch          I saw a          considerable                number

of    other       Police            officers,             s om e    apparently                begging          to    form a          line

across         the       pitch and             some       running         towards             the       fencing        at      the       front       of

the    West       Stand,             I ran          to    the      front       of       the    West        Stand       in f r o n t        of    the

perimeter            fence          a n d at        that       time      I thought             that        the      p roblem was               one

of    f a ns     in t h a t         pa rt      of    the       stadium         invading             the       pit c h .        As    I got       to

the    perimeter               fence        I saw         people         climbing             up    the       fence       on     the      o t her

side       and attempting                   to      climb       o ver     the       top.

One    young         m a n who           was     holding           onto       the       fence       about          halfway          up    shouted

at    me    "Get         yourselves              in he re y o u           black          b a s t a r d s , there's               people

die i n g " .

I moved          along         the       front       of      the    fence          towards          the m i d d l e         of      the    pitch

be 1 i e v e d    the         g o a l s , towards              a gate         in the          fence,

As    I did so            I realised                t ha t     something            had       happened             in the        stand and

that       people         in the          stand          were      trying          to    get       out     themselves               or    to h e l p

other       people            to    get     out      both       o ver     the       fence          and     through          the      gate.

I then         saw       two P o l i c e         officers           on    the       other          s ide      of    t h e f e n ce w ho

appeared        to       be    rendering             aid       to a       person        lying         on    the    ground

immediately              behind          the    perimeter             wall       on w h i c h         the    perimeter                fence       is

erected.            People          on    the       other       side       were       trying          to    force       a way          through

the    guage        mesh       of    the       perimeter             fence       by     pulling            and    pushing             the

mesh.        With        other       police          officers             I joined           in to         pull    the       mesh       away

and    the    body        on    t he      ground          was     then      passed           through         the       gap which              had

been m a d e .

People       were        still       climbing             o ver      the    fence          and       sitting       on       the       w all    and

going       o nto    the       pi t c h .       I then          saw a P o l i c e            officer         rendering                first

aid    to    our     elderly man                    who     w a s l y ing       on      the g r a s s n ear            to    the       goal

I went       with        it,    and assisted                   the    husband           to      the    gymnasium.                 The       man

was    absolutely              distraught                a n d as we        arrived             at    the    gymnasium                there

was    a delay           in e n t e r i n g         as    the     board was             too      wide       to    go    straight

into    the     gymnasium                building          where          the    body was             left       and    one       officer

remained with                 the    body       and       the man.              I then          returned          to    the       p i t c h at

the    front        of    the W e s t          Stand       via       the N o r t h         Stand.           On arriving                at     that

end    of    the     pitch          I saw man y            fans       bringing             boards          and    carrying             people

on    them away           from       the       area       at    the       front       of     the W e s t         Stand.           I

continued           to    try       to a s s i s t        people          who    were        injured and               or    distressed

as    ambulances              and    a    doctor          arrived.

I am    not     exactly             certain          of    the       sequence           of      events       as    t h ey o c c u rred,

                                                                                                                     R3&6

  *   *’     as   during    the    events       time    seemed         to    condense     and    I had a    deep    sense

             of   unreality       as    the    t rag i c e v e n t s    unfolded.         I f elt   an    overwhelming

             sense    of   total       helplessness          as   1 began         to   realise    the    proportions       of

             what    was   happening.           Following         the       events     I assisted       other    officers

             to   request    several          youths    to    clear         the   pitch and      then was       directed    to

             wait    in the N o r t h S t a n d .

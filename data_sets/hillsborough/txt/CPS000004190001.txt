    1.   The request of the Hillsborough Steering Committee in
    their letter of 5th February 1990 for the release of copy
    witness statements and of the files prepared for the Coroner
    is in our view a reasonable one, and the only question that
    arises is whether its release might prejudice either the
    criminal investigation or any prosecution that later results.


    2.   Mr Mervyn Jones is satisfied that the release of the
    information on the restricted basis suggested by the Coroner
    in his letter of 15th February 1990 would not prejudice the
    criminal investigation, the restrictions being that only
    evidence of a medical nature and evidence directed at the
    location of each deceased be adduced. The Coroner appears to
    be satisfied that the proceedings can be controlled to achieve
    this object and it seems propitious that the Coroner's
    assistance is available in this way.


    3.    For our part we do not think the release of the
    information in this controlled way would be likely to
    prejudice a criminal trial and we do not advise that public
    interest immunity be claimed at this stage.


    4.   We agree that the civil trial should not be embarked on
    until after the conclusion of any criminal proceedings.

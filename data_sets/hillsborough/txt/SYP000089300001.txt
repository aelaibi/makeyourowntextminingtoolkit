             I reside at the abov^^address with my family.             I have been a supporter
                     C'/VT~
             of Liverpool footJSal 1 club for a lot of years.           I am not a season

             ticket holder*/ffaut attend as many matches as possible.

             I obtained a ticket for the Liverpool Notts Forest Semi Final to be

             played at Sheffield on Saturday 15th April          1989 (150489)   from a friend

                                                             the ticket was for seats       in

             the North Stand and cost £12 or £.14.

             At about 10 am (1000) on the morning of the matehi                       I am not

             in Sheffield at about     12.30 <1230) / a     1 pm (1300).   We parked the car

             in a side street and it took us about fifteen minutes to walk to the

            near the/Gate pt^fclic hse. J 4 e went into tp e    pub the four of us and

            travelled to Sheffj^ld in another/car driven by^_____________

            We stayed in the pub until about twenty to half past two (1420 1430)

            when I left, with                                         I d o n ’t remember      if

            there was anyone else with me.       My son             and his mates had left

            the pub before us.           '

            The three of us walked towards the grbund but did not                  any

            misbehaviour it was just like a normal game.             I d tc l not see any

            Policemen about and when we got to Leppings jsn it was chaos people

            were milling about all over the street Vp/sre was no queues just a mass

            of people.    When we eventually got to/the turnstiles I saw one

            Policeman stood by the wall he couldn't do anything because of the

            crowd.    I was pushed and crushed in getting to the turnstile and it

            was uncomfortable and it would have been very awkward for a small or

            elderly person.

                         had a ticket for the sr£at in Leppings Ln stand, and myself

            and                   made ouiVway to the North Stand.           We both went

            through the turnstiles amd did not get separated, and got to our seats

  ^         about ten minutes    before the kick off.

            After a few minutes the players      came out and the game kicked off, and

            the area I was in    was quite normal and orderly.          After a short time                  I

            remember BEARDSLEY hitting the cross bar and then just before or just

            after this I remember a policeman or steward walking along the edge of

            the pitch with a lad who had a broken arm you could see i V w a s               broken

            is seeing a person on a hoardin                ' H c h e r being carried across the

            pitch.     The person was conujjffl^tely covered over and appeared to be dead.

            After this a crowd            lice came onto the pitch and lined up across

            the front of our/^stand and also across the centre of the pitch.               By

            this time there was large crowds of fans running across the pitch with

            hoardings with people on, they were running towards the far area of

            the North Stand.

            w e r e n ’t they helping down at the iy^ppings Ln end.       I saw a young bobby

            in the line of policemen looking at the crowd and making a

(U.         masturbat ion sign.       I was   irfsensed by this and the fact that the
m*oc        Police did not appear to /h e        doing anything also I knew that my son was

            in the Leppings Ln te r j^ace, this was

            I told                      that I was going down on the pitch to see if I

c o M H ^ K j r could see if I could find           . JL made my way down and jumped over a

            little wall       into the pitch,          was with me.   I made my way to the

            Leppings Ln end and got to/the penalty area when I was jumped on by a
m-sc        Policeman who grabbed «fy arm and told me I was under arrest.             I told

            him to let go as I >«6as only going to try and find my son,                  also

            shouted to the policeman.           After this an older policeman told the

            policeman who had hold of me to let go and he did.             We then went to

            the Leppings Ln end and tried to find                 ind any of the other     lads

            but could not find anyone.

            I remember one for especially he was a man aged about 30 to 40 years,

            who was overweight and was wearing a Liverpool shirt of the older

            type,    jeans,   this man was    in a very bad way but people were helping

            him.     There were people on the pitch who appeared to be dead and also

            a lot seriously injured.          There appeared to be a calm but people doing

            all they could to help this being some Police and fans.

         We searched around for about half an hour and because we could not

         find anyone so we went back to the car, when we got to the car I can

         remember the football scores were art it so it must have been about 5

         pm (1700).   We waited at the cars and eventually they all arrived back

         except for                    After waiting for sometime,   I saw a

         Policeman and Policewoman on horses they radioed to check a

                      they could not find out anything but advised us to go to

         Hammerton Rd Pol Stn.

         We went to the Pol Stn and then to the Boys Club near Hammerton Rd.

         After some time we decided to ring        home and on doing this we

         found out that he was injured but not seriously and was     in hospital

         Later we came home.

           Further to the written statement                  I made on the 22nd August     1989

            (220889)     1 would like to comment on the actions of a young bobby at

            that moment      in time we could see that problems were arising and the

            bobby appeared to be having some verbal                 exchange with supporters        near

            to the trackside.             This ended up with the young bobby giving a

            masturbating sign to the crowd and this was not done in a jovial

            manner.     This attitude          incensed me because I could see that the

            situation was getting serious up the Leppings Lane end.                      It was

            obvious the young bobby had not got a clue what was going on.

            The other incident             was as an afterthought the action of the young

            bobby who took hold of me was rectified by the other bobby telling him

            to let me go.

            I do not wish to complain about this action.

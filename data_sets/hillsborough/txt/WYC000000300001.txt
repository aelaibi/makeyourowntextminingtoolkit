Dear Sir

TONY BLAND INQUEST 21ST DECEMBER 19 93
I act for Airedale NHS Trust and acted for the Trust in the
Application for a Declaration in this case, heard ultimately by
the House of Lords.        There has been numerous previous
correspondence between us      in connection with the     court
appearances and, latterly, when I forwarded a copy of the
Judgements in the case.

I should be most grateful if copies of the Statements and of the
Pathologists Report might be made available to me prior to the
Hearing on 21st December.

Yours faithfully




pp W J M LOVEL
Head of Legal Services

                                                                         September 1989




      Thank you for your letter of 16 August addressed to the Home Secretary expressing
      your support for the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire and his force following
      the tragedy at Hillsborough.  I have been asked to reply.

^jf   There have been many calls for the resignation of Mr Wright however the decision
      of the South Yorkshire Police Authority not to accept Mr Wrights resignation
      is a matter for the Authority alone.

      I can confirm that the Home Secretary is not aware of any grounds under which
      he could justify requiring the police authority to exercise its power, to call
      upon the Chief Constable to retire in the interest of efficiency under
      Section 29(1) of the Police Act 1964.  Your views have been noted.

                                                             Yours sincerely




                                                             D P C JONES

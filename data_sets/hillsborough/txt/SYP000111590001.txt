            Inside    ground,       crowd,     subdued and          I could see              no reason for     dogs    being

            Radio messages          from start        of    incident           not    received very well        due to

            battery failing          through        long use.

            I felt    that    I was       not used to best adv a n t a g e               and that       I could have

            been used      in a positive way to help situation.

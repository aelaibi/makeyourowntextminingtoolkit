  pens      seemed       to     be    getting        worse,          I could          see    children              and       teenagers

  feeing, - p h y s i c a l l y      crushed        against          t he      mesh,       their        faces       were       turning

 and     it w a s       obvious         that      he was        dead.           I realised              t hat      if    something

 At    briefing          that        morning        I had       been        issued with a                   personal          radio           the

  noise      from       the     crowd       was     such       that       I could          not     here       anything              at    all.

  1 called         control           several        times       on       the    radio       but        I heard          no    response.

  I do      not    know whether              they       h e a r d me        or w h e t h e r       the       noise       was        such

  that      I could          not     hear    them       acknowledging                 my    call.            Again       I can

  remember         shouting           down     the      radio        t hat      there       were        dead       people           in the

most      of       them       appeared          to     be    still          breathing.                 It was        during           this          that

left      t his      man       with       Inspector              Harvey          and       rejoined          other       officers               at

It w a s at         some       point       during          t his      I cannot           reca l l       exactly       w hen that            I

realised           that       the    game       had a c t u a l l y         started,         as     I led a -fan out                  o nto

behind        I, s a w       the    game      in     progress.

As     I looked          along       at    the       fence         away     from     the     g ate       to' e i t h e r     side      I

could        still       see       people       trapped who               were     either          dead       or    very     near      to

death        that       we    s t ill     c o u l d n ’t get          to.

I then        s a w f’S, K/vights a n d a P o l i c e w o m a n                    stood        on the         hcsar d i n g s

joined        them       and assisted                in    lifting          several         fans        over       this    f en c e    and

handing           them       down    to    officers             who    were      stood       on     the       trac k .       These

he     was    in    f a ct     still       breathing.                 I left       him and          returned          to     the      f e nce

tended        by P o l i c e        officers          and       other       supporters.                 I realised           that      the

match        had    been       stopped          at    some         sta ge.

tending          them.       .It w a s        obvious        to me       that       the     v ast      majority           of    these

fans       were    dead.           Their       bodies        were       limp,       their        faces       were     purple,

they were          covered          in v o m i t ,      and       they      all     h ad    several          items        of

Occasionally                someone          would     shout       "This       o n e ’s still           alive"        and       that

particular             body       would       be    rushed        out    through           the       gate    and     laid       onto

the    field where                ambulancemen              had    now      joined         Police       officers           and       othe

supporters             in    rendering             first     aid.        The      sight         of    these     bodies          was

terrible          as    n one      had any          apparent          injuries           other        than     purple          faces.

They       were    obviously             suffering           from       crush       injuries.

1 remained             outside          at    the    gate      helping         to    lift        bodies        out    and       onto

had    been       cleared,          then       together           with      other        officers           I entered           the        pe

preserve          the       scene.           The    terraces          were     littered              with    sh o e s ,    items           of

As    I stood          in t h i s       cordon       I looked           onto      the      pitch and           saw    that        other

officers          had       formed       a    cordon across              the      pitch         at    about     the       centre           of

the    field,          thereby          containing           the      Liverpool            supporters           and       the

also       saw    t hat     Police           and    supporters           were       pulling           the    advertising

hoardings          down          that   were        round     the       ground       and        were    using        t h e m as

    up    numerous             fights          t hat    were      taking          place          between.Liverpool                    supporters.

    It    became          apparent             t hat    these      fights             were       the       result     of    one       fan

    blaming          the       Police          for     what      had    happened             and       the    second        one

    apparently                defending          them.           Once       this       situation             had     calmed          down,        I

    remained             on    the    pitch          together          with       other          officers           assisted          in

    carrying             the    wounded          to     the      gym a r e a          and also             attempted        to       get       the

    fans       that       could       walk       unaided          off       the       pitch,           Several        supporters                asked

    me    if    the       match       had       been       postponed             and       after       asking        other       Police

    officers             I was       informed           that      it    in       f act      had       been.         During       a    lull        in

    th i s     action          I met       PS M o r g a n        and    after          conversing             with     him       for       a

    period          of    t ime      we    obtained            a dr:i. nk        of    water          from a bucket              brought

    round       the       field       by a m a n           in a t r a c k s u i t           who       was    an     employee          of

    Sheffield             Wednesday,

    Once       the       pitch       had       cleared         I made        my way          to       the    gym at        the       rear       of

    the      North        stand.           O n my       arrival         there          the       scene       was    one     of       organised

    ch aos      with ambulances                      all    over       and       the       injured          l aid    out    on       the

    floo r .         The       gym    was       being       used       as    a morgue.

    Supporters                were    constantly arriving                         with       injured          people        or       dead       ones

       Statement
       *•
                 of DC Clarke*......
       I am a Detective Constable in the South Yorkshire Police Force, currently attached to
       The Drag Squad at Police Headquarters*
       Prior to the 15 April 1 9 8 9 I volunteered to work in uniform at She Semi Final held at
       Sheffield Wednesday Stadium on Saturday 15 April 1989* The teams playing on that date
       were Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.

       On the morning of Saturday 15 April 1989 I commenced duty at 8,00am and attended at
       briefing held at W'T
                         West  Bar Police Station at 9*00aa»*
                            Bo/"
       I was attached to^serial 16 under the command of PS                 Swift, and our initial duties
       consisted of attending at Midland Station where both Liverpool and Nottingham Forest
       Fans were to arrive and supervise thier conduct at the Station and engare that they
       were directed into the awaiting PSV and together with two Police Officers per PSV they
       were to be escorted to the Ground*
       On completion of the briefing we were provided with a packed meal# and after consuming
       this we walked to Midland Station as a serial* On arrival there at approximately 10«00am
       we remained there aad carried out our duties as previously stated*

       At approximately 2.30 pm that date our complete serial boarded a ESV and was conveyed
       to the Penistone Road end of the Football Stafiium* On arrival we went directly to the
       Gyp where we were to be held on standby p B I am unsure of the time at this stage,
       however I can recall that on our arrival at the ground there was consideralble Radio
       traffic, all relating to problems being suffered at the Leppings Lane entrance to the
       ground* I cannot recall any particular officers, however the situation sounded very
       hectic* We were immediately told to leave the 3BHQC Gym and go onto the track surrounding
       the pitch and go to the Lepping Lane Terraces MSHK            where problems were being
       encountered* UK         As far as I am aware we were not told what the problems were at that
       particular end of the ground* As we walked round the track to the Leppings ane Terraces
       I can recall that the match had not statted*

       At that stage there were only mmmotL* area*   X Police Officers from F Division on the
          V r e e . © < g w e r e PC's Marsden Walpole and Brookes
       perimeter track! As I got to the Leppings Lane end of the ground *he Liverpool supporters
       were throwing coins'^verbal abuse at the Police Officers* They were also spitting at

       the®, and shouting, * Fucking Murderers' DO Something* the whole feeling of this crowd
       was one of aggresion directed towards the Police Officers on the track* It was at this
^ ^ s l ^ e that I actually saw the crowd inside the penJSXEK and the f M M B H l i                  V
       wmmmmmmmmmt what was happening U U H w , I saw people being physically squashed against
                                                                      \VVvC
       the mesh, thier faces bulging through the holes, they were'taBtapMMk on the person next
       to them and those that could still talk were crying out for help, aMbfftmMmgHiiNKrai
       H   W   m   M   l   i   l   T   h   i   s   crush went back for 5 to 6 rows and the sound was one
       of people crying                                and aWailing sound that I hafre never heard before*

       The supporters behind these were still hurling abuse at the Police and spitting at them*
   '   A— x ----- u — 1—           t                        ------ |—          I passed behind
                                                                                                             II

       the Goal at the Leppings Lane end of the ground the crush inside the pens seemed to be
getting worse, I could see children and teenagers being physically crushed against the

mesh, thier faces were turning purple, thier eyes bulging and vomitt and saliva trickling
from thier mouths*                                                                       ..
                             tfKYmtiffmsyMY * I then saw a man of about MO years, white hair,

and grey jacket, he was at the front of the crush and his face was totally distorted with
being crushed against the mesh* He had turned purple and it was obvious that he was dead,
I realised that if something was not done there were going to be more deaths in that pea*
                            A ” *>*                                     a ™ m T...ariri nU rirnnirfh

ftt briefing that morning I had been issued with a persoaall radio the noise from the
crowd was such that X could not here anything at all, I called control several times on the
radio but I heard no response, I do not know whether they heard me or whether the noise was
such that I could not hear them acknowledging JOB my call* Again I can remember shouting
«ncE down the radio that                               there were dead people in the crowd
2BSBXSBKXEKX* The scene and the sound at the front of thoses terraces was unbelievable mm^


I was know near to one of the small access gates that lead into the terraces, and I
realised that        must be opened immediately in an attempt to get into the people inside*
ftpAt I looked round for a supervisory Officers but I could not see one, Together then
with several other officersU^Jp>ur own inititive, we opened the gate at the left of the
 goal leading into the terraces, IXM«ll»IXM9iiaB^3aaa5XXMMXK8mMi8mK^llXMl^                 into the
centre pen* On opening the door I intended to enter the centre pen area and try to 1QSKXX
render what assistance I could, however once the door was opened outward it became
apparent that the crush was such that no one could enter the pen, in fact the supporters
 inside were crushed together to such an extent that the two or three actually in front of
the door could not get out** They were wedged together*
 Together with several other Police Officers I began to attempt to force the supporters
 back, to relieve the crush, however I immediately realised that this was futile and there
 was no way that this crush of bodies could be forced back* I then began dragging out
 supporters from the pen,   these however were the ones that had been stood several rows
 back they were climbing over the heads of the ones at the front who were still crushed
 together so that they could not move* As we were helping thes fans out onto the pitch they
 were striking and kicking out at the Police, and hurling abuse at them, I t was obvious
 that the majority of them were drunk, and on several occasions I was struck and kicked
 by these supporters*




 As I helped the first initial wave of supporters out they mainly appeared alright and they
 made their way round the track to the North Stand* After this first wave had come out
  the supporters that we were helping out were in a worse condition, although I would say
                                                                                                   V

That most of them appeared to be still breathing, it was during this that I lost my
uniform Helmet, ray tie and ray Police Spectacles, recovering ray helmet later on that day*
I pulled one supporter out who was wearing all denims, and he appeared to be still
breathing, as X JSBBX pulled him onto the pitch he vomitted, and at that point I was
joined by Inspector Harvey and together we walked him around on the pitch until he had
calmed down and was breathing more normally* I then left this man with Inspector Harvey
and rejoined other Officers aV the gate* During all this time we were still beingabused
by the rest of the crowd inside the pen and numerous supporters who we had already got
out onto the pitch were fighting with m y s e lf and other Officers in an attempt to get back
     W « - $ew\


On several occasions I had great difficulty convincing these people that they could not go
back in and that they were only getting in the way of rescue attempts* The majority of
them after being initially very aggresive towards me would simply break down and start
crying, and slump down onto the pitch*
It was at some point during this I cannot recall exactly when that I realised that the
game had actually started, as X led a fan out onto the pitch and handed him over to other
police Officers who were stood behind I saw the game in progress* Although the uitwtien
                                                                Vi            »i|*<V

4s I looked along at the fence away from the gate to either side 1 could still see people
trapped who were either dead or very near to death that we still could* nt get to*
I then saw PS      Knights fflggMXIOflgX and a Police Woman stood on the hoardings several yards
from the gate, lifting supporters over the fence* I tjpMfc joined them and assisted in
lifting several fans over this fence and handing them down to Officers who were stood on
the 3E9QE3C track* These were all still alive though in a various state of health*
As we lifted one supporter over I realised that there jfiBflClBSX were no Police Officers to
hand him down to so I climbed down still holding this youth, I carried him onto the pitch
where after 1 ascertained that he was in fact still breathing I left him, and returned to t
the fence*
I then saw Supt Greenwood stood talking to PS Morten on the perimeter track* PS Morten
then ran off towards the gym area,             the pitch lBfltPaX in front off the Leppings ^ane Bnd
was littered with people the majority of whom appeared to be alive although numerous were
being tended by Police Officers and other supporters* I realised that the match had been
stopped at some stage*
I then heard a siren and on looking towards the gym area I saw a St John's Ambulance come «
                                                            Xl
onto the pitch and drive towards the Leppings ane End* It stopped directly behind the
goal and a St Johns Ambulance man alighted from the vehicle.
As I got to the gate leading into the centre pen, numerous other Officers were still there
and we were joined by Chief Supt Nesbitt who organised us into a funnel leading out from
the gate onto the pitch* I realised that several Police Officers were know inside the
centre Pen, rendering first aid to fans on the terraces. These Officers inside began to
pass out bodies to us and we were then passing them down the funnel onto the pitch where
other Police were tending them. It was obvious to me that the vast majority of these fans
were dead* Their bodies were limp, their faces were purple, they were covered in vomit,
and they all had several items of clothing missing or hanging off them in tatters.
Chief Supt Nesbitt joined Officers inside the pen and was assisting in handing bodies out
                                                                                       '
                                                                                       !
to myself and other officers who were on the track*
Occasionally someone would shout ’This Ones Still Alive* and that particular body would
be rushed out through the gate and laid onto the field where SSJa68Xglfl68XISffllX3Har»i&itIX
Ambulance men had now joined Police Officers and other supporters in rendering first aid.
The sight of these bodies was terrible as none had any apparent injuries other tha&,
purple face, they were obviously suffering from crush injuries*
I remained outside at the gate helping ti lift bodies out and onto the track* I i B B X M g r
reraianed there until the front part of the centre pen had been cleared, then together
with other officers I entered the pen and we formed a cordon approximately half way up
the terraces, to preserve the scene. The                                               terraces
were littered with st§oes items of peoples clothing, money, spectacles        etc......
As   I was stood in this cordon I looked onto the pitch and saw that other Officers had
formed a cordon across the pitch at about the centre of the field, thereby containing
the Liverpool supporters and the injured and keeping them from the Nottingham Forest
 Supporters* I also saw that Police and supporters were pulling the advertising hoardings •
down that were round the ground and were using them as stretchers to carry bodies to the
Gym area.
All during this time we were being subjected to continual abuse from Liverpool supporters
who were above us in the seating in the West Stand, they were also still spitting on us.
and shouting ’Fucking Murderef**5 and 'This is all your Fucking *ault'

After a period of time the word was passed along the cordon to return onto the pitch* I
did this and along with several other officers broke up numerous fights that were taking
place between Liverppol supporters* It became apparent that these fights were the restlt
of one fan blaming the Police for what had happened and the second one apparently
defending them* Once this situation had calmed down, I remained on the pitch together
with other officers assisted in carrying the wounded to the Gym area and also attempted
to get the fans that could walk unaided of^the pitch. Several supporters asked me if the
match had been postponed, and after asking other Police Officers 1 was informed that it

in fact had been* During a lull, in this action I met PS Morgan and after conversing with
him for a pwriod of time we obtained a drink of water from a bucket brought round the field

by a man in a tracksuit who W mmmmimkmmbm an employee of Sheff Wednesday*
Once the pitch had cleared I made ay way to the Gym* at the rear of the North Stand* On
ay arrival there the scene WS3SXSX. was one of organised chaos with ambulances all over and
the injured laid out on the floor* The gym was being used as a morgue*
Supporters were constantly arriving with injured people or dead ones on ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ £
makeshift stretchers* I them met up with DS Glossop and S H M K together with him we were
assigned to security on the gym door with the instruction that no injured were to be
carried into the gym as only the dead were being took in there* Any injured were to be
placed outsiAfeon the ground where ambulanee men and Police Officers and Off duty hospital
staff were caring for them*
I assisted in loading the injured into ambulances, and at one point I escorted a man who
stated he was an offduty Merseyside Police Offioer round the gym in an attempt to ID his
brother he had lost* He could not ID him however he broke down at the sight in the Gym and
I took him outside provi^Mfed him with a drink and left him sat down* 1 returned to DS
Glossop on security duty at the gym door*
Once the scene had settled down all officers not involved with anything at that time
were directed to the North Stand, as we were not required any longer as security for the
Gym door myself and DS Glossop made our way into the stand, where we joined DC Ketton,
DC Gibson, and DC Priestley and other offieers* A short time later Chief Insp Beal told
                                                                                        *
us that if there were no other duties we had ^perform we could stand down* In co w#th
other officers I them walked back to West gar, where a de brief was held by Chief Insp
Donnely. On completion of which we were informed we could go off duty*
I terminated duty at 8*00pi that night at Police HQ*....................

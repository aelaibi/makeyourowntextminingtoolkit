                         QUESTION                 FIVE

Why wasn't the tunnel leading to the central pens closed when they
became full, the procedure adopted at the previous year's Semi-
Final?

The tunnel was not closed as Chief Superintendent Duckenfield did not perceive
overcrowding in pens and that fans entering Gate C would go in direction of tunnel.
Chief Superintendent Duckenfield took no steps to block off or stop people going
down central tunnel.

The fullness and overcrowding in central pens 3 and 4 were not identified by Chief
Superintendent Duckenfield or brought to his attention by any other person,
consequently no instruction to block off or stop fans going down central tunnel.
On giving instructions for the gates to be opened, radio on talk through,
hoped/expected for officers on concourse to take appropriate action to close tunnel.
In 1988 the central tunnel was closed at 2.35 pm, possibly because central pens full.
All fans in at 2.45 pm. However in 1989 different situation and atmosphere.


OBSERVATIONS
Please see pages 53 - 79, Volume 2.


Lord Justice Taylor - Interim Report
231. Planning apart, however, it should have been clear in the control room where
there was a view of the pens and of the crowd at the turnstiles that the tunnel had to
be closed. If orders had been given to that effect when gate C was opened, the fans
could have been directed to the empty areas of the wings and this disaster could still
have been avoided. Failure to give that order was a blunder of the first magnitude.


Lord Justice Taylor - Recommendation 9
9.   Arrangements should be made:-

(a) to limit the number of spectators entering each self-contained pen or area to the
maximum capacity figure assessed in accordance with Recommendation 8 above
either electronically, mechanically, by a ticketing arrangement, by counting or
otherwise, and

(b) to close off further access to such pen or area when its maximum capacity is
about to be reached.

                                                       D. G. D U C K I N F I E L D

              there in recent years and I was looking at recent history
              and recent hi story did not indic at e that there would be a
              problem t h e r e .

         Q.   So what you are telli ng us is that, apart from the
              c o n v e rsation the detail s of which you cannot recall with
              S uperin t e n d e n t Gr eenwood, no other steps were taken to
              monito r or to keep au fait with the situation of those
     6        pens, other than your own o bservation and those with you
              in the Contr ol Box?           A.   There is no other means of
              monit o r i n g at all bec au se the turnstile counts do not
              register for the pens.

         Q. There is an ob vious way of monitoring, surely, with respect,
            and that is to have Of ficers at the back of those pens
            p ositioned in order to see for themselves, with a specific
            duty in the Op eration Order to keep control of the numbers
            going into those pens and perha ps to shut the tunnel up
            and block it off when they get filled up.                  A.   I make
            the point that Serial 13, who were in the West Stand,
          , had many r e s p o n s i b i l i t i e s and one of which was looking over
          I into that terrace, and they w ould have mo nitored that
            situa ti on in add it io n to any other Officer and had the
            numbers in those pens got to a dangerous level then action
     D      would have been taken with seria ls in that concourse,
            Serials 13 and 14 —              14 and 15.

         Q. Can you explain, in the light of what you have said, why
            no action was in fact taken by Serial 13 or any Serial 1?
            A.    Because they did not perc ei ve overcrowding in those
            pens.
     E   Q.   You are sa ying that they ought to have known that they
              should per ce iv e it, or look for it, are you?                A.  What
              I am sa ying is that as train ed Police Officers, if they
              see diff i c u l t i e s o c c u r r i n g then they will take action in
              respect of those diff ic ul ti es .

         Q. But surely you have said to me that there was not any
            other thing that c ould be done - surely the most obvious
            thing, and I do not know whe th er you thought of this or
            not, is, as I have said, to have Officers in the back
            ava il ab le there and ready and able to shut off the tunnel
            should the ce ntral pens become too full.     A.  There
            were Officer s there, sir.

         Q.   There were not.      A.   No, not at that particular point,
              sir.     I take your point about you may consider extra
              Offic er s at the tu nnel but if there was a need to shut off
              that tunnel, then other O f f icers - Serial 13 or the
              track seria ls - wo uld poi nt out the difficulties being
              e xperienced to the Cont r o l Room and the Control Room
              would then advis e the Offic e r s on Serials 14 and 15 to
              take some p o s itive action in the concourse area at the
              back of the West Stand.

                        Q. And did not get th rough? - A. And did not get through.

                        Q.   Did you ask -Mr. Mu r r a y to try to contact? -A. No, sir.      As I
                             hav e said e a r l i e r the re are ac tions that individuals take of
                             their own accord.

                B       Q. So you knew the n that w h e n you de cided the gate should be
                           opened the clu b di d not kno w that that decis io n had been made?
                           - a . No, sir.

                        Q. So they w e r e u n a w a r e of wha t was going to happen? - A. Yes,
                           sir.

                        Q. So far as the Police wer e concerned, that is the Police at and
                           abo ut the Le ppings Lan e co ncourse, they were not informed in
                           advance, we re they, that the gate was going to be opened? - A.
                           No, sir, but we may be able to presume, and as I say I have
                           not seen oth er O f f i c e r s ’ statements, that bearing in mind the
                           radio is on t a l k - t h r o u g h so that every bo dy can hear it, and
                           S u p e r i n t e n d e n t M a r shall had mad e the request for the gates to
                           be opened, and we in turn, that is the control room, gave
                    D      p e r m i s s i o n for them to be opened, I can only assume that the
                           O f f i c e r s who wer e in that l o c a t i o n who had personal radios
                           wer e b e c oming awa re of the d e v e l o p i n g situation and would
                           re spond to it, but I did not giv e a direct instruction.

                        Q. What on ear th could th ey be ex pected to do?                        Even assuming
                           they heard the mess a g e from Mr. Marshall, how could they be
                           e x p e c t e d to a n t i c i p a t e you r r e s p o n s e to it or to know whax.
                           they might be able to do to cat er for it? - A. It is
                           difficu lt .       If they saw people com in g in they could direct
                           them, but I c a n ’t a n t i c i p a t e the ir actions.

                         Q. You see,. you knew by now, di d yo u not, that there were spaces
                            at the.e nd s o f the t e r r a c i n g but that it was pretty crowded in
                            the m i d d l e sec t i o n s ? -A. Yes, sir.   .;            ■-" ■   —

                        .G-... You knew, that the tunnel, the cent r a l tunnel;            gave on to those
                               two mi d d l e s e c t i o n s ? - A. Yes, sir.

                        Q. You knew by no w that it was             10-to,    after 10-to? -
                           A. A p p r o a c h i n g kick-off.

                         Q. You knew when p e o p l e got in the y were likely to get to their
                            positions in o rder to w a t c h the match as quic kl y as possible,
                            because you wer e g e t t i n g c l o s e to kick-off? - A. Yes, sir.

                         Q. You knew, therefore, that the y wer e likely to take the most
                            ob vious route to the t e r r a c i n g ? Right? - A. They would take
                            the easi e s t route, sir, yes.

                         Q. And you knew that the e a s i e s t r o u t e was that central tunnel? -

     Q.      Wha t you are sa y i n g is this, that you did not reali se or you
             di d not thi nk that wh en that gat e was opened these people
             wo u l d go d o w n that central tunn e l ? -A. Sir, the situation was
             s u c h that w h e n I was a sked to m a k e that decision and gave it,
             my t h o u g h t pro cesses w e r e all cons um ed in that and did not go
             to the c e n t r a l tunnel.                          -

          j      L O R D JUSTICE TAYLOR:         O nce that flow had started through
             the g a t e and you could see it on the video - we have all seen
             it on the video - was not that a mome nt at which you might
             have g i v e n s ome in st ru ctions to the Officer s on    the concourse
             to try and direct         this flow, after you had mad e    your decision?
             - A. Yes, I m ight        have done, my Lord, but I did     not.

     q   ,         MR. COLLINS:     Why not ? - A. Becau se I was busy watching
             the events and the th ought at that stage did not cross my mind
             to i ssue an instruction.

     Q.       Did it occ ur to you at any time that if a large number of
              p e o p l e w ent d own that cent ra l tunnel they would be likely to
              c ome out s t r a i g h t into pens 3 and 4 and cause overcrowding in
              those pen s? - A. Yes. the re was that possibility, but there is
D             a poi nt here, ands I res pe ct what you are saying.          We have cut
              off the s e q u e n c e of eve nt s as th ough when I issue the
              i n s t r u c t i o n to open that gat e that that is the ceasi ng of the
              problem.

     u.       I am not in t e n d i n g to.     I am si m p l y trying to see what was in
              your mind, whet h e r you thou gh t of this possibilit y? -- A.         On
              the one hand if we cut off the seq ue nc e of events as though
              the ord er to ope n the gat es is the finality of it, and then,
              "Why di d n ' t you do this, this and this?", if we go further in
              my s t a t e m e n t it shows that the si tuation is still devel op in g
              in a cr i s i s sit u a t i o n and I have not got the time to address
              the pr oblems w hich peo pl e may se e here have to be addressed.

              C a n I * T h o p e , put: it fai rl y this way, that the fact of 'the
              m a t t e r -is tha t t h e r e wer e no pre pa ra ti on s mad e and no specific
.T            w a r n i n g s given eit he r to stew ar ds or to Officers', that that
              g a t e was g o i n g to be op ened?      That as a ma tter of fact
              happened?         Right ? - A. I gav e no specifi c instructions.

     Q        You g a v e no s p e cific in st ru ctions.           It did not occur to you.
              th at o n e of the c o n s e q u e n c e s of ope ni ng the ga te would be to
              c a u s e a lot of peop le to go dow n that central tunnel and
              c r e a t e o v e r c r o w d i n g ? - A. I was awa re of the possibilities,
              but I must add we ha ve got to add on the next devel op me nt
              w h i c h takes my min d a w a y .

     G.       J ust be f o r e we come to that, can I say the fact of the matter
              was t here wer e no p r e p a r a t i o n s , but you sa y you simply were
              not abl e in the c i r c u m s t a n c e s to do anything about it beca us e
              of the p r e s s u r e of tim e and the pres su re of circu ms ta nc es ? -
H             A. That is it, sir.         I t h i n k it will come out if I can go to
              the next stage.

                                                                                         55

that at that stage the de ve loping situation within the
g r o u n d had gon e to a s i t uation when I had lost the ootion.

So w h a t you are say in g is that what you believed at the
time you mad e your statement, and presumably at the time
you ma de your deci si on , was         the teams coming out may in
hin d s i g h t not have been.        -  A. No, it may have been coming
o u t for a k i c k - a b o u t as you say.

And th e r e f o r e you may in fact have been earlier, or it may
have been at a time ear li er than 2.54.       It mus t have been
at a time ea rlier than 2.54. - A. Yes.

Co m i n g back to page   10   ....

     LORD JUS TI CE TAYLOR:          If that was right and the
teams had their k i c k - a b o u t and went back off again, the
option w o u l d have reappeared.       - A. 'To delay the kick-off
sir, yes.

          MR. COLLINS:      But by then, having regard to the
e v i d e n c e you gave ea rlier this morning, the events you
told us abo ut e f f e c t i v e l y made it impossible for you to
come to that de cision you are saying.            -  A. Yes.

That is the breakdown of co mmunications ....                  -  A. My
perceotion is brea kd ow n in c o m m u n i c a t i o n s , worsening
situation, 2.47-ish dec id e to take some action, think
a bo ut dela yi ng the kick-off, players out, straight into
the crisis of 2.47.

How you then you tell us w a t c h the Leppings Lane terrace
intently:..for d e v e l o p m e n t s resulting from the gates
opening.    - A. Yes sir.

When: you- w a t c h e d that w e r e you.'aware. of a surge into those
cent r a l pens?           A. No sir.                    ■

I thi nk that there c l e a r l y was such a surge.        You didn't
see it though.   -  A. No.

Was it not clear fr om w h a t you could see, because the
vi deo was still ru nning presumably.    - A. Yes.

And you wer e keep in g one eye on that I imagine from time to
time.       You cou ld see peopl e pouring in still, and you
c o u l d see them goi ng towa rd s that central tunnel could n' t
you?      -   A. I can o nly refer to the compi la ti on video I
have just seen, and the comp il at io n video do esn't indicate
they were po uring towards the central tunnel.

W it h resp ec t Chief Sup er in te nd en t, to anyone who knows the
g e o g r a p h y it is clear be y o n d any peradventure that that
                                                              D.G. DUCKENFIELD




was w h e r e they w e r e flowing isn't it?     And you did snow
the geogra ph y.      -   A. Wh en I sa w the co mp ilation I saw
people w a l k i n g in, orderly, not rushing, not charging
towards a par ticular point, and that was my perce pt io n of
the situation.

But they w e r e all flowing, if you look at the video, in a
di r e c t i o n w h i c h to anyone who knows the ground is in the
d i r e c t i o n of the tunnel w e r e n ' t they? Of course there
wer e one or two who w e r e peeling off in other dir actions
but the vast bu lk was goi ng in the direction of the tunnel
w a s n ' t it.      -    A. I didn't perceive that situation sir.

But if you w ere awa re of the geography of the gro un d you
mus t have p r c e i v e d it.  -  A. I looked at the compilation
and I was su rp rised to see that people were walking, and
the direc t i o n s they w e r e going.

Don't be lieve every t h i n g you read in the papers!       But the
d i r e c t i o n they w e r e going was clearly in the direction of
that tunnel w a s n ' t it?        -  A.  That is not my belief sir.

Where did you think they were going?      - A. My concern was
that they w e r e coming into the ground and I saw them
walking in what I thought was the general directions, and
some were g o i n g through that gateway in the wall.

Let me put at least this:    you were aware that because a
large number of peopl e had come in in a short space of
time that there mig ht be a problem if they went down into
those ce n t r e pens. - A. There is a problem in any pen
when a large number of peop le come in.

But p a r t i c u l a r l y   those centre pens.      - .A. There could be a
dif f iculty .                                                i •

And- t hat i s 'why you wer e keeping, as you s a y , .an •intent
eye w a t c h i n g the Le ppings Lane terrace intently was it?
A. I w a s n ' t looking s p e c i f i c a l l y at the central pens. I
was looking at the terr a c e and the rest of the gr ound as a
whole.

It mus t have o c c u r r e d to yo u that one po ssibility was
o v e r c r o w d i n g in the cent r a l pens resulting from this. - A.
T h e r e was a p o s s i b i l i t y of overcrowding ev er ywhere sir.

Pa r t i c u l a r l y in the c e n t r a l pens.      -  A. It was a
p o s s i b i l i t y but it was a p o s s i b i l i t y of ov er crowding e v e r y ­
where .

You then see a gate, w hich you think was either gate 3 or
gat e 4 , being ope ne d and some people coming out on to the
p e rimeter track.   -   A. Yes sir.

     and a few people com in g out to people beginning to climb
     over the side fences of pens 3 and 4 into 1 and 2 and into
     6 and 7, ri ght? -   A. Yes, clim bi ng over the radial
     fences.

Q. Climbing over the radial fences, that began, and equally
     people began to c l i m b over the front fence, right over the
     perimeter fence.    -    A. Yes.

Q. And that de v e l o p e d fai rl y quickly.       -   A.   Ic devel op ed in
     due course sir.

Q.   Well by very shortly after kick-off that was starting to
     happen wa s n ' t it?     Can I ask you to look for example at
     photograph DS17 in a l b u m 2?       Sorry, DB1714.   That is at
     three o'cl o c k precisely.       Well three o'clock within a
     minute.   It is a n y t h i n g betw ee n 2.59 and 30 seconds and
     three o'cl o c k and 30 seconds I think, to be precise.
     -  A. Yes sir.

     And you can see there someone climbing over the perimeter
     fence can't you?  -  A. Yes sir.

           LORD J U S T I C E TAYLOR:       And the side fence on 17.

           MR.   COLLINS:      Yes,      DB1717:

r
^\• And indeed on DBL717, w hich is at one minute past three,
    we can see q uite a number of people by now who have got
    out on to the p e r i m e t e r by one means or another, and you
    can see people s t a nding up clearl y trying to.get out and
    over the per i m e t e r cencs,      I mean by three o'clock
    e f f e c t i v e l y people had started to try to g e t t h e m s e l v e s
    out of those pens h a d n ' t they?        - A. Yes sir.         :

Q. And    p e o p l e were:
                          - trying to get out of. t h e side"as well. - - ;
     A. Yes . : That" is: no t an unusual phenomenon:- though >"people              ;-
     going over pens at times.

Q. I follow that, but pe o p l e coming over the front, you
     Knew that yo u had people still flowing in at three o'clock.
     Not admi t t e d l y in large numbers by that ’
                                                   o ut there were
     still people coming into the gro un d weren't there?
     A. I don't recall that s p e c i fically sir.

Q.   If you had looked at the video at three o'clo ck you would
     nave seen peop le st ill com i n g into the ground.   I'm not
     sure whether by then through gate C but certa in ly through
     the turnstiles they w e r e still coming in.    -   A. Tha t may
     have been so sir.

Q. You knew you had taken no steps at all to block off that
     tunnel o r*to stop pe o p l e goi ng down the central tunnel.

                                                                                   58

          r e s p e c t of the d a n g e r s of doing that, nam el y that peopl e wou ld
          c o m e in w i t h m i s siles and drink? - A. Yes, sir.

     Q.   Ju st s t o p p i n g   t h e r e for a moment, wha t conce rn s me is this.
          We hav e h e a r d      a lot of e v i d e n c e from peo pl e who entered the
          gr o u n d early,       2 o ’clock, 1.30, 1.45.             They w e r e all searched,
          and of c o u r s e      s e a r c h i n g is a tim e c o n suming exercise, is not
B         it? - A. Yes,           sir.

     Q.   You ar e no t suggesting, are you, that at from 2.45 onwards
          w it h a m a s s i v e cro wd o u t s i d e wait i n g to get in, it was
          c o n t e m p l a t e d that e v e r y b o d y com in g into the gr ound would be
          s e a r c h e d for m i s siles or al cohol? - A. The si tuation at that
          stage, s i r , . w a s suc h that it would not be possible.

     Q.   Exactly.         So w h e t h e r the gat e was ope ne d or wheth er the gate
          was not opened, the sam e pro bl em w ould arise in relat io n to
          d r i n k and m i s s i l e s ? - A. no, sir.      If peo pl e w ere going

          w o u l d h a v e a vis ua l view, or a vie w of them goi ng throu gh the
          turnsti le s, and the y would not if the gate was opened.

D    Q. Mr. Ducken fi el d,            wit h gre at respect, peo pl e don 't usual ly
        ca r r y o f f e n s i v e   weap o n s into a foo tb al l groun d in their hand
        in full v i e w of            a Po l i c e officer, do they? - A. No, but you
        can se e if the y             have a n y t h i n g s t i c k i n g out of their pocket
        like a b i l l i a r d       ball or a beer can.

     Q.   Yes, all right.         Let us ac cept that for a moment.      In ad dition
17        to the p r o b l e m s you hav e just outli n e d and whi ch you properly
          t ook int o account, in favour of open i n g the gat e was the
          d a n g e r to th e c rowd outs i d e of being kill ed ? - A. Yes, sir.

     G.   W h i c h you had been w a r n e d about.    Did you or did you not have
          at the forefront, o f you r mind in a d d i t i o n .to ntissales and beer
          that: the i n c o m i n g fans if the gates were:x>peaedr                   •erSmijghfc'-
          get on to th e t e r r a c e that was alre a d y near ly full? - A. It                 !
          did not s p e c i f i c a l l y cross my mind.  I k n e w t h e y - w e r e gtfihg to
          e nter t h e t e r r a c e as a whole.

     Q.   S i n c e you kne w from your own in sp ection that there wer e no
          w a r n i n g signs and no di r e c t i o n a l signs leadi ng to the two wing
          pens, and s i n c e you knew that the tu nnel was d i r e c t l y in front
          of th e gate, did it not o c c u r to you that th e one thi ng that
          was e s s e n t i a l if th e gates wer e to be op ened was to have
          p e o p l e d i r e c t i n g fans to the win g pen s? - A. Yes, sir, but I
          ma d e th e p oint that oth er a g e ncies who have a r e s p o n s i b i l i t y
          for the g r o u n d and had not seen the lack of s i g n i n g or

    u.    Th e stewards, of course, the S h e ffield Wedn es da y Football
          Club, w o u l d not have a n t i c i p a t e d that gate C would be opened
          10 m i n u t e s bef or e the kick-off. wou ld they? - A. No. sir. but
B         th e s t e w a r d s in that l o c a l i t y would be aware of the d e veloping
          situation.

    G.    Well, that is what I had be tter ask you about.           Unless they
          w er e tol d ho w would they know? - A. I presume an yone in the
          c o n c o u r s e area at that t ime wou ld be aware of the situation
          outside.

    G.    Why w o u l d s o m ebody in t h e co ncourse area be aware that
          s o m e b o d y o u t s i d e mig ht be crushed to dea th against the outer
          w a l l ? - A. Tho se co m i n g th rough the tu rnstiles may have a view
          and e x p r e s s that view.

    G.    That is a fair answer.         How would t hose in the con co ur se know
          that on e of th e op tions bei ng co ns idered by the Police was the
          o p e n i n g of gat e C? - A. Who in particular, sir?   Do you mean
D         the s t e w a r d s ?

    G.    The stewards.               The chi ef steward, the man in charge of the
          s t e w a r d s from S h effield W e d n e s d a y Football Club? - A.
          S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Mu r r a y t ried via his personal r adio’ link with
          S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y Fo otball Clu b to get in touch with Mr.
          Locke, the chi ef steward.                   Unfortunately, he was unabl e to do
          so.

    G. Are you s a y i n g that before th e gate was opened Supe ri nt en de nt
       M u r r a y tri ed to w arn the chief steward to get stewards on to
       the t u n n e l ? - A. S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Mu r r a y spoke or tried to speak
       with mr.. Locke.          The s p e cific time I can't be certain, but
       c e r t a i n l y -at this p a r t i c u l a r mom en t of-crisis.

    G.              LOR D JUST I C E TAYLOR:      I am sorry.   When you had made the
          d e c i s i o n you we re g o i n g to allow the gate to be opened, or
          w hen? - A. About that time, my Lord.              I can't be accurate.  I
          know he spoke.

    G.    What I would like to know is, if he had manag ed to get th rough
          to Mr. Locke, what as you un de rstood it was he going to say to
          him?        That "We are g oing to open the g a t e " , or "We are
          c o n s i d e r i n g o p e n i n g the g a t e ” ? - A. That we were co ns idering
          o p e n i n g the gate, beca u s e I unde r s t a n d an incident had
          h a p p e n e d p r e v i o u s l y w here the Po lice had taken a cours e of
          a c t i o n and not in formed the club, and the club wa nted to know
          about it.            So Mr. Murray, of his own accord, tried to mak e
          c o n t a c t w i t h the club.

    ,Q.        MR. HYTNER:   You see, you appreciate, Mr. Duckenfield,
          so far I have not mad e any cri t i c i s m of the d e c ision to ope n
H         the gate, nor am i g o i n g to m a k e any cr iticism of that
          decision.  There may be c r i t i c i s m of the si tuation that led to
                                                                                          61

        the open i n g of the gate, but that is a dif f e r e n t matter.          Onc e
        you had ha d the request m a d e it mus t have been obvious to you,
        that is at 2.49, it mus t h ave been obvious to you, must nor
        it, that one of the d a n g e r s of open i n g the gate was people
        s w a r m i n g into th e a l r e a d y almost full terra ce ? - A. As I said
        earlier,        sir, the d e c i s i o n I was asked to ma ke and the ope ni ng
        of the gat es was s uch that I was conce n t r a t i n g upo n that, and
        I did not i ssue a d i r e c t i v e a bout the tunnel.

        But this is the w h o l e point, is not it?                       You have said that
        e v e r y d e c i s i o n you m a d e on that d a y was a corre ct one.          You
        ma y not hav e bee n t h i n k i n g a b o u t the tunnel.             What I have to
        put to you is that it was a p lain e rror nor to hav e co ns idered
        the tunnel, and as it tu r n e d out a fatal error ? - a . I
        consider, sir, that at the time I was faced wit h a very
        d i f f i c u l t :situation.           I mad e a d e c i s i o n and I did not
        follow it up w i t h a d i r e c t instruction, but as I said
        earlier, the ra dio was on ta lk -t hrough. Police Offic er s
        w e r e p a t r o l l i n g t h e c o n c o u r s e ar ea and I would hope
        there w ere stewa r d s in that c o n c o u r s e area, and whilst
        I did not iss ue a s p e cific direc ti ve . Polic e Off ic er s
        a r e trained to act on their initiative, and I would
        h ave hoped they w o u l d h ave tak en som e actio n at the
        tunnel.

Q       Let us just deal with you first.                Ever yb od y here sym pa th is es
        with you, I am sure, in having been put into an emergency
        situation.           It wou ld be a harsh person, indeed, who did not
        h ave that sympathy.           What is b e i n g put to you is this, Mr.
        Duckenfield. that in d e a l i n g wi t h that emergen cy you took into
        account very p r o p e r l y so me factors, but having mad e your
        decision, w hich was p r o b a b l y the right one, you completely
        forgot to deal with one of the f oreseeable consequences of
        yo u r d e c i s i o n ? - A. In view of m a k i n g the decision, sir. I did
        not follow it up, but there are Officer s in that area' who I ri
        would have hoDed would have t a k e n a course of action.
    (
Q.      That;.is- a d i f f e r e n t m a t t e r w h i c h I will come t o . - The f a c t
        that you may. h o p e and expect that others will r e m e d y -your :‘              own J
        e r r o r is a s e p a r a t e issue, but, Mr. Duckenfield, can you face
        this p r o blem?         You m a d e a m i s t a k e in fo rgetting this
        consequence, f o r e s e e a b l e co ns equence, of making your d e c ision
        to open t h e gat e? - A. Sir, I d i d n ’t iss ue a dir ec t
        i n s t r u c t i o n to close that tunnel.

G.      But that was an error, was not it? - A. Sir, it was a mome nt
        of crisis, and I was d e a l i n g w i t h a di ff icult situation.

0.      That is accept, but it was a mistake, an error, an omission,
        to have f o r g o t t e n to g i v e an i n s t r u c t i o n to clo se off the
        t u n n e l ? - A. Sir, I am not w i s h i n g to evad e the issue.              I
        have said I did not g i v e an instruction.                    The re ar e man y
        occ a s i o n s as a C o m m a n d e r you giv e instr uc ti on s and you

        is I did not issue an instruction.

                            d i f f e r e n t way s of p u t t i n g this, Mr. Duckenfield.             One is, "I
                            di d no t g i v e the i n s t r u c t i o n b e c a u s e I was entitle d to expect

                            suggested.           T h e r e f o r e I di d not m a k e a mistake*'. The other
                            way of p u t t i n g it i s t ”1 m a d e a m i s t a k e but in fact other
               6            O f f i c e r s sh o u l d hav e r e m e d i e d that m i s t a k e by u sing their
                            in it iative".           Now, w h i c h of th em is it? - A. The latter, sir.

                       G    Y ou m a d e a m i s t a k e but you would have hoped that others would
                            r e m e d y it? - A. Yes.

                       G.   Well, that at least is ver y frank, and I am sorry to have
                            p r e s s e d you to that answer, but it was my duty to do so. Mr.

I ought I think to follow it up by asking you about
O f f icers on the g r o u n d in fairness to them.      You, having
f o rgotten to give that instruction, are you saying that
e ither an Insp ec to r in the c o ncourse or individual
O f f i c e r s w i t h their pe rsonal radios shou ld have realised
wha t was h a ppening and rac ed to the tunnel?          -  A. Y e s , I
w o u l d have e x p ected tha t they w o u l d taka a course of
action.

We kno w that there was one st eward in the concourse, we
see h i m on the video, but he was near gate C.                 Are you
saying that you w o u l d hav e expe ct ed the information that
the gat e was being o p e n e d to have been relayed
s u f f i c i e n t l y to the stewa rd s that they w ould .<now to go to
the tunnel?             -  A. Beca u s e we could n ' t contact Mr. Locke
the only mean s of c o n t a c t w ould have been verbal contact
between the Po lice O f f i c e r s and the steward.

This was an a p p alling break do wn in comm un ic at io n wa sn't
it, that the Police c o u l d n ' t ge t hold of the chief steward
at a critical time.       Do you kno w why the Police could n' t
get h o l d of Mr. Locke?   -     A. Id o n 'c sir.

The whole point of ha v i n g the,        I think he is called the
chief secu ri ty officer, and the          Police on the gro un d is
that they lia is e toget he r don't         they? - A. Yes sir.

How w o u l d those in the c o n c o u r s e have known the state of
packing of pens 3 and 4?         -     A. Pol ic e Officers or
stewards sir.

Both?    -    A. Police O f f i c e r s w o u l d be looking, serial 13
from the top of the W est Stand, for activ it y there and
they w o u l d moni to r it there, but as I have said the
steward Vs r e s p o n s ibility, which is the prime-* •
responsibility/ I can 1c be c a t egoric how- they -would'do it" '
other than looking.

W e r e the O f f i c e r s in the stand, who I accept should have
seen the state of o v e r crowding, w ere they under any orders
to pass on by perso na l radio their assessment of crowding
in the pens?          -    A. Sir specific instructions w ould have
been given to those people by Superi nt en de nt Greenwood,
and I w o u l d expect them, as traine d Police Officers, and
trained in c rowd control, to assess the situation and if
they saw a d i f f i c u l t y rela y that back.

      LORD JUST I C E TAYLOR:      3ut short of either the
Officers or the stewa r d s on the concourse, assuming there
w ere Offic e r s and stewa r d s on the concourse, short of
their being told, "Pens 3 and 4 are getting to be nearly
full" how w o u l d they k now?    -  A. They wou ldn't sir.

                     Q.         MR. HYTNER:            Yo u accep t d o n ' t y ou that once the mass
                          o£ s u pporters w a l k e d - be cause they did walk, they didn't
                          rush - thro ug h the tunnel and into the ov er crowded pens,
                          it is fai r y l a n d to supp o s e that they could turn back when
                          they saw the o v e r c r o w d e d terraces an d push their way back
             B            wit h e v e r y b o d y pu shing forward.       -   A. I don 't know what
                          the si t u a t i o n was sir.

                     Q. Well you kno w crowd s d o n ' t you?         -   A. Yes.

                     Q.   If there    is a c rowd mo v i n g forw ar d down a tunnel ....
                          A. There    isa p o s s i b i l i t y of a diffi c u l t y as you say.

                     Q.   I only have to put that to you you see because in your
                          answe rs to Hr. Co llins you su ggested otherwise, and I have
                          to put to yo u that yo u have giv en wholly unrealistic
                          a s s e s s m e n t s of how pe o p l e can behave in this sort of
                          situation.            I am not g oing to go over the territory
                          alr ea dy tr odden by Mr. Coll in s, I'm sure you will be
                          relieved to know, I just want to see how the matter is
                          s umm ar is ed .       You d i d n ' t really ap pr eciate until far too
             D            late that there was real trouble on the terraces did you?
                                A. Do yo u mea n prior to the stopping of the game sir?

                     Q.   Yes.    -   A.   From my vis ua l in spection     I   wasn 't aware sir.

                     Q.   You see a pit ch in vasion is a term of art, we all .<now
                          w ha t it means.           It is fans del i b e r a t e l y getting out of the
                          terraces and invading the pitch for a purpose, either to
                 E        spoil the game, or to a b u s e the referee, or to go for an
                          o p p osing play er wit h w h o m they        are displeased, or
                          o c c a s i o n a l l y to invade p r o perly to get to the other end to
                          get at the o p p o s i n g fans.         That is a pitch invasion isn't
                          it?       -     A. Yes sir.

                     Q.   You are wel l aware of        that,        A. Yes sir,

                     Q. This was the beg i n n i n g of the game.         There was no incident
                          on the field that c o u l d have pr ovoked anger among the fans
                          and above all the fans never got on to the pitch.              How
                          c ould it p o s s i b l y have been inte rp re te d as a pitch
                          invasion?" -        A. Sir my view fro m the Control Box was such
                          that there was no a b n o r m a l i t y and I qu es tioned in my mind
                          w hy the gat e was opened.

                          Well that is a s e p a r a t e thing.     You are now going back to
                          the very be ginning.        W h a t I have to ask you about that is
                          this:     that kno wi ng full well that you had just given
                          orders to o p e n the gate, an d they c ould be c a l l e d the
                          floodgates / and k n o w i n g full wel l that the tunnel was very
                          muc h in line wit h the gat e, an d knowing that the pens wer e
                          near ly full, again it o n l y w ould ta&gjua chi ld of less than
                          aver a g e i n t e lligence to say, "Well if that has all

     h a p p e n e d and pe o p l e ace spil li ng out of the front of the
     c r o w d it is beca u s e p e o p l e have crow de d into the pens at
     the rear.         T h e r e is o v e r c r o w d i n g in the pen s. " That is
     right isn't it?             -  A. T h a t is your su ggestion sir.          It:
     w a s n ' t my p erception.          I d i d n ’t see any pushing.       I saw a
     s tate of n o r m a l i t y and the gat e opened.

Q.   But it mus t be ob vious m u s t n ' t it that if the gate was
     ope ne d and then peop le w e r e cli mb in g over the fences that
     w hat has h a p p e n e d is that there has been no stopping the
     fans gett in g into the back of the pens.         -  A. The ra has
     b ee n no stopping, yes sir.

Q.   And when the fans d on't go on the pitch but stand
     d o c i l e l y on the tra ck an d walk aro un d in a dazed fashion
     the one thing it plai n l y w a s n ' t was a pitch invasion.
     A. No it w a s n ' t at that stage sir.

Q.   It cl early w a s n ' t was    it?    -    A. No sir.

Q. You see today you have said rather frankly that at some
   s ta ge you rea li se d it w a s n ' t a pitch invasion, but in your
   st at ement at page 12 you said this:

                   "The A s s i s t a n t Chief Co nstable (Operations)
                   Mr. Jack so n, joined me in the Control Box
                   and ask ed for an appra is al of the situation.
                   I was unable to give an accur at e acc ou nt of
                   w ha t the sit u a t i o n was other than a possible
                   pit ch inva si on whi ch had resulted in us
                   stop pi ng the game."

     Now that is after the m a t c h had been abandoned, or at
     least after the game had been stopped.             You still thought,
     and so: t o l d your A s s istant Chief Cons ta bl ey that~it' was a
     possible: pitch inva si on . -        A. Ih fairness ,'‘sir , the ter m
     ''pitch i n v a s i o n 1 was used to descr ib e a cr owd co mi ng'oat of
     the gat e on to the p e r i m e t e r track.

Q.   And it still had not dawned on yo u that they had spilled
     on to the track and c l i m b e d the fence because of possible
     o v e r c r o w d i n g as a result of openi ng the gate. - A. It
     was a p o s s i b i l i t y sir, but at that stage I was waiting for
     information.

Q.   And lastly, can you ex plain a myst er io us message, of which
     we have only hea rd so far from Mr. Collins in his opening
     soeech, but no doubt we wil l hear mor e in due course, at
     fourteen m i n u t e s past three the Po lice told the Fire
     Brigade that fans had broken down or broken through a gate
     and that was the c ause of a major incident.        I have to
     speak from m e m o r y but I thi nk those are broadly the words.
       ■ A. Can you tell me w h e r e that came from?

                                                                                        66

        O. Do you re member Gat e C b e i n g opened at about 2.48 whe n a
           number of   fans cane through? - A. Tha t is correct.

        0. Were you p a r t y to the o p e n i n g of that gate or was that one
           of you r o ther O f f icers? - A. I don 't believe - I was not
           p arty to it - I d o n ' t beli e v e it was an Of ficer on my
           Serial.    The gate did ope n w h e n I was standing up near
    B      to T u rnstile A and of course as it opene d ray attention
           was drawn to it.        I ran, w i t h o t h e r Officers from my
           serial to try and close the gate, w h i c h event ua ll y we did
           do.    The o n l y reason we did do this is because I unde rs ta nd
           there was a Police hor se there and the Police horse cane
           between the fans and Gate C and that assis te d us quite a
           bit and we m a n a g e d to close the gate then.

        O. Can you help us w i t h the nu m b e r of people who came through
           Gate C w h e n it was o p e n e d on tha t ocasion? - A. I said
           initially in the rep or t I mad e p r o b a b l y a couple of days
           afterwards, I said a p p r o x i m a t e l y 50, bu t having wat ch ed
           it on the v ideo there was nig h on 200 easily.

        Q. lie know that Gate C op e n e d aga in ap pr ox imately four or
           five min ut es later? - A. Yes.
D
        Q. A n d on that o c c a s i o n st a y e d ope n for some time? - A. That
           is correct. It was about five minu t e s later.

        Q. H o w close wer e you to Gat e C w h e n it was open ed      the second
           time? - A. Well I think m y p o s i t i o n w o u l d be betwe en
           Tu rnstiles A-G, central position, wh en the gate suddenly
           opened.

        Q. Did you see wh o o p e n e d it? ~ A. No, I was not in a position.
           There was one or two fans a r o u n d that area and of course
           that r estricted ray view.      I hav e no idea wh o opened it,
           if it wa s a Police Officer, a Stew a r d or what, I have no
           idea whats oe ve r.

        Q. Wer e there a n y o t h e r Police Serials wo rking in the area
           i m m e d i a t e l y b e h i n d that gate a part from your Serial 14?
           - A. I did not see anyone.

        Q. Did you  h e a r any tra ff ic on the radio about the opening
           of the gates ? - A. U one what so ev er .

        Q.   Did you n o t h ear an in s t r u c t i o n that the gates shoul d be
             opened? - A. Non e whatsoever".

        Q. Did you hav e any w a r n i n g that the gate would be ope ne d
           and left ope n for the inf lu x of fans? - A. Kone at all.

        Q.   If you ha d known that it v/as goi ng to be opened, was there
             a n y t h i n g " y o u ’w o u l d have done before it was opened? - A.

         w h o come in there is not m u c h I can do wit h ten men.            If
         there is 2,000 it is 200-1, 3,000 300-1 Officers.

    Q.   If the peopl e are w a l k i n g in, as they appeared to be,
         coming in towards the tunnel, do you think you could have
         ha d any effect? - A. It is a d i f f i c u l t question.         I doubt
         it.   T h e y w o u l d p r o b a b l y have just pushed us ou t of the way.

       ever.

       di d o pen there was a surge th rough and I ran again with
       the o t h e r Of ficers in m y Serial towards the gate.          Several

D      rush i n g in.
       gate fell over.
                         A lot of the peop le wh o actu al ly came in the
                             T h e y w ere in da n g e r of being trampled.
       The O f f icers in m y Serial d r a g g e d them clear.      I think
       they all p u l l e d so meone clear bec au se ob vi ously we had
       like a sn ooker ball ef f e c t that whe n someone fell over
       some of us be h i n d it and then we had that situation, so it
       was a case of we had to d rag them away qui ck otherwise we
       c ould have had ....

    Q. Are you talk i n g abo ut the first time or the second time?
       - A. The second time.

    Q. W h e n that crowd had gone throu gh the gates of course there
       were v ery few people left outside, we ren't there? - A.
       Well I d o n ' t kno w that. I di d not see it outside.
       A t that time we rem ained inside the turnstile.

    Q.    Di d         you   hear any m e s s a g e to go to the track? - A.I did
         not personal ly .        It was one of the Officers wit h me.          I
         did not hea r it on the radio.                One of the Officers w h o was
         in m y Serial         says: "We have go t a me ssage to go on the
         p e r i m e t e r track".

    Q.   You see I noticed, if I ma y just put this to you,               Sergeant,
         you say at the top of page 5 of you r statement:

                "Shortly aft er 3 p.m. there was a radio/'fannoy
                m e s s a g e that all Of ficers were required on
                the p e r i m e t e r t r a c k " .

         A.   Yes.

                             Cross-E x a m i n e d by MR.   HYTNER:

    Q. Sergeant, in the co u r s e of duties, parti cu la rl y in crowd
       control and in other e m e r g e n c i e s you are accustomed to
       r e c e i v i n g or ders as it wer e on the ground and obeying them? -
       A. That is correct, sir.

®   Q.   If at som e t h i n g like 2.40 or 2.45 or 2.50, at any of those
         times, if you had receive d a message, "Pens 3 and 4 are full.
         Pens 1, 2 and 5 are v i r t u a l l y empty.    Get spectators
         d i v e r t e d ” , what would you have don e? - A. I would have acted
         on instructions, but I d on't think that is m y re sponsibility
         inside the ground.

    Q.   That may well be. but sup p o s i n g you as a Sergeant were there
         and ther e were just ste wa rd s with ou t a chief steward there and
         you re ceived that ord er ?   Su ppose control had sent you the
         order, "Pens 3 and 4 are full.        It is dan ge ro us to have any
         mor e in.    Make sure the crowds are div er te d to the wing p e n s ” ,
         w hat wou ld you actu al ly have don e? - A. I would have acted on
         instr uc ti on s, sir, like I said.

    G. And wha t would you have done?               A.   I would have tried to get
D      t he m in the pens eithe r side.

    G. Can we see it a little mor e practically.          In the area between
       the t u r n s t i l e s and the stand wall there was you, your serial
       and some ste w a r d s ? - A. There were not any stewards apart from
       the bo t t o m of the stairs to the West Stand, and of course
       t here was one stewa rd on gat e C.

    Q.   I was t h i n k i n g of him be cause we saw him on the video.     There
         was at least him, was not the re ? - A. Yes, and there was
         s o m e o n e se lling progr am me s eithe r side, one up at the side of
         the wall, and one beside gate C selling programmes.

    G. C a n we just ex amine this.          I am so rry to take a little time
       but it is ver y important.            It may well be that you are right,
       a l t h o u g h th ere is some co nflict of evidence, but it may well
       be you are right in say in g that the position of the crowd into
       t h e v a r i o u s pens was noth i n g what ev er to do with you. L e t ’s
       s u p p o s e that is right and it was the res po ns ib il it y then of
       the stewards.          Is this th e position, that when pens 3 and 4
       had be en obs er ve d to be full from the ground side, because
       t ha t is only whe re they can be observed, what could anybody
       have d o n e about it if it was not your res po ns ib il it y and
       t h e r e w ere no steward s in the area? - A. In answer to that
       q u e s t i o n they could have been devia te d or diver te d to the
       flanks at the rear of the West Stand.

    G.   By w h o m ? - A.   I sup po se the Pol ic e Officers if they were
         there.

    Q.   This is what I am rea ll y trying to get at.          Somebody, and it
H        will p r e s u m a b l y be so mebody in control, someb od y in control
         has o b s e r v e d or has been told at 2.40 or 2.45 that the centr^;

                                                         W.C. CRAWFORD


     pens are full, th erefore it is ne cessary to divert fans to the
     wing pens.   If it is not the respons i b i l i t y of the Police to
     do it and it is not your job, and there were no stewards
     there, what could have been d o n e about it?       Are you saying you
     wou ld then have had to step into the breach? - A. That could
     have bee n the situation.

Q.   So far as you wer e c o n cerned it was not your job, and you
     w ould have e x p ected som ebody els e to be doing it? - A. The
     r e s p o n s i b i l i t y is the stewards.

Q. And the re wer e none there? - A. There were none on that
   p a r t i c u l a r bit, yes, apart from the places where I have
   indicated.

Q. Now, that is that situation.               That is si mply a normal crowd
   s i t u a t i o n whe re some pens are full and some are empty.        Now we
   com e to a wh o l l y d i fferent situation.         Suppo se you had been
   told at 2.47, a me ss enger co mes ru nning up to you because the
    radios are off, he has just come from control:                "Mr.
    D u c k e n f i e l d is going to ope n the gates because of the crowd
    outside.            Pens 3 and 4 are full.     Make sure the people coming
    in go to the win g pens.             This is an emergency".    Now, you know
    what the s i t u a t i o n was.      You know who was there.    What would
    you have d one? - A. The only thing I could have done in those
    c i r c u m s t a n c e s is form a line wit h what serial I had across the
  1 top to di v e r t them either side.

Q. Can I h elp you a little, because this is not a case where
   anyone is trying to trap a n y b o d y into an unw ar y answer.      Think
   back and take your time.           Would you have said in answer to
   that, "If Mr. D uckenfield wants me to do that he must send
   reinforcements", or would you have said, "All right, I can do
   it"? - A. That is a d i f f i c u l t q u e stion not kn owing what the
   s i t u a t i o n is outside.   If the y said, "There are several
   t h o usand outside.        They are going to burst in or they are
   g oing to come through gate C if it is o p e n " , I doubt very much
   w h a t s o e v e r if 10 men could contain several thousand people.     I
   doubt ver y much if I could have done anything.

G. You say, "What is going to happen?".       "There are hundreds
   outside, and they have got to be let in through the gate.
   Make sure they don't go into pens 3 and 4".         Are you saying
   your answer would have been, per fe ct ly reasonably, that it
   would have been, "I can't do it with the serial at my
   disposal.       He will have to send me reinforc em en ts "? - A. I am
   not s a y i n g that.  If I was instructed to do it I probably
   would hav e taken my serial up and done it.

Q.   I don't know what briefing you had had, but did you know that
     there wer e gates at the e n t r a n c e to the tunnel? - A. There arc
     wo o d e n gates, yes.

Q. O b v i o u s l y there are dangers in clos in g both those gates
   beca u s e they o pen towards the turnstiles, and if you had shi|#
   them and then there had been a crowd trying to get out of the
   tunnel from the terraces you mig ht not have been able to
                                                                        70 ...

             them against the crowd,              Do you follow?      - A.   I think it is
             the o p p o s i t e way.

                    L OR D JUST I C E TAYLOR:         They open towards the pitch.

    Q.                MR.   HYTNER:       I am sorry, towards      the pitch.   - A. I   was
             g o i n g to   co rrect     you on that, sir.

    Q. Tha t is right,             is not it? - A. Yes,       they open towards the
B      pitch.

    Q.       So if the re is a crowd comin g from the pitch            you c a n ’t open
             th em then ver y eas il y? - A. That is correct,          and then we hav e
             a s i t u a t i o n w h i c h could have been even mor e serious than the
             one we h a d .

    Q. Cert ai nl y.         The first thing you can wi thout any difficulty at
       all is clo se one gate, and that immediately halves the area
       you      h a v e to mo nitor wi th your serial. That is right,     is not
       it?       - A. I d oubt ver y much if that was going to be the answer.
       It could h a v e bee n more dif f i c u l t and it could have been a
       m o r e d a n g e r o u s si tu ation if we had closed the gates, but there
       a g a i n ....

D   Q. No, c l o s i n g one gate. - A. There is only one gate.    It is a
       d o u b l e gate, a wo o d e n gate at the tunnel. There again that is
       for the stewards.          That is not for us.

    Q.       Sergeant, what we are trying to find out is what could have
             been done.          Ar e you sa ying that app re ci at in g the situation at
             the time you r v iew would have been that you would have been
             u n a b l e w i t h the serial and the stewards in the area to seal
             off the tun ne l and point the fans to the wings where there was
             p l e n t y of r oom? - A. Under those circumstances it would have
             b een i m p o s s i b l e to deal wi th a crowd of that size and do what
             you are saying.

    Q.       It is p o s s i b l e ?     - A.   It is not possible.

    Q        It i s n ’t? - A.         I dou bt very much.

    Q.               LOR D JUST I C E TAYLOR:         You would not be stopping them
             g o i n g int o the m atch at all.         All you would be doing is
             saying, "Go rou nd there.             There 's space there".   I quite
             u n d e r s t a n d if you were blocking their way to get in at all.
             T he y m ight say, "Get out of my way.             I've paid.  I'm coming
             i n ” , but w hat is su gg ested is sim pl y that you indicate, "Full
             in here.           Ple n t y of room ro und there"? - A. I can accept that,
             my Lord.           We cou ld have stood t h e r e and we could have tried tc
             d i v e r t them.        Wh ether they would have paid any attention is a
             d i f f e r e n t story.

    q    .            MR. HYTNER:           But you see, Sergeant, what we are looki
              at is a s e r i o u s situation, serious in th e s e n s e it-
              T h e r e w e r e crowds outside.         Pens 3 and 4 wer e full and you
              b e i n g told, "There are hoa rd s co m i n g in.       Th ey have got t o

                    h ave kno wn im me diately that if you fail to keep them out of
                    the tu nnel there would be or was likel y to be a terrible
                    tr agedy in pens 3 and 4 beca u s e of overcrowding.         That would
                    be the c o n s e q u e n c e of faili ng to keep them out of the tunnel,
                    w ou ld not it? - A. Possibly.

            Q. Think carefully.                If you had s e r i o u s l y thought on receiving
               s uch an order that you wou ld be ph ys ically incapable of
  B            c o m p l y i n g wit h it you would hav e said so, and asked for
               r e i n f o r c e m e n t s , would not you ?    You would hav e advised your
               c hi ef that what he was asking was a policing impossibility?
               - A. I think m a t c h control wou ld hav e been aware of the
               situation, but t h e r e again it is a hypothetical question.
               Yes.

            G.      It is hypo t h e t i c a l only beca us e nobody asked you to do it? -
                    A. That is correct.

            Q.      If you had been faced with such an order, if you had thought
                    it was p o s s i b l e to co mply you would have done, and if you had
                    tho ught it was im po ssibly to com pl y you would have advised
                    your super i o r Of ficers so that they could mak e an alternative
                    s t r a t e g y ? - A. That is possible.
   D        Q.| It is not just possible, it is the only alternative. - A.
                Well, but that was not the case, but my co nc en tration was on
                gat e C and s u d d e n l y burs ti ng open.

            Q.               LOR D JUST I C E TAYLOR:      Sergeant, I don't think anybody is
                    c r i t i c i s i n g you be cause you w e r e never asked to do it. - A.
                    That is true.
        E   q   .        MR. HYTNER:   You do un d e r s t a n d ? - A. Yes,      I can see what
                    you are getting at, sir.

            Q.      You must not be too d e f e n s i v e if no body is attacking you.
                    G oing back, I want to deal with this.            At about 2.30 fans were
                    c oming thro u g h the turns ti le s and being abusive, and indeed
                    o bsc e n e in their lan gu ag e to you, but what they were
                    i n d i c a t i n g with their obscenities and ill-manners was that
                    the re was a li ke lihood of s o m e b o d y being killed because
                    o u t s i d e the Police had not got control.       That was what was
                    be ing c o n v e y e d to you in this obsc e n e language, was not it? -
                    A. Yes, that was the message.

            Q. Of course, there is now way I am going to attempt to defend
               either bad manne rs or o bscenities aimed at Polic e Officers,
               but drunk or sober, foul mout h e d or not, these people
               u n d e r s t o o d at 2.30 or believe d at 2.30 that the Po lice had
               lost cont ro l and that fata li ti es wer e a      possibility, and that
               was what was get ti ng them e x c ited? - A. It was after half-
               past-2, sir, whe n the abu se was directed.           Nearer quarter-to.

            Q. Ne a r e r qu ar ter-to.       It was between half-past and q uarter-to? -

         has o d d l y enough been a confl i c t of evidence.     You were there.
         You saw what was happening.           You in fact were very worried and

         Insi de the grou n d ?      Inside th e actual track?

    Q.   Yes. - A. Yes,    I did think the exit gates were a bit on the
         n arrow side.
B
    O. And it was your view, being there, that had they been bigger
       it wo uld hav e he lped the e v a c u a t i o n of the bodies rather than
       h i n dered it? - A. Yes, up to a point, I would think, but th ere
       again mor e people could hav e tri ed to get out and there could
       hav e been a bigger situation.

    Q.   Anyway, it wou ld have as sisted in evacuation,                  the larger the

                          C r o s s - E x a m i n e d bv MR.   JACKSON:

    Q. Wou ld you look for a moment, please, at the fat bundle of West
       Midl an ds photographs, No. 18.              May I emphasise, Sergeant,
       again, no - o n e is a t tacking you, but is not it qui te clear from
       that that by th e use of that p o r t a b l e barrier and the Officers
D      in your serial that there was lit tl e problem for the Force
       that has m a n a g e d the m i n e r s ’ s t r i k e to block that tunnel? - A.
       I d i d n ’t r e a l i s e that barrier was there, sir.

              LOR D JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I don' t know there is any e v i dence
         that it was.   It is on this photograph, but I d o n ’t know
         whether it was at the time.
E   G.            MR. JACKSON:         I think we can se e from the video th ere
         were lines of these po rtable barriers just behind gate C.                I
         think if we look on the line the re I think we will see on the
         video a number of portable, or the re was a v a i l a b l e . ... - A. I
         think those barri er s that w e r e ins id e or close to gat e C were
         blocking the pro g r a m m e sellers.          T here were about 3 or 4 .
         They w e r e being used to stop the fans getting in close
         pr o x i m i t y to the p r o gramme sellers, and that is what their
         pu rpose was.        It was not a n y t h i n g else.




                                  /G.       LORD JUST IC E TAYLOR:         You mean.

                  LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:         You       mean programme-sellers
         needed to have that kind of protection?                  A.   That is
         correct, and this is one of the reasons I put P.C. Burton
         up beside one of the p r o g r a m m e - s e l l e r s . There was another
         one just up alongside the wall and that was being fenced
         off and we had had in previous match es there, Semi-Finalsj
         one or two snatches - you know, takingi the money off the
B        pr o g r amme-sellers and disappea ri ng into the crowd - and
         that is one of the reasons why P.C. Burton was there in the
         first place, supervising.

              MR. JACKSON:             I make it quite c l e a r ,“S e r g e a n t ,
         there is when policing a football crowd a number of
         activities you have to combat which would be outside the
         experience of most people thinking about a crowd, such
         as snatching pr ogrammes and the proceeds from the programme-
         sellers.     A.        We were talking about the actual money
         from the p r o g r a m m e - s e l l e r s .

    Q. Sergeant, if we looked back at the order - you have no need
         to do it yourself - we will find that Serials 14 and S erial
         16 were the two at either side of the Turnstiles A-G.
         A.   Yes, sir.
D
         Serial 16 was outside it.   You have no need to look unless
         you need to particularly.   Serial   16 was outside and
         Serial 14 was inside.  At about half  past two, who was
         your senior Officer?   A.   Inspector   White.   He was in
         charge of us.   He was in charge of two serials inside
         the actual concourse.

E   Q. During the time of the build-up outside,              did you see the
       Inspector at all?   A.   No.

    Q. Do you     actually   know where he was?               No.

    Q. We know that the Sergeant outside was processing a prisoner
       and you, as it were, were the only non-Constable inside.
       A.  There was Sergeant Burns.  He was on the other side
       of the wall.

    Q.   The other side of the wall?          A.    Yes.

    Q.   Sergeant, we have heard an awful lot about  radios going
         down at the same time.    What we have not heard is surprise
         that they did.    No-one - not a single Officer - has added
         to his evidence about radios going down that he was surprised
         or worried.   A.  No.  Well, nothing surprises me in this
         job these days, sir.

    Q.   Do I take it that it was expected that    the radios would
         go down?     A.   Sometimes that does happen.    It has
         happen ed at other football matches, not just Cup Finals'.
         I regula rl y police the Barnsley football matches and it
         has happened there.

    Q.   In particular,      you see,   if we have a chain of command that

                                                                                      74

         W h i c h serial did you comma nd in the 1933 semi-final,     if
         not 14? - A. Serial 15.        I am sorry, Serial 13.

         You then had a larger numbe r of men under your control,
         had you? - A. I had the same numbe r of men.   I hac ten
         PCs.

B   o.   You had been resp on si bl e for the Divis io n of Officers    to
         the stai rc as es going to the various entrances to the
         stands? - A. That is correct.

         In the co urse cf the ex ecution of those duties in 1933
         had you noticed the fact that the tunnel had been closed
         by Police Offic er s at any time? - A. It was closed in
         1933.   The gates were closed, pr obably about twenty
         minutes, twenty-five minutes, before kick-ocf tine.

    0 , You had notic ed that it had been clo ss d - my question was
         'by Po lice O f f i c e r s ” ? Or are you suggesting they just
        shut the gate and went away? - A. Mr              It was a Police
        O f f i c e r who had an ins tr uc ti on to close the 'sate in 1938
        and that Police Ofti<            was PC Lang, 1273.

D                  •a3 JUST I C E TAYLOR:  tie had instruction from
         whom? - A. That I do not know, my Lord.           I do not know
         if it was ave rbal instr uc ti on     or if itwas   an
         instru c t i o n over the radio.    It is difficult to pinpoint
         whs re it had come from.

               M R . GLASGOW:    It ce rt ainly did net come from you?
         - A. I cannot rem em be r that, sir.     It could nave come
         through the     chain ofco mmand like it was suggested
         before, but     I do not recollect it.

         W ha t di d you think he './as doin g it for?     I mean,
          obv i o u s l y because he had been told to, I accept that.
          However, what was the object behin d the closing of the
          tunnel in 1933? - A. I presume bec au se the centre pens
         'were full.         I presume.  I do not know.

         Can yo u think of any otner c o n c e i v a b l e reason for the
         closing of the tunnel before the kick-off in 1933? - A.
         None to my knowledge.

         If that had ha ppened in 1933, did it occur to you in 1989
         w.ien your re sp on si bilities inclu de d the ma in taining of
         order on the terraces, that those pens might fill up
         again in .the w a y they had last year? - A. Like I said,
         initially, if I had that in st ruction then I would have in
         all proba bility closed the gates, if I had had that
         ins traction, but I ne ver had the instruction.          Of
         course, there was a di fferent situa ti on from 1933, a
         dif f e r e n t atmosphere.  It was a comp le te contrast from
         what it was the year before to what it was this year.

    0.    -Was there anyth in g inthe changed atmosphere this year to
         indicate that pans 3 and 4 might not fill up this year in
         the way they had last year? - A. I cannot answer that one
         b e c a u s e .••

    0.    I thought you told us        there was a compl et el y different
         atmo s p h e r e this year. Did you wish to imply by that...
B        - A. I am talking about the gener al atmosphere of the
         supporters.

    0. Has that atmosphere, howev er different, in any way
       con d u c i v e - to your belief that the pens would not fill up
       this year as they had last year? - A. Last year I believe
       that all the fans were in posit io n by, sa/, fifteen
       minu te s before kick-off and virtu al ly the fifteen minutes
       leading up to the kick-of f in the concourse area there
       was v i rtually nobody.         Tnerefore, compared i,?ith this
       year, of cou rs e it was a diffe re nt story.       Last year
       they wer e all in posit io n at that particular time,
       fifteen minut es befo re the game.

    0. This year, at     a time when in the previous year you say
       everybody had     effe ct iv el y been in the ground, you had
D      actually seen     gate C, in your words, burst open and a
       large number      of suppo rt er s run dow n the tunnel from it?
       You saw that      this year? - A. This year?

    0. Yes. - A. when gate C opened...    Did I say in mv
       statement that I presumed- that that is where they headed
       towards.

    Q. You were there, Sergeant, we weren't.   Did you              see where
       tney went or were you not interested? - A. I do              not think
       I actually saw w here they went to?

    0. Uas it not pretty obviously, w ith respect? - A. That was
       a difficult question.   We were pulling a lot of tha
       people who were being trampled as the gates opened.

    Q. They were runni ng through so fast that people were -being
       knocked over? - A. Peo pl e were bei ng knocked over as they
       came in gate C.    Ther ef or e, my Officers were pulling
       them to one side o t herwise the injuries would have been a
       lot greater at gate C.      If you ask me where they went I
       cannot answer because I did not wat ch where they were
       going.

    Q.         LQi\:3 J U S T I C E TAYLOR: I am just looking at your
         statement, the bottom of page 4:

                "Suddenly gate C appear ed to burst open again,
                appro x i m a t e l y 2.50 pm to 2.55 pm, a large number of
                fans ran through into the centre tunnel of the
                Le p pings Lane end."

         - A. Yes, I did say that.     I pre su me if you look at the
         actual thing, gate C is dir ec tl y in line with the central
         tunnel and I pre su me that is where they were all heading,
         but I did not actua ll y see them go in the tunnel.

    Q.         MR. GLASGO":      If I can take it in stages,
         Sergeant.    Did you sea that the first time?             I know you

Q. De aling ge nerally with the 1988 match, were you aware
   of the si tu ation on the West terracing in this sense, that
   there have been some comp la in ts that there was considerable
   crowding, alth ou gh no-one was physically injured?
   A.    I was not aware of that.

Q.   You were aware of no compl a i n t s about any     form of ove r­
     crowd in g? A.   No.

Q. What a r r a n gements were made, as far as you can recall, in
   1988 to try to ensure an even distribution of people on the
   West t erracing?       A.   The same gs this year.

Q.   This year there were    none,    so -■—   A.      There were none:
     last year.

Q. None at all?       A.    None at all -

Q . We have had some evidence, as you probably are aware,
    that in 1988, towards the latter stages before the kick-off,
    there was some sort of a physical barrier put up at the
    concourse end of the tunnel, formed I think by people rather
    than any inan im at e object - a combination of stewards and
    Police - to stop people going down that middle tunnel but
    to go round the edges.       A.I was not aware of that.

Q.   You have heard nothing    of that at all?         A.   No.

Q . Other than, of course, the evidence         that has been given.,
    in the course of this Inquiry-   A.           Yes.

Q.   I cannot put to you at what stage it happened but it would
     a pp ea r to have been towards the latter stages, some time
     shortly befor e kick-off.     A.   As I say, I have no knowledge
     of that, sir.

Q.   So as far as you were aware the strategy was the same in
     1988 and 1989, namely let the fans find their own levels
     on the West terracing.    A.  Yes, sir.

Q.             LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Can you just help me a moment?
     Have you got the thick bundle of West Midlands Police
     p h o t o graphs?   A.   Yes, my Lord.

Q.   16 and 17.   They show the entrance       to the tunnel,     do they
     not?   A.    That's right.

Q. And they show a barrier there - a temporary barrier - you
   can see in pr ofile in 16 and you can see it again in 17.
   Pres um ab ly that is there, is it, to enable that entrance
   to be shut off temporarily, or, if not, what else is it
   there for?      A.  I am not quite sure why those barriers
   are there, my Lord.

Q.   There is only one there,        I think, the one I am looking at.
     A.   There are some more        off to the side on Photograph 17.

                                                                            78

Q. Ag ainst   the wall,    yes,   that is true.       A.    Yes.

Q. But there seems to be one  by the tunnel there.   That
   could easily be used to shut off the tunnel, could it not?
   A.   Yes.

Q.         MR. COLLINS:     Whether or not that particular barrier was
     there on the afte rn oo n in question, it would not have been
     di fficult to pro vi de for some form of temporary barriers to
     be ava il ab le in order to shut off the tunnel, or restrict
     access to the tunnel, should that become necessary.
     A.    That's right.

Q.   It is simply   that, it appears     that that manoeuvre was nevex              ;.
     thought of.     A.    No, sir.

Q.   That is right, is it?        So far as 1988 was concerned, you
     say in your st atement that apart from minor problems of •
     dru nk en ne ss , theft, discharge o f a pyrotechnic during the
     match, the game passed off without serious incident.
     A.     It came to my rec ol le ct io n after I compiled this
     stat em en t there was a stabbing in Hillsborough Park.

Q.   That is outside.       A.     That was outside-but.it         involved
     football fans.

Q. And there was, of course, a pitch invasion, as we know,
   at the end of the match.      A.   Well, I have heard that
   evidenc e but I cannot sp ec ifically remember it myself.

Q. Well, it does not sound as if it was a very serious one,                   by
   all accounts.   A.   I think Liverpool had won the Semi-
   Final tie and that was the result.

Q. A bit of o v e r - e n t h u s i a s m by a small, number of fans.
   A.   Possibly.

Q.   In 1989 you knew that you were to have the same fixture
     in the same ground and it appears from the evidence we
     have heard that effec ti ve ly the same plan was used.
     A.  Yes .

Q.   The only modifi c a t i o n s being you switching with M r . Greenwood :
     and some m o d i f i c a t i o n s of man-powex basically. A.  That's .
     right.

Q. What I want to ask you about is this:              you were responsible
   for the Liver po ol fans, effectively;            is that right?
   A.   T h a t ’s r i g h t .

Q.   And that is responsible, is it, for bringing them from
     where ve r they arrived in Sheffield or to covering their
     movements, I sh ould say, from wherever they arrived in
     Sheffield to the ground entrance?     A.   We had a dual
     role as well and that was to look after the local population
     and see that traffic moved with the minimum of inconvenience

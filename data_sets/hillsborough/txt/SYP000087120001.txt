             a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3. 1 0 p m   <1510)     and a l t h o u g h        there was a handful              of    people
                                                                                                                         P AGE            2

            outside      the gr o u n d there was              no sericSxs conge s t i o n whatsoever.



            A p p r o x i m a t e l y 3 . 15pm    <1515),      the same       date,     our Serial          was     d i r ected      up

             into the West S t a n d where we                  took     up varying        positions         thro u g h o u t   the

            stand.        I went      towards        the front        of the stand,           to the        right    hand side

            w h e n facing      the    pitch,       where      numerous       people were           crouched down           in the

            aisle and        in front       of     people      o c cupyi ng seats         on the front             row of the

            stand,      none    of these          people      had stand       tickets        and had        in fact     entered

            the stand by people                  hoisting      them from the           standing are a up into                  the

            West Stand.           As we a p p r o a c h e d        these   people     they     continued to            lift m o r e

            fans      up into the stands.                   On speaking       to them a number               of them were

            abusive      towards       other       fans,     who m they were          o b s t r u c t i n g and two youths

            did      in fact urinate             in the front         of the     stand.

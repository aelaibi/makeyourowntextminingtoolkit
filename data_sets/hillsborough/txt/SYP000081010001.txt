             I am the above person and 1 reside at the above address with my

             parents,      one brother,                      who is 8 years old, and two sisters,

                       , 17 years, and                      3 years.

             I am employed as a 'Second ChtlrF* at_

                                          in Romford,

             I    am a,Liverpool Football Club supporter ^ nd I have been such a

             supporter for nearly 12 years.                        I am a season ticket holder and I

             travel to the majority of the team's home and away games.                                            I ,used to



 V*
      /      be a member of the London branch of the Liverpool FC Supporters' Club

             but my membership lapsed at the end of the 1987-1988 season.

             In the main,        I used to travel to the matches on my own and if I

        In about the month of October           1987 <001087),                      I caught a train from
                                 r'   ...                ......................



        London to Liverpool     to watch a home game against Queens Park Rangers,
    h   On the train I met a woman who started talking to 1  me

        Inger SHAH^v She was with her two children,          and                                     "l/

                                                       We all started talking together

        about football as they were Liverpool           supporters as well.

W   3   After this time when we all went to matches we would travel                                   to ge t h e r .

        This would be to most matches.

        On the morning of Saturday the 15th of April                                1989 (150489)^/1 went to

        the FA Cup Semi-Final     game between Liverpool and Nottingham Forrest,

        the match was to be played a t Hi 1 1 sborough ,/the home of Sheffield

        Wednesday.     I left home at about 6.20 am <0620) and caught a bus to

        Romford.      I then caught a scheduled Network South East train to

        Liverpool Street Station and a tube to St Pancras/Kings Cross S t a t i o n ,

        The station has an open court area near to the entrance to the
                                                                  tU S rfO ^

                                      at 8.15 am (0815).     They arrived at 8.20 am

        <0 S 2 0 ).         didn't go with us and neither did                                                    had

         plit up from us a few months earlier after an argument and

        couldn't get a ticket.

        We caught the 8.35 am <0835)           train direct to Sheffield^ this was an

        ordinary scheduled train,           not a football            special.               We all went   in one

        carriage and sat down together.            I would estimate that about one

        hundred fans caught the same train as us.                                 I saw some fans drinking

        cans of beer and lager indeed each of the adults                                in the party had a

        couple of cans each.      In ge r's son,                             didn't drink anything,           he's

        only 13 years old.

        There was no trouble on the train at all and I didn't see anyone who
                                                                           PAGE     3
                                                                           S2527

was drank.      We had all got £6,00p Leppings Ln standing tickets.          We

had all got them via oar season tickets.

The train made only scheduled stops and we arrived at the main

Sheffield Station at 11.15 am (1115).        We had arranged to meet more of

our friends from Lincoln at the railway station.         We waited until

nearly 12 noon < 1 2 0 0 ) but their train was delayed so we decided to

make our way to the ground.

We used the buses that had been laid on straight to the ground.              The

bus dropped us all off at the Leppings Ln end at about          12,20 pm

< 1220).    There w e r e n ’t that many fans about at the time,   there weren't

any fans queuing at all.                                    j

We decided to hang about outside the Leppings Ln tdNrnstiles for our

friends from Lincoln to arrive.              and I went for a walk to fetch

some   chips.    We c ou ldn ’t all go in because _____ hadn't got his ticket

with him,    one of his friends from Lincoln had got it.

At about    1.00 pm (1300)           and I were bored with waiting about

outside the ground and we decided to go in.         At this time there were

about one or two       fans at each turnstile.

There was a very       large police presence outside the turnstiles     and we

were searched as       we approached the turnstiles.    Ialso saw one or      two

stewards hanging       about.   We handed our tickets in and had thestubs

taken off.      Beyond the turnstiles we were searched again.       We had

arranged with Inger and the rest to meet behind the goals.            Indeed, we

.had all stood there together      in the same location at the same fixture

the previous y e a r . ^ / j

We went to the tunnejf and walked down it.        I ca n’t remember seeing any

police officers or stewards       controlling the end of the tunnel.        The

tunnel was completely clear of people.        We walked to the end of the

tunne 1 and then to the right into pen \3\//we waIked over to the far

right of that pen, against the side fence into pen 2.           We stood
                                                                                        PAGE       4
                                                                                        52527

        against the barrier nearest to the front emergency fence

        At about      1.30 pm <1330),  Inger, Marrian and 1       I joined us at the
                                                  Kifty     a/ i u i<r
        barrier.        There three friends, Steve QATES,                  and his
                                  /k u q z  5zi3<a>.
                                  ______ also joined
        friend who I only know as _______also  joins us.            At this time the

        terrace was getting full but it was quite easy to move about

        j~ ve ryone except me,            and         went and s tood against the fence at

        the front of the pen;         this being where they always    preferred to stand,

                          and I stayed against the barrier until around 2.15 pm

        (14 15 )■     At this time I could still just about see the rest of our

        friends at the front of the pen.             At 2.15 pm <1415) we, that    is

               and I , decided to go to the very back of the pen as,           because of

        the presence of the main fence,            we could n’t see the Leppings Ln goal

        eas i l y .

        We moved to the back of pen 3 .            We all stood with our backs to the

        concrete wall,       roughly six feet in from the fence that separates              pens

        2 and 3.        By this time you had to push your way about to get where you

        wanted to stand.

        As time went on the Forrest fans were singing songs.              We also sang

        songs and chatted away as the atmosphere grew ready for the game.                     I

        wasn't aware of anything strange going on at all.

^^^The         teams came onto the pitch and the t^ayfe^ kicked o f f .     At kick-off

U   J   time, 3 . 0 0    pm (1500),   the crowd felt tightly packed to me at the back

        but I still wasn't aware of any problems            at all. The   crowd pressure

        felt    like a normal    ’K o p ’ crowd.

        I d i d n ’t see or experience any crowd surge or any stream of fans

        pour i ng onto the terrace but from kick-off time pressure built-up

        dramatically in the crowd. / I d o n ’t know        why.

        I saw BEARDSLEY hit the b5r at the other            end of theground but        I

        d i d n ’t notice any surge     in the crowd.

        The first thing that came to my notice            in the crowd was when I saw
                                                                             PAGE             5
                                                                             S2527

someone climbing onto the front f e r u ^ from the pitch and shout for us

to move b a c k .   This man was a normal supporter.       I couldn’t work out

what was going on.       My initial   reaction was that they wanted to put

more fans into our pen from off the pitch.

I could n’t move back anyway as the wall was still against my back.                       I

saw the game stopped and the players          left the pitch.     I thought that

they would only leave for about 5 minutes,          then L saw fans being

pulled up from around me into the seating a r e a ^ s b o v e .    This d i d n ’t

mean a lot ot me as this had happened a lot the previous year when

lots of fans had been pulled up into the seats area,              I simply thought

it was happening again.

I still didn't know why the game had been stopped,            I thought that         it

was a bit of crowd trouble and the referee wanted the teams off the

pitch for the crowd to settle down.

All of a sudden, a uniformed PC pushed his way onto the terrace near

me from the right-hand side      (pen 2 ) .   He was shouting loudly,       "Fucking

get out the way," and pushing fans into pen 2.            He shouted,    "Fucking

move," and continued to push people into pen 2.            I would estimate that

he pushed about/ 50 or so fans into pen 2.          M e , ______ and        went

into pen % asfd only then could we see that people were being crushed

against the fence at the front of the pen.

people were being 1 ifted over the dividing fence between pens 2 and 3 ,

        and         made their way through the crowd in pen 2 and ^through

an open gate onto the pitch.          I couldn’t get through the crowd easily

so I waited for about 20 minutes and then got onto the pitch through

the emergency gate in pen 2 .

I looked around the pitch for my friends.           I had met Steve GATES on

the terrace of pen 2 and he was apparently okay except for the fact

that he had hurt his chest badly.          I think that he had broken three

ribs.

                  We walked onto the pitch and found                   He again seemed okay but I

                  understand that later it transpired that he had had internal                injuries



                  We then found          t            friend.    He was okay.     I asked       where

                           was and he said he'd gone to find his mother.            We next found

                           on the pitch and he was okay.               told me that           had gone

                  with a policeman to find Inger,          his mother.

                  We all went round the pitch as a group,            trying to find Inger and

                  Marrian.     On the pitch we all met                    We also found Marrian's

                  coat on the pitch immediately behind the goal.                We were told by the
          v       pol i ce that we could n’t touch anything. ^ 1         saw one fan col l'ecti ng

                  coins up from the floor of the terraces^.            He was arrested and taken

    vtA         leeway by the police.        This was the only incident that I consider to be
    ^I    o x y                -------
                    criminal offence.                     ft &

                           id all go home.    We all left the pitch and caught the buses back


           6         the railway station.        As we were on our way to the station, a

                   us load of Nottingham Forrest fans pulled up alongside us and started

                  shouting,    "Play dead," "Die," and things         like that at us.      A police
          v\
            3     officer told us to ignore what was being said,

     \            At the railway station we approached a policeman who gave us the

                    1ephone number of the local hospitals.             We tried to ring them but we

4             * c o ul dn ’t get th r ou gh , so we    caught a taxi and Steve and I went to the

      ■p          hospital,     I gave         my ticket for the train as Inger had got his.

                  Steve and I arrived at the hospital.             A nurse asked us who we were

                  after.     They couldn't help us though.         We stayed at the hospital for

                  nearly two hours,      talking to vicars and social workers who were trying

                  to fix us up with accommodation for the night.                I got a message home

                  from the hospital.

                  We left that hospital and a social worker took us to another h os pit al.

 We arrived at the second hospital at about 8 pm (200]]                      We again gave
                                                     /
 all the details of Inger and Marrian but to no a v a i l.              We hung around

 there for about an hour,              then the social worker took us,       in his car,

 to the police station near to the fo otba^j/ground.

 A policeman took a statement from both of us to identify Inger and

 Marrian.        The police took us to a b o y cs club where the police had made

 available        ’phones to use free of charge.         We met         at the b o y s ’

 c 1u b .                seemed okay but he was very concerned over finding his

 mother and Marrian.

 We all sat about for some time making               ’phone calls to family and

 friends and drinking tea.               There would be about one hundred of us.           At

 about      1 . 4 5 am    <0145),   on the Sgunday morning,   the police put us all

 into buses and took us to the ground. ^
                                     .O A A J tt
 The police took us to the gymnasium/that was being used as a temporary

 mortuary.

 As a group of the three of us, we looked/at some photographs and we

 had pointed out pictures of Inger and jnarrian.

 A policeman asked if one of us could/go into the mortuary and identify

 the bodies of Inger and Marrian.               We all   refused at first thep/,Steven

 OATES agr ee d.          He w e n y with the policeman and a social worker to

 identify the bodies

 We were then put m             an ambulance and taken to another      club and given

 more to drink.            We all stayed with the social worker that night and

 then the ne:«t day the social               worker drove us home.   Steve    caught the

 train back to Liverpool              on his own.

 At no time during the whole incident did I come to any physical                    harm

           We     left                  at about       1045 hrs on the S a t u r d a y morning,           picked

                     up in Liverpool.              We t ravelled       in a private           car and our       route

           took     us along          the H & 2 , and then along A roads,              via Huddersfield,              to

           Sheffield.     purposely avoi de d the recognised r j o u t e to S h e f f i e l d to

           avoid traffic delays, but were s ub jected to o n y delay on the M & 2 , due^

           to heavy traffic.                  We stopped on route to Shs/pfield,                 at a public

           house,        near Sheffield,          about    10 miles        from^-he City,        for a break and

           refreshments.              We each had two         pints an d /he        driver      had two       pints

           of Shandy,         the      little    lad had soft        drii



           We a r r i v e d   in S he f f i e l d at about       1413 hrs and         parked the        car    in a side

           road off Halifax Rd,                 the main A61.         I saw no Police           dir ec ti on or

           escort        from where we          parked the      car to the       ground,       h o w e v e r , we had

           been to the ground the                 previous year,           and knew where we were             going.

           Any on e who       had not been before             could have followed the                crowds,     there

           were     lots of       people there.           I saw the occasional               fella drinking a can

           of beer,        but    I must       stress    I saw no droRkeness           or disor de rl y behaviour



           We     got to the entrance             of the grouri/ between             1430 and      1435 hrs,      a nd     I
S .O .£
           just     saw a mass of             people    infront /if the        e n t rance    to^ the ground,

           spilling        out    into the       road,    t h ^ r y were    no o r d e r l ^ q u e u e s , I never      saw

           a n y stewards         outside       the ground.         I saw t h r a e / mo un te d Police Officers

           who     had    positioned their horses              one    in front      of each blue         gate.          Thii

          . was    having     very      little effect        on the    crowd^      incontrolling         them    in

             rderly queues,             and    in my opinion more Police              should have been

           present,        and the       crowd formed        into    queiy&s awa y from the main entrance

          gates,        whilst)_____ took           his    son to the turnstiles.                 It soon became

          a p pa r en t    that with the mass              of   people we were            unable    to stand       in one

          spot,     there was a lot of               congestion and we had to move away,                          it was

          obvious,                w ould not        be able     to find j f s , and we thought we should

          try a nd get          into    the ground o u r s e l v e s / b e c a u s e       of the difficulties

          there     seemed to be.             The    lettering        o f the turnstiles was confusing,                        A,

          C , B and we wanted the 8 turnst iilesf.                          We had m oved back            into the       crowd

          outside         the blue gates,           at this     point there          seemed to be an urgency-

          felt     by the       crowd,       because      there w a s n ’t m uch         progress towards          the

          t ur ns ti les and         people were worr ie d they were going                        to miss       the match,

          At this         point     I heard a m o u nt ed Police Officer                   shout at the          crowd

          “ It's    only your          own    people      causing the        crushing” .



          ^ e was       doing a b s o l u t e l y   nothing     to    control       the    crowd,    and       it seemed to

COMM^/V/Tme     it was      the fault        of the Police           to ensure       orderly queues were

          formed.          A t this     point we       lost                              in the    confusion,          which

          left myself and                                 together.         We were trying          to make       for the

          t errace        turnstiles,         but   I noticed that           the    blue    perimeter          gates    for

          the West S tand were                closed,      but that one of the gates                 for t erracing

          was    still      open.       A m o u n t e d Police Officer             shouted to the          crowd,       "Bear

          to your         right" and         so by-passing          the turnstiles.           This <^T did,            all    of

          a s udden there was an ease                     in the     crush and we were aijie to walk

          forward without any difficulty.                           We found ourselves jneading towards an

                   having      gone down the tunnel            which we had free p a s s a g e       along,    we were

                   in concrete,         in other words         there was       no m ov em en t whatsoever.        I

                   im me di a te l y   realised we        had a problem and           it was more    congested than

                   you w ou ld find at other              football     matches.       The    crushing was u nbearable

                   from the      point when we got out             of the tunnel         onto    the terracing and

                   hit    the mass      of people       in front     of us.      I landed with my        left arm over

            front       fencing.        They were       telling          him to open the gate and              let       people

            out to relieve          the       pressure.           I saw    people at the front           trying          to

            climb out of the             pen over the fence at the                   front,     but this       seemed

            very difficult,             and    people were          getting    t h e i / clothes       caught and torn

            on the       railings.        Some       people,       teenagers, / e r e       being    passed over              our

            heads       towards    the front and the P o 1 i c em yi was                   opening     the    gate to

            There was       no surge          in the    crowd during          this time,        I think       I stood on

            the same       concrete       in front          of                 , throughout all              this       time



            As   time went        on people were             getting more and more distressed,                          and were

            in fear       of their       lives,       I certainly felt             like this.        People were              now

            gasping       for air,       and    crying       out    in pain.        I remember a small man                    in

            front of me who had his                   head       lodged under my        chin,    who    never made any

            sound       or movement       throughout             this ordeal.        I c o u l d n ’t see     the man's

            face       because    he had his back to me,                   but a large man who           had his elbow

            in my       ribs whom       I ’d asked      could he help me             by moving       his elbow,           w h i ch

            he couldn't          he told me at this                time,    that    this    little fella was              in a

            bad way.



            I w ould describe            this man as white about 5'6 tall,                       slim build,             I c a n ’t

If/soff     really say the age,                he w a s n ’t younger         than 20 years of age,              but not

&i£.T7n<—   older       than 50 years          of age.           He had short,       straight       dark hair,

            possibly thin on top.                    I c a n ’t tell you what          he was wearing,              I

            c o u l d n ’tsee    his body,       the    thing       that    stuck    in my mind was           that he was

            motionless,          throughout          this    time,       I w ould go as far as saying                   the

            pressure       of the       crowd was       holding          this man up,        I would have           loved to

            have       helped    him,    but    I c o u l d n ’t move my arm to give him a lift up,                                and

            out of the          crowd.

was    telling       him to hold on,            e v en tu al ly    it became       clear to me that            he

was    in danger         of loosing       his    life.       I looked over my shoulder,                  and    I

saw he was         frothing at the m outh and his eyes were bulging,                               his    face

was a s h e n      in colour.       The    crowd seemed            to quell around me a little

bit,    enough for me          to shuffle my feet,                 it took me about three minutes

to do a       180 degree       turn and face                        I m a n ag ed to do a bit of

pushing       shoving and dragging at him and event ua ll y                          I made enough         room

for him to duck under               the bar,        where upon        I said to him          "Let's      get out

of this       pen as quick as we            can".



W i t h the help of some            other       supporters we made            our M a y to the fence

d ividing Pens 4 and 5, arid supporters                           on the otheyr side         put their

hands     through the fencing,              we were able            to put jSur      feet    in their      hands

out,    because       everyone      in P en 6 kept           loo\ir/q at us,                 was   covered          in

sweat and          looked really bad,            I must      have    looked the same.              It was a

terrible        experience,        I felt       pain in my ribs,            but    I w a s n ’t ser io us ly

p h y si ca ll y    injured.       1 have a few mental               scars    though.        It was

d is tr ess ing      to w atch     people       being     given the kiss of            life and having

their     chests      pumped.       As time went            on 1 began to          realise    lots of

people had died,            and how       lucky             and     I had been.         I saw dead bodies

on the     pitch with        coats over          people's         heads.     The man      1 could describe

is the one          I m e n t io ne d earlier,        and    I don't       know what h ap pened to him,

of    course,       I didn't see his face though.



        and     I left the        ground on the dir ec ti on of a loud speaker

                announcerrtjent, whatever              time    that was.         We met    up with my brother and

                his   son inside         the grounds, and we met                                     as we wa lk ed back

                to the    car.         Everyone       in our      party s ur vived the disaster,             fortunately.



                I feel    that     the       pens were       a bad    idea,    the fencing        running    from the

                front    to the back of the                 pens,    prevented     people moving          to the sides           of

                the terracing,           when       I got    in Pen 6,       I was amazed to find there was

                plenty of        room.        I feel    this was a factor             in causing      the deaths of

                those    people.

                I thought        the    public address            syste/i was     very    poor,    and    people       c o u l d n ’t

                I'm of the        view,       if they       could have       filtered     people     into the ground,

                a nd gone    in orderly,             then the disaster w ould             not have happened,

                because     then there would have been an even dis tr ib ut io n of supporters

                Having got        in the ground,            and     in the    crush     in Pe n 4,    I felt the^-

                initiative and           let the       people out,          thereby     relieving the       pressure          in,

                Lhe pen.         Everyone was          screaming at him to dfi this,                 but he seemed ve/ry

                '•eluctant to          respond       in this way,          probably /wai t i ng for       instructions,!

                but surely where              it's a matter          of    life or/death,      then an Officer

                should act        of his       own initiative             in the?** circumstances.


 Am             I w ould just          like to add that four out of the five who went                             to

                g round together             came    back with their          tickets.

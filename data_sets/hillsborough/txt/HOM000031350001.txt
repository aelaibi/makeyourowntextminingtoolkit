Summary

3.       I met Lord Justice Stuart-Smith today and explained the purpose of the
examination. He will confirm on Monday whether he is willing to do it The draft
statement, which has been agreed by the Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers
explains that while you (Home Secretary) do not believe there is any new evidence
you believe it right that the material should be independently examined. You will
also wish to consider the proposed arrangements for giving advance notice of the
announcement to interested parties. Because of other business in the House, the
start of the week beginning 30 June is now more likely for the announcement.


f:\oppu\hou\longsub\pp0244pddoc
  Recommendation

  4.        That you approve:

                        the draft oral statement

                        the proposed handling arrangements.

  Consideration

  Lord Justice Stuart-Smith

 5.      I met Lord Justice Stuart-Smith this afternoon. He was not immediately
 enthusiastic about the task but fully appreciated that a judge of his seniority is
 required. He wanted to reflect over the weekend and will confirm on Monday if he is
 willing to take on the task. If he agrees - as I expect him to - a substantial court case
 beginning next week and commitments in America in August mean that he could not
 devote himself full time to the work until the start of September. This is no
 disadvantage, because it will allow interested parties time to prepare representations
 which they wish to submit.

  Oral Statement

 6.     The attached draft statement is largely factual. It explains that you do not
 consider that any new evidence has been submitted. To say otherwise would be to
 invite the question why a new inquiry was not being established. But it makes clear
 that you consider it very important that the material should be independently
 considered.

j Eorewarnina interested partitat

 7.       We suggest that the following need to be forewarned:

The Hillsborough Families

8.    You should probably see the families shortly before the announcement is
made. This includes the representatives of the Hillsborough Family Support Group
and the families who have made direct representations. They will need to be invited
a few days before the day of the announcement although they would not be told
what you intended to say until the day of the statement itself. You may wish to see
them in the House immediately before the statement so that they can then go to the
Gallery to watch the announcement being made.




f:\oppu\hou\longsubpp0244pddoc
   Merseyside MP<s

          We do not recommend that the MPs be informed before the families. It is
   clear that the families will feel aggrieved if they themselves are not first to be told.
   You could see the MPs at the same time as you see the families.

   Opposition Home Affairs spokesmen

  10.   You will wish to alert the Shadow and Liberal Democratic Home Affairs
  spokespersons.                   ______

  Ssuth Yorkshire Police

   11.   We should give the South Yorkshire Police 48 hours notice of the
  announcement. I propose to speak to the Chief Constable in confidence and to give
  him a copy of the terms of reference - partly so that they can make arrangements to
  keep former chief superintendent Duckenfield away from media attention. It is right
  that the chief constable should receive the terms of reference before the statement
  because they refer directly to his role as disciplinary authority.

  Mr McBride

 12.   You have previously indicated that you wished to inform Mr McBride in
 advance. We assume you will want to make contact with him on a personal basis
 and confidential.

 Handling

 13.    The media (especially regional media in Merseyside and Sheffield) will need
 to be teed up. CD will be putting forward separate advice on media handling.

 l i ming

14.     The business managers offered Monday or Tuesday as possible dates At
best that would mean giving 24 hours notice to the families, or trying to contact them
over the weekend, to make arrangements to travel to London. Given that they have
been waiting several months for a decision, I think it would be insulting to give them
such little warning when there is no compelling need to make the statement urgently.

15.     The business managers’ alternative is the start of the following week 30
June. That has the disadvantage of allowing speculation over the previous weekend
- and pushes a little further back a possible announcement of the police community
relations inquiry - but I think that is greatly preferable to rushing out a Hillsborough




f:\oppu\houUongsub\pp0244pd.doc
    statement in a way which would seriously upset those directly concerned. I propose
    we should confirm to the business managers that you will make a statement on
    Monday 30 June.

   DRAFT:                20 JUNE 1997




   DRAFT ORAL STATEMENT FOR THE HOME SECRETARY




   With permission, Madam Speaker, I would like to make a statement about the
   Hillsborough Stadium disaster.


  2.           On 15 April 1989 95 people lost their lives in the Hillsborough disaster. That
  was more than eight years ago but no one who saw the news reports on that
  dreadful Saturday will have forgotten those terrible events. For those who lost loved
  members of their family, the pain is ever-present. Following Hillsborough, members
  of this House were united in ^d e te rm in a tio n to do all in ouifpower to prevent
  anything like that ever happening again.


  (>)         Public inquiry


   3.         Madam Speaker, following the Hillsborough disaster a number of inquiries
 and investigations took place, looking atjaspects of the tragedy. Pefhaps-'jhe most
 thorough and wide-ranging was the Publiclnquiry led by 'Lord T a ^ o r/ The terms of
 reference of that Inquiry encompassed not only inquiring into the events but also
 making recommendations about crowd control and safety at sports events. Lord
 Taylor’s Inquiry took oral evidence from over 170 witnesses at public hearings during
 May and June 1989 and considered many hours of video evidence from different
sources. In his interim report in August 1989, Lord Taylor found that the disaster
had a number of causes. He did not attribute aH the blame to a single cause or
person, but in paragraph 278 he made clear that:


             “The main reason for the disaster was the failure of police control”
      |      /JZH- ’-~V-'          ,v\ .
4. ^ Lord Taylor made 43 immediate recommendations. His final report in January
1990 made a further 76 recommendations. The improvements which have taken


f:\oppu\hou\diafts\pp0232pd. doc
      place since then in safety at football grounds and in the policing of football matches
      have been based largely on those recommendations. Football in this country has
      been transformed since the Taylor Report. To a laige extent that is due to his wide-
    reaching and soundly based conclusions.


    (»)        Coroners IngiiP^



   5.          The deaths which occurred on 15 April 1989 were also the subject of inquests
   conducted by the Coroner of the western district of South Yorkshire.


   6.          Madam Speaker, as hon Members will know, an inquest is a fact-finding
   inquiry, conducted by a Coroner in front of a jury, and aimed at establishing the
   answers to four important questions, namely:


              the identity of the deceased;


              the place of death;


              the time and the date of death; and


              how the deceased came by his or her death


 7.        The Coroner's rules require proceedings and evidence to be directed solely at
 finding answers to these four questions.


 8.        The jury at the Coroner's inquest after examining the evidence, found in
March 1991 that the cause of death of those who died at Hillsborough was
accidental death.




f:\oppu\hou\draftsVpp0232pAdoc
      (in)        Mtest Midlands Police Investigation


      9.         A further investigation was conducted by the West Midlands Police
     supervised by the Police Complaints Authority, to establish whether there were any
     grounds for criminal proceedings and to consider whether any police officer should
     be subject to disciplinary proceedings.


     10.        That investigation involved the taking of over 5000 statements and the
    scrutiny of all the material which had previously been examined by the Taylor
    Inqurry.          After that investigation evidence was sent to the Director of Public
    Prosecutions, who concluded that no person should be subject to criminal
    proceedings.


    11.       The Police Complaints Authority decided that the chief superintendent and
ju p e m te n d e n t in charge on the day should face disciplinary charges for neglect of
   duty. In the event, the chief superintendent retired due to ill health in advance of a
   ruling by a disciplinary tribunal..' The Police Complaints Authority later decided that
   disciplinary proceedings against the superintendent should be withdrawn because
  the retirement of the chief superintendent meant that what, in effect, was a joint
 .allegation of neglect of duty could not be fairly heard in the absence of the more
  senior officer.


             £ a ntirwed gall? for further investigate^


 12.            Madam Speaker, hon members will know that some of the families of those
 who died were unhappy with the verdict of the inquest. They later applied for judicial
 review of the coroner's proceedings.            During the judicial review proceedings the
 conduct of the inquest was subjected to close and detailed examination.                 In
 November 1993 the divisional court ruled that none of the matters raised in the
judicial review proceedings justified intervention by the court in the verdict of the
inquest jury.              The court also expressed strong doubts as to whether a further


f:\oppu\hou\drafts\pp0232pAdoc
    inquest, if ordered, would result in anything further being learned and observed that
    the process would be very harrowing.


    13.         The events surrounding the Hillsborough disaster have therefore been subject
    to exceptionally thorough investigation on several occasions. But concerns have
    remained about whether the full facts have yet emerged. I have met relatives of the
    Hillsborough victims whose suffering is exacerbated by their belief that there are
   unresolved issues which should be investigated further.


   14.          Representations were made to my predecessor and have been made to me, A
   to the Attorney General and to the Director of Public Prosecutions. A Granada
   television programme in December last year dramatised the disaster and raised a
   number of issues which, in the view of the programme makers, represented new
   evidence.              Since then further material has been submitted on behalf of the
   Hillsborough Family Support Group.              Those representations have related in
  particular to video evidence of the disaster and medical evidence about the time of
  death of the victims.


  15.         Madam Speaker, my Department, the office of the Attorney General and the
  Crown Prosecution Service have considered very carefully all the evidence which
I has been put forward in recent months. We have been unable to find anything
 which we consider would materially have affected the outcome of any of the
 investigations into the disaster.


 16.         Much of the evidence which has been put forward concerns matters which
 were fully addressed by previous investigations. For example, the Granada
 television programme suggested that there were ten unresolved questions about the
disaster. I am satisfied that each of those ten questions was fully considered by the
Taylor Inquiry. Indeed, specific recommendations were made in relation to eight of
them.

      am-,, hH0We? ' am aCUtely COnSCiOUS lhat the families 0f some of those who died
        Hillsborough are concerned that unresolved issues remain. I am determined to go
      as ar as can to ensure that no matter of significance is overlooked and that we do
      not reach a final conclusion without a full and independent examination of the
      evidence.



     19.        I am therefore pleased to announce today that the Attorney General the
     Director of Public Prosecutions and I have fS e fe ^ a g re e d that there should be an
     independent scrutiny to ascertain whether there now exists any new evidence which
     was not previously available relating to the disaster. We are appointing L o * Justice
     Stuart -Smith, a senior Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal, for that purpose. His full
     terms of reference are:
 \

              To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the
              Hillsborough Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:


                         (a)     To the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or


                         (b)     To the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General
                        for the purpose         of   discharging   their   respective   statutory
                        responsibilities; or


                        (C)    To the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to
                        police disciplinary matters;


f:\oppu\hou\drafts\pp0232pAdoc
                 And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available
                 is of such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State
                 for the Home Department of a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and
                 (c) to draw to their attention any evidence not previously considered by them
                 which which may be relevant to their respective duties; and to advise
                 whether there is any other action which should be taken in the public interest.


   [I am today placing a copy of these terms of reference in the Library]


   20.           We have asked Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to examine all the written and other
   evidence which has been submitted.              He will also consider any further material
   which interested parties wish to submit. There will be an opportunity for interested
   parties to make representations to him if he considers that necessary to enable him
  to form a view. His task will be twofold. First to provide me with advice on the basis
  of his independent consideration of the evidence whether any evidence not
  previously available is of such significance as to justify establishment of a further
  public inquiry. This will not itself be a Public Inquiry. However, I undertake to make
  public the advice which he gives. Secondly, he will identify for the Attorney General
  and the Director of Public Prosecutions any evidence which might be relevant to
  their decisions which has not previously been considered.
                                                                                        i

 21.            I hope that this examination will enable us to establish conclusiv e ly /th a t^
 material evidence has been overlooked in establishing the causes ~ of the
 Hillsborough disaster. For the families of those who died at Hillsborough the grief
 will never end.. (But I hope at least that this examination may settle finally their
 doubts oventhe circumstances of those deaths and so remove a part of their
 distress^

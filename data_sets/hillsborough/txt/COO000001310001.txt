      Thank you for my copy of your letter to John Morris o f 9 February. I have not, o f course,
seen Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s report: the following remarks are based on the comprehensive
summary in your letter.

        The questions in respect o f the publication of the DPP’s advice in 1990 and 1997, and the
lack of justification for fresh criminal investigations, are of course for John, but if he is content, I
would be too.

        More generally, I agree with your conclusions on Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s work.
Though it will undoubtedly be disappointing for the family support group, I support the proposition
that the Government response should make clear that there are no grounds for a further public
inquiry, nor for further investigations into the police conduct in respect o f the amendment of
statements. I also agree with your comments about the later evidence on the state of the ground,
though that is not primarily a matter for me.

        The final point concerns the relationship between judicial enquiries into major disasters and
coroners’ inquests into the resultant deaths. The recommendations o f the Home Office working
group are in my view entirely sound. Where it is possible to certify that a properly-constituted
judicial inquiry would examine all the necessary issues, it merely prolongs and exacerbates the
distress o f bereaved relatives to have to contemplate the prospect of a coroner’s inquest as well. I
therefore agree with the proposal to accept the working group’s recommendations in principle,
recognising that the necessary primary legislation may have to wait for a suitable opportunity.

           It follows that I am content with your proposals for handling the issues before Parliament
    next week.

         I am copying this letter to the Prime Minister, the Attorney General, the President o f the
   Council, the Director of Public Prosecutions, and to Sir Richard Wilson.


                                                 Yours                                 ^

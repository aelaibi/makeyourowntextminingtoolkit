S h e f f ie l d at about     10.30am     (1030)      and got a taxi           to the football

ground.         We tried to get a ticket and after a while a lad came up to

me and a sk ed       if we wa nt ed a ticke                  We bought       two L ep p i n g s Lane

We then got       some      chips and then a sked a policeman                    if he k         a pub

that woul d let Liver pool             supporters        in,     he told us l\y              x and

dir ec te d us to      it.       We went      there and had a                    ints and at about

1 pm   (1300)   we    left to walk        to the ground                     took a bo ut      half an hour

to walk      to the g ro un d and on reaching Leppings L a n e^ Ks rn st i les and

there w asn't        too m any      people about.            There w aa ' o n l y about        ten to

fi ft ee n   people at the turnstiles an d we a m e r e d                    the ground without

•any trouble.          Before we entered the ground a policeman took                             the

stick    from                 and    let us go      in with the flag only.                    1 tied the

flag a ro un d my neck and went               into the ground,



I had never       been to H i l l s b o r o u g h before and did not know w t w e                     to go,

but    I saw a tunnel a h e ad of me and as                  people were head*fTg for the

tunnel we followed.

and on reaching          the terrace we went             to th^jHTqht          hand side of the

goal.        We stood about          halfway down the              rrace and just            to the    right

of the goal.           At    this    point    it w a y ^ u s t    a normal       crowd no great         crush

We s tayed      in this      position and had a good view b*ft it started to get

busy about 2. 3 0 p m        (1430).         By 2. 4 5 p m   (1445>/it       got very busy and           I

was    crushed very tight and             could not mays about                    I was      not too

At about     two or three minutes              before      the kick off        it got very       crushed

and     I s tarted to get worried.                I a s ke d   people    behind me to try and

move     back but they       could not and         in fact we were all            being       gradually

pushed forward.             I was    pushed up a g a i n st ayf er ri er and my stomach and

pelvis are a was         being     crushed,     it was      gej/fing painful.            At    this       point

        was about       three or four feet a w a y from my left an d slightly

f orward as he was          not against        thexjrarrier            I saw            bend down

because his glasses            had been knocked off.                  I grabbed his       shoulder and

told him not to bend down as he w o u l d not get up again.



I had seen the          game kick     off but      because      of the crush       i/^fras no longer

i nterested       in the g a m e , Iwas just          trying        to push    h^/tk awa y f rom the

barrier.          The   next     thing I remember          is going    ov/r     the crush barrier

and b e i n g c o mp letely upside          down wit h my h e a ^ d o w n       between the       people

in front of me,         my head was about            six    incites from the ground.                  I

remember     t hinking      to myself       do not    faint     because       if I did    I w ould not

be able     to    control      myself or help myself.                After     this someone      grabbed

hold of my        legs.        I d o n ’t know who         it was     but by this person        pulling

a nd me grabbing anyone             I got upright again.                I pushed    people a wa y to

try and get some air and then                  I realised that                  had gone.         I could

not see him anywhere.                The    crush a p p e a r e d    to get a bit easier          but       I

could hear        people    shouting       " T h e r e ’s people     dead down here" and a lot

of screaming was           going    on.



I looked a r o u n d a nd saw                on my    right a l th o u g h     he was    on my    left

w hen    I saw him first         I grabbed hold of                    by his jacket       collar and

pulled him back          towards me.           I told him that we were             going       to get out

of here.                w a n t e d to go out on the           pitch because we were            closer

            to the      pitch than the         back and     I could see       people    climbing       over the

            fence    into the      pitch.         I told him that we were             not going    that way

            because     t h a t ’s where    people were          being    killed   in the     crush.



            We   pushed our way back            towards     the tunnel       at the    rear of the t e r r a c e ;

            most    people w ere m a k i ^        for the tunnel.            As we    reached the tunnel             I

            saw people        on the floor        in the tunnel,          t he sexfeople were     being

~1          t rampled on by people             go i ng o u t .    We got/oack      out of the     tunnel a nd

            into    the outer yard and sat on the a /ound by the /t ur ns ti le s                       to get our

            breath back.           As   I got there        I saw    people    hpang    carried and dragged

            out of the tunnel,           some     of these       people a pp e a r e d to be dead.           I saw a

            man about 40 years           carrying a young           lia out aged about          10-12 years,

            the young      boy a p p e a r e d to be dead.           This    upset me and       I burst       into

NSU&f'      tears.       I could not believe what was                    happening.      I would       not

            recognise      the man or the boy he was                carrying again.



            I turned a ro u n d to a crowd of              police who were         standing     near    the    exit

            and said      ’C a n ’t you do s o m e t h i n g ’      They told me to keep the             exit

            clear and      I saw    people      rushing     out w it h dead and        injured.



            We   left   the    enclosure and on going outside                 I saw a Jfi ne of bodies           on

            the ground        covered over.           I burst      into tears a        in and told

            had to go.          I a s k e d a policeman the way to the                railway statifen,         he

            d i r ec te d us and we w al k e d to the station.                 At the station          I rang home

            to   let my parents         know    I was alright.



            We then got        the next ava il ab le        train and w nt home.              As we     entered

            said,    "Stop acting        like a smart                       I said    I was    not being a

             "Well    t h e r e ’s several   people acting    like    cunts today        i s n ’t t h e r e ’

            We then got       the train      I think   it was about 4.20pm          (1620).

I     am       the     father       of
                 went       to the match with his                two uncles,        one of whom             is

only       a     few      months     older    than      him.        My     wife    and    myself       were

watching             the    match     on    the   TV    and were          devastated       by    what       we

were seeing.                 We did not know at first that our son was in the

part       of     the       ground       affected      but' as      the    afternoon       progressed,

relatives             and    friends contacted us and made us                           aware    that our

son        and       my    wife's     brothers       were      in    the    affected       part.            The

experience was horrific and was exacerbated by the fact that my

w i f e â€™s father was               there watching with us, having only lost his

wife        in March of             this year       and knowing            that his       two    sons       and

 grandson            were     in    the    ground.       Since       the accident,            none     of    us

 have slept properly and we have all had bad stomachs.

Once     through tj      tunnel, and onto the terraces, I saw Det e c L r v e

He then shou t e d at myself                    and other       officers       to try and             push the

crowd away from the                  perimeter wall.              I m a n a g e d to get             to the front

the     crowd       near to the waLJ^     but              it soon became               a p p arent         that    I had^no

chance        of    moving the jyrowd back.                    I was    then jost l e d          and       pus i/ed by

the     crowd       and fouryr myself trap p e d amongst                 it      near to         a gate which

leads        d i r ectly onto        the    pitch.        At    this gate,         was a supporter,                 who

had one arm on either                   side     of the    gate,      wit h his        back      to the         crowd,

p reventing anyone                from gett i n g       onto    the    pitch.           I reali s e d that            he

was     trying       to    protect a no t h e r      supporter who was               lying       on the g r o u n d

inside        the gateway from being                 t r a mpled on but          in doing            so,     he was     in

fact        causing a build            up of supp o r t e r s     behind him.                I could feel

my s e l f    being       trapped an d s q u a s h e d     by the       crowd and finding                    difficulty

breathing.                Somehow,      I m a n a g e d to move the sup p o r t e r              from the          gate

and     1   , together with other                fans were able          to get        onto      the       pitch.

                                                                                                                 S3007



Once    on the      pitch,        it took me a few minu t e s                to   regain my bre a t h and

then     looked for other mem b e r s                 of my Serial         but    could not find anyone

I took      up a position on the                    pitch,    along wit h other          officers           to

prevent what          I thought w o u l d            be a pitch       invasion.          This     did not

m a t e r i a l i s e and    1   then no ti c e d a build up of supporters                      congregating

at the      players         entrance.              I went    to that      entrance      stopped some              four

or five supporters                from going          up towards       the    players      dressing          rooms

only to be         informed fay them that                   they had      been    informed by a stew a r d

that    there was a phone                in the       old g y m n a s i u m that    they     could use            to

phone     home.



.1, then saw       Inspector i ^ w e y             (C2)   at the top of the entrance and he

i n s t r u c t e d me to remain             in the dressing          room area       to Police        fans

already      c o n g r egated      in and a r o u n d        the    phone area.          At any one              time,

for the following                two    hours,       there must have          been between fifty and

s i x t y fans waiting            to use the          one    phone.       Some     of the fans were

o b vi ou sl y   d istressed           but    there were also a number who                   had been

dr i n k i n g and were          using       the    phone as an excuse            to talk      to the        player



I remain ed       in the         players       tunnel       until   all   had q u i e t e n e d down and

a l mo st all     of the fans,               both Liverpool         and N o t t i n g h a m Forest          had    lef

the    ground.



I later went          into the N or th S # a n d where we were                     d e b r i e f e d an d    I went

off duty at R o th er ha m at 7 . 0 0 p m                 (0700).

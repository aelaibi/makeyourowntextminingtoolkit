  (who         died at the match)                  But we           intended to try and get him a ticket at

  the g r o u n d or on the way.                            Myself,                                  had tickets           for

          45pm    (1345) We         parked up and had no d i f f i c u l t y getting a parking                              space.

          The    only      police     I saw on our            route were       there were            some    in Snake       pass

          to the ground.

          We got out of the               van at       1.45pm     (1345)     there were a lot of L i verpool

          s u p p o r t e r s about,      but    I only saw a handfull                of Notts Forest

          were    d r i nking       cans of beer an d eating                chips.       But     I did not see anyone

          After     the      van the      six of us split            into two        grou'ps.         Myself

          When    they       came   back        they said that          they had met                             and       that

                 lad got his ticket               for the West end Terrace.                     We     last saw

          W h e n we got       near    to the         t urnstiles     there was a large                crowd outside and

          ijoto the        street.        The    three     of us went        to the      left hand side of the

          turnstiles         which     lead      into the N orth stand.                We only w a i t e d          for about

          2 or 3 minutes and               by now       it was     just tur n e d 3.0 Clock.                  A p o l iceman

          on a horse          told e v e r y o n e     to be    patient and that the game                     had been        put

          back    15 minutes.             So we then went            back    into L e p p i n g s Ln to wait a bit

had seat          tickets and            there was                no need to                    rush.

At this        time there w ere               still       thousands            still             outside                 the t u r n s t i l e s

im L e p p i n g s    Ln.      The       crowd was                packed            in tight an d it                                      was

very uncomfo r t a b l e .               I saw a number               of       people               climb over                       the gates

and turnstiles              bui l d i n g s    to get       into the ground,                              and at about 3 . 0 4 p m

      04)     I s a w a large         gate      to the          left of the t u rnstiles                                        open and a l l o w

«lfbout 20 people            in.      I d i d n ’t         see who opened it but                                  I saw about                           4

p o l i c e m e n outside        this     gate an d         I saw a few more                           inside w h e n                       it

opened.           I did not see an y o n e                 hurt       ina n y w a y outside                          the gates.

At 3 . 0 5 p m     (1504)      a loud         cheer        went       up inside the ground and                                             I knew

then that          the game        had started.                 Myself and                                                      went           to the

very far          left t u r n s t i l e and got            in a queue.                       We were about                              10 people

away    from the           turnstiles.              Thats w h e n the gate opened to our                                                       left and

let a few people               in.      I tried           to get       in there                  but the gate was                                      closed

again       before     I could get             in.        Myself and                                 went           in thro u g h the

left    tur n s t i l e     but we      had     lost                   We went                 in at the side of the

West    stand        round to the             back of the N o r t h stand.                                   There was                      no great

crowd       inside     the t u r n s t i l e we just w a l k e d                      into the stand an d down to

the    front.         By the       time we got             to the front                     of the stand                           I saw that

the game had stop p e d               but      the    players were                   still             on the                  pitch.                  At    that

time    there were           hundreds          of    people s p i lling                    out of the West                                  end

moment        there were         th o u s a n d s    or\ >£ne/ pitch.                   I could see                            that         the two

ceritre pens          on the West             terrace were a b s o l u t e l y over                                   crowded and                           that

there was          space     in the       two end          pens       1 & 6.               I didn't                   realise what was

going       on.      The    players       then went             off   the         pitch and things                                   got more

chaotic.           I stayed        in the N o r t h stand an d                                         went           onto           the          pitch

            Paul     H E WITSON.         He told me         that    people had been killed               in there,

            We then went           over       to b y the goal        intending       to get         the 6 of us

            together.                  and              were   on the terrace             just      behind the goal,

            they     told me       that Paul        had been drag g e d out            unco n s i o u s an d that      they

            d i d n ’t know w here            he was.

                                       then    came out      of a gate a n d        onto    the      pitch and we went

            up to a p o l i c e m e n and a s k e d w here             the    injured were,          we then w a l k e d    out

            of the gr o u n d          the    rem a i n i n g 5 of us.        Into L e p p i n g s Ln we saw a lot            of

            stretchers        on the          pitch a n d    people w i t h       coats    over      their   heads,   who     I

            a s s u m e d were     dead.

            We went        back    to my van an d f o l lowed             the a m b u l a n c e s    to the Royal

            H a l l a m s h i re Hospital.          We made        e n q uiries    but we     c o u l d n ’t find him,      and

            a g a i n at    the N o r t h e r n Gene r a l     w i t h the same        result.         It was so

             chaotic we        c o u l d n ’t find a n y t h i n g     out.

              t about 8 . 3 0          pm the same day.             I went     to the g y m n a s i u m at the ground

            where     I i dentified Paul               H E W I T S O N from a photograph.              It was   then that

             I knew he had died.

            We did have           to    produce     our tickets at the              turnstiles.

full    police        uniform.          I was     to be c o n veyed          directly       to H i l l s b o r o u g h

Football       Gr o u n d by        force    coach     to be b r i e f e d     for the       day's      duties.

2.                 I was     part     of serial        56 under        the    l eadership        of PS 2140

Taylor     from C 2 .          We were       under     the    direct      responsibility            of Inspector

3.                 F o ll ow in g    the b r i e f i n g   in the North            Stand    at the      football

Road,     an industrial              estate     near       to the bottom           of Herries       Road.        At

within     this       industrial          estate.

The    football         fans    that I saw were              conducting        themselves          in a good

natured      and l ig ht he ar te d manner.                  The m a j o r i t y    had parked up and

entered      the      ground        at an early        stage.        On the        apprach of 3-OOpm

the     ground         but       th e    numbers           were       not     so    great          as    to     c a u se      any       problems.

The     n ex t     stage         of     our       duties        was    to a t t e n d         Claywheels               Lane        Traffic

Office        for      a    cooked           meal       and     following           this,          we w e r e         to     be    on    standby

outside          the       ground        on       the P e n i s t o n e       Road       end.

At a b o u t       3.05pm         (1505)           t hat      date,      I was       stood with                 the        rest      of my

serial        at    the      corner           of P e n i s t o n e       Road and Herries                       Road         outside          the

Charlie          Brown       sho p.           We w e r e        approached           by a S u p e r i n t e n d e n t ,                 who    had

just     emerged            from        the       football         ground,          he    immediately                  ordered           us    into

the     ground.

At     this      time       I had        no       i d ea w h a t      was     happening,                I entered             th e      ground

with     the       rest      of m y          serial        together           with       PS Taylor              and        Inspector

Newey        who    were         both        in    possession            of    police          r adios.               As     I approached

the     playing            area       from        the    entrance           between           the       North         stand        and    the

Spion        Kop,      I saw          th e    players           leaving        the       pitch and a                  large        crowd       of

spectators             on    th e       pitch around               the      Leppings           Lane          en d     of     the     g ro u n d .

My     immediate            reaction              was    that      there       had       been a          pitch         invasion           by the

Liverpool           fans.             I then         ran a c r o s s        the     pitch          to    offer         my assistance,

there        were      s om e     police           officers           present        but       not       ma ny.

As     I approached               th e       Leppings           Lane     terraces             it    became            obvious           to me

that     the       situation             was       not     of    public        order          but       of    public          safety.              I

ran     towards            the    fenced           area       near     to G a t e        4.        The       g a te    was        open    a nd

several          officers             were        pulling        people        from       the       gates           with      great

difficulty,                due    to     the       f act      that     people        were          wedged           together            across

th e    s m a ll    exit         gate .           I realised           that        the    situation                 was      very       serious

and     I could            not    get        into       the     gateway        to    help.              I looked             towards          the

fence        and    I saw         that        people          were     crushed           against             the      perimeter

fen ce .         I was       faced           with a situation                  where          I could           not        get     to a n y o n e

to     help.        I wa s        at     this        ti me      with     Police          Constable              Reeves.              Situated

to     the    immediate               right        of    the     gate       I saw        some       wooden            hoardings.               I

climbed          onto       the       hoardings            w i t h PC       Reeves        doing          the        s a me    and       I was

trying        to     look         at    the     situation            behind           the       fences.          I s aw          t h at     the

crush      wa s      present            along        the      length       of     the       terrace          and       s ome      15 to 20

deep     in     people.                People        were      pushed       up a g a i n s t           each      other           and      gasping

for    breath.               It    seemed          to    stretch          for a b o u t          10 f e et       back along                 the

terrace         and      then          I sa w a         gap    of a b o u t       3    f ee t     and       from       t ha t     po int

although           it w a s        crowded           people         were     standing             in a n       upright            position

and    looking           towards             the     pitch.

1' t h o u g h t     that         if    I could          encourage           the       p e o p l e at        the       back       to m o v e

further         back         and       out    of     the      exit       tunnel        to       their       r i g ht    t hat       the        crush

of    people         directly               in f r o n t      of    those       people           would       le s s e n .          I shouted

repeatedly              to    th e      people          at    the    back       to     'M ove         back,      walk        out       of      the

ground'         and      that          'People          were       being     crushed             at    the     front'.              The        only

response           I got          from       the     people         at    the     b a ck        was    obscene           language,              'V'

signs      and       spitting               towards          myself       and     the       officers           near         to me.

Whilst        on     the      wooden           ledge         youths       were        repeatedly             climbing             on to        the

heads      of      the       people          being       crushed          and     I assisted                them       over       the

perimeter            fence         and       ont o      the    ground,          several           of    these          persons            fell

onto     the       playing             area     and appearing                to       collapse          they        sought          assistant

I don't         think         th e      people          at    the    back       realised              the    seriousness                  of    the

incident           at    the       f ro n t .        1 was         in a    helpless              situation             so    I then

started         to      speak          to    the     people         crushed           into       the    fe nce .            I saw many               of

them     s t il l       conscious             with       their       heads        pushed          to    one      side        and       their

ears     crushed against                      the       fe nc e.         I encouraged                 them     to      keep       their         eyes

open     and       to    try       and move             their       limbs       and        as    the    crush          became          easier

to m o v e      backwards               if    they       could       or    j u st      to       stand       st ill .

During        the       incident             the     wooden         hoarding           broke          and myself             and       other

officers           fell       to       the    ground.              I was    s ti l l        able       to    climb          up    o n to       the

fence      by u s i n g           the       supports          of    the    number           4 gate.            I was         aware          that

several         bodies            had       been     placed         onto    the        playing          ar e a .        I could             not

believe         at      first          that     many         were    dead,            my    initial          thoughts             were         that

The      c r o w d at        the      b ac k      did    e a se      at    one       stage        and     I noticed               2

policewomen              appearing                from      the      tunnel          at     the     back.          I shouted                to    them

to    encourage              people          to    le ave       the       terracing             and      for    them         to m a k e          their

way      to    the      back       of    the       crushed           fans       and       to    pull      them       backwards               and       to

safety.            After        great          difficulty             I noticed                that      the    two       policewomen

had moved             through           the       crowd and           were        now       into       the     c r u s h e d a re a .             They

appeared           to    be     receiving               the     s a me     response             from      several            of       the    fans.

It a p p e a r e d       to     me      that       the      f an s    di d      not       want      to m o v e       in      case          they

lost      their         view       of    th e      proceedings               or      the       possibility              of    the          match

being         pl a y e d .      I also             noticed           one P o l i c e S e r g e a n t          moving          through             the

crowd a nd            down      to      the front,            he a p p e a r e d           to     be     caught       up      in the             crush

at    one      stage         and      from         my    p o s i t i o n at       the t o p         of   the     fence            I directed

him      to    pull      back         and      try and          pull       o t h e r s b ac k          with     him.          Another

incident           I remember                was     when       I saw Po li ce                 Constable           Alan       Davies,             a

member         of C D i v i s i o n            moving         down        through           the     crowd       assisting                  fans       in

carrying           a man.             The      man      appeared           to     be      unconscious              about          45 years             of

age      and     of     good       build.            They       couldn't             get       through and              I was          trying          to

t el l    PC     Davies         to      go     b ack     up     through           the       fa ns      and     out      the       b a c k way.

1' c o u l d     see     quite          well       t ha t     they        could        go      back,      but      PC     Davies

obviously             did     not       have       the      same      view        as      I did a n d          tried         to       bring       the

man      through         the       crush and             pass        him     through            the      Gate      number             4.

When      the a r e a         near       to G a t e         4 had         partly          been      cleared,            I saw P o l i c e

officers           and       f an s     pulling          at     the       fence        around          the     terrace.                I thought

that's         a good         i d ea a n d w h e n            it h a d       been         pulled away              people             were

pulled         through,            however,             the     people          at     the      front        had     great            difficulty

in    climbing           up     through            the      fence         from       the       drop      behind         the       w a l l.

When      all      persons            had      been      cleared           I l o o k e d at            the     area       where            I had

been      in a n d       I could             not     believe          t h at      such a small                 area       had         been able

Whilst       at       Gate       4    I cannot            r ec a l l     seeing          any       person who          was     dead          being

carried          from       that       area,           except       for       the     man      PC    Davies          had     been wi th

who    appeared             unconscious                  to me.

I moved          back       onto       the        pitch an d            tried        to a s s i s t       any     persons          who       ha d

obviously             been       in t he          crush.          Many        people          were       being       resuscitated               by

Police       officers                and     ambulance            c rews       and       also       fans.        Many        fans were

shouting          and       swearing              on     the     pitch        blaming          the       Police       for     the       crush

but    I j ust         c o u l d n ’t        comment            because        from       entering             the    pitch area              to

leaving          it    I did          not      receive           any     i nf o rrnat i on v i a           ra d i o     or w o r d       of

mouth       as    to       the       cause        of     the     crush.

I must       have          spent       some         13 to 2 0 m i n u t e s              walking          around        the    crowd

preventing             fans          from      fighting           amongst            themselves,               firing        insults

towards          other          officers,              myself       and       persons          in g e n e r a l       who     were

present          on    the       pit ch .

I sa w      many       fans          and     officers            carrying            bodies         away       on a d v e r t i sernent

boards       and       leaving             th e     pitch        v ia    the       exit       to    the    gym.         I only          saw     one

ambulance             originally               on      the      pitch and           then       after       20 mi nu te s           another

came.        I was              amazed           that      2 0 or 3 0 h a d         not       been       directed          onto     the

playing          area.           I kept           thinking          where          are    all       the    ambulances,              has

anyone       asked          for       more.

Many     fans         on        the        p i t c h w e r e a s k e d to          l ea v e    and       get    out     of    the way.               I

was    met       with           the        reply         "I'm looking              for    my brother"            or     "mate".

Several          were       obviously               distressed               and     I spent         time       speaking           to    them

to    try    to       help and             all      the       persons         I spoke          to    on    the       pitch     appeared

to    have       been       drinking,               to    s ome     degree.              I found          it    impossible              to

reason with                many       of     the       f a ns   and      I am        sure      that       they       did     not    know       the

full     extent            of    the       tragedy.              I. c e r t a i n l y     d i d n ’t k n o w         so m a n y     people

             more    to help,

             to C l a y w h e e l s    Lane          and     travelled            back    to C 2 S u b        Division          for    debrief.

             I went      off    d u t y at           S . 0 0 pm       (2000).

             I have      attended              two     other          semi    finals      at    Hillsborough.              The        last    one

             in    1988 w h e n       I was          on    duty        before      the m a t c h      at     the L e p p i n g s      Lane    end

             turnstiles.              Although             th e       crowd were         generally           rowdy and          in h i g h

             spirits       there       was       no       serious        crowd      disorder          or a n y      crushing          near    the

             gates.

             I submit       this       report             for     your       information.

                I have        to     report        that        I attended             the    Hillsborough              Semi     Final      in       1988

                avid w a s        a member         of D S       T issington* s serial.                        Our    duties        before       the

                match        included          crowd         control         at L e p p i n g s        Lane    end     of    the    ground.            I

                commenced            my     duties         shortly          before         12 n o o n     on the       day    of    th e   ma tc h ,

                I was        responsible              with      other        officers            for     crowid c o n t r o l      on    the    bridge

                near        to L e p p i ngs       Lane.           At      t his    Io cat ion          coaches      were     allowed          to    pull

                up a n d      allow         fans      off     to      go    to t h e       ground       and also        normal          public

                service           vehicles         which        had        travelled         from Sheffield                 with Liverpool

                f an s      were     allowed          to      s t o p at t h i s l o c a t i o n .          The      vehicles       did    not

                cause        great        problems            and       the f l o w of      traffic         along      Leppings          Lane        was

                only        slightly         impeded.

                The        fans    on     this     day were             in a       good mood,           several        high     spirited            and

                many        had    been      drinking.                Any    f an w h o      turned         up at      our    location

                carrying           b ee r    cans      or      cider        bottles         were       told    to    put     them       down and

                get        into    the      ground.           Only         a handful         wanted        to a r g u e      the    p o int     about

                s t a n d i ng a r o u n d       dr i nki ng          but    these         persons        were      deal t, w i t h      in a f i rm

                way.         We    were      encouraged               to a s k      fans     who       were    standing         around         to m a k e

                their        way     into      th e    ground,             I also asked            to    look at       their       tickets

                firstly           to m a k e     sure         they       h a d one a n d         secondly       to    establish          that        t h ey

                were        in the        correct          a r ea .

  Directly          in f r o n t         of    the    turnstiles               I saw       several         Police         Officers

  stopping          fans       and       searching           them.         Items          removed        from       them       could      he

  collected after                   th e      match.         It    seemed           to    me    tha t    the     o r g a n i s a t i o n at

  Leppings          Lane       was       working        well.           I d i d n ’t see          anyone         being arrested,

  and    apart       from          the     occasional             group        of    20    to 3 0 y o u t h s        singing          and

  shouting          at    various             times     as    they a p p r o a c h e d           the     ground       the       f ans

  behaviour          was       very        good.

  I noticed          the       odd       group       of 5 to         10    people          walking         around         obviously

  without        tickets,            they appeared                 to     be    looking          for     friends          who     h ad

  arranged          to    meet       them       outside           the     ground          to    receive        their        tickets           or

  wanted       to    buy a          ticket        on the          day.         Immediately              before       th e      kick      off       I

  was    s t i ll    outside             the    ground and              near        to    the    turnstile*,              there       w as     no

  overcrowding                at    this       time,     and       only a           few    latecomers            making         their way

  into    the       ground.

  Shortly after                the       kick     off     I went          into       the       ground,        I saw       no

  overcrowding                in the          open area           behind        the       stand and           no a p p a r e n t

  problems.              No    tunnels          or    gates        had     been          blocked        off    by P o l i c e      or

  Stewards.

  During       the       match       I took          my meal        with        the       other       members        of     our    s er i a l

  and    at    the       e n d of        the    match        I assisted              in    crowd        control.            I saw        no

  incidents          after          the       match     of a d i s o r d e r l y           nature.            The    only       incident

  I rec all         after          the     m a t c h was     the        fa ct       that       someone        had    been       stabbed

  in a n e a r b y        p a rk a f t e r        the    game.            The       only       real     danger       of     fighting

  after       the    m a t c h was            confined around                  the       gymnasium         area      where        rival

  fans    ha d      gathered             to    collect        items        taken          from them           before        the    game,

  however,          incidents              were      minor.

  I did       not    arrest          or a s s i s t      in the           arrest          of a n y      p e r s o n at      the    match

  in    19SS.

  I submit          this       report          for    your        i n f o r m a t i o n . _________________ _______________ _

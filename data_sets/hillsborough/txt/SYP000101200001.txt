 At     approximately                       1.50pm          the    same        date     a    situation                 arose           which             caused

 me     some        concern.                     I was       at    my     gate       and     was           approached                 by    a    number               of

 Liverpool               supporters                who       attempted            to    explain                that        they        were

 frightened               because                they       had    been        placed        in        the       wrong       end           of    the

 stadium.                 I       inspected             their           ticket       stubs         and         was     surprised                 to

 discover               that       the      tickets           were        for     that       end        of       the       ground.               I       then,

 by     radio,           contacted                Police          Ground        Control           and          was     informed                 that       in         no

 the        lawful        limit.                I was        instructed              that        an     overspill                area           had       been

 in    attendance                 in       this    area,           segregating               the       opposing              supporters.                        All

 persons           at    Gate          3    were       told        to    quietly            make       their          way        to       this        area

where            they    would             be    allocated              standing            space.

This        action           or     instruction               was        repeated            on       at       least        10    occasions                 to

Liverpool               Supporters                and       from        observations                  in       the    area        of       the

overspill               area,          I    saw    no       crowd        behaviour                problems.

At    2.15pm            the       same            date       I was        a p p r o a c h e d by           a    man    whom           I     now          k n o w to

be                                                 years,          born f                         of

Liverpool,               whom          I again          directed              towards        the           overspill             area.               He    was

.i,r. a n    excited              state          and    on    leaving           me     traverse                the     lower           terraces

shouting           Liverpool                    chants       and    displaying               a    Liverpool                 banner.                  I    took

this        as    not     only         stupid           but       downright            dangerous                 and       entered              my       gate

to    apprehand               him.          This        I    did    with        the     help           of      Chief        Inspector                    Beal

near        to    the     overspill                area       and       after        documentation,                                             was

ejected           from        the      Football              Stadium          under         the        ground          regulations.                        I

 the turnstiles in Leppings Lane for the sum of £25 and that he had

 expec ted to be taken to the enclo sur e c o n t a i n i n g the Liv erpool

  heard                any         instruction                  on    my    radio.                 The         officers                               were                  let      onto        the

  playing                   surface           via          my    gate       and        1    was         shortly                         joined                         by        Chief

  Inspector                    Beal          who       I       thought        had          taken            control                         of            the              situation.                  He,

 having                 to     shout,             told          me    that     I must               watch                  the              Kop               because                 myself,             PC

 Groom                 and     PC       Holmes             were       the     only          officers                       between                            the           thousands                of

 say             the        least,           was       frightened             and          had          a    stupid                         thought.                                I was

 thinking,                    for        Christ                sake    will        someone                  please                     throw                     the            beach          ball

    erupted          with             persons       rushing              to    the       gates        when       a    Liverpool

    supporter             ran          the    full       length           of       the       ground       and        gesticulated

    violently             towards             the       Nottingham                 Forest          supporters              from        the         goal

 mouth.              He       was       chased          back       by     a    police          officer          and        apprehended

    inside       the          Liverpool             half        of      the        field.           This       apprehension                     relieved

 somewhat             the             tension       of       the       Kop     and       again       a    cheer           went        up.          A

 further             Liverpool,                fan       what          I. w o u l d      describe          as        in    his        forties

 repeated             the             same    manoeuvre                but     for       some       reason           this       was       laughed

at        by    the       Forest             supporters.

May        I    say       that,             time    at       this       stage           time       had    no    meaning               but      I was

surprised                 when          a    Liverpool             supporter              was       led    past           my    position

obviously                 not          injured          but    being           forcibly             ejected           from       the          ground.

This           man    was             the    supporter             I    had    earlier              ejected           from       the

Stadium.                  Although             concentrating                   on        the       crowd       in     front          of       me',     I

did       see        an    Ambulance                drive          onto       the        playing          surface              and    then

became           aware            that       Liverpool                 supporters              were       breaking              up

advertisement                         hoardings           at    the        Leppings             Lane       end       of        the    ground

and       were        gradually               moving           towards             the       Spion       Kop.         A        number,          well

over       100,           ran         the    full        length          of    the       playing           surface             and        I    recall

thinking             that             they    were        breaking             the       hoardings             to     use        as    stretchers.

I    informed             a       pres*       camera-man                 to    move          his    expensive              equipment                   which

was       placed          behind             the    hoarding              at       my    location.               By       this        time         the

Nottingham                Forest             supporters                had     become          more       calm        and       when          the       first

of    the       casualties                   were       being          carried           off       via    the        ramp        they         clapped.

The       running             supporters                by     this       time          had    reached           our       location                and       were

obviously             in          a    state       of    shock          and        began       kicking           frenziedly                   at       the

advertisment                      hoardings.                 Many       shouted,              "Get       up „there             you     useless

    boards          left       pieces          of    wood           H"    x    1"       and       about        E'    long        all       over           the

    area      and        myself          and     another                officer          were           instructed              to    remove          them

    because             of    the     situation               and        because             in    all        probability                 they       would

    be     used         as    weapons          against             us.         This          we    did        and    hid    them           behind              the

    North        Stand         at     the      rear       of        the       gardeners               hut.          Once        in    this       area,            the

    scene        was         horrendous             with       injured              and       dead           persons       everywhere.

    Although             not    ordered             to    help,           I    could          not        leave       this       area           and    offered

    my   1 im it e d         f i rs t      aid      e xperiences.

    To   be      quite         honest,           the      period              of        time      behind        that North                Stand           is     a

    blur      which          I want         to      forget          but        1' c a n       recall           placing          people           in

    various         states           of     injury            in    certain              places,             moving        coughing,                 shocked

    boys      out       of     way,       against             the       Gymnasium                 and    around           the        prison          bus.

Heart          massage              and    the      kiss           of     life,          all       to    no    avail,           and        still          the

dead          and       injured           kept      coming.               Supporters                    were        copying          my    action               and

asking           "are         we     doing       it       right".              I        kept       shouting           "5    pushes, one

breath."                 Many        officers             were           behind                   that        stand       and        all       were            i n no

contact             with        each       other.              1    remember                 seeing          Inspector           Harvey              in    the

same        situation               as     myself,            also        the       St.        John's          Ambulance              Personnel.

The        panic         and       upset       were       unimaginable                       and        many    experienced                    officers

were        in      a    state        of    shock.             Someone              whom          I     do    not    know        shouted,                 "put

the        dead         in    the     Gymnasium."                    Attempts                were        made       to    transport              dead

persons             into       that        hall.          I    recall a                 y oung boy            being         c a r r i e d by          a

I    personally                was       kicked          and       punched              whilst          attempting               to       resuscitate

a    person             by    supporters             who       had        a    dead          man      with      them.            I want          to

believe           that         the       violence             offered              to    me       was        only    to    gain        my

attention.                    The     situation               became           so       bad       that        I attempted                 to

resuscitatedead                      persons             myself           just          to     appease              the s u p p o r t e r s          who

had        carried              them       in.         The         casualty was already                         d e a d but          the       fans

    By     the       side       of    the        entrance                to       the       Gymnasium           a    woman             police        officer

    was          tending             to a     youth         who was               breathing spasmodically                               and        awaiting

    thea t t e n t i o n         of       a m b u 1a n c e              personnel.                  1 knelt          by      her       side        to       ask

    what       he     was       like        and       suddenly                   became        aware          that       I was          getting             wet.

    We,     all       in     that         location             were              getting          wet.         Some          in    the      stands           above       u

    was     urinating                against           a    corrugated                      wall     and      this           was       running           over      us

    and     the       dead.           Many        words             of       abuse          were     said       by       police          officers             at

    the    scene           and,       what        I    could             describe             as     a    waterfall,                   stopped.

    It    is     very        difficult                to    express                my       feelings          and        I    feel       very       emotional

    at    this        stage       of       this        report            although                 I am     normally                quite          lucid       and

    factual          about        the        circumstances                         of    described              events.                They       may        or    may

    I was      aware          that         scuffles             had          broken           out       and    was        glad         to     see       a    cordon

    of    police           officers           at      the       east             end     of    the        North       Stand            and       that

emotionally                  upset          and       in    f e a r ,of            my       own     safety.               I will            be    honest,           I

did        not       think        I was          going          to       get       away        from       that        location               alive,          such

was        the       panic       and        animosity                   of       the    supporters              who          were       transporting,

by        this       time,       dead         bodies                I    heard          a     scream          for    a       driver          to     take      a

badly          injured           to       hospital             and           I    ran       for     an    ambulance                door.            At      the

door,          Sergeant              Hardy         told        me        to       keep        going       and       that          he    would        drive         the

vehicle.                  This       he     did       and       I       then       was       approached              by       someone             who       said

he       was     a    doctor.               He    asked             me       who       was     in    charge.                 I was       absolutely

stunned              by    his       remark           in    the          mayhem.               I am       afraid             that       I was        rude         and

told       him,           "anyone           you       can      see."               I    then        told       him,          "walking             wounded

were       against            the         wall,        dead          were          behind           the    police             bus       and       people          in

a    prone           position             might        be      breathing."                        The     doctor             apologised              and
                                                                                                                                                    PAGE
                                                                                                                                                    R416

 immediately              set,    to       his    task.




_______________________________________________________________________________________________________                                       I     was

 at    this     Lime       shaki n g ,           sweating              and       totally              exhausted.                  I    couldn't

 intend       still.        On        my    way       back        to    the       area          where              the    dead        and   dying

 were     I    saw    a    youth           who    I    recognised                 as        a   Special              Co'sntable.              He     had

 his    shirt        on    but        is    uniform           trousers were                          completely              ripped         from      the

waistband            to    the        turn       up.         He       was       in a    state             of       semi      consciousness

and     I must        admit           that       in    a     kind       of       panic.               I    grabbed him                 by   the      sirt

front     and        lifted           him    into          the        police roomwhere                         a    blanket           was   placed

around        him.        Together               with      PC     Hulley,              we       pulled             and    carried           him      to    an

ambulance           and    again           left       him       in     the        care          of    ambulance               personnel.                  All

the     time    I was        screaming                 "breathe,                keep        breathing".                     Dead       were         still

being     brought          to     the       rear        of      the     stand           but          thank          God     the       carriers

knew    that        they    were           dead       and       although               they          were          shocked        and       irate,         I at

this    stage        felt        as    though           I was          calming              down          and       regaining           some

control        myself.

Problems        arose       with           the    lack          of     space           at       the       entrance           to       the   Gymnasium

door    and     supporters                 tempers           again          got        frayed.                 I    can    only        descibe

that    trying        to    get        a    body       on     a       stretcher                 with       HO       people        carrying           the

stretcher           caused        mayhem          and        again          I    felt           fear       for       my    own        safety.         In

my    exhausted           state        it    was       all        I    could           do       but       to       help    carry        the       dead

inside        the    building.               The       number           of       bodies              inside          w a s / f io r r e n d o u s    and
 although we kno w that there were a lot of dead,                    that sight will haunt

 me for the rest o f m y life.            I n t e r s c a p e d w i t h the carr ying o f the

 dead,    first aid w as given to the oth er injured and I gave c ig are ttes

 to d e e p l y affect ed and sho cked s u ppo rter s and helpe rs who were sat in

 disbelief.     I, by this time was in need of a drink o f w a t e r and as I

 o b t aine d this w a t e r w h i c h was si tua t e d b y the side o f the p rison B a v .t

 saw that the j u v en ile contin gen t of the St.             Johns A m b u l anc e   Brigade

 had been p l a c e d insid e that bus for their own safety.                   I w as glad

 they were there but to mar this,              a dead person,        covered, was direc tly

b y the door.         I felt u p s e t and d e e p l y r e g r et ted that the chi ldr en had

to see this carnage.            Eventually,      and at what time God only knows,

the suppo rt servic es g a ined control and the total panic o f the

situation subsided.           I wanted to t h r o w away m y u n i f o r m and run away.

I was tot all y exhausted,          a l t h o u g h I c oul d not sta nd still.        W h e n the

last o f w ha t I w ould describe as the w a l k i n g w o u n d e d left b y

ambulance,    I w a l k e d d o w n the r a m p towards the p l a y i n g ar ea and wept a

tear of r e l i e f that all the crowd had gone home.                  It is har d for m e to

a dm it that w h i l s t the d i s a s t e r was taking place,        I felt fear f o r m y s e l f ,

and guilt at feeli ng this fear and to see no c r o w d was, in some way,                            a

s e l fis h relief.      I then w e n t into the Gymnasium,          not because I wanted

to but to k e e p busy,       p o s s i b l y h e lp ing wit h i d e n ti fic atio n o f someone

but things wer e in the charge o f the m a j o r i n c i d e n t g r o u p and r at her

than pester anyone         there,    I went outside.        The sight in there was

horrendous.

People,   by this time, were as king about p e rs ons they had come wit h

and a table w as set up in the North St and wher e a l ong queue had

formed.    This p oint was m a n n e d and w e wer e then told that a nyon e who
                                                                                                      PAGE 11
                                                                                                      R*ll6



had n o t hin g to d o was to sit in the North Stand.

 So me k i n d o f d e - b r i e f i n g took place and myself,          t o g ethe r w i t h other

 officer*              s t o o d down fro m the g rou nd and wer e told to go to

 N i a g a r a Sports Club.       T h i s w e d i d and a l t h o u g h I was to be on duty

 from that time and until               .1.00 am the f o l l ow ing m o r n i n g I had 2 stiff         y.   i «

 drinks.       A l t h o u g h these d r i n k s r e l a x e d m e somewhat,   I sat outside on

 the wall adjacent to the e n t ra nce steps and tried to refl ect a n d admit

 ju st w h a t had happened.           T h i s was i mpo ssib le so I m a d e a telephone

 mess age to m y d a u g h t e r to the effect that I w a nted her to br ing m y

 v e h icle to N i a g a r a f rom w h e r e I h a d left it at her b o yf rien d's home.

Th is she d i d and on her arri val she e n q u i r e d as to w h e t h e r I had

 t e l e p h o n e d home.   I had not a n d felt ag ain g u i l t y a n d tearful for not

doing so.                                                                 t

W h i l s t sat there,       a L i v e r p o o l s u p p o r t e r of about 18 years came u p to

us a n d asked h o w to get to Co lley R o a d Catholic S cho ol whe re his

party           left their transport.              I tr ied to e x p l a i n the q u i ck est way

to w a l k and f i n a l l y told m y d a u ghte r a n d h e r b o y f r i e n d to take h im

there.       T h i s t h e y d i d a n d I sat on m y own v e r y q u i e t and t a kin g stock

of things.

D u r i n g this p e r i o d I w a s j o i n e d b y PC G r o o m e a n d was s pok en to by

I n s p e c t o r Sykes a n d S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Greenway.   I c o u l d not face going

inside the C l u b because I d i d not wa nt to h e a r a n y t h i n g about what

had happened.           I d i d after some time a nd on the r e t u r n o f m y

daughter,       I c o n t i n u e d m y t o u r o f d u t y until 1.00 a m wit h PC Groome

but in all honesty,           I cannot recall wh at duties I performed.

T h i s is a true a n d a c c ura te account of what I recall a n d I sign it so.

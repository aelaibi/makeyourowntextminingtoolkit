fi' n o t i c e d t h a t the               owd appeared                  to    be    slow          in a r r i v i n g        at t h e

   be 2 5 , 0 0 0      and 30,000.

   At     2.40    p.m.       that       same          d at e    I checked             with          the    camera            which       co ver s

   the     Penistone          Road          area       and      noticed             that       there       were         very       few       people

   in the        streets,          and       on       c h e c k i n g 'the          computer,             it w a s       showing             19,000

   totals        start       to    pulsate,              the        total       capacity             for       t h at    area       of       the

   ground        being       21,000,          which            t o l d me       that       n e a r l y all           the      Nottingham

   supporters           were       in the             ground         and       it w a s        near        to    full         capacity.

   I then        switched          to       the       camera         that       was       covering             the L e p p i n g s           Lane end

ground           to    break           their            fall       as    they        landed.

On       th e    South Stand                  of             this     area         I saw a m ou n t e d P o l i c e m a n                being

pushed           on his           horse           down        towards          a large           double          door       which        l e ads     into

     e    rear        of    the        West         Stand.                                                           /

During           all       this        I. c o u l d          h e ar     several         officers              Vneluding

Superintendent                        Marshall,               requesting              further            assistance              in t h a t       area,

for       the     double               doors            to    be      opened        in o r d e r        to let        fans       i nt o the

ground           to    save            a major               incident/outside,                      also             for th e     m a t c h to     be

delayed           for       a     further               15 m i n u t e s .

At       this     point           I noticed                  that       the    large        door         situated           on    the       South

side        of L e p p i n g s             Lane         open,         and     there       was       a    surge       of a b o u t        1,000      f a ns

run       into        the       ground.                 Within a minute                   of     this         happening           I noticed
                                tap
that        the       large           doors         of       the      North        side     of      Leppings             Lane     open and

again           about       1,000           fans         run       into       the     ground.             I could           tell       from       the

noises           on    the        radios            from        the      officers           in t h a t         area       that        the

Liverpool              fans           were        very        boisterous              and      excited          and       appeared           to    be

heavily           intoxicated with                            dri n k .                                          /

I then           turned           to       th e     camera            that     was      inside           the     ground and              covered

th e      area        of    th e       West         Stand and               it w a s      obvious             that       th e    s it ua ti on was

getting           out       of         hand         and       people         were      being            pushed       up a g a i n s t the

                  appeared            to    be    some        distortion         and      some     messages            could      not     be    read

                  I would            only    like        to   add     that     in m y       opinion,           the m a i n       cause     of    this

                  major       incident            was     caused       by     the L i v e r p o o l         fans     arriving        at    the m a t c h

                  too    late         and    being        under       the     influence           of    drink        and    trying        to    e n ter

                  the    ground without                   tickets.            It w a s      obvious          that      looking       at    the       crowd

                  were     attempting               to    enter       without        tickets           at    all     cost    to     the    safety          of

                  During         the       incident           I was    trying        to     concentrate              on m es s a g e s     being

                  received            on    the     Police        radio' n e t w o r k ,      but       did      not      listen     to w h a t w as

  E N D OF      REPORT
HAROLD GUEST




Police Constable 1421




I am a Police Officer in the South Yorkshire Police at present stationed

at Deepcar.

During the last four years I have worked all football matches at

Hillsborough Football Ground.

My duties consist of working in the video room   in   company with Chief

Security Officer, Mr Lock.

Under the ground regulations in respect of the amount allowed in each

section of ground, it is my duty to check with the computer, the number of

persons who have entered and then the number of persons outside the ground

about to enter, to make sure that no more persons are allowed into that

area than the regulations set.    If there are to inform control to arrange

for turnstiles to be closed and for the persons outside the ground to be

moved to an area where there is sufficient room to accommodate them.

This is very important at a no ticket match where the numbers attending

 are not known in advance. ---

On a ticket match this rolC becomes a watching brief with the main

 concerns being persons turning up at the match without tickets.

 The video room is situated near to   the players entrance on theSouth

 Stand.   My duties are to liaise with the club and    the Police. Any

 problems which may arise on behalf of the club are passed over to Mr Lock

>ncr and involving the Police are forwarded by radio or telephone through

 to the control room.

 In this room there are twenty T.V. monitors which are covered by cameras

 which are strategically placed around the ground to cover all 95

 turnstiles.   There is also a T.V. monitor which can be operated by a

 switch which will operate and show any view by the cameras from the main
Police control point situated between the West and South Stands.             There is

also a computer which shows all 95 turnstiles and can tell at any time

during a match how many persons have passed through each turnstile at any

given point.

Each section of the ground is shown in separate columns, each column shows

a number of turnstiles for that area and how many persons have passed

through each turnstile and at the bottom of each column the total is shown

for that area of the ground.

There are six areas of the ground recorded on the computer and at the end

there is a total shown for the full attendance in the ground.            The

computer scans all turnstiles and is updated every two and a half seconds.

On Saturday 15 April 1989, I was on duty for the semi-final between

Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, and commenced my duties at 10am on that

date.      At about 12.45pm after the turnstiles were open I switched all

video recorders on to record all the fans as they were entering the ground

via the turnstiles.

 During the afternoon leading up to the kick off time at about 2.15pm I

 noticed that the crowd appeared to be slow in arriving at the turnstiles.

 I am not sure of the size of the crowd but believe it to be 25,000 and

 3 0 ,0 0 0 .

 At 2.40pm that same date, I checked with the camera which covers the

 Penistone Road area and noticed that there were very few people in t|
                                                       Avr (fa S^o.oyj   Kc-f>.

 streets and on checking the computer it was showing 19,000 plus.^ When

 each area of the ground gets near to capacity the totals start to pulsate,

 the total capacity for that area of the ground being 21,000, which told me

 that nearly all the Nottingham supporters were in the ground and it was

 near to full capacity.

 I then switched to the camera that was covering the Leppings Lane end of

 the ground and noticed that there was a large gathering of fans in that
                                    - 3 -                                 K - >■ M ^




area.   I could see that the fans were spread from the turnstile entrance

right back into Leppings Lane, fully blocking the road.    I would estimate

that there would be between 3.000 and 5,000 fans.    I made a check of the

computer and saw that the figures for the West Stand were pulsating and

showing near to capacity and the Leppings Lane figures were showing

approximately 7,000 which would be near to capacity and the computer would

be at a point to start pulsating,     The figures on the computer start to

pulsate when the capacities get to within 15% of the total.

As I looked at the scene I could see the crowd getting larger and many at

the back of the crowd were surging forward pushing violently towards the

turnstiles.    From that point I could also see Police Officers trying to

get the crowd into some sort of order but they were being pushed to one

side out of the way.    I saw several missiles being thrown towards the

 Police.   A large contingent of the fans were climbing the walls over the

 top of the turnstiles, and they were landing on the asbestos roofs on the

 inside of the ground and jumping on to people who were on the inside of

 the ground to break their fall as they landed.

 On the South Stand of this area I saw a mounted Policeman being pushed on

 his horse down towards a large double door which leads into the rear of

 the West Stand.

 During all this I could hear several officers including Superintendent

 Marshall, requesting further assistance in that area, for the double doors

 to be opened in order to let fans into the ground to save a major incident

 outside, also for the match to be delayed for a further 15 minutes.

 At this point I noticed that a large door situated on the South Side of

 Leppings Lane was open, and there was a surge of about 1,000 fans run into

 the ground.   I could tell from the noises on the radios from the officers

 in that area that the Liverpool fans were very boisterous and excited and

 appeared to be heavily intoxicated with drink.
                               -   4   -




I then turned to the camera    that was inside         the ground and coveredthe   j
                                                                                   i
                                                                                   ?
area of the West Stand and it was obvious that the situation was getting           j
                                                                                   j
out of hand and people were    being       pushed up   against the fencing onthe   j
                                                                                   1
perimeter of the ground.                                                           J
   WU poM *                   tot c,e« wcy U W cc^ ck Mu-u sf.H *
At thie p'Tvr1- I tried to use my personal radio in order to contact Police
               A
Control that further Police assistance was required urgently at the

Leppings Lane end of the ground, but each time I tried to use the radio I

was blocking others already using the radio, so I did not try further to

use it.

I then tried to use the internal telephone system to contact Police

Control but again each time I tried the line was engaged and could not get

through.     At this point Mr Lock then left the video room in order to

organise some safety measures with the security personel.

 Also present during this time in the video room was a Mr Roger Holdsworth,

 £10   is the person who installed all the videos and computer system.

 As he could also see what was taking place he also left the room in order

 to assist in any way he could.

 I could see that all available officers were being sent to this area of

 the ground to assist with the injured and dying.

 By this time injured persons were being brought to the players entrance of

 the ground and I assisted in treating people in that area and arranging

 for ambulances to be directed in that area to ferry the injured to

 hospital.

 I can say that during the time prior to the major incident the Police

  personal radios were working very well but during the day there appeared

  to be some distortion and some messages could not be read clearly.

  I would like to add that in my opinion, the main cause of this major

  incident was caused by the Liverpool fans arriving at the match too late

  and being under the influence of drink and trying to enter the ground
without- tickets.    It was obvious that looking at the crowd outside the

ground prior to kick-off there were several thousands that were attempting

to enter without tickets at all cost to the safety of other Liverpool

supporters inside the ground.

During the incident I was trying to concentrate on messages being received

on the Police radio network but did not listen to what was being

transmitted on the back to back radio system owned by the club,    as I knew

Mr Lock would deal with any situation that had developed.

After the incident I made a note of all the people that had entered the

ground as shown on the computer and they are as follows

Spion Kop                            19,906

North Stand                           8,109

South Stand Covered                   4,740

South Stand Uncovered                 3,255

Leppings Lane                         7,038

West Stand                            5,618

                    TOTAL            48,666

These numbers ^vould not give a true reading of the exact amount of persons

 entering the ground due to the gates being opened and several hundreds

 entering the ground without tickets and trying to gain access, by any

means.

                                                                             nstable.1421.........................................
 On Saturday, 15 April l989, I was on duty for the Semi Final between Liyerpool
 and Nottingham Forest, and conmenced my duties at 10.00 a.m. that .date.
 At about 12.45 p.m. after the turnstiles were open I switched all video
 recorders on to record all the fans as they were entering the ground via.
 the turnstiles.                                                     .
 During the afternoon leading up to kick-off time at about 2.15 p.m. .1 noticed
 that the crowd appeared to be slow in arriving at the turnstiles.                                                 I am not
 sure of the size of the crowd but belieye it to be between 25,000 and 30,000.
 At 2.40 p.m. that same date I checked with the camera which covers .the
 Penistone Road area and npticed that there were very few people in the streets,
 and on checking the computer it was showing 19,000 .plus, and when each area
 of the ground gets near to capacity the totals start to pulsate,, the total,
 capacity for that area <pf the ground being 21,000,. which, told rne that nearly
 all the Nottingham supporters were in the ground and it was near to .full
 capacity.
 I then switched to the camera that was cpvering the leppings Lane end of the
 ground and noticed that there was a .large gathering of fans in that .area,.
 I could see that the fans were spread from the turnstile entrance right back
 into Leppings Lane, fully blocking the road.                                I would estimate that there,
 would be between 3,000 and 5,000 fans.                          I made a check pf the computer and
 saw that the figures for the W e s t Stand were pulsating and showing near to
 capacity, and the Leppings Lane figures were showing in excess of .7,000,
 which would be near to capacity and the cpmputer would be at a point ready
 to start pulsating.               The figures on the corputer start to pulsate viien the,
 capacities get to within 15% of the total.
 It was cpbvious that looking at the crowd from outside trying to get .in, that
 there would not be sufficient room for all to be, accornrodated.                                            As I looked,
 at the scene I oould see the crowd getting larger and ,neny. at the back ,of,
 the crowd were surging forward pushing yicplently towards the turnstiles.....
 From that point I could also see Police Officers trying to get, .the. crowd,
 into scare sprt of order but they .were being pushed to .one side, cut of the, way.
 I saw several nrtissiles being thrown towards, the. Police,                                    A large, .qontiijgent.
 of the fans were climbing onto, the .backs of, others, and climbing, the wall?

 the ground to break their fall as they landed.
 On the South Stand of this area I saw a mounted policeman being pushed on
 M s horse down towards a large double door which leads into the rear of the
 West Stand.
 During all this I could tear several officers including Superintendent
 MMSHALL requesting further assistance in that area, for the double doors
 to be opened in order to let fans into the ground to save a major incident
 outside,      also   for the match to be delayed for a further                      15      minutes.
 At this point I noticed that the large door situated on the South side of
 Leppings Lane open, and there was a surge of about 1,000 fans run into the
 ground.       Within a minute of this happening I noticed that the large doors
 of the North side of Leppings Lane open and again about 1,000 fans run into
 the ground.          I could tell from the noises on the radios from the officers in
 that area that the Liverpool fans were very; boisterous and excited, and
 appeared to be heavily intoxicated with drink.
 I then turned to the camera that was inside the ground and covered the area
 of the West Stand and it was obvious that the situation was getting out of
 hand and people were being pushed up against the fencing on the perimeter of
 the ground.
 I could see that all available officers were being sent to this area of the
 ground to assist with the injured and dying.
 By this time: injured persons> were being brought to the Players' Entrance area
 of the ground and I assisted in treating people in that area and arranging
 for cmbulances to be directed in that area to ferry the injured to hospital.
 I can say that during the time prior to the major incident the Police
 personal radios were working very well, but during the day there appeared, to
 be some distortion,: and soremessages could not: be read clearly.
 I would only like to add that in my opinion that the .main cause of this major
 incident was caused by the Liverpool fans arriving at the rratch too late, and
 teing under the influence of .drink .and. trying to .enter the ground .without,
 tickets.      It was obvious that looking at the crowd putside the ground prior
 to kick off there were several thousands that were attempting to enter.with­
 out tickets at all cost to the safety of other Liverpool supporters inside .
 the ground.
 During the incident I was trying to concentrate on messages being .received .

HAROLD GUEST, Police Constable 1421, South Yorkshire Police.



I an a Police Officer in the South Yorkshire Police at present

stationed at Deepcar.



During the last four years I have worked all football matches at

Hillsborough Football Ground.



My duties consist of working in the video room in company with the

Chief Security Officer, Mr. LOCK.



The video room is situated near to the Players' Entrance on the

South Stand of the ground.



In this room there are 20 T.V. monitors which are covered by

cameras which are strategically placed around the ground to cover

ai 1 95 turnstiles.   There is also a T.V. monitor which can be

operated by a switch which will operate and show any view by the

cameras from the main Police control point situated between the

West and South Stands.    There is also a computer vdiich shows all

95 turnstiles and can tell at anytime during a match how many

persons have passed through     each turnstile at any given point.

Each section of the ground for example the Spion Kop it will give

a figure showing the exact number of people in that area of the

ground.   These figures for that section of the ground are then

added up to give a grand total at the end.     The computer scans all

the turnstiles and takes approximately 2*s seconds.



On Saturday, 15 April 1989, I was on duty for the Semi Final between

Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, and conmenced my duties at 10.00 a.m.
                                                                    .2.

that date.    At about. 12.45 p.m. after the turnstiles were open

I switched all video recorders on to record all the fans as they

were entering the ground via the turnstiles.



During the afternoon leading up to kick-off time at about 2.15 p.m.

I noticed that the crowd appeared to be slow in arriving at the

turnstiles.    I am not sure of the size of the crowd but believe it

to be between 25,000 and 30,000.



At 2.40 p.m. that same date I checked with the camera which covers

the Penistone Road area and noticed that there were very few people

in the streets, and on checking the computer it was showing 19,000

plus, and when each area of the ground gets near to capacity the

totals start to pulsate, the total capacity for that area of the

ground being 21,000, which told me that nearly all the Nottingham

supporters were in the ground and it was near to full capacity.



I then switched to the camera that was covering the Leppings Lane

end of the ground and noticed that there was a large gathering of

fans in that area.     I could see that the fans were spread from the

turnstile entrance right back into Leppings Lane, fully blocking

the road.     I would estimate that there would be between 3,000 and

5,000 fans.     I made a check of the corputer and saw that the

figures for the West Stand were pulsating and showing near to

capacity, and the Leppings Lane figures were showing in excess of

7,000, which would be near to capacity and the corputer would be at a

point ready to start pulsating.    The figures on the computer start

to pulsate when the capacities get to within 15% of the total.

It was obvious that looking at the crowd from outside trying to get
in that there would not be sufficient room for all to be

accorrrnodated.   As I looked at the scene I could see the crowd

getting larger and many at the back of the crowd were surging

forward pushing violently towards the turnstiles.     From that point

I could also see Police Officers trying to get the crowd into some

sort of order but they were being pushed to one side out of the

way.   I saw several missiles being thrown towards the Police.      A

large contingent of the fans were climbing onto the backs of others

and climbing the walls over the top of the turnstiles;     they were

landing onto the asbestos roofs on the inside of the ground and

jurrping onto people who were on the inside of the ground to break

their fall as they landed.



On the South Stand of this area I saw a mounted policeman being

pushed on his horse down towards a large double door which leads

into the rear of the West Stand.



During all this I could hear several officers including Superinten­

dent Marshall requesting further assistance in that area, for the double

doors to be opened in order to let fans into the ground to save a

major incident outside, also for the match to be delayed for a

further 15 minutes.



At this point I noticed that the large door situated on the South

side of Leppings Lane open, and there was a surge of about 1,000

fans run into the ground.     Within a minute of this happening I

noticed that the large doors of the North side of Leppings lane

open and again about 1,000 fans run into the ground.     I could tell

 from the noises on the radios from the officers in that area that the
                                                                         .4.
Liverpool fans were very boisterous and excited, and appeared

to be heavily intoxicated with drink.



I then turned to the camera that was inside the ground and covered

the area of the West Stand and it was obvious that the situation

was getting out of hand and people were being pushed up against the

fencing on the perimeter of the ground.



I could see that all available officers were being sent to this area

of the ground to assist with the injured and dying.



By this time injured persons were being brought to the Players'
                          ♦

Entrance area of the ground and I assisted in treating people in

that area and arranging for ambulances to be directed in that area

to ferry the injured to hospital.



I can say that during the time prior to the major incident the

Police personal radios were working very well, but during the day

there appeared to be sane distortion, and some messages could not

be read cleanly.



I would only like to add that in my opinion that the main cause of

this major incident was caused by the Liverpool fans arriving at

the match too late and being under the influence of drink and trying

to enter the ground without tickets.    It was obvious that looking

at the crowd outside the ground prior to kick off there were several

thousands that were attenpting to enter without tickets at all cost

HAROLD GUEST




Police Constable 1U21




I am a Police Officer in the South Yorkshire Police at present stationed

at Deepcar.

During the last four years I have worked all football matches at

Hillsborough Football Ground.

My duties consist of working in the video room in company with Chief

Security Officer, Mr Lock.

Under the ground regulations in respect of the amount allowed in each

section of ground, it is my duty to check with the computer, the number of

persons who have entered and then the number of persons outside the ground

 about to enter, to make sure that no more persons are allowed into that

 area than the regulations set.   If there are to inform control to arrange

 for turnstiles to be closed and for the persons outside the ground to be

 moved to an area where there is sufficient room to accommodate them.

 This is very important at a no ticket match where the numbers attending

 are not known in advance.

 On a ticket match this rolC becomes a watching brief with the main

 concerns being persons turning up at the match without tickets.

 The video room is situated near to the players entrance on the South

 Stand.   My duties are to liaise with the club and the Police.    Any

 problems which may arise on behalf of the club are passed over to Mr Lock

     and involving the Police are forwarded by radio or telephone through

 to the control room.

 In this room there are twenty T.V. monitors which are covered by cameras

 which are strategically placed around the ground to cover all 95

 turnstiles.   There is also a T.V. monitor which can be operated by a

 switch which will operate and show any' view by the cameras from the main
Police control point situated between the West and South Stands.      There is

also a computer which shows all 95 turnstiles and can tell at any time

during a match how many persons have passed through each turnstile at any

given point.

Each section of the ground is shown in separate columns, each column shows

a number of turnstiles for that area and how many persons have passed

through each turnstile and at the bottom of each column the total is shown

for that area of the ground.

There are six areas of the ground recorded on the computer and at the end

there is a total shown for the full attendance in the ground.      The

computer scans all turnstiles and is updated every two and a half seconds.

On Saturday 15 April 1989, I was on duty for the semi-final between

Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, and commenced my duties at 10am on that

date.      At about 12.45pm after the turnstiles were open I switched all

 video recorders on to record all the fans as they were entering the ground

 via the turnstiles.

 During the afternoon leading up to the kick off time at about 2.15pm I

 noticed that the crowd appeared to be slow in arriving at the turnstiles.

 I am not sure of the size of the crowd but believe it to be 25,000 and

 3 0 ,0 00 .

 At 2.40pm that same date, I checked with the camera which covers the

 Penistone Road area and noticed that there were very few people in
                                                     *Vf tfcs cyj k c - f >. J
 streets and on checking the computer it was showing 19,000 plus.^ When

 each area of the ground gets near to capacity the totals start to pulsate,

 the total capacity for that area of the ground being 21,000, which told me

 that nearly all the Nottingham supporters were in the ground and it was

 near to full capacity.

 I then switched to the camera that was covering the Leppings Lane end of

 the ground and noticed that there was a large gathering of fans in that
area.   I could see that the fans were spread from the turnstile entrance

right back into Leppings Lane, fully blocking the road.   I would estimate

that there would be between 3,000 and 5.000 fans.   I made a check of the

computer and saw that the figures for the West Stand were pulsating and

showing near to capacity and the Leppings Lane figures were showing

approximately 7,000 which would be near to capacity and the computer would

be at a point to start pulsating,   The figures on the computer start to

pulsate when the capacities get to within 15% of the total.

As I looked at the scene I could see the crowd getting larger and many at

the back of the crowd were surging forward pushing violently towards the

turnstiles.    From that point I could also see Police Officers trying to

get the crowd into some sort of order but they were being pushed to one

 side out of the way.   I saw several missiles being thrown towards the

 Police.   A large contingent of the fans were climbing the walls over the

 top of the turnstiles, and they were landing on the asbestos roofs on the

 inside of the ground and jumping on to people who were on the inside of

 the ground to break their fall as they landed.

 On the South Stand of this area I saw a mounted Policeman being pushed on

 his horse down towards a large double door which leads into the rear of

 the West Stand.

 During all this I could hear several officers including Superintendent

 Marshall, requesting further assistance in that area, for the double doors

 to be opened in order to let fans into the ground to save a major incident

 outside, also for the match to be delayed for a further 15 minutes.

 At this point I noticed that a large door situated on the South Side of

 Leppings Lane was open, and there was a surge of about 1,000 fans run into

 the ground.   I could tell from the noises on the radios from the officers

 in that area that the Liverpool fans were very boisterous and excited and

  appeared to be heavily intoxicated with drink.
I then turned to the camera that was inside the ground and covered the

area of the West Stand and it was obvious that the situation was getting

out of hand and people were being pushed up against the fencing on the

perimeter of the ground.

Control that further Police assistance was required urgently at the

Leppings Lane end of the ground, but each time I tried to use the radio I

was blocking others already using the radio, so I did not try further to

use it.

I then tried to use the internal telephone system to contact Police

Control but again each time I tried the line was engaged and could not get

 through.    At this point Mr Lock then left the video room in order to

 organise some safety measures with the security personel.

 Also present during this time in the video room was a Mr Roger Holdsworth,

 he is the person who installed all the videos and computer system.

 As he could also see what was taking place he also left the room in order

 to assist in any way he could.

 I could see that all available officers were being sent to this area of

 the ground to assist with the injured and dying.

 By this time injured persons were being brought to the players entrance of

 the ground and I assisted in treating people in that area and arranging

 for ambulances to be directed in that area to ferry the injured to

 hospital.

 I can say that during the time prior to the major incident the Police

 personal radios were working very well but during the day there appeared

 to be some distortion and some messages could not be read clearly.

 I would like to add that in my opinion, the main cause of this major

 incident was caused by the Liverpool fans arriving at the match too late

 and being under the influence of drink and trying to enter the ground
without tickets.   It was obvious that looking at the crowd outside the

ground prior to kick-off there were several thousands that were attempting

to enter without tickets at all cost to the safety of other Liverpool

supporters inside the ground.

During the incident I was trying to concentrate on messages being received

on the Police radio network but did not listen to what was being

transmitted on the back to back radio system owned by the club, as I knew

Mr Lock would deal with any situation that had developed.

After the incident I made a note of all the people that had entered   the

ground as shown on the computer and they are as follows   .-

Spion Kop                          19.906

                   TOTAL            48,666

 entering the ground due to the gates being opened and several hundreds

 entering the ground without tickets and trying to gain access, by any

 me ans.

HAROLD GUEST




Police Constable 1421




I am a Police Officer in the South Yorkshire Police at present stationed

at Deepcar.

During the last four years I have worked all football matches at

Hillsborough Football Ground.

My duties consist of working in the video room in company with Chief

Security Officer, Mr Lock.

Under the ground regulations in respect of the amount allowed in each

section of ground, it is my duty to check with the computer, the number of

persons who have entered and then the number of persons outside the ground

about to enter, to make sure that no more persons are allowed into that

area than the regulations set.    If there are to inform control to arrange

for turnstiles to be closed and for the persons outside the ground to be

moved to an area where there is sufficient room to accommodate them.

This is very important at a no ticket match where the numbers attending

are not known in advance.

On a ticket match this rolg becomes a watching brief with the main

concerns being persons turning up at the match without tickets.

The video room is situated near to the players entrance on the South

Stand.   My duties are to liaise with the club and the Police.    Any

problems which may arise on behalf of the club are passed over to Mr Lock

.and" and involving the Police are forwarded by radio or telephone through

to the control room.

In this room there are twenty T.V. monitors which are covered by cameras

which are strategically placed around the ground to cover all 95

turnstiles.    There is also a T.V. monitor which can be operated by a

switch which will operate and show any view by the cameras from the main
                                   -   2   -




Police control point situated between the West and South Stands.                      There is

also a computer which shows all 95 turnstiles and can tell at any time

during a match how many persons have passed through each turnstile at any

given point.

Each section of the ground is shown in separate columns, each column shows

a number of turnstiles for that area and how many persons have passed

through each turnstile and at the bottom of each column the total is shown

for that area of the ground.

There are six areas of the ground recorded on the computer and at the end

there is a total shown for the full attendance in the ground.                   The

computer scans all turnstiles and is updated every two and a half seconds.

On Saturday 15 April 1989, I was on duty for the semi-final between

Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, and commenced my duties at 10am on that

date.      At about 12.45pm after the turnstiles were open I switched all

video recorders on to record all the fans as they were entering the ground

via the turnstiles.

During the afternoon leading up to the kick off time at about 2.15pm I

noticed that the crowd appeared to be slow in arriving at the turnstiles.

I am not sure of the size of the crowd but believe it to be 25,000 and

3 0 ,0 0 0 .

At 2 . 40pm that same date, I checked with the camera which covers the

Penistone Road area and noticed that there were very few people in
                                                       VH ( f il   S^o.'cyj i < C j O .
streets and on checking the computer it was showing 19,000 plus                       When

each area of the ground gets near to capacity the totals start to pulsate,

the total capacity for that area of the ground being 21,000, which told me

that nearly all the Nottingham supporters were in the ground and it was

near to full capacity.

I then switched to the camera that was covering the Leppings Lane end of

the ground and noticed that there was a large gathering of fans in that
                                    -   3   -




area.     I could see that the fans were spread from the turnstile entrance

right back into Leppings Lane, fully blocking the road.       I would estimate

that there would be between 3,000 and 5,000 fans.       I made a check of the

computer and saw that the figures for the West Stand were pulsating and

showing near to capacity and the Leppings Lane figures were showing

approximately 7,000 which would be near to capacity and the computer would

be at a point to start pulsating,       The figures on the computer start to

pulsate when the capacities get to within 13% of the total.

As I looked at the scene I could see the crowd getting larger and many at

the back of the crowd were surging forward pushing violently towards the

turnstiles.     From that point I could also see Police Officers trying to

get the crowd into some sort of order but they were being pushed to one

side out of the way.     I saw several missiles being thrown towards the

Police.     A large contingent of the fans were climbing the walls over the

top of the turnstiles, and they were landing on the asbestos roofs on the

inside of the ground and jumping on to people who were on the inside of

the ground to break their fall as they landed.

On the South Stand of this area I saw a mounted Policeman being pushed on

his horse down towards a large double door which leads into the rear of

the West Stand.

During all this I could hear several officers including Superintendent

Marshall, requesting further assistance in that area, for the double doors

to be opened in order to let fans into the ground to save a major incident

outside, also for the match to be delayed for a further 15 minutes.

Leppings Lane was open, and there was a surge of about 1,000 fans run into

the ground.     I could tell from the noises on the radios from the officers

in that area that the Liverpool fans were very boisterous and excited and

appeared to be heavily intoxicated with drink.

             area.     I could see that the fans were spread from the turnstile entrance

             right back into LcJ^pings Lane, fully blocking the road.       I would estimate

             that there would be between 3.000 and 5,000 fans,      I made a check of the

             computer and saw that the figures for the West Stand were pulsating and

             showing near to capacity and the Leppings Lane figures were showing

             approximately 7,000 which would be near to capacity and the computer would

             be at a point to start pulsating,      The figures on the computer start to

             pulsate when the capacities get to within 15 % of the total.

             As 1 looked at the scene I could see the crowd getting larger and many at

             the back of the crowd were surging forward pushing violently towards the

             turnstiles.    From that point I could also See Police Officers trying to

             get the crowd into some sort of order but they were being pushed to one

             side out of the way.     I saw several missiles being thrown towards the

             Police.    A large contingent of the fans were climbing the walls over the

             top of the turnstiles, and they were landing on the asbestos roofs on the

             inside of the ground and jumping on to people who were on the inside of

             the ground to break their fall as they landed.

             On the South Stand of this area I saw a mounted Policeman being pushed on

             his horse down towards a large double door which leads into the rear of

             the West Stand.

             During all this I could hear several officers including Superintendent

             Marshall, requesting further assistance in that area, for the double doors

             to be opened in order to let fans into the ground to save a major incident

             outside, also for the match to    be delayed for a further 15 minutes.

             At this point I noticed that    a large door situated on the South Side of

             Leppings Lane was open, and there was a surge of about 1,000 fans run into

             the ground.    I could tell from the noises on the radios from the officers

             in that area that the Liverpool fans were very boisterous and excited and

             appeared to be heavily intoxicated with drink.

             I then tried to use the internal telephone system to contact Police

             Control but again each time I tried the line was engaged and coaid not get

             through.     At this point Mr Lock then left the video room in order to

             organise some safety measures with the security personel.

             Also present during this time in the video room was a Mr Roger Holdsworth,

             he is the person who              installed     all thevideosand computer system.

             As he could also see              what was taking place he also left the room in order

             to assist in any way he could.

             I could see that all available officers were being sent to this area of

             the ground to assist with the injured and dying.

             By this time injured persons were being brought to the players entrance of

             the ground and I assisted i,i treating people in that area and arranging

             for ambulances to be directed in that area to ferry the injured to

             hospital .

             I can say that during the time prior to the major incident the Police

             personal radios were working very well but during the day there appeared

             to be some distortion and some messages                   could not be read clearly.

             I would like to add that in my opinion,the main cause of this major

             incident was caused by the Liverpool fans arriving at the match too late

            and being under the influence of drink and trying to enter the ground

   without tickets.     It. was obvious that looking at the crowd outside the

   ground prior to kick-off there were several thousands that were attempting
                    #
   to enter without tickets fit all cost to the safety of other Liverpool

   supporters inside the ground.

   During the incident I was trying to concentrate on messages being received

   on the Police radio network hut did not listen to what was being

   transmitted on the     back to back radio system owned by the club,as I knew

   Mr Lock would deal     with any situation that had developed.

   After the incident     I made a note of all the people that hadentered the

   ground as shown on     the computer and they are as follows :-

   Spion Kop                               19,906

   North Stand                              8,109

   South Stand Covered                      4,740

   South Stand Uncovered                    3,255

   Leppings Lane                            7,038

   West Stand                               5,618

                      TOTAL               48,666

  These numbers would not give a true reading of the exact amount of persons

  entering the ground due to the gates being opened and several hundreds

  entering the ground without tickets and trying to gain access, by any

  means.

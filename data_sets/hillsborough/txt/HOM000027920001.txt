HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY PINAL REPORT

In response to Mr Gilbert's note of 24 January I discussed with
him the desirability of providing a CFR copy to Peter Wright, the
Chief Constable of: South Yorkshire. As the South Yorkshire Force
bore the brunt of criticism following the publication of the
interim report, it is inevitable thafcvtfaa^vedla will look to the
Chief Constable for early comment on the final report.

Mr Gilbert indicated that he would discuss the matter with the
Police Department but was not optimistic that an exception would
be made in favour of Mr Wright1

If advance copies are made available to the press (MrMower's note
of 2 6 January) to provide them with preparation time, then I
suggest that the case for providing a similar facility to
Mr Wright is strengthened. There is no likelihood of Mr Wright
not honouring the embargo and in consequence there is little risk
factor.

If this request is acceded to I would be pleased to arrange for
delivery to Mr Wright at the appointed time on 29th.

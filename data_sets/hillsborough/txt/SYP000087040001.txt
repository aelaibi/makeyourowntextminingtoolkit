                         impossible         to say what was happening at that                              end of the ground.

                         On arrival         my serial        a s s i s t e d other       serials       to form a cordon            leading

                         from the bridge to the                   sweet       shop at the entrance                 to the ground.

                         Although         I was    in p o ss es si on of a personal                   radio       I did not have a

                         earpiece and           I could hear            nothing of the communications.                     On arrival

                         of the first           amublance,            Inspector M or t o n        i nstructed our Serial              to

                         enter      the    rear of the West                 stand enclosure           thro ug h one of the          large

                         Once      through      this    gate      I saw       injured      persons         and bodies strewn about

                         the      floor at      the    rear      of the West stand.                   At   this    point the      serial

                         p rob le m was      confined        po       this area alone.            -

                        Once       the    injured     persons asnd bodies         had been removed I took up a

                        T here      I joined other           officers who were a t t e m p t i n g                 to   prevent    fans    re

                         enter      the enclosure          t h r ou gh the tunnel            to   look       for    friends and

                         relatives.

              and that         the vast m a j o r i t y       from the encl os ur es            had gone onto                 the        pitch.

               In view of this             I saw       it as my duty to prevent any                       persons        entering

              the enclosure            via the tunnel              to enable --emergency a s s is ta nc e                 to be

              hurl     of verbal abuse                from fans,       the worst        coming       from those who were

              clearly under            the    influence         oK^i nt ox i c a n t s .     Whilst        it was        possible               to

              reason w ith the more                   rational,      the m a j o r i t y were        taking      no notice at

              all    and several a t t e m p t e d           to force       their way through.

              With     no a n n o u n c e m e n t s    coming      over    the     l ou ds peakers        quite a number                 of

              fans     b el ieved that          the m a t c h was         still     going a h e a d and were              pleading

              with     police to         call    on the       referee to           postpone     the match.               At one

              stage        I had to      request        the a ss is t a n c e      of other     serials as           I feared

              that     the fans who we had                  refused ac ce ss         t h r ou gh the tunnel              were       going

              to vent        their a-nger on us.                Eventually          I h e ar ck a    loudspeaker

              ground.         The a t m o s p h e r e was       like a tinder           box and       I feared for the

              sa fe ty of the          police at         this      stage .as most        of the anger was                 d ir ected

          car to a cafe               near    to Leppings               Ln entrance,          sat down and had a meal

          a nd   cup of tea.            Whilst we were            sitting        down,    I w i tn es se d a number             of

          were    closed.              I left the      cafe             at about       1.45pm    (1345)        and made my way

          to Leppings Ln entrance where                        I was     due to meet          four friends        from

          ticket        on his arrival,          by now the        crowds       had become        notic ea bl y greater

          and    they seemed to have more urgency about                               them,    it was only at this

          stage       I realised my ticket             was for the L ep pings Ln standing area

          behind the goal w hich was for Pens 3 and 4.                                   I tried to make a point

          of getting a seat at awa y matches                       because        I d o n ’t like the           noise     or

          the    crush or fences and the general                         i rritation of         it,   so    1 resigned

          m yself       to the fact      that     I would have            to go to the Leppings Ln standing

          Pe n and went         to the       turnstile     situated to the               left of the L ep pings Ln

          entrance,          there were       no queues at this               turnstile,        and as     I

          a p p r o a c h e d the turnstile         I a pp ro a ch e d        by a Police C onstable who                  saw

          my ticket,          who    politely told me that                I was at the wrong turnstile and

          c or rected me to the              r i ght o n e .

          Ha vi n g     reflected on the s ituation for a few minutes                             I decided to go

          in,    I was a pp re h en s iv e       because        previous       k n owledge      told me that         it

          w o ul d be very crushed and the view w ould be poor and a lot of swaying.

          I realised towards             the turnstiles             the       crowd was       getting      larger    behind

moving     slowly.            I stood      in the queue apfyrox five yards             from the

turnstile,       everyone a pp ea r ed to be in ggrad humo ur .a nd there did. not

seem to be any           problem at this stage. / I w i t n e s se d at least two

 fficers      on horseback and two foot                  ^ajfrol    officers     to each turnstile

at this section of the ground.                        The time was      now about 2 . 2 5 p m     (1425).

At this     time       I was    standing        in the queue       to the turnstile        to the      far

right    of the Leppings Ln entrance                    to the     right of me was a waist             high

red metal       barrier,       which       ran from the turnstile          to the wall        that     opens

into    forecourt,        I then saw a youth on the other                  side of the        barrier

who was on his own.                 He a pp ro a ch e d the queue       I was     standing     in.        He

s tood two or three yards                  from me at the barrier.



He said,      'Does any one want                to swop t i c k e t s ’ nobody    reacted I said,

'Yeah    I do    lad'.         He    came up to his side            of the barrier,        I asked

where    the ticket was             for and he said         it was for     the    N orth Stand.           He

then said,       'I wanna go with my mates'.                     I said,   ' I    don't want to           go

in here".        He then showed me his ticket and something                         like    'It   is

alright'.        Then he said           'The thing       is mine     is a £14.00 ticket and

yours    is a £ 6.00 ticket             give us a five quid on top'.                  I was    in a bit

of a    panic,     thinking         I. did not have any m oney on me,              to my    relief        I

found some       change w hi ch was about £4.50.                     I was getting      flustered

because     I did not want            to    lose the o p po rt un it y of the ticket and the

lad was trying           to    calm me down saying           'Take your time,"          I said,        "Look

I have only got £4.50'.                    He    replied    'Its OK'    a lad behind said            'I

will    give £14.00'           but the      lad said     ’We have     sorted     it o u t ’ I was

s u r pr i s e d and    impressed gave him £ 4.50 and shook hands.                         I a sked for

his address        so    I could send the m on ey on to him,                he d ec lined saying we

will    meet again,           we shook hands         e xchanged first      names his was

and he went        off away from the turnstile                   towards   the bridge,      and main

 entrance.             I would describe       this y outh as white          in his      late teens,

 clean shaven with dark hair,                 I think,       his hair was medium            length and       I

 think    he was wearing a dark              coat to his waist and            possibly a white

 shirt,     I cannot       remember     his de sc ri pt io n exactly as           I was busy        looking

 for the m oney and scrutinising                 the tickets.            I then    left the queue

and w a l k e d    right across        to the extreme         left and joined the queue

there.       There was a P o l i c e m a n on this turnstile,               checking        that

 everyone      had a ticket         I queued for about           five miniates and gained entry-

after     handing my ticket            to the turnstile         operaysr.          1 met my friends

at a Tea Kiosk wi th in the North Stand where we d is cussed this                                  incident

for a few minutes.                 I then    left them and nyfde my way to the seat.                         I

 knew where        it was    from    previous      knowledge-;       The seat was situated              in

the N or th Stand on the             half way line,          approx thirty yards          from the

 touch    line.          The time was       now 2.4 5 p m    (14455.       I looked a ro un d the

ground and noted that               the Forest     end was      comfor ta bl y full and the

L ep pings Ln end          in the    stands     to the extreme left was about                sixty    per

 cent    full,     this    stand adjo ins West S ta nd the pens 3 and 4 was

a b s o l u t e l y jamned and there did          not appear       to be any swaying at all

and the      pen adj oi ni ng       on the extreme          right was     only    about     ten per     cent

full.        The       seating a rea above was        only ab/ut         sixty    per   cent full.           I

then saw two beach balls                in the middle         s e c t i o n s , they were    bouncing

 off    p e o p l e ’s heads,   this    surprised me^as          normally the fans would be

 patting     the ball about          between thems/l v e s .            I also    noticed that        there

was     no m ov em en t at all w it h in the y w o centre               sections.       The

ILiverpool        players then       came o r i ^ ^ h e     pitch and began to war m up,

 shortly     followed by the Forest              players and the game' began at 3pm                   (1500)

 I then noticed that the other areas                      in the Leppings         Ln end had

 increased to about 80/i on the                 left and to the          right    about 50%.          It

was a very         intense start,        and Forest         i mm ed iately wan two      corners and

 there was        no    reaction    from the Liverpool           fans    in Leppings Ln.             After

                    about     three      or four minut es         there seemed       to be a lot of Police and

                    photographers at the L ep pings Ln e/rd.                       There was an        incident   on the

                    pitch where a shot             hit    the Fores/ b a r , it was         immediately       cleared to

                    the    other       end w hich was      the Le/pings Ln and          I could see there was a

                    continued when             people    sud denly a p pe ar e d on the      pitch these were        fans

                    a n d Police,        a P ol i ce m an went     to the    referee and some of the            players

                    were    trying       to persuade       fans to leave the          pitch.        It was    difficult

                    for me to see what was                happening      because     of the goal and the

                    advertising          boards.         I saw fans stagger          onto   the football       pitch as     if

                    they were          drunk,    then    I saw someone with a badly twisted arm,                  being

                    led away by a St Johns ambulance.                        After about       ten minutes      there

                    s eemed to be a lot of               people    lying    on the grass and people            everywhere,

                    appeared       confused and making             e xagerated mov em en ts and photographers

                    were    everywhere          taking    pictures,     they could ha ye made matters worse,

                    witnessed          pockets    of fighting       in the stands       in the Forest         end which

                    was    being       ex a c e r ba te d by photographers.           I then saw approx 200

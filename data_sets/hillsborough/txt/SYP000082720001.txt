were     by now thron g e d w ith               parked vehicles              and      large     crowds     of    people

could be seen drinking                    in groups          outside        public       houses      in the area,

can remember           seeing      not      only      loud men,          and w o m e n    drinking        out    of

dismayed.               Ambulances              were        present           at    that       location           and       injured

persons           were       being       treated.                DI    SCAIFE           had a       conversation with                     Police

Officer           (unknown          to me        although              he w a s         wearing        a uniform)              in my

presence           and       the    officer          was         crying.

Together           with       DI    SCAIFE         a n d DC           JONES        I walked           to    the       pitch       and     I.

re ca l l     the       ho r rif i c s i g h t          of       s e e i ng      dead and           injured           suppor ters          be ing

assisted           by P o l i c e        Officers            from          the     pitch area              towards          the     gym area.

Many      were       crying         and       there         was       confusion            with       so m a n y       people        wandering

a n d r u s h i n g in all               cii r e c t i o n s .

Many      Police         Officers             were      struggling                 to    carry        i n j u r e d a n d as         it    turned

out,      dead,         persons          from      the       field and              we     tried       to       assist        where       we

could        in this          respect           although,              I presume              due     to    our       cas u a l     mode       of

dr e s s ,    we    were        not      immediately                  recognised              as    Police        Officers.

Although           I gave          assistance               I left          the     bodies          with        the    officers           who

already           had    possession              and        I did          not     see     the      Leppings           Ln     gate      opened

or    even        k n o w at       that       stage         what       ha d      happened.

I believed              there       had       been      a    pitch          invasion           by L i v e r p o o l         fans     at    this

stage        and     thought          that       possibly              fighting            had      caused        the       injuries

although           this       was     l a te r     to       be    clarified              as    not     so,        It w as         a scene

w h ich      is    difficult             to     d es c r i b e        s i n c e so me         m a t ters        r e mai n cIe a r i n t ha

mi nd a n d        o t h e rs      becorne       fogged.               I f eel          that       un 1 ess      you    were        there       then

the    scene         cannot         be     imagined.                  DI    SCAIFE         obviously             saw     the      need     to

work      in a n        organised             manner         and       together            with      DC     JONES        I left         the

field        with       him     to a t t e n d       the         gym.       Once        there       it w a s      apparent           that       the

situation           was       grotesque            and       the       problems            enormous.

Det,      Supt.         McKAY       was       in a t t e n d a n c e          at    the       gym.         DI    SCAIFE        approached

h i m a n d as          he    did     so      I looked            around           me    and       saw a bou t         two     dozen       bodies

lying        on    the       floor       with      Police             Officer           in a t t e n d a n c e .         DI    SCAIFE

S h o c k e d and dismayed,            people were a t t e n d i n g           the Police Box and

a s s i s t a n c e was    given to them to allow them                        to    contact    their       relative

who w o u l d ob v i o u s l y be         concerned.

D'l SCAIFE,        DC J ONES a n d         I returned to the                ground and        passed the

appropriate          inform a t i o n to Det,           Supt.      McKAY.           That    done   the     three      of

us were       instructed to a t t e n d H a m m e r t o n Rd Police                     station where

relatives        of the d e c e a s e d         persons were         being         cared for.        The      journey

to H a m m e r t o n Rd took 40 minutes                 due to traffic               congestion.           Upon

arrival       at that         location,         DI SCAIFE and          I were         instructed      to      visit      t

1o c a 1 hos p 11 a 1s wi1 h a v i sw to               i nst ruct i ng the of f i c er s at              those

locations        regarding          the    details       required          by the C a s u a l t y B u r e a u at

E c c l e s f i e l d T r a ining    Centre.         It was a p p a r e n t         upon arrival         at    those

locations        that      the    officers        in a t t e n d a n c e    already        had the    situation

well    in hand.DI            S C A I F E and   I returned to the                  gy m n a s i u m at SUIFC and

were    then     instructed          to take P r o fessor USHER                    to a fatal      house       fire

w h i c h had o c c urred         in F2 D i v i s i o n and had suspi c i o u s               circumstances

surrounding          it.

I then t r a n s p o r t e d Prof.          USHER      to the      incident and from there                     back t

the H i l l s b o r o u g h    Incident.         At that       time a further matter                  had

oc c u r r e d at E c c l e s f i e l d    requiring my a s s i s t a n c e            involving      firearms a

I was     rec a 1 1 e d t o        m y D i v i s io n t o a s s i s t w i t h t hat.

I was     not    present           at L e p p i n g s Ln at any time.               I have     previous

experience         of     policing        the   ground but not              for many years and                not   in

this manner.

My feelings at             the    time were        of d i sbelief           and a long        lasting m e m o r y

what a p p e a r e d to be an unreal                 situation.

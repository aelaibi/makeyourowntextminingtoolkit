               I am a                   student at                   High School   in Bolton.
                                                          V/
               home with my mother.

               I would just like to refer to the questionnaire                     I have just filled in,

              and speak about an incident outside the turnstiles, where a policeman

               told me that he could get^me into the ground for money if I didn't

               have a ticket.           He saidr he could also get my friends in.

               I got to the turns tiJn? in Leppings Ln, Sheffield at about                      11

               (1100)       on the morning Saturday 15/4/89 (150489) a nd sat down \6n the ^

               floor waiting for the gates to o p e n .
                                     <v\ W t sSUffc? >
               I was with

                                   ^ojfton.
                                     tc       We had our backs to the wall between the West

              Stand turnstiles and the terraces turnstile and were

              all     reading some newspapers         that I had bought.
                                                                                               PAGE        2

                    Although we were very early for the game, we all had tickets, and had

                    gone to the ground early because we thought that there was going to be

                    some pre match entertainment.        After about     13 minutes we heard the


           \V A
                    clinking of a gate, and I saw a blue concertina gate in our wall,               open

                    slightly and 2 policemen come out and stood in front of us.

                    Somebody else on the inside closed the gate.            I would describe the

                    policeman as one being

                    j ust a                                                thought he had dark hair

                    as well.     There was nothing different on his uniform from other

                    policemen I've seen except that he was wearing a flat cap, which was

                    all dark with a badge at the front.         The other policeman was a bit

                    younger                           but I never noticed him much because he

                    stood slightly behind the first one,        but I did see he had a helmet on

                    and not a flat     cap and he was clean shaven.        I think he had da rk ha i r
(M     m            as well.     The older one spoke to us and I thought that his accent was

                    local.     He said to us "Your here early.       I ’ve got Steve McMAHON in the

           *r       sweep stake, what do you think of my chances?"                   said,   "Very good

             tai    because he scores      a lot."   Then the policeman said,      "Have you got

                 ' tickets?" We told him we          had and he said,    "If you hadn't have had,    I

                    would have got you into the ground for a tenner."            He then said,     "So

                    tell your    mates."   He half   started to go away but stopped and said

Qfji                     mu c^ did you     pay for your tickets?"       Steve said "Six Pound

QJ& |.            /^lach."        The policeman then said,     "Tell your mates    its Ten Pound for

                    sitting down and Five      pounds for standing up."       Steve said,    "Are you
             ✓
                    going to see the match" and the policeman said "Yes."            During this

                    time the other     policeman never spoke at all.       They then walked off and

                    turned along the path by the river.         About half hour later I saw the
     ■v
                    same two policemen come back from the river path and stand at the

                    turnstile    perimeter fen c e with some other policemen that were there

                    and some fans and then after a few minutes they came back to the blue
                                                                              PAGE
                                                                              S2118

           concertina gate they had come out of, knocked on it, the door opened

           and they went back inside.     The only thing about the policeman that

           spoke to us, was that he was swearing a lot whilst speaking.      I'm not

           sure   if I could recognise these policemen again.    Whilst these two

           policemen were talking to us there were no others nearby,     nor were

           there any fans nearby.    Just a final   point about the two policemen,

           the one that spoke to us was well built without being fat and he was

           quite tall.    The second one was slightly taller than the other, and he

           was slimmer.

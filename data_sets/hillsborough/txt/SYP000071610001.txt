We did not stop on route,          I d o n ’t know which way we went because      I was

playing       cards and was not paying any attention to the road.           I d o n ’t

think we were subjected to any travel delays.                 We had started off the

journey at 1030 am.

There was no one drinking any alcohol             on the coach and the only time I

saw anyone drinking on the whole journey from home until                I got into

the ground was just as we entered Sheffield,             right on the outsk i rts

when I saw about 20 fans drinking cans of beer.                 I did not know which

supporters they were they were all wearing             red.

We arrived in Sheffield about             1245 hours and parked in Wheels Ln,

there where other         coaches already parked there.         As we arrived a

Policeman came on the          coach and told us not to take any weapons or

alcohol       into the ground.     I was sitting downstairs.        The Policeman did

not go upstairs.          After that we did not get any directions from Police

officers.

We walked to the turnstile entrance             in Leppings Ln.     Mum then went

into the ground into the West Stand with my sister and our neighbour



The    rest of us the remainder of the people from the list I gave

             earlier walked back up the road for 100 yards waiting for a friend of

                                  We waited   in the /-o^di for half and hour but the friend

             did not arrive.       The time was amout   1.30 pm,          (1330).     It was quiet        in

             the area around the turnstileA.         I saw ttie letter           ’B ’ on the turnstile
 s.o. e
     u (u-   so I knew it was the right entrance.           /There were no queues.              There

             were about seven Policemen by the turnstiles and another ten dotted
V0 LKG 6 -
     hrT     around between the gates and the t/rnsti l e s .                I did not notice any
  u \ 1—
             stewards      in this area.

             I did not witness any fighting disorder or drunkenness between our

             arrival      point and the ground.

             As we approached the turnstile                              was searched and they

             found a flag,      he ran back to the coach with the flag.                We went     in

             through the turnstile and waited f         o     r     W    e     all handed our

             tickets      in at turnstile   ’B* entrance.

             I did not see any other gates open other than the/turnstiles.                        I     did

             not witness any unauthorised entry to the groui
                                                                    1 f-i J a i . OiSS

             way to go.  I don't remembe/r seeing any signs.

             We went through the tu'(>Tie/ which was in           front of us       the tunnel    was

             cl e a r .

 M   r       I did not see a Pol/ceman or a steward at either the entrance of the

             exits to the tunne

             At the end of th4 tunnel we all went           right       into pen    three, the

             position we stood last year.         About fifteen minutes             l a t e r ______

             joined us on the terracing.

             There was no disorder or incident between our entry point and                       the

             match viewing      point.

             I did not witness any consumption of alcohol at any time in the ground.

        3 after tradgedy end up here                      S. Moved to here because

                                                                       was too small and could

                                                          not see the match



                                     Segregation fences

        I have shown the three         positions we were at during the time I was on

        the terracing.          Position one we were there for an hour by this time

        the terracing was filling up                                   decided he could not see

        so he moved to position 2.             The time was about 2.30 pm,          (1430).     I

        think that at 2.30 pm (1430)            the pen was as full as it should have

        been,   no more supporters should have been allowed in.

        At 2.45 pm (1445)         it felt    like being       in a crowd in the terracing at a

        derby game      (Liverpool    v Everton)     in these games you normally hurt and

        possibly end up with a sore stomach.                  At that time it felt     it was

        going to be that sort of a game.                Just after ten to three we felt             that

        we were    in some sort of trouble.             I was talking to

        about   it.     B                                                1 the pressure on us

        from behind was         intense and constant                      hands   crossed in front

        of me to protect myself,            it is something      I always do at games to

        protect my stomach.          We were all     in the positions as shown in the

        diag ram

          I don't    remember seeing the players come out on the pitch,          but I knew

          they were there from the cheers.       The pressure       remained the same

          until about 2.55 pm (1455).       It started getting worse now I would

          guess that    I was about five people from the front barrier

          fencing just to the    right of the goal.      I was   completely squashed

           up against the five    people and they were all up against the

          fence.                   was   perpendicular    to me all the rest ofthe

           group were facing the pitch.       I would hear screams coming

          from in front of me and to my left I presumed the screams from

          in front of me were coming from whoever was up g a i n s t the

          and I remember seeing a photographer on th^/running track taking

          photographs of us.     I think he was from the Mirror.          I have seen

           the paper and the photograph since and I think            it was the one

          taken.

                            I hap noticed two Policemen on the running

          track of the ground just behind the goal and to the left.              We

          were all   very frightened,    we were shouting and screaming at

          the photographer,    the Policeman and the fans who had got out

          of the pen onto the pitch?      "Help us get us o u t ’    the Policemen

were    looking at us and talking    into their      radios.     The fans

who had got out of the pen were up on the fencing trying to pull

                   up because he had his arms        in the air.     They

managed to get hold of his arms and they lifted him an inch or

two he told me that this had helped him to breath because he was

 so tightly packed in they could not pull him out.

I saw a Policeman pull the fans away from the fencing,               the fans who

had been trying to pull             up     Because of the

pressure                        earlier)    had his face pressed into

a mans arm his nose and mouth were pushed into the mans

jumper,    he could not breath,    then        started screaming you

could not hear his voice because it was muffled by the mans

jumper.     He stopped screaming and passed/out.          We shouted at him
             —                                  /----
 to bring him round I tried to hit him to wake him up but I

could not move a muscle.

We were all screaming at            for a few minutes then

 passed out his head went      limp and rested on my shoulder.              We

were all    like this for what seemed like five rnrnutes.            Then

the pressure started to ease up.          I d o n ’t know what    caused

that    I dont know if the game had been stopped          I could not see

 As the pressure relaxed around me                               started to

sink to the floor onto their k n e e s /     I held them both,                   ln

 my left hand and ______in my rigl/i hand I held them by their

clothing,    chest height.    I was semi bent trying to pick them off

their     knees.

The    crush came back and I was trapped in that         position.     I felt people

standing all over my back,      they were standing on heads

and shoulders trying to get out of the pen over the fencing.                     It was

like that for just under a minute         I think.

There was a massive surge down the middle to the left of /ne as a

           result of the surge       I was   catapaulted to my right and ended

          up against the segregating fence to pens one and two.                 I had let

           go of j                  because of y ffe force of the push.        I

          noticed    there was                    and me,      there were other fans

          up against the f e n c e /   I helped         -over the segregating fence

          into pen one and 'two.       A fan in p       one
                                                        '   and two reached through

          the railings to /ielp me up because        I could not get over on my own.

            Then a Pol iceman gra bbed piy arms and dragged me over the top

          of the fence into the pen

          Me and        aere then shouting at the fans in pen three to help

           and        who by this time were lying down on the floor                in pen

          three where    I had last seen them.       Within about five minutes the

          fans had picked them up and passed them over the segregation

          fence.     Then a Policeman carried them onto the pitch through a

          gateway which was      in pens one and two.       The Police would not let

          rne go through on to the pitch with them.

          We were left on the terraces         in pen one and two until about 4

          o ’clock   (1600).

          I looked back into pen three and the crush was over.                The first

          thing    I saw was   people handing dead bodies over the segregating

          fence    into pen one and two.

          I had a brief    glimpses of bodies       lying on    the terracing to      the

          left of where    I stood before in^peri three.

          I tried to look up into the West          stand to    see me   Mum but I    could

          not see her.     I later found her.

          When I looked out onto th4 pitch I could see it was mainly fans

          treating the injured th</re did not seem to be many Policemen.
CAT       There were Police      but they were stopping fans going          places and

C O M M   do i n9 Other things,     'fthen I thought they should have been

          treating the injured,

    and I got onto the pitch at 4 o'clock    (1600) met up with

              and left the ground when I heard the tannoy telling

                                                        I was not

injured in any way.

My views on the way the incident was handled after the match are

 that the fans were the only ones giving treatment.       The Police

did not seem to be doing much they were mainly standing around

in groups talking.    I did not see any stewards apart from

those   carrying around water on the pitch for     injured fans

approximately five was all   I saw.

The Police were too late realising what was happening and when

they did realise they were inadequate.

The FA should have examined the ground and the reasoning given

for ticket allocation was wrong.

I. went to the match last yej/r and the difference to me was.

We were stopped on tj/fe coach before we we*/nt into Sheffield and
                   7 --------------------- '-----------------------
thoroughly searched.

We were escorted to the ground by the Police a/id not allowed

into Sheffield and fans who did not have t iykejls were stopped

prior to reaching the Leppings Ln turnstiles and turned away,

None of these things happened this year.

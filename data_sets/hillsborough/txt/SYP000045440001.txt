          HILLSBOROUGH -              DECEASED PHOTOGRAPHS

         I refer to your letter of 14 December 1990 in which you indicate the
         arrangements made for securing two sets of the photographs. Arrangements
         have been made for these to be collected. I have noted that the costs
         will be arranged direct from the Hillsborough- Inquiry Budget.

          Can I thank you for the assistance rendered in this matter.

   I refer to yohr/letter of 17 November 1989 in which you requested photographs
   of the deceased from the Hillsborough Incident.

   I have caused two sets of these photographs to be prepared, one set of which
   has already been collected by your Inquiry Team and the other set is awaiting
   collection.

   Detective Inspector Eggleston, the Head of our Scenes of Crime Department, is
   dealing with this matter, and is liaising with Inspector Sewers, a member of
   the Inquiry Team based at Furnival House, concerning any further requirements.

   The cost in this instance                                     is          £971-60,   which     will        be       charged      to   the
   Hillsborough Inquiry budget.

    If I can be of any further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me.

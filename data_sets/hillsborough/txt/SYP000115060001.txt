Dated                          180589                                                                                                                Si g n e d



              On    Saturday             15th       April          1989       I was       on       duty    at    the    Hillsborough

              Football             Stadium          in       connection             with       the    FA    Cup       Semi-Final          football

              match       between             Liverpool                FC    and    Nottingham             Forest       FC.        I was       part     of

              serial          34    under       the          supervision             of       Police       Sergeant          Sherratt.

              At    10.00          am    all    Officers                attended          a    briefing          in    the    g r o u n d ’s N o r t h

              stand.           At       11.00       am       serials          number          34    and    35    were       briefed       by    the

          y Commander,                                                              Communication                was    by    means       of    Personal

              Radios          which          were    in          the    possession             of    the    Inspector          and     two

              Sergeants             only.

              At    11.15          am    we    took          up    our       position          on    Claywheels             Lane.      In      company

              with       PC    1232          Hood    we          were       responsible             for    the    direction          of     coaches

              containing                Liverpool                supporters          along          Claywheels          Lane.

              At    S .25      pm w e         were       further             deployed          to    supervise          the    arrival          of

              supporters                at    the    junction                of    Claywheels             Lane    and       Penistone          Road

              North.           We       were    positioned                   near    to       "The    Gate*       public       house.           We    were

               instructed               to    form       a       filter       line    of       Officers.              The    large     volume         of

              supporters                walking          to       the       ground    continued             for       some    40    minutes          with

              many       of    their          numbers             spilling          from       the    pavement          and    onto       the

              roadway.              there       was          a    range       of    ages       amongst          the    supporters.              However
                                                                                                                                       PAGE
                                                                                                                                       R433

the    largest          proportion             were       those       under       30       years       of    age.          A    minority

of    these    supporters                were       consuming          alcohol             as    they       approached                our

lines.        They       were         instructed           to       deposit       the       alcohol          before

continuing.              All         those     so       required       did       so,       although          a    proportion

remained       in       our      presence           to    consume          their          purchase.              In    some       eases

where    the       supporter             was       in    possession          of       a    quantity          of       canned

alcohol,       he       would         consume           each    can    or    distribute                it    amongst             other

supporters.              I did          not    witness          any    s u p p l e r            refusing          to       deposit          his

purchase       of       alcohol.              The       supportewrwere                    generally          well          behaved.

At    2.55    pm we        were         requested          to/attend             at       *The       Gate"       p u b l i c house

after    receiving               a    report        of    disorder          inside.              A    number          of    men       had

been    ejected           from         the     public          house       and    were          standing          outside.             They

showed       signs        of         being     involved             in a    struggle.             They       did       riot r e q u i r e

medical       treatment.                 On    access          being       gained          to    the       lounge          bar,       it    was

evident       from       the         damage        to    property          that       disorder             had    preceded             our

arrival.           It     was         quiet        on    our    departure.

On    returning           to         Penistone           Roarttva      further             call w a s       received            of

fighting       at       ’T h e       CSate’ p u b l i c        house.        Access             was    gained          and       although

there    was       no    disorder,             the       landlord          was    instructed                to    close          the       bar.

I left       the    premises             at    3.10       pm w h i c h      were          now    empty.           Once          again       our

serial       returned            to     North       Penistone          Road       resuming             original             duty.

I became       aware          that       transmissions                received             on    the       supervisors                radio

had    intensified,                  I was     unable          to    determine             the       content          of    these

transmissions.                   Police        Constable             106    Goss,          who       had    assisted             in    ’T h e

G a t e ’ public         house          was    ordered          to    return          to    his       own    serial             which       was

now    due    to    take         refreshment              at    the    Traffic             Garage,          Claywheels                Lane.

He    therefore          left         our     company.

Minutes       later,          PC      Goss     returned.              He    informed             us    that       there          were       no

officers       at       the      Traffic           Garage,          they    had       all       be    directed             to    assist          at

the    football          ground.              At    this       time    we    were          unaware          of    any       incident             at
                                                                                                                                                  PAGE
                                                                                                                                                  R433

       the   ground.            We     immediately                made          our   way        to       the    ground.              On    reaching

       the    entrance          to     the       Spion       Kop,          we    were          instructed             by    Inspector

       Townend       to     remain          outside.              After          a    few       minutes          we    entered             the     ground

       and   along        with        other       Officers             I was          instructed                to    set       up a       cordon

       across      the      access          to    the       Spion          Kop.        Our          responsibility                   was    to

       restrict          access        to     the      stand          by       persons          wanting          to    enter          or    re-enter

       the    Kop.

       Minutes       later         the      serial          was       directed             to       the    field.           Access          was

       gained       by    taking         the      walkway             between             the       North       stand       and       Spion        Kop.

       A    number       efc a m b u l a n c e s      were           parked          along          this    walkway.                 The     field       was

       littered/with               people.             Initially                I saw          people          pulling          advertising

^boards/from                    the    South          stand.           Naturally,                   I assumed          disorder              had

      - erup/ed.          However,            this      was          instantaneously                      refuted          by    a    contingent

       of/men       running           towards          me    with          a    body       lying          on an       advertising

jpi    board.        I gave           assistance             in       carrying             the       body       to    the       gymnasium.

       After       rendering           First          Aid,       I    immediately                   returned          to    the       field?         My
  *
       path    continually               impeded            by       the       flow       of    men       and    women          rushing

       through       the        walkway          carrying             bodies          towards             the    gymnasium.                  My

       attention          was        immediately             drawn             to    the       goal       posts       nearest          the        East

       stand.        I saw         three         bodies          on    boards             lying          in a    row.           They        were

       conveyed          directly           to    the       gymnasium.                    I gave          what       First       Aid

       assistance            could       be      reasonably                applied             to    each       victim.              In m a n y

       cases       it w a s      blatantly             obvious,                they       were       unretrievable.                     I

       continued           in    this       vein       for       approximately                      1 hour.

       Due    to    the      vast      numbers          on       the       field          requiring             assistance              1    never

       had    cause        to    direct          my    attention                to    the       West       Stand.           As       yet     I was

       unaware       of      the      precise          location                of    the       circumstances                of       the

PC 2055 Donnison

Bentley Police Station.




On Saturday 15th April 1989 I was on duty at the Hillsborough Football
Stadium in connection with the FA Cup Semi-Final football match between
Liverpool FC and Nottingham Forest FC. I was part of serial 34 under the
supervision of Police Sergeant 2248 Sherratt.

At 10.00 am all Officers attended a briefing in the ground's North stand.
At 11.00 am serials number 34 and 35 were briefed by the Conmnander,
Inspector Townend. Communication was by means of Personal Radios which
were in the possession of the Inspector and two Sergeants only.

At 11.15 am we took up our position on Claywheels Lane. In company with
PC 1232 Hood we were responsible for the direction of coaches containing
Liverpool supporters along Claywheels Lane.

At 2.25 pm we were further deployed to supervise the arrival of supporters
at the junction of Claywheels Lane and Penistone Road North. We were
positioned near to 'The Gate1 public house. We were instructed to form a
filter line of Officers. The large volume of supporters walking to the---
ground continued for some 40 minutes with many of their numbers spilling
frcm the pavement and onto the roadway. There was a range of ages amongst
the supporters. However the largest proportion were those under 30 years
of age. A minority of these supporters were consuming alcohol as they
approached our lines. They were instructed to deposit the alcohol before
continuing. All those so required did so, although a proportion remained
in our presence to consume their purchase. In some cases where the
supporter was in possession of a quantity of canned alcohol, he would
consume each can or distribute it amongst other supporters. I did not
witness any supporter refusing to deposit his purchase of alcohol. There
were no incidents of disorder at this location. The supporters were
generally well behaved.

At 2.55 pm we were requested to attend at 'The Gate' public house after
receiving a report of disorder inside. A number of men had been ejected
from the public house and were standing outside. They showed signs of
being involved in a struggle. They did not require medical treatment. On
access being gained to the lounge bar, it was evident from the damage to
property that disorder had preceded our arrival. It was quiet on our
departure.

On returning to Penistone Road, a further call was received of fighting at
'The Gate' public house. Access was gained and although there was no
disorder, the landlord was instructed to close the bar. I left the
premises at 3.10 pm which were now empty. Once again our serial returned
to North Penistone Road resuming original duty.

I became aware that transmissions received on the supervisors radio had
intensified, I was unable to determine the content of these transmissions.
Police Constable 106 Goss, who had assisted in 'The Gate1 public house was
ordered to return to his own serial which was now due to take refreshment
at the Traffic Garage, Claywheels Lane. He therefore left our company.

Minutes later, PC Goss returned. He informed us that there were no
officers at the Traffic Garage, they had all been directed to assist at the
football ground. At this time we were unaware of any incident at the
ground. We immediately made our way to the ground. On reaching the
entrance to the Spoin Cop, we were instructed by Inspector Townend to
remain outside. After a few minutes we entered the ground and along with
other Officers I was instructed to set up a cordon across the access to the
Spoin Cop. Our responsibility was to restrict access to the stand by
persons wanting to enter or re-enter the Cop.

Minutes later the serial was directed to the field. Access was gained by
taking the walkway between the North stand and Spoin Cop. A number of
ambulances were parked along this walkway. The field was littered with
people. Initially I saw people pulling advertising boards frcm the South
stand. Naturally, I assumed disorder had erupted. However, this was
instantaneously refuted by a contingent of men running towards me with a
body lying on an advertising board. I gave assistance in carrying the body
to the gymnasium. After rendering First Aid, I immediately returned to the
field; My path continually impeded by the flow of men and women rushing
through the walkway carrying bodies towards the gymnasium. My attention
was immediately drawn to the goal posts nearest the East stand. I saw
three bodies on boards lying in a row. They were conveyed directly to the
gymnasium. I gave what First Aid assistance could be reasonably applied to
each victim. In many cases it was blatantly obvious, they were
unretrievable. I continued in this vein for approximately 1 hour.

Due to the vast numbers on the field requiring assistance I never had cause
to direct my attention to the West Stand. As yet I was unaware of the
precise location of the circumstances of the incident. On returning to the
gymnasium with a body I was instructed to join other Officers to establish
a cordon to the entrance of the gymnasium which had now assumed the role of
a mortuary. Our responsibility was to prevent unauthorised access; that
meant all persons not being medical staff, Police or those present with
injured persons. I continued this duty until 8.00 pm.

It was evident that there had been a large number of casualties, some of
which had died. I was not aware of the extent of the death toll or the
substance or scale of the disaster whilst on duty that day. Our serial was
not de-briefed.

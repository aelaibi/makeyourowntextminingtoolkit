VIDEO TAPE RECORDING OF INTERVIEWS

You may recall that we have met previously in Birmingham when you came to
luncheon at Headquarters, Lloyd House with Geoffrey Dear and my ACPO colleagues.
Since that time I have moved on to an appointment in the Cheshire Constabulary.

The purpose of my writing is to advise you of developments with video tape
recording. When we last spoke I briefly mentioned developments in this field of
activity.  Since then video tape recording has been developed and we have used
the system for the taping of interviews, under caution, of certain parties
involved in the Hillsborough Disaster.

As you are probably aware the inquests into the ninety five deceased were
re-convened on 19th November at Sheffield Town Hall and the Coroner, Dr S L
Popper, is continuing to receive evidence before a Jury.  It is likely that it
will be February or March before they conclude.  Talking to Dr Popper, he tells
me he intends to call the evidence of the interview by either playing the audio
tape (in accordance with PACE) or displaying the video recording, the facilities
already being in place in Court.  This latter action will depend on the agreement
of the person interviewed to the video being shown. The indicators are that at
least one Superintendent has raised no objections to the video recording being
displayed.  If that view is sustained it is likely that the recording will be
shown to the Court, including the Jury, very early in the New Year when we
reconvene after the Christmas/New Year recess on 7th January 1991.

This may be the first use of such a technique before a Jury in Court, although
you may be more aware of the uniqueness of the event. Notwithstanding the
Coroner has asked me to cordially invite you to consider whether you, or your
nominated representative would like to attend the proceedings to observe the
process of replay.




    PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE AT                Sheffield
                                           - 2 -

    Neither the Coroner nor myself will     be offended i f any way if you or your
    nominated representative choose not to attend Sheffield in winter, but we both
    felt you ought to be made aware of this interesting development.

    With all good wishes for the forthcoming festive season.




    cc   Mr Colin Clough
         Mr Mike Kennedy

Dar i n g     this    early    period    I made arr a n g e m e n t s    for black dustbin bags

to be brought           to collect       items   seized or disposed of by fans                   entering

the ground.            Normally quite a number             of fans are         xn possession of

cans     of soft        drinks    on entering       the ground,          these are     not     permitted

in the ground.            They are       given the      opportunity to drink or dispose                      of

the     cans.        Also where    fans have       cans    of alcohol        the same applies

except        they are    informed       to dispose       not drink them.

A short while after we had o b t ained the bags and labels                              for     property

a number        of    large    plastic: dustbins arri v e d these were               sited      in

between 4 turnstiles              for the same use as the bags.

Initially as           I have stated there were             very few fans a r r i v e d from

Liverpool        and the officers were able                to make searches          of virtually

every        person arriving at          tne turnstiles without              causing any delays or

entering.            Orderly queues were         formed     but they amounted           to perhaps 6

or 8 at one           or two turnstiles,         all    the entrances were           not used by the

fans at this           time.

Du r i n g    this    early    period there were          no great       problems wit h the fans

o r   their     behaviour.        The major i t y      consisted of middle age            a    and t'amii’,

groups,        there were       light heartea exchanges               witn them.

F rom    this    early stag:? a         problem started        to arise wnicn          later     on grew

quite        consicisrably.       The North S t a n d was           reserved for Liverpool

period onwards           numerous       ticket   holders      came up to me         confused as to

where        they should enter          the ground.        They did not appear            to

u n d e r s t a n d the significance         of the     colour       coding.     A further       cause of

confusion was the              layout of the actual           ticket.        Numerous     people as«ea

     for entrance X,Y, M etc these being                            tne gangway not the             entrance,              but

     the    layout of the ticket                 is such that the gangway,                 entrance and               row

     etc were all         in the same            size    print.        Further    c o nfusion was aiso

     caused by ticket              holders       not knowing which colour               related to which

     entrance,         i.e. Brown N or th Stand,                  Red West Stand,       Blue Leppi n g s Lane

     terracing.          As a result a n              increasing       number    entered the area              in

     front    of stiles for the N or th Stand who wanted other a reas                                    of the

     steadily         increased.         T h e y were arriving            on foot,    by    coach and service

     bus.      Initially they were                   searched and seen by the o f f icers                    on coach

     reception and then came                    towards       us,   quite a number         started       to arrive

     as time      progressed            in possession of and smelling of alcohol,                             as a

     result     the dustbins            at the side turnstiles                started to fill            with empty

     or full      cans of beer.                I instructed about 4 or 5 p e r s o n a l l y to place

     part full         cans   in the bin.              I did however         see other      o f f icers       engaged

     on both North ana West S t a nd turnstiles                           instruct fans        to      put    cans and

     bottles      into tne bins.               As     the numbers steadily           inc r e a s e d    the

     officers made more sel e c t i v e                 searches       of persons     entering.              Orderly

     queuss were formed and there were                            no great    problems      in respect           of

     maintaining         them apart            from tne       confusion over tickets.

     However      on about 3 or 4 occasions                       i. requested .a m o u n t e d     officer           to

     on    coach reception were            brought    back a n d     continued with searching.

     it was      locked open w i th a pin on the floor and a bar across                                                       the       too.

Al t h o u g h I knew there should be quite a number of officers a r o u n d                                       I

aid during this       period feel        very      isola t e d and at               this time could see

no one apart      from Insp.        B enett    on the wall,              some moun t e d o f f i c e r s           in

the    crowd on Leppings Lane,           Supt.      Marshall            on the bridge        parapet anc

another     officer   on the    roof of a police               vehicle             in Leppings        Lane     near

to the shop.

My radio at this       time    seemed to be worKing,                     but as often not and                  I

could hear shouts       to open gates            but due       to the noise and o f f i c e r s at

one stage trying      to     close    the     perimeter        gate       it is hard to say              if        it

was    them or the    radio.        S ho rt ly after     that m y earpiece                became

aetached during       the    crush and        I cannot        recollect any other

transrnissions .

Fhe situation was then as             I have      d e s c r i b e d and a o p eared         to be qettino

worse with confusion over             tickets,       fans      pushing and shouting                    etc and

j. wa s literally at       times     fearful      of my       i if s if i nad fallen                  over.        I

was    unable to make any headway t h r o u g h              the        crowd to check           to    see    if

the officers     on    the    turnstiles were           alri g h t as               I could not         see    or cet

to them from where         I was.      The      next    thing       that happened was              that Gate

:
“i opened,   which     is si tu-stsd to the            left     of the No rtft Stand

turnstiles.      It    was then as           if some o n e    had       let         the   plug    out,       the

pushing and crushing          in the area         in front         of these          turnstiles

virtually abated with         large numbers            surging          through that         open gate and

into    the North S tand area.

X c was at this      point      that PC 2 9 3 3 W a d s w o r t h joined me and said that

they haa had to         climb through the              turnstiles          for their safety.             The

crowd then eased off            completely a n d            the queues at the turnstiles

returned with an elderly gent who                      had been stood with me for safety

near the fence       joining a queue           of about 20 at the                  right      hand

turnstile and by this            time Gate A had                 closed again.         I w o u l d say       it

only remained open for 4 or 5 m i n u t e s at                      the most.

Shortly after the gate             had closed and the                queues     reformed a number of

officers   ran from Lepping s Lane                  an d    in t h r o u g h the    turnstiles.          X

could hear      nothing     on my radio        but         heard one of them shout that                  there

had been a pitch         invasion and all             a v a i l a b l e assistance          was   required

inside.    Together w i th PC W a d s w o r t h and                other    officers        I entered the

ground by climbing          over    the turnstiels,                turned right an d           ran across

the back of the West Stand towards                         the    corner with the S outh stand.

As we   ran past     the tunnel        entrance            to the terracing and               in the area

at the back of the          stand     1 can say that               there appea r e d        to be nothing

untoward and there was             really quite a m a r k e d absence                  of     people    in

this area.

As we went      to the    pitch via the             rear     of the Police Control                I gathered

as many of my serial            together as          I could a n d         it included         1 think

P C ’s 2933,    3027,    346,    880 43,      809 and some            other     officers.

We entered the       playing area from the S o u t h Stand and                         I am virtually

certain that       tne came had stop p e d at this                   time but       I cannot         be sure.

I looked across         the Leppings Lane              end and       could see officers               stood on

across.    At    this time       I did not a p p r e c i a t e        what was       happening.          He

shouted to take a serial              into    pen 2 so I collected a group of

     open.          As we went                  to enter    the gate          I saw a young       girl     being      carried

     over        tne head of tne fans and t o w a r d s                         tne gate,     some then         shouted that

     she was           injured.                 It was at this          ooint    that    I realised or started to

     realise           that          something drastic was                wrong.        when the girl          had    cleared       1

     entered Pen 2                       via gate 2 and we f o r m e d a cordon to push the                      fans        sack

     into Pen 3 the                       crowd seem to part a n d move                 back away from the front.

     I could then see what                          1 can o nly d e s c r i b e d as a huge            pile     of bodies

     Leppings Lane       had taken    place.

     submitting my debriefing          sheet and     radio tne serial         returned to

     Claywheels Lane       for standby and awaiting          transport at 6pm.           The    seria

     I can say tht       I have worked duties at H i l l s b o r o u g h    football     ground

 Dear Sir,

 Hillsborough Inquests

May we raise two points:


          1.       "Chronology11

                   It has been brought to our attention that a
                   document headed "Chronology of Events" (copy
                   enclosed) has been handed in by Counsel for the
                   bereaved and seemingly copied along the bench of
                   advocates.

                   This document appears to contain a number of items
                   which could hardly be described as "events" and
                   many of those which are properly so described have
                   not yet been the subject of evidence to the
                   Inquest.

                   Moreover, apparent Statements of Fact are included
                   e.g. at item 17 in relation to barrier 124A which
                   are clearly matters of dispute.

                   In our respectful submission, this document is of
                   no value to the Inquest.  Even if it is to be used
                   by H. M. Coroner and by the bench of advocates, we
                   would respectfully request that it should not be
                   made available to the Jury without Counsel having
                   the opportunity of making submissions as to whether
                   that should happen.


J. Mervyn Jones Esq.,                                                                                                /••• contd.

        2.   Tapes of CJ A 'Statements

             It has been indicated that it is intended to play
             to. the Inquest the tapes of CJA statements taken
             in the course of the West Midlands Police
             investigation into the disaster.

             We appreciate that it is usual practice at an
             Inquest either to read CJA statements or, if
             available, to play the appropriate audio tapes.
             It seems to us, however, that the basis of such
             practice is that individuals concerned might not
             be expected to give evidence to the Inquest
             directly because of the possibility of self
             incrimination.   If that is correct, then the need
             to play the tapes will disappear if the witnesses
             concerned are willing to answer whatever questions
             are put to them.

             Bearing in mind that the playing of the tapes will
             probably occupy several days, it occurs to us that
             time might be saved if the witnesses are called to
             give evidence before tapes are played.  If they
             are willing to answer all, or substantially all,
             of the questions put to them without claiming the
             privilege against self incrimination then the
             need to play the tapes may be obviated. A
             considerable time saving would ensue and it seems
             to us that nothing would be lost if a witness,
             having been called, declined to answer significant
             questions, because the tape could then be played.

  Dear Sir,

  Hillsborough Inquests -•Engineering Evidence

  Thank you for your fax of 17th December.

                            ?opy to M r - Noel Burna Of Elrond Engineering for
  to                   our clients are more than willing to instruct Mr. Burne
                     a meeting with the HSE to discuss any points of difference,

  j!Lthe*.Cir?Um!tances' we do not think it would: be helpful if we
  we d o ^ a v s ^ n f ^ ^ °n JhS specifAc 'Points raised at this stage, but
  we do have one or two observations which may be relevant:


           1.        is not quite clear whether the HSE accept that
                  there was a misinterpretation of the result of
                      tests carried out on barrier 124A in 1983 and
                  1988.  It was suggested in submissions to the
                  Taylor Inquiry that there was a body of opinion
                  which would support the Eastwood policy of re­
                  zeroing after each test,  Elrond Engineering
                  indicate that there is no such body of opinion
                  and indeed we have not been able to find any
                  Engineer who would support the Eastwood
                  interpretation. We think it a fair assumption
                  that if the tests had been correctly interpreted
                  then the barrier would have been replaced and a
                  newer barrier would have been unlikely to have



                                                                                                            . contd.

         Dear Sirs,

         I have gone through the names of witnesses whom you have asked me to consider
         and you will no doubt note in due course that I have selected several from
         your list for inclusion as witnesses, though I did not think it necessary to
         call all the witnesses whom you mention.

         With regard to            this witness has emigrated to Spain and my Listing
         Officer informs me that he has no present intentions of returning to the
         United Kingdom.


         Yours faithfully,

Dear Sir
                                        Hillsborough Enquiry
In the light of the critisism directed at your officers from
Liverpool Supporters I feel 1 should point out the behaviour
of these fans in this area and on the M63 Motorway on the
morning of the semi-final.
From 10.30am on the morning of the match they w e r e :-
1) Abandoning their cars in the central lane to urinate on
     the grass verges.
2) Consuming vast quantities of drink,including the drivers.
3) Discarding the empties through car windows.
4) Running from car to car to replenish their stocks.
5)   Shouting obscene abuse at any unfortunate lady who
     happened to be on the Motorway.
At the end of the motorway near my house they stopped at our
local off license to re-stock and to urinate in adjacent
gardens.
Whilst I would not suggest that the innocent victems of
Hillsborough were drunk 1 would think that there were many in
the crowd who were not in a fit state to handle the nightmare
that was to follow, plus the fact that at 1.30 fans were still
passing our house with no hope of arriving at Sheffield in good
time to gain admittance.
Y ours       sin c e re ly .

Dear Sir,

Resumed Hillsborough Inquests

We thank you for your letter of 8th November with draft of Proposed
Summary of Agreed Facts attached and we apologise for the delay in
replying. We trust you will appreciate that we did wish to go
through this document carefully before responding.

In the event, we are instructed to agree the draft, save in respect
of two points, which are so minor that they could be the subject of
verbal correction rather than of any need to amend the existing
document.  These are:


          1.        Notwithstanding the terms of the Operational Order
                    the whole of Serial 37 and approximately half the
                    Officers on Serial 36 (train reception duties)
                    accompanied the supporters arriving by train to
                    Leppings Lane turnstiles and remained on duty at
                    that point, rather than remaining at the Railway
                    Station, as indicated by the Order.

          2.        Neither in 1988 nor in 1989 was a serial allocated
                    to "Coach Reception (Leppings Lane)" as indicated
                    in the draft Statement.

Yours fa                        f

         Re: Resumed Inquests.

         Thank you for your letter of the 9th   of November 1990.

         It is my intention to invite all the   people listed on the first page of your
         letter to give evidence.

         I have not yet had an opportunity to consider the names in Section 1 and   11
         of your list, but will look at these as soon as possible to enable me to
         decide whether and if so whom to call.


         Yours faithfully,




         S.L.Popper,

    Further to paragraph 6 of your letter, we would be grateful if you
    could give serious consideration to calling some of the witnesses
    named in the attached list. The majority are Police Officers,
    although a number are fans and local residents.

    We are including copies of all the "Section I" statements in the
    order they appear on the list. Also enclosed are copies of those
    fans and local residents' statements within "Section II" who did
    not give evidence at the Inquiry. Those fans and local residents
    called by Mr. Justice Taylor have been marked with an asterisk.

    We will, in all probability, write again on Monday suggesting
    further witnesses, although at this stage we can say they will not
•   exceed six in number.

 Dear Sirs,

                          Resumed Hillsborough inquests on 19th Nov. 1990

With reference to my earlier corespondence I am circulating to all the
firms that were represented at the meeting on 30th October 1990
summaries of what are believed to be facts relating to the
Hillsborough disaster.

 I would be most grateful if you could please study the documents as
 soon as possible and let me know:

1. Whether you agree that they correctly summarize the position in
respect of those matters which are dealt with.

 2. If you think that there are any errors inthe summaries. Please
 specify the errors so that if appropriate they can be corrected.

If we cannot agree a particular point than it may be necessary to
delete it entirely from the summaries. I will decide what
action is needed in the light of any comments and in relation to
the importance or otherwise of the point that is disputed.

Please note that it is likely that for convenience the summaries will
be merged and presented as one. They have simply been prepared in the
present format, and, in the interests of time I am circulating them
split.

There is a further matter that has occurred to me. I have taken it
that you have kept your client(s) informed of the recomencement of the
resumed inquests and I have not written to them personally informing
them of this fact. I have also taken it that neither you nor your
client(s) object to this. If these assumptions are incorrect please
let me have by return and preferably by FAX the full name and
current address of your client(s) so that I c a n formally write to
them.



Yours faithfully,
    ^    JL

         Dear Sirs,

         Hillsbrough - Resumed Inquests 19th November 1990.


         I have decided upon reflection, not to have core bundles put before the Jury,
         but to build up exhibits as we go along.

         Although I can see certain advantages in the method which you have proposed,
         I think on balance it is going to be easier and more convenient if we adopt
         my method.

         Whilst of course all documents which are necessary for the purpose of the
         Inquest will have to be introduced as exhibits, I am sure you will appreciate
         that I would be anxious not to multiply paper unnecessarily.




         Yours faithfully,

 Dear Sir,

Hillsborough - Resumed Inquests 19th November, 1990

In connection with the pre-inquest review which is to take place on
30th October, we would be grateful if you could consider and give
directions upon a number of matters.

Firstly, it would be helpful if, prior to the commencement of the
inquests, all parties were to receive a list of the witnesses to be
called and copies of the proofs of evidence of those witnesses.

Secondly, in order that all Counsel should prepare for the inquests
on the same basis, it would be helpful if some direction could be
given as to the status of the Taylor report, the transcripts of the
Taylor Inquiry and statements submitted to the Inquiry.  It occurs
to us that it will be important to know, prior to the inquests
starting, whether, for instance, one or more of these items is to
be admitted for any purpose or, for example, for cross examination
purposes.

Thirdly, we would like permission to distribute, for use by the
Jury, three bundles of prepared documentation, together with the
"Green Guide". The first two bundles are the South Yorkshire Police
Volumes 1 and 2 submitted to the Taylor Inquiry, which all parties
already have in their possession. The third bundle consists of
further relevant documentation prepared from documents available to



                                                                                                                       /. .. contd.

    the Inquiry or made available at the civil contribution hearing.     We
    enclose a copy of this third bundle.

    It would be helpful to us if, at the pre-inquest review, you could
    provide a time estimate for the length of the inquest hearings and
    also advise whether a daily transcript will in fact be available.

    With regard to accommodation arrangements for the hearing, it may
    be helpful for you to know that the Police team is likely to consist
    of two Counsel, a Pupil and two instructing Solicitors. Our Counsel
    has also asked us to enquire whether space could be arranged to keep
    documentation at the inquests venue, which they anticipate will be
    in the region of fifteen box files.

    Finally, it occurs to us that you will be calling as witnesses a
    number of members of the Health and Safety Executive and we wonder
    whether you may be able to confirm that this is the case.

    We trust the above is of assistance to you.

    the Inquiry or made available at the civil contribution hearing.        We
    enclose a copy of this third bundle.

    It would be helpful to us if, at the pre-inquest review, you could
    provi e a time estimate for the length of the inquest hearings and
    also advise whether a daily transcript will in fact be available.

    With regard to accommodation arrangements’ for the hearing, it may
    be helpful for you t o _know that the Police team is likely to consist
    or two. Counsel, a Pupil and two instructing Solicitors.   Our Counsel
    has also asked us to enquire whether space could be arranged to keep
    documentation at the inquests venue, which they anticipate will be
    in the region of fifteen box files.

    Finally, it occurs to us that you will be calling as witnesses a
    number of members of the Health and Safety Executive and we wonder
    whether you may be able to confirm that this is the case.

    We trust the above is of assistance to you.

        Dear Sirs,

        Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.


        If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the de^ h s
        of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent,
        on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m.  Details of venue will be notifie in
        due course.

        I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
        evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
        coronal investigation which you will recollect is not a versaria   ^
        inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only-limited o j

        Subject to the Coroners’ Act 1988 and the Coroners’ Rules, the Inquest is
        under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select
        witnesses who wish to give evidence.  I am at present engaged in considering
        this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

        Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter,I am writing   to you
        to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
        appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me
        consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

        May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
        attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

         I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
         names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that thedecision  as
         to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

         I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
         heard from y o u by the end of September I will assume you have no names to
         submit.

         Yours faithfully,

        Dear Sirs,

        HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER:                          RESUMPTION AND REPRESENTATION.


        It is my intention to resume the Inauests on Monday the 19th of
        November 1990 at 10.a.m. into the deaths of the 95 people who
        died on the 15th of April 1989 at Hillsborough Stadium.

        As I have to take some urgent decisions regarding venue for the
        resumed Inquest, I would be grateful if you could please reply
        by return and indicate whether you anticipate:

                                   That you wish to attend and represent your Olient(s)
                                   (if you have not previously been granted representation
                                   rights I will assume that an affirmative reply indicates
                                   your intention to apply).

                                   Whether you expect to appear by Counsel and if so
                                   whether it would be by junior or by silk and junior.

                                   If your response is positive, do you anticipate being
                                   present throughout the Inquest which I expect will run
                                   for a period of several weeks.


        Yours faithfully,

Dear Sir or Madam,

Re:     18th April 1990 -Interim Resumed Inquests                - Hillsborough

I am writing to inform you that the venue for the above will be the
Memorial Hall, Barkers Pool, Sheffield, and we are scheduled to commence
at 10.30 am.

I anticipate that the second date, 19th April, will also be at that
location but after the 19th, we plan to hold the Inquests at the Medico
Legal Centre, Watery Street, Sheffield.

It would be appreciated if you would confirm to me as soon as possible
whether you intend to be present on 18th April, and also let me have, if
known, the name of the   solicitor or Counsel who is representing your
clients.

Yours faithfully.

Hammond Suddards,
Solicitors,
&srpire House,
10 Piccadilly,


Bear Sirs,



Thank you for your latter of ths 20th of October. Wa have
aade a note of your interest on behalf of the Chief Constable
of South Yorkshire.

You are not the only fira who have contacted ae with a request
for early disclosure.

On the whole, I aa reluctant to consider each a request
until I have had aa opportunity to see the inforoation ayself.
The present position is that it is still in the coarse of
preparation.

I as also vary conscious that a eriainal investigation is under
way, and I would be exceedingly reluctant to consent to any
disclosures of inforaation gathered by the West Midlands Police
which could iilnany way be construed as prejudicing that aspect
of their work.

I do not want yea to feel that I m intending to obstruct you
or indeed the solicitors for the bereaved, but as you very
rightly point out, your request is an unusual one and does raise
issues which I feel have to be considered before a definitive
decision is taken.

Yours faithfully,



S.L.Popper,

 Dear Sir,

 Hillsborough

 We are acting on behalf of the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire
 in connection with civil actions which have been raised against him
 arising out of the events which occurred at Hillsborough stadium on
 15th April, 1989.

 We should be obliged if you would kindly note our interest, for the
 purposes of any inquests which are to be held on victims of the
 tragedy.

 One of the issues which has been raised in the civil proceedings is
 the extent to which injury or death may have been caused or
 contributed to by the collapse of a barrier in pen 3 of the Leppings
 Lane terraces.

 The question of precisely where fatalities and serious injuries
 occurred will be highly material evidence on this issue. Certain
 evidence on this point was presented to the Taylor inquiry, but we
 believe that considerable further progress in investigations has
 been made by the West Midlands Police on your behalf, so that the
 positions at which the great majority of the fatalities occurred
 can now be determined with considerable accuracy.



                                                                                                                     /... contd.

We seek your consent to a disclosure of the up to date information
by the West Midlands Police to ourselves for the purposes of the
civil action.

We appreciate   that this is a highly unusual request, but the
circumstances   are unusual, because there seems to be every
possibility that a civil trial will take place before inquests on
the deceased are held. Certainly, directions have already been
given in open Court by Mr. Justice Steyn in relation to the exchange
of expert evidence, the precise nature of which will inevitably
depend on where the majority of fatalities and injury occurred.   It
is difficult to see how such evidence can be completed and exchanged
without the relevant information.

We shall be obliged if you will kindly consider the positionand let
us know if we  may approach the. West Midlands Police indicatingthat
we have your consent to receive whatever information they have about
the location of the fatalities and major injuries.

We appreciate that any information supplied to us will have to be
available also to the other parties to the civil action.

Finally, we appreciate the West Midlands Police inquiry has a joint
purpose, in that they will be reporting not only to yourselves but
also to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  If you are able to
give us the necessary'consent, then we will approach the West
Midlands Police and, if they indicate that the consent of the DPP is
also required, we will approach him accordingly.

We should perhaps make clear that any information made available to
us pursuant to this request will be treated in confidence, save
insofar as it is necessary to make use of it in the civil
proceedings.


Yours faithfully,


                   £

          Dear Sir,

          Re: HILLSBOROUGH RESUMED INQUESTS.

          I have had some requests for a Pre-Inquest review in order to enable an
          exchange of views to take place between myself and representatives on
          procedural matters, with the object of ensuring that as far as possible the
          Inquests proper run smoothly with the minimum amount of delay and to the best
          advantage.

          1 have now decided that this review should take place on Tuesday
          30th October 1990 at the Medico Legal Centre, Watery Street, Sheffield at
          2 p.m.

          Although this meeting is intended for legal representatives, I would not
          raise any objection if interested parties wished to attend to see what was
          going on, subject of course to us not exceeding the space availability at
          the Medico Legal Centre.

          I would be grateful if you could please confirm to me that you would like to
          attend the review.


          Yours faithfully,




          H.M.       oner.

Dear Sir,

Resumed Inquests - 19th November, 1990

Thank you for your letter of 19th September.

Whilst we appreciate that the planning for the resumption of the
Inquests must be got under way immediately, it may be that the civil
contribution proceedings due to commence in Manchester on 2nd October
will produce some material which is relevant to your inquiry.
Whilst, therefore, we are complying with the time limit which you
have indicated is appropriate for a response, we trust that there
will be no objection if we write further in due course should
material with potential relevance become available during the civil
trial.

Subject to that point, we are in some difficulty in that, whilst the
South Yorkshire Police now consider the events which occurred
outside the turnstiles at Leppings Lane to be of lesser significance
as a causative factor than was previously thought, other parties
maintain the contrary. That being so, the South Yorkshire Police
would wish to see a balanced view presented of the causes of the
problems outside the turnstiles.  In this connection, it would seem
to us that if Mr. Phillips, Deputy Chief Constable of Devon and
Cornwall, is available to give evidence at the Inquests as an expert
then it would be appropriate for him to be called.




                                                                                                                   /... contd.

 We have, of course, already made available a copy of Mr. Phillips'
 report to the Coroner's Officer.

 As can be seen from the report, Mr. Phillips has himself analysed
 and commented, in his capacity as an expert, on a large body of
 evidence relating to the effects of alcohol consumption on the
 behaviour of those outside the ground.

 We do not think that it will be particularly helpful for us to
 identify individual witnesses, more particularly, as the main data
 base of statements is held on the HOLMES computer system by the West
 Midlands Police. We would, however, ask that where there are
 independent witnesses, particularly local residents, neutral
 supporters or Liverpool Police Officers, such as the mounted
 Officers on duty at Leppings Lane, all of whom give evidence in
 relation to the effects of drunkenness, then these witnesses ought
 to be called.

 So far as the presence of non-ticket holders outside the ground is
 concerned, we would again ask that witnesses be called from amongst
 the many supporters who gave evidence of people asking for "spares"
 as they walked down Leppings Lane.

 In relation   to the possibility that there was some organised attempt
 to breach the turnstiles, we would ask that those witnesses be
 called who are referred to in paragraph 204 of the Interim Report of
 Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry.

We would also ask that witnesses be called from amongst supporters
who found themselves confused by the signs and ticket colours and
also from amongst the turnstile operators as regards supporters
appearing at the wrong turnstiles.

In relation   to the events inside the ground, we would again point
out that we   do not have access to the great mass of evidence
collated by the West Midlands Police and we are effectively
restricted to putting forward names of those who were called to Lord
Justice Taylor's Inquiry, being those of whose evidence we are
aware.  Of these, it seems to us that Messrs. Foster, Bradley,
Hennessey, Clark, Cruice, Cunningham, Postlethwaite, Comerford,
Connolly, McCaffery, Fitzmaurice and Eccleston are relevant amongst
the Liverpool supporters.

We also think that, in relation to the issue of recognition of
overcrowding, Messrs. Saxton, P. Higgins, Eason, Yoxall and Kirton
are relevant.



                                                           /. .. contd.
H a m m o n d Su d d a r d s                                  PAGE NO.   3




 Again, we think that there will be some merit in calling our expert
 Engineer, Mr. Noel Burne of Elrond Engineering, who has made a very
 careful study of all the engineering aspects, a copy of which we
 intend to make available to the Coroner's Officer.

 Please let us know if we can assist further at this stage.

^        Dear Sir,

         Re: HILLSBROUGH.


         Thank you for your letter of the 3rd of September.

         I am not sure where the Press get their information from but I have made no
         announcements and indeed have not yet reached a decision as to when we should
         resume the Inquests.

         I will obviously take the point which you have drawn to my attention into
         account.

Dear Sir,

Hillsborough

The announcement from the Director of Public Prosecutions that
there were to be no charges in connection with the Hillsborough
disaster has, we understand, opened the way for the resumption of
the Inquests into the 95 victims of the disaster.

As you may know, there is at present a civil trial fixed for hearing
in Manchester Crown Court before Mr. Justice Jowitt, with a
commencement date of 2nd October and an estimated hearing time of
six weeks.

We have noted certain press reports to the effect that the Inquests
may be resumed at a time when the civil proceedings are actually
being heard.

Without wishing to make any comment on the question of which
proceedings might be thought to have priority in law, we would
respectfully suggest, as a practical matter, that it would be
inappropriate for both matters to be proceeding at one and the same
time or, indeed, even for one hearing immediately to follow the
other.



                                                                                                                       /... contd

If matters were otherwise, then not only would there be problems in
adequately preparing for one or other hearing, but if there were a
direct overlap then there would be the embarrassing possibility of
witnesses receiving Summonses requiring them to be in two different
Courts at the same time.

We would respectfully request that these matters be given
consideration prior to the fixing of a date for the resumption of
the Inquests.

 Dear Sir,

 Hillsborough

 The announcement from the Director of Public Prosecutions that
 there were to be no charges in connection with the Hillsborough
 disaster has, we understand, opened the way for the resumption of
 the Inquests into the 95 victims of the disaster.

 As you may know, there is at present a civil trial fixed for hearing
 in Manchester Crown Court before Mr. Justice Jowitt, with a
 commencement date of 2nd October and an estimated hearing time of
 six weeks.

 We have noted certain press reports to the effect that the Inquests
 may be resumed at a time when the civil proceedings are actually
 being heard.

 Without wishing to make any comment on the question of which
 proceedings might be thought to have priority in law, we would
 respectfully suggest, as a practical matter, that it would be
 inappropriate for both matters to be proceeding at one and the same
 time or, indeed, even for one hearing immediately to follow the
 other.



                                                                                                                         /... contd.

Dear Sir,

Hillsborough

Thank you for your letter of 26th October, 1989.

You will recall that we are acting on behalf of the Chief Constable
of South Yorkshire in the civil proceedings arising out of the
Hillsborough disaster. We are also instructed to arrange
representation for the Chief Constable at the forthcoming Inquests
into the deaths of the victims of the disaster.

You indicated in your letter of 26th October that you did not
consider it appropriate, in advance of the Inquests, to release to
the parties to the civil proceedings any evidence which might be
material to the Inquests.

You may be aware that, for that and other reasons, the South
Yorkshire Police take the view that it is inappropriate for the
present civil proceedings to continue, but that new proceedings
should be commenced when the Inquests and the West Midlands Inquiry
and any subsequent proceedings have been concluded.  This view is
not shared by the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club nor by Messrs.
Eastwoods, who take the view that there ought to be a speedy
conclusion to the civil proceedings.



                                                                                                                       /. .. contd

The question of whether or not the proceedings are to continue will
be resolved in the High Court in February and it would be most
helpful if you can assist us on two points, namely:


        1.    Are you able to give us any indication as to when
              the Inquests are likely to be held?

        2.    Do you have any views which you would wish to be
              put before the Civil Court in relation to the
              possibility that the liability issues in the civil
              claims will be tried before the Inquests are heard?


Obviously, any views which you express will be disclosed to the
other parties and to the Court, but if you consider it appropriate
not to respond to this letter, but rather to make any views which
you have known through judicial channels, then we understand that
the High Court hearing will take place before the Honourable Mr.
Justice Steyn.

       PCM/PAB                                    20th October, 1989




Dear Sir,

Hillsborough

We are acting on behalf of the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire
in connection with civil actions which have been raised against him
arising out of the events which occurred at Hillsborough stadium on
15th April, 1989.

We should be obliged if you would kindly note our interest, for the
purposes of any inquests which are to be held on victims of the
tragedy.

One of the issues which has been raised in the civil proceedings is
the extent to which injury or death may have been caused or
contributed to by the collapse of a barrier in pen 3 of the Leppings
Lane terraces.

The question of precisely where fatalities and serious injuries
occurred will be highly material evidence on this issue. Certain
evidence on this point was presented to the Taylor inquiry, but we
believe that considerable further progress in investigations has
been made by the West Midlands Police on your behalf, so that the
positions at which the great majority of the fatalities occurred
can now be determined with considerable accuracy.


                                                         /... contd.




H. M. Coroner,
Medico-Legal Centre,
Watery Street,
SHEFFIELD S3 7ET.
                                                                       2




We seek your consent to a disclosure of the up to date information
by the West Midlands Police to ourselves for the purposes of the
civil action.

We appreciate   that this is a highly unusual request, but the
circumstances   are unusual, because there seems to be every
possibility that a civil trial will take place before inquests on
the deceased are held.   Certainly, directions have already been
given in open Court by Mr. Justice Steyn in relation to the exchange
of expert evidence, the precise nature of which will inevitably
depend on where the majority of fatalities and injury occurred.   It
is difficult to see how such evidence can be completed and exchanged
without the relevant information.

We shall be obliged if you will kindly consider the position and let
us know if we  may approach the West Midlands Police indicatingthat
we have your consent to receive whatever information they have about
the location of the fatalities and major injuries.

We appreciate that any information supplied to us will have to be
available also to the other parties to the civil action.

Finally, we appreciate the West Midlands Police inquiry has a joint
purpose, in that they will be reporting not only to yourselves but
also to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  If you are able to
give us the necessary consent, then we will approach the West
Midlands Police and, if they indicate that the consent of the DPP is
also required, we will approach him accordingly.

We should perhaps make clear that any information made available to
us pursuant to this request will be treated in confidence, save
insofar as it is necessary to make use of it in the civil
proceedings.


Yours faithfully,
                                                                                                                                                     HK*

Dear Sirs,

ju J M M M B L ,
Thank you for your letter of the 20th of October. We hare
aade a note of jour interest on behalf of the Chief Constable
of South Yorkshire.

You are not the only firs who hare contacted ae with a request
for early disclosure.

I feel that it would be unwise of ae to indicate whether I
would be prepared to consent to the release of the inforaation
until I at least tod had a proper opportunity to consider it.
I sust also add that cm the whole, it is not ay practice to
release documentation prior to the hearing of the Inquest.

I do not in any event think it right that I should release
or authorise release of the Vest Midland’s files whilst
the original investigation is underway.

I am sorry that 1 am unable to write a aore helpful letter.

Yours faithfully,



S.L.Fopper,

Dear Sirs
RE: NICHOLAS JOYNES DECEASED
Thank you for your letters of 13th and 19th February 1991.
You will I am sure be pleased to hear that we are arranging to
hear Mr Thomas in person and hopefully Mrs Joynes will then have
the benefit of the evidence which he is able to give.
If you have a word with Miss Steele at the Hillsborough Steering
Committee, she will be able to explain to you what I said in open
court regarding the release of statements.
Yours sincerely

         would like to see a copy of      gt-af-pmpnt- t h a t - hp madp_to the Wpst~ Midlands

         Dear Sirs,

         Hillsborough Inquests - 19th November 1990.

         Thank you for your letter of the ^t h of November. I note what you say
         regarding Peter E. Smith.  I will carefully consider your request and will be
         in touch with you again at a later date.

         You will appreciate that there are at least three aspects to the matter:-

              1.   His interest, which I assume you will be looking after anyway.

              2.   On the whole I like people to be present when audio tapes of their
                   evidence is played, so that they can have an opportunity to make any
                   additional comments which they feel is appropriate.

              3.   Subject to the rules, the opportunity for others to ask him any
                   relevant questions.


         However, I am anxious not to harm anybody medically speaking and I will
         certainly think about your request very carefully.


         Yours faithfully,

   Dear Sir,
   Hillsborough Inquests - 19 November 1990
   Further to previous correspondence, we write on behalf of our client Mr Peter
   Edward Smith, a Police Constable in South Yorkshire Police, to request that
   his attendance at the forthcoming Inquest be excused.
   The basis for our request is that his health is such that he is unfit to
   attend and we enclose for your attention a letter from his general practitioner
   dated 6 November 1990.
   We are conscious of the fact that you have requested the attendance of Constable
   Smith and that it was your intention, so far as possible for evidence to be
   given viva voce. Perhaps in this particular instance, you would be prepared
   to take the view that it would be unfair to the witness to require his attendance,
   given his present state of health.
   Perhaps you would give your consideration to our request and should you require
   any further information in this regard, please do not hesitate to contact the
   writer. We tjiank you in anticipation.
   Yours^faitjjfully,

            ELL JONES & WALKER

               It Is my firm medical opinion that it would be very
               harmful to the above patient to attend any forthcoming
               Inquest associated with the Hillsborough Football

Dear Sir,

Re HILLSBOROUGH INQUESTS - VIDEO RECORDINGS.


You will of course be aware that your client was interviewed under the PACE
procedure and that tfyis interview was audio taped in the usual manner.

I also understand that in addition to the audio tape, a video recording of
the interviews was prepared.  This video recording being however so to speak
extra statutory.  I understand that it was done with the consent of your
client, and on the understanding that it would not be used in proceedings.

It is my intention to have the audio tapes played to the Jury at an
appropriate point in the resumed Inquests.

It occurs to me however that if the video recording is of good enough quality
(which I in fact understand it is), that it might be better and easier to
follow if we showed the video recording rather than listen to the audio tape.

I would not however wish to do this without the express consent of yourself
and your clients.  I would therefore be grateful if you could please let me
know whether you or your client would have any objection to the video
recording being used at the inquest.

I want to make it quite clear that this is entirely your decision and if                                 you
would prefer that the video is not used, then we will respect your
wish and use the audio tapes.




Yours faithfully,




S.L.Popper,

We are in receipt of your letter of the 6 November 1990, together with enclosures

We thank you for your co-operation.

         Dear Sirs,

         Re: Hillsborough Resumed Inquests - 19 November 1990.

         Thank you for your letter of the 1st of November.

         With regard to your comment in the second paragraph, I have indicated what my
         feelings are with regard to the use of this report. On the other hand it
         must be clear that we live in the real world and it will be inevitable I
         think that reference is made to it from time to time.  Similarly, I have to
         be open to any submissions which may be made to me.

         With regard to the next two paragraphs,   I note what you say and you will be
         hearing from me shortly I hope.

         Thank you for letting me know that Miss Andrea Addleman of Counsel will be
         attending, instructed on behalf of your firm.


         Yours faithfully,




         S^,. Popper,

Dear Sir,

Hillsborough Resumed Inquests - 19 November 1990
I am grateful for your letter of the 31 October 1990, the contents of which we
note.

I would take this opportunity to clarify with you that Lord Justice Taylor's
report will not be used in evidence unless matters of fact can be agreed between
all representatives.
I note that statements are being prepared to be used as "scene setters". This
seems to be an excellent idea and I would be most obliged to receive copies of
those statements in due course.
I am aware that you were to re-consider the question of circulating a list of
proposed witnesses. This would be of immense benefit to me in view of my
general interest on behalf of the officers of Federated rank as a whole, and I
would be obliged to receive such a list at your earliest convenience should
you take the view that such a course of action is appropriate.
Finally, I can confirm that Miss Andrea Addleman of Counsel will be attending
the Inquests, instructed on behalf of this firm.
.Yours faithfully.

   Dear Sirs,

                             Resumed Hillsborough inquests on 19th Nov. 1990

   With reference to my earlier correspondence I am circulating to all
   the firms that were represented at the meeting on 30th October 1990
   summaries of what are believed to be facts relating to the
   Hillsborough disaster.

   I would be most grateful if you could please study the documents as
   soon as possible and let me know:

   1. Whether you agree that they correctly summarize the position in
   respect of those matters which are dealt with.

   2. If you think that there are any errors in the summaries. Please
   specify the errors so that if appropriate they can be corrected.

   If we cannot agree a particular point than it may be necessary to
   delete it entirely from the summaries. I will decide what
   action is needed in the light of any comments and in relation to
   the importance or otherwise of the point that is disputed.

   Please note that it is likely that for convenience the summaries will
   be merged and presented as one. They have simply been prepared in the
   present format, and, in the interests of timeI am circulating them
   split.

   There is a further matter that has occurred to me. I have taken it
   that you have kept your client(s) informed of the recomencement of the
   resumed inquests and I have not written to them personally informing
   them of this fact. I have also taken it that neither you nor your
   client(s) object to this. If these assumptions are incorrect please
   let me have by return and preferably by FAX the full name and
   current address of your client(s) so that I c a n formally write to
   them.



   Yours fai

 Dear Sirs,

                       Hillsborough resumed Inquests 19th Nov, 1990

 r refer to our meeting on 30th. October 1990 at the Medico Legal Centre
 when, we discussed various procedural aspects.

One o£ the points which was raised was to try to construct an agreed
extract from the report of Lord Justice Taylor which could deal as I
understood it with in the main factual matters on which all. the
parties were agreed and so save time and effort.

For some reason I did not make it clear at that point                            that I already
                 PreParftlon of various statements to                            be presented by
WMP officers which are intended, to be 'scene setters'                           and which I
think will meet the objectives which some of you were                            trying to
achieve,                                                                              5       .

I am writing to you now on this as. it may help you in. connection,
with your planning.    ■

If we can get the paper work together in time it may be possible to
circulate these statements to those firms that were present at the
              on 30ih 0cL?ber‘1990 i " ordor co                                               T,m

      Dear Sir,

      Re: HILLSBOROUGH RESUMED INQUESTS.

      I have had some requests for a Pre-Inquest review in order to enable an
      exchange of views to take place between myself and representatives on
      procedural matters, with the object of ensuring that as far as possible the
      Inquests proper run smoothly with the minimum amount of delay and to the best
      advantage.

      1 have now decided that this review should take place on Tuesday
      30th October 1990 at the Medico Legal Centre, Watery Street, Sheffield at
      2 p.m.

      Although this meeting is intended for legal representatives, I would not
      raise any objection if interested parties wished to attend to see what was
      going on, subject of course to us not exceeding the space availability at
      the Medico Legal Centre.

      I would be grateful if you could please confirm to me that you would like to
      attend the review.


      Yours faithfully,
                  _L

We thank you for your letter of the 12 September 1990, and we note that it is
your intention to resume the Inquests into the deaths of the 95 people on the
15 April 1989 at Hillsborough Stadium, on Monday the 19 November 1990. We also

For your assistance, we can confirm that it is our intention to attend the
Inquests to represent the interests of our clients. We would propose that our
clients be represented by Junior Counsel.
At the time of writing to you, it would be our intention to be present throughout
the period of the Inquests. Your assistance, in indicating those witnesses who
you intend to call and the likely estimate of the length of the hearings, would
be greatly appreciated.
As you will no doubt appreciate, we are instructed on behalf of the Police
Federation, to have particular regard to the interests of Police Officers of
Federated rank.

Your                   ijthful l y ,

Dear Sirs,

Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.


If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent,
on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m. Details of venue will be notified in
due course.

I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

Subject to the Coroners’ Act 1988 and the Coroners’ Rules, the Inquest is
under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
witnesses who wish to give evidence.  I am at present engaged in considering
this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me to
consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision as
to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
heard from you by the end of September I will assume you have no names to
submit.

Yours f^thfully,

Dear Sir or Madam,

Re;   18th April 1990 -Interim Resumed Inquests                       - Hillsborough

I am writing to inform   you that the venue for the above will be the
Memorial Hall, Barkers Pool, Sheffield, and we are scheduled to commence
at 10.30 am.

I anticipate that the second date, 19th April, will also be at that
location but after the 19th, we plan to hold the Inquests at the Medico
Legal Centre, Watery Street, Sheffield.

It would be appreciated if you would confirm to me as soon as possible
whether you intend to be present on 18th April, and also let me have, if
known, the name of the   solicitor or Counsel who is representing your
clients.

Yours faithfully,




INIAAH

Sear Sirs,

flmBWfflffOGg STAPIDM   msmm 15th April 1989.
Thank you for your letter of the 19th of March. I note what
you say in the third paragraph and I would not object to
representation by your firm at the Inquest in respect of
officers of federated rank.

You are of course in sosae difficulty as prestathbly you are
not entirely aware of the scope of the Inquest. I think the
best I can do is to enclose a copy of • letter which I wrote
to solicitors for the family Ref» HILLS/SOL/l which sets out
the limitations of the proceedings which I intend to recommence
on the 18th of April 1990.

It is of Qpurse a matter for you to decid* whether Tou wlah to
be present at the whole or any part of the resumed Inquests.

tours fAftftfctalftr,




S.L.Popper,
B.M. Coroner.


The whole of the letter is not relevant. In particular the
summonses are only being circulated to the bereaved or their
solicitors where represented.

    YOUR REF            SLP/JT




    Dear Sirs,

    Re:             Hillsborough Resumed Inquests

    As you are aware, we act on behalf of Sheffield Wednesday
    Football  Club and note your intention not to allow any
    interested party to add to or alter your list of witnesses
    unless representations are made on or before the 19th December
    and reasons are given as to the proposed change.

    We possess a copy of your provisional list and we do have                                                                              a
    number of suggestions to make. These are as follows

     (a)                 We note from your list that two of the "C" gate men are
                         listed, namely Malcolm Bain and Ian Marsh.    The third
                         "C" gate man was Mr. Richard Beads ley.    His evidence
                         is important and in our view he gives much clearer and
                         more cogent evidence concerning the opening of gate
                         "C", the timings and the police involvement.   We would
                         suggest that Richard Beadsley and Malcolm Bain be
                         called or alternatively all three;

     (b)                 Of the    "A" gate men,    only Jack Stone has been
                         mentioned.    Following the Hillsborough disaster, Jack
                         Stone was something of a controversial figure in that
                         he appeared on television and we have not seen any
                         police statement obtained from him.     As for the "A"
                         gate men who were positioned on "A" gate, our only
                         concern is that Jack Stone's evidence may not be as
                         full and as detailed enough as any other witness
                         evidence available.   We obtained a statement from Mr.
                         Cobb who confirms that he was in charge of "A" gate. A
                         copy of his statement is attached for your information.
                         Again, we would ask you to give consideration to

                                                                                                                        Contd....

        calling Mr. Cobb instead of Mr. Stone or alternatively
        calling both;

(c)    We note from your provisional list that a large number
        of turnstile operators have been selected.    As you are
        no   doubt   aware,   Mr.  Colin  Milton  admitted  when
        questioned by the police that he had taken money from
        Liverpool fans on his turnstile and at the present
        moment we do not know whether Mr. Milton is still under
        caution or indeed is now the subject of criminal
        proceedings.     Unless there are very stong reasons for
        calling him to give evidence, we would ask you to
        reconsider whether it is appropriate in these circum­
        stances that he should be called to give evidence.    Of
        the other turnstile operators, we would ask you to give
        consideration to calling Mr. Eason whose evidence given
        at the Public Enquiry was important in terms of the
        numbers entering through the turnstiles.

(d)    In   relation to spectators,    we note   that  Patrick
        Cunningham and Christopher Moran are missing from your
        list.    Both gave evidence to the Public Inquiry and
        gave very effective evidence on the behaviour of the
        crowd as they passed through "C" gate at or after
        2.52p.m.

We would ask you to give the above your consideration.      Mr.
Stuart Catchpole of Counsel will assist if you have         any
difficulties or queries regarding our comments.

      faithfully

    Dear Sir,

    RESUMED HILLSBOROUGH INQUESTS ON 19TH NOVEMBER 1990

    We thank you for your letter dated 8th November enclosing the
    draft proposed summaries of fact.


    We      agree              that        it will be useful to have                                        such    summaries      and
    provided               agreement                      can      be        reached,                it   may   well   obviate     the
    need to refer to any agreed extracts from the Taylor Report.
    The statements will also be useful as "scene setters" although
    it is not clear whether any further summaries will be prepared
    and in that regard we                                       would ask you to confirm whether                               it is
    your intention to rely upon the                                                                two drafts alone.


    We are also concerned                                       that the                           two drafts contain a number of
    comments which                           in our             view do not                         provide a complete and in
    some respects a fair picture although we say this against the
    background of the knowledge we have gained in representing the
    Club at the public inquiry and in the civil litigation.


    In relation to the draft statement dealing with the transport
    and          other         planning aspects,                                 the          section      dealing     with   police

Dear Sir, !
RESUMED TTTr.T.CTtn^OpGH INQUESTS OH 19TH HOVEMBER 1990

W e ;thank you for your letter dated 8th November enclosing the
draft proposed sranmazries of fact.

We | agree that it will be useful to have such summaries and
provided agreement can he reached, it stay well obviate the
need; to refer to any agreed extracts from the Taylor Report.
Tke statements will also be useful as "scene setters" although
it, is not clear whether any further summaries will be prepared
3hd in that regard; we would ask you to confirm w h e t h e r i t i s
your intention to rely upon the two drafts alone,.

We: are also concerned that the two drafts contain a number of
comments which in our view do not provide a complete w * in
sape respects a fair picture although we say this against the
background: of the knowledge we have gained in representing the
Club at the public inquiry and in the civil litigation.

and other -planning aspects,' the section dealiu g with police

            arrangements does in our view require further explanation as
            clearly the jury will find it difficult to make sense of the
            dejtails provided unless the names of the senior officers are
            given and those areas for- which those senior officers were
            responsible vis a Vis the operational order


            Oujr .concerns, as mentioned above, are more directed towards
            the draft- explaining the history of the Club, the layout of
            the ground, and the safety developments,     Onir comments by
            reference to the paragraphs are as follows

            PAGE 1


            '<*>     Third paragraph: The second sentence should be
                     by adding the words w *♦. and to advise the certifying
                     authority,   responsible   for  granting   the   safety
                     certificate for designating stadia withii their area".
                     It is incorrect to state that the football club and the
                    . consulting engineers were members of the Officer Working
                     Party * The Officer Working Party was sell up to advise
                     the certifying authority and the Club were invited to
                     attend any meetings.    Normally, representation for the
                     Club was by tie consultant engineers*.

            (*>)    Sixth paragraphs The supporters first had to enter
                    through and not "negotiate* the iron perimeter gates,
                    We think it misleading to describe the gaties as situated
                    at the **funnel entrance ** to the ground immediately
                    before, the turnstiles« Ho doubt evidence will be heard
                    as l;o whether the Leppings lane approaches constituted a
                    bottle neck but as to whether the entrance constituted a

supporters "entered through" rather than negotiated the
gates.   it should also be noted that In n o rmal league
matches access can also be given to turnstiles 19 to 22
and 23 to 28 via the lane adjacent to the Leppings Lane
end which runs direct to the south stand.

Ninth paragraph: The proposals put forward by Eastwood &
Partners for alterations to the turnstiles in 1985 is a
subject that requires much further explanation.      The
clear implication behind this paragraph is that the Club
rejected a :safe scheme put forward i Y Eastwood &
Partners.. It must be explained that the scheme put
forward by Eastwood & Partners was put forward for
segregation purposes only and at no time was the Club
advised that alterations were required to the turnstiles
at the Leppihgs Lane end in the interests of safety nor
was ;it suggested by anyone that the schesoe adopted was
unsafe.    The final scheme was approved by the Officer
Worlcing Party and the certifying authority, Sheffield
City Council. Moreover, of the schemes put forward, the
one |finally adopted by the Club and approved, involved
the •;same number of turnstiles as before although the
arrangement of those turnstiles altered, and the reason
for the Club adopting this scheme as opposed to more
expensive schemes for that end of the ground, was that
in the aftermath of the Bradford fire tragedy, the
had to implement substantial work to the ground rvnd in
particular the south stand.    It is our view that the
second sentence of this paragraph should be deleted or a
proper explanation should be provided.




First paragraph: it should be evplainftf that the 12
turnstiles were not in use at the insistence of the

police fox reasons of segregation*

Second, paragraph: rt should be noted that some confusion
may;have been caused by the turnstiles bei ng signed from
left to right A-C-B. it will be a matter for the jury
to decide, whether indeed the sign postilng was wholly
inadequate and constituted a major source of confusion
amongst the supporters.    The last sentence of that
paragraph is also unfortunate in that combi tied with our
above comment/ it may create the impression that the
congestion immediately in. front of the jtumstiles was
caused by poor sign posting and tickets failing to
provide correct information. Moreover, ilhe subject of
congestion raises the question as to whetiier there was a
failure in controlling the supporters who entered
through the perimeter gates and that this failure caused
the congestion, if this paragraph is meant to do more
than simply give an explanation of the lay out at that
end>: by referring to events on the day, it! is only right
in :the interests of fairness that all the relevant
issues are mentioned and in particular the issue as to
who was responsible for controlling fans as they
approached the turnstiles*




Third paragraph:   The details concerning     the gradient
should be clarified. The average gradient was 1:18.5.
At no point did it increase to more than 1:6.8 and it
achieved that for no more than 3 metres 0 2 ' approximately
one.: seventh of its length.   That puts the matter in
bett;er perspective.

Sixth paragraph: The gradient of the terracing was never

                   relevance of such information as the Leppings Lane end
                   at that time was open (i.e. no radial barriers) and the
                   west stand was not in existence.      The west stand was
                   constructed for the purposes of staging world
                   matches in 1966. Ho information was available before
                   Lord; justice Taylor on this particular semi-final and we
                   have seen no evidence since on this subject.      Indeed,

Dear Sir,

Re HILLSBOROUGH INQUESTS - VIDEO RECORDINGS.


You will of course be aware that your client was interviewed under the PACE
procedure and that this interview was audio taped in the usual manner.

I also understand that in addition to the audio tape, a video recording of
the interviews was prepared.  This video recording being however so to speak
extra statutory.  I understand that it was done with the consent of your
client, and on the understanding that it would not be used in proceedings.

It is my intention to have the audio tapes played to the Jury at an
appropriate point in the resumed Inquests.

It occurs to me however that if the video recording is of good enough quality
(which I in fact understand it is), that it might be better and easier to
follow if we showed the video recording rather than listen to the audio tape.

I would not however wish to do this without the express consent of yourself
and your clients.  I would therefore be grateful if you could please let me
know whether you or your client would have any objection to the video
recording being used at the inquest.

I want to make it quite clear that this is entirely your decision and if                     you
would prefer that the video is not used, then we will respect your
wish and use the audio tapes.




Yours faithfully,

    Dear Mr. Popper,

    HILLSBOROUGH RESOMED INQUESTS - 19TH NOVEMBER 1990

    We thank you for your letter dated 31st October and note your
    intention to use various statements as "scene setters".

    Indeed, the use of such statements may prove useful and
    eliminate the need to refer to agreed extracts of Lord Justice
    Taylor's report.   In order to provide our detailed comments,
    we should be grateful if you would kindly forward copies of
    those statements for our consideration.

    We also confirm that we would like transcripts to be made
    available on a next day basis to Counsel at the resumed
    inquests.

    Yours faithfully

 Dear Sirs,

                           Resumed Hillsborough inquests on 19th Nov. 1990

 With reference to my earlier correspondence I am circulating to all
 the firms that were represented at the meeting on 30th October 1990
 summaries of what are believed to be facts relating to the
 Hillsborough disaster.

  I would be most grateful if you could please study the documents as
  soon as possible and let me know:

 1. Whether you agree that they correctly summarize the position in
 respect of those matters which are dealt with.

  2. If you think that there are any errors in the summaries. Please
  specify the errors so that if appropriate they can be corrected.

 If we cannot agree a particular point than it may be necessary to
 delete it entirely from the summaries. I will decide what
 action is needed in the light of any comments and in relation to
 the importance or otherwise of the point that is disputed.

 Please note that it is likely that for convenience the summaries will
 be merged and presented as one. They have simply been prepared in the
 present format, and, in the interests of time I am circulating them
 split.

 There is a further matter that has occurred to me. I have taken it
 that you have kept your client(s) informed of the recomencement of the
 resumed inquests and I have not written to them personally informing
 them of this fact. I have also taken it that neither you nor your
 client(s) object to this. If these assumptions are incorrect please
 let me have by return and preferably by FAX the full name and
 current address of your client(s) so that I c a n formally write to
 them.



 Yours faithfully

         Re; HILLSBOROUGH RESUMED INQUESTS.

         I have had some requests for a Pre-Inquest review in order to enable an
         exchange of views to take place between myself and representatives on
         procedural matters, with the object of ensuring that as far as possible the
         Inquests proper run smoothly with the minimum amount of delay and to the best
         advantage.

         1 have now decided that this review should take place on Tuesday
         30th October 1990 at the Medico Legal Centre, Watery Street, Sheffield at
         2 p.m.

         Although this meeting is intended for legal representatives, I would not
         raise any objection i£ interested parties wished to attend to see what was
         going on, subject of course to us not exceeding the space availability at
         the Medico Legal Centre.

         I would be grateful if you could please confirm to me that you would like to
         attend the review.


         Yours faithfully,

Dear Sirs,

Re» HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - RESUMPTION AND REPRESENTATION

Thank you for your letter of 19th September.  I was aware of the
civil proceedings and in fixing my date I tried to take account
of them with a view to avoiding any overlap.

However as an inquest is not concerned with civil aspects I do
not think that the fact that neither the judgements nor the
transcripts are available are a relevant consideration.  Obviously
if something were to arise which you might wish to draw to ray
attention I would be pleased to hear from you.

On balance it was felt that a start in November on the date
specified was the most convenient choice and I am therefore not
minded to adjourn the resumption,

I am sorry that I cannot agree to your request.



Yours faithfully,

    YOUR REF      HILLS/SOL/3


    Dear Sir

    Hillsborough Disaster : Resumption and Representation

    We thank you for your letter dated the 12th September and note
    your intention to resume the Inquests on Monday the 19th
    November 1990 at 10.00 am.

    We represented Sheffield Wednesday                                                            Football Club at the
    PreliminaryInquests held in May and                                                            it is our intention to
    attend   the resumed   Inquests, where                                                         our clients    will be
    represented by Junior Counsel.

    Hammond Suddards,    the Solicitors for the South Yorkshire
    Police, have provided us with a copy of their letter to you of
    3rd September making reference to the civil trial fixed for
    hearing in Manchester with a commencement date of 2nd October
    and an estimated hearing time of six weeks.      We agree with
    their views that as a matter of practicality, it would be
    highly unfortunate if the Inquests overlapped with the civil
    trial.   While the date for the resumption of the Inquests
    should avoid this, we are concerned that the transcript of the
    evidence from the civil trial and the judgment should be
    available to assist in the Inquests, together of course with
    the evidence given to the Public Inquiry before Lord Justice
    Taylor.   It is unlikely that the transcript evidence or at
    least the judgement will be available for some weeks after the
    conclusion    of   the  civiltrial,  and  therefore we    very
    respectfully ask that the resumption of Inquests be adjourned
    to a later    date, with the agreement of the principal legal
    representatives involved.

    We anticipate that those representing the deceased will also
    wish to have access to the evidence from the civil trial, and
    the availability of such transcript evidence may also have a

                                                                                                                   Contd../..

      Dear Sirs,
       Dear Sirs,

       Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.


       If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
       of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent,
       on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m. Details of venue will be notified in
       due course.

       I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
       evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
       coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
       inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

       Subject to the Coroners’ Act 1988 and the Coroners’ Rules, the Inquest is
       under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
       witnesses who wish to give evidence.  I am at present engaged in considering
       this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

       Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
       to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
       appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me to
       consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

       May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
       attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

        I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
        names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision as
        to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

        I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
        heard from you by the end of September I will assume you have no names to
        submit.

        Your^8 faithfully,

    Dear Sir

    Hillsborough Tragedy

    We act on behalf of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club with
    regard to the Public Inquiry and generally on matters arising
    from the Hillsborough tragedy on the 15th April 1989.

    We are also instructed to act on behalf of the Club        in
    relation to the inquests, and we would ask you to kindly note
    our interest.

    We would be happy toattend any meeting to discuss          the
    procedures to be adopted and any other matters relating to the
    inquests, but this may well be premature given the criminal
    investigations now being conducted.  In any event, please note
    our interest in the matter.

         Dear Sirs,

         Hillsborough resumed Inquests 19th November 1990.

         Thank you for your letter of the 2nd of November.  I have already got
         statements made both by Mr. Butler and Mr. Bownes but if you are in
         possession of any further statements which you feel may be of assistance to
         me in considering and assessing the evidence, I would be grateful if you
         could please let me have it.

         I do not think it is a practical proposition, certainly not at this stage, to
         try and de-limit the extent or scope of the evidence which they may be asked
         to give.

Dear Sir

Hillsborough resumed Inquests 19th                  November 1990

As you are aware, we act for Sheffield City Council.  We understand that Mr
Butler and Mr Bownes have been asked to make themselves available to give evidence.

Both Sheffield City Council and these gentlemen are very willing to assist
at the inquests but as you probably know Sheffield City Council's involvement
as the licencing authority of Hillsborough covers a wide area of activity.
We would therefore think that it might be mutually helpful if you could indicate
those aspects to which you would wish to direct their evidence.

They would be very willing to supply in advance some form of statements which
might be helpful to you in your preparation for and the conduct of the inquests.
Please let us know whether this would be sensible and whether some definition
of the extent of their evidence could be agreed.

We look forward to hearing from you.

Yours faithfully

  Dear Sirs,

                          Resumed Hillsborough inquests on 19th Nov. 1990

 With reference to my earlier correspondence I am circulating to all
 the firms that were represented at the meeting on 30th October 1990
 summaries of what are believed to be facts relating to the
 Hillsborough disaster.

  I would be most gratefulif you could please study the documents as
  soon as possible and let me know:

  1. Whether you agree that they correctly summarize the positionin
  respect of those matterswhich are dealt with.

  2. If you think that there are any errors in the summaries. Please
  specify the errors so that if appropriate they can be corrected.

  If we cannot agree a particular point than it may be necessary to
  delete it entirely from the summaries. I willdecide what
  action is needed in the light of any commentsand in relation to
  the importance or otherwise of the point that is disputed.

 Please note that it is likely that for convenience the summaries will
 be merged and presented as one. They have simply been preparedin the
 present format, and, in the interests of timeI am circulating them
 split.

 There is a further matter that has occurred to me. I have taken it
 that you have kept your client(s) informed of the recomencement of the
 resumed inquests and I have not written to them personally informing
 them of this fact. I have also taken it that neither you nor your
 client(s) object to this. If these assumptions are incorrect please
 let me have by return and preferably by FAX the full name and
 current address of your client(s) so that Ican formally write to
 them.

          Dear Sir,

          Re; HILLSBOROUGH RESUMED INQUESTS.

          I have had some requests for a Pre-Inquest review in order to enable an
          exchange of views to take place between myself and representatives on
          procedural matters, with the object of ensuring that as far as possible the
          Inquests proper run smoothly with the minimum amount of delay and to the best
          advantage.

          1 have now decided that this review should take place on Tuesday
          30th October 1990 at the Medico Legal Centre, Watery Street, Sheffield at
          2 p.m.

          Although this meeting is intended for legal representatives, I would not
          raise any objection if interested parties wished to attend to see what was
          going on, subject of course to us not exceeding the space availability at
          the Medico Legal Centre.

          I would be grateful if you could please confirm to me that you would like to
          attend the review.


          Yours faithfully,

       Dear Sirs,

       Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.


       If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
       of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent,
       on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m. Details of venue will be notified in
       due course.

       I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
       evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
       coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
       inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

       Subject to the Coroners’ Act 1988 and the Coroners’ Rules, the Inquest is
       under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
       witnesses who wish to give evidence.  I am at present engaged in considering
       this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

       Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
       to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
       appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me to
       consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

       May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
       attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

       I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
       names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision as
       to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

       I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
       heard from you by the end of September I will assume you have no names to
       submit.

       Yours faithfully,

Dear Sirs,

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER:                           RESUMPTION AND REPRESENTATION.


It is my intention to resume the Inauests on Monday the 19th of
November 1990 at 10.a.m. into the deaths of the 95 people who
died on the 1 5 th of April 1989 at Hillsborough Stadium.

As I have to take some urgent decisions regarding venue for the
resumed Inquest, I would be grateful if you could please reply
by return and indicate whether you anticipate:

      i•                  That you wish to attend and represent your Client(s)
                           (if you have not previously been granted representation
                          rights I will assume that an affirmative reply indicates
                          your intention to apply).

      ii.                 Whether you expect to appear by Counsel and if so
                          whether it would be by junior or by silk and junior.

      iii.                If your response is positive, do you anticipate being
                          present throughout the Inquest which I expect will run
                          for a period of several weeks.


Yours faithfully,

          Dear Sir

          Hillsborough - Interim Resumed Inquests - 18th April 1990

          Thank you for your letter of the 9th April.

          Mr Gregory from this office will attend the opening day
          of the Inquest on behalf of Sheffield City Council. We
          think it highly unlikely that it will be necessary for
          him or another representative of our firm to be present
          on a daily basis and we feel that we will only be able
          to make a decision about our attendance from day to day.
          We recall that you expressed the view that you would
          not regard it as a discourtesy if representatives dealt
          with representation on that basis and we hope that this
          approach therefore will be acceptable to you.

          If it presents any problems we would be most grateful
          if you would telephone Mr Gregory immediately.

          Yours sincerely

Dear Sir or Madam,

Re:     18th April 1990 -Interim Resumed Inquests                - Hillsborough

I am writing to inform  you that the venue for the above will be the
Memorial Hall, Barkers Pool, Sheffield, and we are scheduled to commence
at 10.30 am.

I anticipate that the second date, 19th April, will also be at that
location but after the 19th, we plan to hold the Inquests at the Medico
Legal Centre, Watery Street, Sheffield.

It would be appreciated if you would confirm to me as soon as possible
whether you intend to be present on 18th April, and also let me have, if
known, the name of the   solicitor or Counsel who is representing your
clients.

Yours      thfully,




            ,er

          Hill Dickinson Davis Campbell,
          Solicitors,
          Pearl Assurance House,
          Derby Square,
          Liverpool. L2 9XL.

          Dear Sirs,

              Hillsborough - Resumed Inquests

              Thank you for your letter of the 3rd of December.

              I hope that you will excuse the relative brevity and staccato style of this
              reply, but I am sure you will appreciate that I am rather pressed for time.
              Nevertheless X felt it right that I should respond to you as quickly as
              possible. May I make a few general observations first-

              As you know, X have been perfectly willing to allow your clients to be
              treated as an interested party and to be represented at the inquest. The^
              fact that for whatever reason they are unable or unwilling to be present is
              regrettable, but not something that I can do anything about.^ I should
              perhaps add that they are not unique in this situation, and indeed even in^
              these inquests they are at present interested parties who no doubt would wish
              to be legally represented but who for various reasons are u n a b l e to be so.

              I note what you          say with regard to funding. Should your position change and
 —            should you feel          that you would wish to avail yourself of the opportunity for
^             representation,          then I would not stand in your way. Whether such attendance
              would be useful          would I think in the final analysis have to be for you to
              determine.
              You are of course quite right that this matter was investigated by Lord
              Justice Taylor and that he wrote a report.

              However, whether one likes it or not, the present legal position is quite
              clear that notwithstanding a Public Inquiry (and this would apply w h e t h e r the
              Public Inquiry was a statutory one or a departmental one) there is a duty on
              the coroner to hold an inquest (see R - v - H.M.Coroner for East Kent ex
              parte Peter Alan Spooner et el Queen’s Bench Division October the 6th ^S?).
              Furthermore, if an inquest is to be held I took the view that this should be
              held with a Jury.
              It is perfectly plain that before the Jury can reach a verdict, they have to
              hear the evidence. The fact that some or all of the evidence may have been
              heard or considered by Lord Justice Taylor is neither here or there.
              It i s the duty of the Jury to r e a c h a v e r d i c t i n a c c o r d a n c e w i t h t h e e v i d e n c e

Enclosed is a copy letter from Hill Dickinson.   It is lengthy but most
of it is quotation, of LJT’s Report.

I have already indicated to the Inquests that I am not going to admit
LJT’s report, either in part or in toto.

I do not think that I would be prepared to put the letter as written
before the Jury because of 2 above.

Furthermore it would not constitute evidence - i.e. not on oath.

It is also in the nature of an address to the Jury on facts contrary to
the rules.

The fact that they cannot attend having been given opportunity is not my
fault.

Reporting of the Inquests by the Press is often patchy and selective.

Hill Dickinson admit they are trying to influence the Jury by the letter
or by the publication to the Press. Even if this is a typographical
error which it might be, it may still influence the Jury.

Bearing in mind that the Jury must reach their verdict based on the
evidence, an attempt to influence them by publication is likely to be
contempt, in my opinion-.

         Dear Sir
                                                HILLSBOROUGH - RESUMED INQUESTS

        As you will recall from our letter of 16th November our clients'
        (the Football Supporters Association) funding is such that we have
        been unable to attend before you to represent our client's interest.
        Our clients' attempts to raise financing are, however, still
        continuing and it may be that our clients will be able to attend at
        some later date. Should financing become available our clients
        would, of course, have to take a view as to whether an appearance
        after the Inquests had started could usefully assist you.

        At the pre-inquests meeting our representative stated that if our
         clients were unable to represent the interests of Liverpool
         supporters there would in effect be a void in representation before
        you. We have to say that on the basis of the reports on the opening
        days' evidence at the Inquests which both we and our clients have
        read in the media, this void in representation is now marked and is
        possibly affecting the outcome of the Inquests themselves.

         Our clients have asked us to write to you to explain their views in
         the light of the various media reports we have been reading and
         hearing in respect of the first weeks of evidence. As a party whom
         you invited to be represented before you, we would invite you to
         place copies of this letter before the members of the Jury, as this

may be our clients' only way of having their views considered.
You can obviously stress to the Jury the weight which you feel
ought to be placed upon the sentiments and views we set out below.


The source of our clients' frustration and anger has been the gist
of the evidence concerning the behaviour of Liverpool supporters in
the hours leading up to the disaster occurring. The general
impression given by the evidence lead to show the behaviour of
Liverpool supporters seems to be that:-

1.   The vast majority of Liverpool supporters had drunk to excess
and that drink has affected their behaviour.

2. That Liverpool supporters were not only drinking to excess in
public houses but had purchased large quantities of alcohol from
local stores and off-licences.

3. That Liverpool supporters largely arrived "late" at the game,
and that this lateness was caused by drinking in local hostelries.


4. That there were hundreds, if not thousands of Liverpool
supporters without tickets and that these ticketless supporters
were in some way responsible for the disaster.

5. That Liverpool supporters were involved in other criminal
activities which in some way influenced the cause of the disaster.

It would appear to us from reports seen by our clients that this
scenario is not being substantially challenged. In saying this we
imply no criticism of the representatives of those bereaved or
injured at Hillsborough. It has already been accepted that their
brief and emphasis has,of necessity, been different to that of our
clients. If our clients had been able to be present at the Inquests
they would have challenged this scenario most rigorously, as it is a
scenario they do not accept as being factually correct.
    FROM HILL DICKINSON DAVIS CAMPBELL

Our clients would like to draw to the attention of the Jurors the
following facts

1. At the Taylor Inquiry the South Yorkshire Police produced
excellent collections of photographs of the crowd outside the
Hillsborough Stadium in the hours leading up to the disaster.
These photographs were timed and presumably give an accurate
reflection of the visibly apparent nature of the crowd, in so much
as it would appear to an onlooker. None of those phtographs at any
time support the view that the majority of Liverpool supporters were
carrying large amounts of alcoholic drinks.   Indeed, the
photographs show that three or four individuals (in separate
photographs) are seen to be carrying one can of beer.

2. The video compiled by the West Midlands Police investigation
team similarly does not support the theory that vast numbers of
supporters around the ground were carrying large quantities of
alcoholic beverages. Nor does it support the view that the vast
majority of the crowd were badly behaved or openly hostile towards
the South Yorkshire Police. It does show quite clearly that some
elements of the crowds at the back of the mass of supporters seeking
entrance to the ground were boisterous; it supports the view that
there was an altercation between one Police Officer and one fan; but
it does no more than that. There is a marked difference between the
boisterous, excited bahaviour of a football crowd, expectant of
seeking an exciting, important game and the badly behaved crowd, the
picture of which appears to have been painted on the basis of the
report we have seen.

3. We have heard reports of bad behaviour of Liverpool supporters
in public houses well away from the ground - one particular incident
involving supporters who allegedly pulled a cigarette machine off
the wall of a public house. Our clients feel that this evidence
has little, if any, relevance to the matters in issue.

4. Our clients are firm believers that Lord Justice Taylor's
interim report provided an accurate description of the factual
circumstances which ensued on 15th April, 1989.   Our clients feel
that Lord Justice Taylor heard sufficient representative evidence to
have formed an accurate factual overview of the events.

We know that you have discussed the use that you will make of the
Taylor Report and we do not know, because of our absence, of the
final view you have formed in this regard. However, bearing that in
mind our clients would like to make the following points:-


A. Lord Justice Taylor heard much evidence as to the alleged
bahaviour of Liverpool supporters in the hours leading up the
tragedy. On the question of the alleged drunkenness of the fans he
heard evidence from many of those witnesses appearing at the
Inquest, such as witnesses Hockenhull, Lindley and Buck, and will
have read many other statements. In dealing with this aspect of the
behaviour of Liverpool fans, he concluded at Paragraph 196 of his
interim report:-


         "Of those who arrived at 2.30 p.m. or after, very many
         had been drinking at public houses or had brought drink
         from home or an off-licence. I am satisfied on the
         evidence, however, that the great majority were not drunk,
         nor even the worse for drink. The Police witnesses varied
         on this. Some described the high proportion as drunk, as
         "lager louts" or even as "animals". Others described a
         generally normal crowd with an unco-operative minority who
         had drunk too much. In my view, some Officers, seeking to
         rationalise their loss of control, over-estimated the
         drunkal element in the crowds. There certainly was such an
         element. There were youngsters influenced by drink and
         bravado pushing impatiently at the rear of the crowd,
         thereby exacerbating the crush. But the more convicing
         police witnesses, including especially Detective
         Superintendent McKay and Chief Inspector Creaser, as well
         as a number of responsible civilian witnesses, were in my
         view right in describing this element as a minority. Those
         witnesses attributed the crush to the sheer numbers of fans
         all anxious to gain entry. There was no criticism of the
         crowd by any of their witnesses in the period up to 2.30p.m.
         or even 2.35 p.m. What happened then was not a sudden
    FROM HILL DICKINSON DAVIS CAMPBELL
    T  S.L. Popper Esq                         5            ^      03-Dec-90
    To                                   No.                Date




        deterioration in the mood or sobriety of those assembled
        there. No doubt those coming behind would have had more to
        drink and would have included the unruly minority. But the
        crisis developed because this very large crowd became packed
        into a confined turnstile area and its very density hampered
        its passage through the turnstiles.11


B. Lord Justice Taylor also heard much evidence as to the
"lateness" of Liverpool fans and the allegation that it was this
"lateness" which caused or at least contributed to the caotic scenes
outside Hillsborough. In this regard he concluded at paragraph
192:-


        "Whether those who arrived between 2.30 p.m. and 2.40 p.m.
        were "late" was much debated. The ticket simply requested
        its holder "to take up (his) position 15 minutes before
        kick-off". That may have been intended to pursuade those with
        stand tickets to take their seats, but it would not be
        unreasonable for a standing spectator to arrive at the
        turnstiles between 2.30 p.m. and 2.40 p.m. Whether they were
        "late" or not, however, there was certainly a large
        concentration of Liverpool fans arriving at about 2.30 p.m.
        and after."


C. Substantial evidence at the Public Inquiry was brought to
allege disgraceful behaviour on the part of Liverpool fans, both in
and around the ground and further afield.          In this regard, Lord
Justice Taylor concluded at paragraph 197:-


        "Superintendent Marshall and other Officers criticised the
        crowd as uncoperative because Police exortations to stop
        pushing into his back were not heeded. How could they be?
        In that crush most people had no control over their
        movements at all. Two incidents involving police horses
        illustrate the point. One horse was found afterwards to
        have cigarette burns on its rump. Clearly that was the
        despicable work of a hooligan whether in drink or not.
        However, there were also eye witness accounts of a horse
        being physically lifted off its feet by the crowds. That
        occurred, as the police accepted, without malice or intent
        but as an involuntary consequence of crowd pressure which
        those by the horses flanks could not resist any more than the
        horse itself."

    To S.L. Popper Esq                                        6          03-Dec-90
                                                        No.       Date




Further, at paragraph 199 Lord Justice Taylor went on:-
         "The result was that in the early stages Police Officers were
         pestered by fans for help as to where they should go. Later,
         as the crowd became more dense, fans were presenting their
         tickets at the wrong turnstile. There were also Liverpool
         supporters who had acquired tickets for The Kop end but
         sought entry at Leppings Lane. They caused delay in the
         turnstile operation when entry was refused, and after a while
         the police instructed the operators to let them through.
         There was further delay because the crush made it difficult
         for fans to get into the turnstile entrances. Once there,
         the pressure from behind was such as, on occasions, to jam
         them in the doorway or against the paddle of the turnstile.
         Finally, there were fans without tickets who sought to
         enter by offering payment, by seeking to go over or under
         the paddle or by sliding through with a ticket holder. All of
         these activities slowed down the turnstile rate which at the
         worse period was only about 600 per hour per turnstile. The
         waiting crowd therefore expanded and as the minutes passed
         frustration grew. Visitors who had paid for tickets and
         travelled from afar realised they were making little forward
         progress, frustration increased pressure and induced panic
         at the front. Determination to get into the match was
         intensified by determination to get out of the crush."


Earlier in the Report, at paragraph 64, and in describing the
situation outside the turnstiles, Lord Justice Taylor stated:-


          "Superintendent Marshall was in the midst of the turmoil.
          He extracated himself and stood on a paraphet of the bridge
          to get a clear view. A drunken fan tried to push him off;
          a beer can was thrown at a mounted officer. But these were
          isolated acts by individuals; the menace came from the
          massive number single-mindedly determined to be in for the
          kick-off with time running out".


D. At the Public Inquiry much play was made by the South Yorkshire
Police of an argument that thousands of Liverpool supporters arrived
at Hillsborough without tickets and that the presence of these
people without tickets in someway caused or contributed to the
disaster. The Police also produced bundles of evidence to support a
    FR O M H ILL D IC K IN S O N DAVIS C A M P B E LL
    To S.L. Popper Esq                                        7          03-Dec-90
                                                        No.       Date




"conspiracy theory" to the effect that the presence of many of the
Liverpool supporters without tickets was pre-planned as a means of
forcing the Police to allow them to enter the ground. This
conspiracy theory was soundly rejected. In concluding on this
aspect, Lord Justice Taylor said at paragraphs 201 - 202:-


         "200 - it has become a fact of football life that fans do
         turn up at all ticket matches without tickets. It is not
         possible to give an accurate figure or even a reliable
         estimate of the number without tickets on 15th April. Police
         estimates varied from about about 200 to about 2,000. There
         was certainly frequent requests for tickets or "spares"
         during the hours before the build up. Many of those warned
         off by the Police were seen to return to the area. Some were
         hanging about on the bridge. Again, however, the police
         witnesses who most impressed me did not consider the number
         of ticketless fans to be inordinately large. This accords
         with two other sources of evidence.
         201 - First, there was a wide range of witnesses who observed
         inside the ground that the Liverpool end was at a late stage
         well below capacity save for pens 3 and 4. The North Stand
         still had many empty seats and the wing pens were sparse,
         the match being a sell-out, there were clearly many ticket
         holders to come and they could account for the large crowd
         still outside the turnstiles. Had the Liverpool
         accommodation been full by 2.40 p.m. one could have inferred
         that most or much of the large crowd outside lacked tickets.

          202- Secondly, such figures as are available from the Club's
          electronic monitoring system and from analysis by the HSE
          suggest that no great number entered without tickets and
          show that the number who passed through turnstiles A-G plus
          those who entered through gate C roughly equalled the terrace
          capacity figure of 10,100 for which tickets had been sold.
          The Club's records showed 7,038 passed through turnstiles
          A-G. However, the counting mechanism on turnstile G was
          defective so the HSE did a study using the video film and
          projecting figures from the other turnstiles. This gave
          an assessment of 7,494 with a maximum of 7,644 passing
          through A-G. Again, using the video, the HSE assessed the
          number who entered the ground whilst gate C was open at
          2,240 with a maximum of 2,480. Accordingly, the HSE's best
          estimate of the total entering through gate C and turnstiles
          A-G was 9,734 with a maximum of 10,124. I recognise that
          these can only be rough checks because, for example, some
          with terraced tickets were allowed through turnstiles 1-16
          and there would be other similar factors which have not
          formed part of the assessment. Nevertheless, the figures do

      To                                   No.          Date




           suggest that there was not a very significant body of
           ticketless fans in the crowd which built up."

Lord Justice Taylor went on at paragraph 208:-

           "I have already found that there was not an abnormally large
           number of fans without tickets on this occasion. With one
           or two exceptions, the Police witnesses themselves did not
           subscribe to the "conspiracy" theory. I am satisfied that
           the large concentration at Leppings Lane from 2.30 p.m. to
           2.50 p.m. did not arrive as a result of any concerted plans.
           There were, I accept, small groups without tickets who were
           willing to exploit any adventitious chance of getting into
           the ground. They, together with a minority who had drunk
           too much, certainly had aggravated the problem faced by the
           Police. But that main problem was simply one of large numbers
           packed into the small area outside the turnstiles".



The purpose of our clients wishing up to make these points is
simple: our clients believe that the evidence which has been heard
at the Inquests and reported in the media has all been put before.
It has been challenged and its limitations have been found.


Our clients are quite prepared to accept that:-

i.     There were some Liverpool supporters who drank too much to the
extent that it affected their behaviour.

ii.    There were some Liverpool supporters who behaved quite
disgracefully.

iii. There were present some supporters without tickets who should
not have been there and who would have made life difficult for the
Police.

The extracts we have quoted from Lord Justice Taylor's report are,
to our mind, fairly balanced and support the points which our
clients are prepared to accept. However, and having said that, our
clients wish to say most forceably that;

i.    All of the above supporters were in a very small minority,

ii.    Their actions were not responsible for the death and injuries
which ensued and,

iii. Their actions, in themselves, were perfectly capable of being
policed and were, indeed, foreseeable to a Police Authority having
a reasonable knowledge of the manner in which football crowds behave
and the tendencies which do, unfortunately, appear to manifest
themselves.

Our clients accept that                         as the allegations referred to above are the
honestly held views and                         beliefs of witnesses whom it is perfectly
relevant to call, it is                         quite proper for them to be heard at the
Inquests. However, our                          clients perceive two dangers

i.     That the allegations are passing seemingly unchallenged in the
absence of our clients and

ii. The allegations are being reported as being fact by the media
who are obviously seeking only to attract readers, viewers or
listeners.

Both of these dangers may result in the allegations being accepted
as fact by the jurors or the public.                             The allegations are not
accepted as fact by our clients.

As our clients cannot appear before you and make these points, they
felt that they had no other option but to write to you, through
ourselves, and attempt to redress the balance in the Jurors' minds.
Had our clients been present at the Inquests all of the above
points would have been made on our clients' behalf.

Finally, and in the light of the manner in which the evidence has so

far been reported in the media, our clients had asked us to write
an open letter in terms of the above to the Editors of all national
and relevant local newspapers and to   local radio stations in
Liverpool and Sheffield. Our clients feel that the allegationsmade
in the media must be answered.

We have considered with our clients the possibility that such a step
may be considered as an attempt by our clients to influence the
outcome of the Inquests, and in some way as being in contempt of
court. We understand from those who have attended the Inquests that
you have requested parties not to speak to the press.

We have considered this point most carefully as it obviously causes
us concern. The above letter is certainly an attempt by our clients
to influence the outcome of the Inquests: that is precisely what
each party at the Inquests sees as its aim. Our clients were, quite
properly in our view, invited by you to be such a party. Our
clients are unable to attend personally before you, or through
Counsel or solicitors, to have their   views known. This methodis,
therefore, the only method of making                               those views known.

In our submission, therefore, it must be proper for you to place
this letter beforie the Jurors, with an appropriate advice from
yourself as to the weight which the Jurors should attach to it. If
that is correct, and we would submit it is, then the letter must
also be capable of reading by the media as the Inquests are open and
reportable by the media.

If you decline our invitation to place this letter before the
Jurors, then we still feel that our clients are entitled through the
media, to respond to the points made in the media reports of the
evidence given so far. Our clients are merely repeating the views
which they have already made public on several occasions and the
line which they took through Counsel at the Public Inquiry. They
are, as we have said, already a party to the Inquests.

Consequently, and after much consideration we are of the view that
our clients would be at liberty to release this letter to the media
without they, or indeed ourselves, being in contempt of your court
or in anyway acting improperly. However, before taking such a step
both we and our clients would welcome your views and comments. If
you believe that our clients would be acting improperly in
releasing this letter to the media, please advise us as we know that
our clients will respect your views and consider carefully any
points you may wish to make.

We await your comments on the above as soon as feasible and if you
wish to discuss any element of the points we have made with us,
please do not hesitate to contact us as you should feel appropriate.


Yours faithfully

  Dear Sirs,

                         Resumed Hillsborough inquests on 19th Nov. 1990

 With reference to my earlier correspondence I am circulating to all
 the firms that were represented at the meeting on 30th October 1990
 summaries of what are believed to be facts relating to the
 Hillsborough disaster.

  I would be most grateful if you could please study the documents as
  soon as possible and let me know:

  1. Whether you agree that they correctly summarize the position in
  respect of those matters which are dealt with.

  2. If you think that there are any errors inthe summaries. Please
  specify the errors so that if appropriate they canbe corrected.

  If we cannot agree a particular point than it may be necessary to
  delete it entirely from the summaries.,1 willdecide what
  action is needed in the light of any commentsand in relation to
  the importance or otherwise of the point that is disputed.

  Please note that it is likely that for convenience the summaries will
  be merged and presented as one. They have simply been preparedin the
  present format, and, in the interests of timeI am circulating them
  split.

 There is a further matter that has occurred to me. I have taken it
 that you have kept your client(s) informed of the recomencement of the
 resumed inquests and I have not written to them personally informing
 them of this fact. I have also taken it that neither you nor your
 client(s) object to this. If these assumptions are incorrect please
 let me have by return and preferably by FAX the full name and
 current address of your client(s) so that I can formally write to
 them.



 Yours far

   Dear Sirs,

                        Hillsborough resumed inquests 19th Nov, 1990

   I refer to our meeting on 30th. October- 1990 at the Medico Legal. Centre
   when we discussed various procedural aspects,

   One of the points which was raised was to try to construct an agreed
   extract from the report of Lord Justice Taylor which could deal as I.
   understood it with in the main factual matters on which all the
   parties were agreed and so save time and effort.

   For some reason I did not make it clear at that point that I already
   w m p 6o ^ J the preparation of various statements to be presented by
                which are intended to be 'scene setters' and which I
   achieve          ^      ob^ ctives whi^h some   of. you weretrying to

   I. am writing to you                         now on this as it may              help you inconnection
   with your planning,

     " * 1 C!n  Lhe paper work together in time it may be possible to
  circulate these statements to those firms that were present at the
  Bering on 30th October 1990 in order to enable                                   ,a t   £ cogent       T t yo n

FILE NOTE DATED 22.10.90 .^TELEPHONE CONVERSATION WITH MR.

JACKSON OF HILL DICKENSON DAVIS CAMPBELL RE THEIR FAX DATED

19th OCTOBER WHICH I RECEIVED WHEN I CAME IN TO THE OFFICE

ON THE 22nd.                                   ______________



I said that I wanted to make it quite clear that I wasn't

trying to drum up the representation, we had quite

sufficient but I didn't want to feel this aspect had been

overlooked.    He said he entirely agreed with the point

which I had drawn to his attention and that he quite

understood what I was now saying.     I then went on to say

that there was no question of central funds, no question of

Legal Aid in fact no financial assistance.     The only

possibility that occurred to me and I had only thought of

this after I had seen his fax and without talking to Mr.

Frazer was that it might be possible that the Steering

Committee could assist.

Mr. Jackson said that he had already thought of this too

and had spoken to Mr. Frazer and that there was a potential

conflict of interests.     He said they would have to sort it

out.     In any event he was coming on the 30th of November.

         De ar Sirs,

         Re;   R E SU ME D INQU ESTS 19TH OF N O V E M B E R 1990.

         I un de rs t a n d that you r fir m wer e   rep re s en ti ng the F ootball Suppor ters
         Association.

         You w i l l I am sure know, that I a m res um in g these Inquests on the 19th of
         N o v e mb er and w i l l no doubt be h e a r i n g evidence fro m various people, some of
         w h i c h m ig h t be cr itical of supporters, p o s si bl y generally.

         You have already informed me on the 11th of A pr il that in all the
         circums ta nc es of the case y ou did n ot feel that y ou w a n t e d to a ttend the
         resumed Inquests and this is of course p e r f ec t ly p r o p e r and correct.

         I of course u n d e r s t a n d that I am d e a li ng w i t h an Inqu est and n o t a Public
         Inquiry, but I felt that I ought to d r a w this to y o u r attention, in order to
         avoid a pos si bl e suggestion at some time in the future, that supporters we re
         not given an o p po rt un it y to be r e pr e se nt ed at the Inquests into the d ea th of
         the 95 persons.

         I w o u l d be gr ateful if y o u w o u l d please   let me k n o w if y o u ha ve any views or
         comments.

         Yours    faithfully,

      Dear Sirs,

      Re:   R E S UM ED INQUESTS             19th N O V EM BE R 1990.



      If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
      of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of w h o m y ou represent,
      on the 19th of N o v e mb er 1990 at 10.a.m. Details of venue wil l be n o t i f i e d in
      due course.

      I do not have to remind y ou of the fact that a considerable amount of
      ev id ence has alre ad y been taken, n or of the na ture and limitations of a
      coronal inv es ti ga ti o n w h i c h you w i l l recollect is not adversarial but
      i nquisitorial in nature, and w h i c h of course has only limited objectives.

      Subject to the C o r o n e r s ’ Act 1988 and the C o r o n e r s ’ Rules, the Inquest is
      under my control, and in particular, it is my re s ponsibility to select the
      w i tn e ss es w h o w i s h to give evidence.       I am at present engaged in c o n s i d e r i n g
      this and in d e t e r m i n i n g w h o I w i s h to invite to attend.

      W i t h o u t p re judice in any w a y to my rights in the matter, I am w r i t i n g to you
      to give you an o p po r tu ni ty to d r a w to my a tt en ti on the names and other
      a pp ropriate details of any witn es s or wi tn esses w h o m you w o u l d like me to
      c on si de r call in g to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

      May I please ask you in c o n si de ri n g w h e t h e r you w i s h to dra w any names       to my
      attention, to bea r in m i n d the scope and limitations of an Inquest,

      I also w a n t to make it absolutely cle ar that the submission of a name or
      names for co ns i d e r a t i o n is n o th in g more than that, and that the d e c is io n as
      to w h o to call to give evidence is and remains a m a t t e r for me.

      I w o u l d be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
      h ea rd fro m y ou by the end of September I wil l assume you have no names to
      ciihmif                                                       '

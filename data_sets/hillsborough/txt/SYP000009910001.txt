that      point heading           towards H i l l s b o r o u g h Ground,            There were

a p p r o x i m a t e l y 45 to 50        coaches and a steady               stream of Liverpool

S u p p o r t e r Private Cars           passing       through the       point.

At a point            close    by there was a Parking Area where                        I noticed        several

cars      parked over a period of this                       time w hich      contained Liverpool

Su p p o r t e r s    displaying        board asking          for any    spare       tickets were

available,            in order      for them to make            purchases.           1 spoke      to some of

these youths and was                  informed        that this was          probably the         last    stop

prior        to getting        to the ground where              tyrffets for         sale    could be dearer,,

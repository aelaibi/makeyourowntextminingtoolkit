                Trevor Bichard                  Police Officer (South Yorkshire Police)

                Doctor David Slater carried out the Post-Mortem on Nicholas Joynes,
                Joseph Daniel McCarthy and Philip Hammond. During the resumed inquest in
                April/May 1990, he gave evidence in respect of their Post-Mortems but
                omitted to give the cause of death in respect of Joynes and McCarthy. In
                respect of Hammond, he was asked questions regarding a fracture to one of
                his ribs.   He stated that the injury was probably as a result of focal
                blunt pressure, but was unable to say what the actual cause of the injury


                Police Constable Trevor Bichard was re-called and concluded his evidence
                under cross-examination.    He was questioned as to his use of zoom
                facilities on the C.C.T.V. He described the panning of the C.C.T.V. when
                Gates C and A were opened.    Part of the compilation tape was shown to
                illustrate this function.

                The recollections of Police Constable 1285 Smith were read out to the
                court by the Coroner. Police Constable Smith has not been called due to
                ill health.

                The B.B.C. compilation video was shown, covering the time period between
                1452 and 1515-

                The Coroner introduced the following as documentary evidence;             the
                statement of Patricia Ann Owens, whose son Jonathan Owens died in         the
                tragedy, the Post-Mortem reports from the individual Pathologists and     the
                questionnaires sent out to the families by the Coroner shortly after      the
                tragedy.

            Police Sergeant Michael Goddard was re-called and concluded his evidence
            under cross-examination.    He was questioned regarding the requests by
            Superintendent Marshall to open the Leppings Lane gate, the reasoning
            behind those requests, where the fans would disperse to once inside the
            ground and the connection between Gate C and the tunnel leading to the
            centre pens.   He described the advantages of talk-through and the time
            scale the repair of the radio system took.

            Police Constable Trevor Bichard has been a member of the Control Room
            staff since 1987-   His duties related to the operating of the C.C.T.V.
            system, the video recorders and the V.H.F. radio.      He described the
            position of the cameras and their functions. He mentioned his actions as
            the situation developed.

                 briefing and duties of Stewards and his expectation as to what assistance he
                 would receive from club officials during the course of a match.           He
                 mentioned the problems with radio communications when used in the talk-
                 through mode. He mentioned that disparity in crowd density is itself not a
                 problem as the central pens, being the most popular attract certain fans who
                 will put up with a certain amount of discomfort to obtain the best view.

            Brian Leonard Mole          Chief Superintendent (South Yorkshire Police)

            Chief Superintendent Brian Mole was re-called and continued his evidence
            under cross-examination.   His evidence included crowd distributions, fans
            finding own level on the Leppings Lane teri*aces when there is a capacity
            crowd,  the ineffectiveness    of Police Officers and/or Stewards when
            positioned in full pens, the closing of the tunnel gates to control ingress
            and the segregation of fans.   He explained the reasoning behind the change
            in roles of Superintendents Greenwood and Marshall and the capabilities of
            those Officers, the type of activity which the staff of the Police Control
            Room would be involved in and the difficulties a breakdown in radio
            communications would cause for the Ground Commander.       He described the
            responsibilities of the Stewards, their briefing and duties.    He mentioned
            the circumstances which would cause him to consider delaying the kick-off.

                The following witness was called to give evidence.

                 Brian Leonard Mole         Chief Superintendent (South Yorkshire Police)

                 Chief Superintendent Brian Mole was Divisional Commander of F Division
                 until March 1989, when he was transferred to 'B' Division, Barnsley. In his
                 evidence in chief he described the working relationship he had with
                 Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, the command structure at football
                 matches, the specific duties of senior officers and the confidence he had in
                 their abilities.   He made reference to the system of raising manpower for
                 football matches and the reason for reducing the manpower for the 1989 semi­
                 final.     He described the preparation for the semi-finals held at
                 Hillsborough in 1987 /8 8 , when he was in command. He mentioned the methods
                 used to check for ticketless fans and the problems caused by ticket touts.
                 He refuted the fact that any filtering or barriers were in position in the
                 1988/89 semi-finals to check for ticketless fans. Hedescribed the initial
                 use of radial fences to segregate fans of opposing teams and the way he
                 perceived the radial gates would be controlled by the Police. He described
                 the criteria for delaying kick-off and the effect this would have on fans
                 already within the stadium, the teams and the implications this would have
                 with public transport timetables after the game.

            During this morning the Jury paid a visit to the Sheffield Wednesday Football
            Ground.

            Doctor Nicholson was re-called to clarify why he used certain photographs
            when he was estimating the crowd figures in Pens 3 and 4.      His explanation
            was that he used only the photograph where he could easily count frontal
            facing faces, the angle of other photographs meant he was unable toidentify
            a head, which would have resulted in a lesser degree of accuracy.

            Doctor Eastwood was re-called and concluded his evidence under cross-
            examination.    His evidence included the removal of barrier 144, the
            introduction of    radial fences   for segregation purposes and the release
            mechanism of the gates in the perimeter fences. The Jury asked the following
            questions:   Q.    Does barrier have specified life span and automatically
            condemned after a period of time? A. No life span as long as continues to
            satisfy and passes load test^of 5 KN. Q. Safe method to repair wrought iron
            with low carbon steel?     A. ' Perfectly legitimate.   No question of marrying
            mild steel playing any part in collapse of barrier.       Q.  Longest period of
            time allowed before random test? A. 5 years. Not allowed to test before 4i
            years, changed to 4 years in 1986, also 5 years cycle to 4 years between
            tests.   Q.  Gradient of tunnel always been? A.       Front part of tunnel wall
            completely rebuilt 1965- Concrete floor renewed 1965-

            The Coroner stated his intentions not to call Police Constable Smith, but to
            read his recollections under Rule 37.

            The following witnesses were called to give evidence.

             Christopher Nicholson          Statistician
             Wilfred Eastwood               Engineer

             Doctor Nicholson was re-called and concluded his evidence under cross-
             examination.   His evidence included the comparison of the examination of
             barrier 128 with barrier 124a and the part corrosion played in the collapse
             of barrier 124A.       His theory of the leaning crowd was questioned in
             comparison to a dynamic crowd, as was the exercise in crowd density which
             was carried out under laboratory conditions.

            Doctor Wilfred Eastwood is a senior partner in the firm of Eastwood
            Engineers. He was appointed in 1978 by Sheffield Wednesday Football Club as
            Consultant Engineer.   He described his duties in an advisory capacity in
            assisting Sheffield Wednesday Football Club preparing the stadium when it
            became a designated ground and required a Safety Certificate. He mentioned
            calculating capacities for sections of the ground and the upgrading to Grade
            A of all barriers.       He referred to plans he had drawn up relocating
            turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end of the ground to provide dedicated
            entrances to individual pens. This scheme was approved by the Working Party
            but was not implemented due to the fire at Bradford Football Club.       The
            resources set aside for this venture were re-directed to fire-proofing the
            South Stand.   He mentioned that he viewed the Leppings Lane terrace as one
            unit.   From correspondence he received, which referred to the pens being
            under the control of the Police, he interpreted this to mean that a Police
            Officer would be at or near the radial gates on match day.

            compassion of what he expected from the Supervisory Officers and what

            Doctor Christopher Nicholson has analysed videos and photographs in
            order to estimate numbers of fans entering the ground through Gate C,
            turnstiles A - G, numbers of fans in pens 3 and 4, the breaking of
            barrier 124A and the testing procedure on barriers.     The maximum total
            figure to enter through Gate C was 2,480 and the maximum total figure to
            enter through turnstiles A - G was 7,644     -   which gave a grand total
            of 10,124. He also prepared a graph to show crowd flow figures through
            the turnstiles and Gate   C. He selected the two best photographs of Pens
            3 and 4. He then prepared an estimated figure from a head count of fans
            in Pen 3, which was 1,576. He suggested that a similar figure should be
            considered for Pen 4.     An estimate of the crowd density showed that it
            was almost 50% over thefigure given in the Green Guide.

            The Jury will be visiting Sheffield Wednesday Football Club next Monday
            or Tuesday in order to orientate themselves with the locations given by
            previous witnesses and to be shown the layout of the Police Control
            Room.

                SUBJECT:        SUMMARY OF INQUEST 19.2.91



                The following witnesses were called to give evidence.

                Graham Henry Mackrell         Club Secretary (Sheffield Wednesday F.C.)
                Douglas John Lock             Security Officer (Sheffield Wednesday F.C.)

                Graham Mackrell was re-called and concluded his evidence under cross-
                examination.   His evidence included facilities for segregation on the
                Spion Kop, media attention on Mr Clough and the fact that the club
                viewed the Leppings Lane terraces globally rather than as pens.

                Douglas Lock was a Superintendent in the South Yorkshire Police between
                1982 and 1985 , when he retired.      During that time he attended at
                football matches played at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and was in
                charge of Ground Control.    He described the method used when planning
                the policing requirement of football matches. He stated that it was the
                responsibility of the Police to monitor crowd density in the pens, the
                manning of gates, the filling of the pens, the blocking of the tunnel
                and the delaying of kick-off.     On retirement he took up the post of
                Security Officer at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club. He mentioned the
                training given to Stewards, the liaison he had with Chief Superintendent
                Mole and the delaying of the kick-off before the 1987 semi-final.     He
                described that except for noticing that the Nottingham Forest fans were
                entering quicker than the Liverpool fans, he saw nothing that caused him
                concern.   He described the situation as it developed after he became
                aware that Gate C had been opened.

                The Coroner has decided that he will not be calling Mr Philips to give
                evidence.

                SUBJECT:    SUMMARY OF INQUEST 15-2.91




                The following witnesses were called to give evidence.

                Stephen Robert Curry        Journalist
                Trevor Higgins              Ex Police Sergeant (South Yorkshire Police)
                Paul Anthony James Eason    Station Officer (Ambulance Services)
                Peter Wells                 Divisional Superintendent
                                            (St. John's Ambulance)

                Stephen Curry is a Journalist for the Daily Express.  He arrived at the
                ground at 2.10pm and made his way to the press box which is situated in
                the upper section of the South Stand, above the players' tunnel,
                arriving at 2.25pm.   He d6scribed the conditions in the Leppings Lane
                terraces from 2.45pm onwards, when he became concerned due to the
                developing situation in Pen 3-

                Ex Police Sergeant Trevor Higgins was a member of Serial 14 at the 1988
                semi-final and was positioned on the concourse area behind the       West
                Stand.   He mentioned that he closed the gates at the entrance to the
                tunnel after receiving a command, the source of which he was unable to
                recollect.  It is now 34 months since that semi-final and as such under
                cross-examination his evidence was tested and he was unable to
                differentiate between his actions at league matches and semi-finals.

                Paul Anthony James Eason, a Station Officer with S.Y.M.A.S., arrived at
                the ground at 2.10pm and took up a position on the perimeter track at
                the corner of the North Stand and the Spion Kop.           He noticed a
                disturbance at the Leppings Lane end of the ground just before 3.05pm
                and together with other ambulancemen he went to that area of the ground.
                He described the situation in that area and the action his Officers took
                in dealing with casualties.

                Peter Wells was a Divisional Superintendent with the St. John's
                Ambulance and was in charge of the St. John's Ambulance personnel at the
                ground on 15 April 1989 . He mentioned that these first aiders were in
                position at all four corners of the ground at 2.15pm.    He mentioned that
                whilst visiting his personnel, he spoke to two female fans in Pen 4 of
                the Leppings Lane end of the ground at about 2.45pm. He saw nothing to
                cause him concern.    He mentioned that at around the time the players
                came onto the pitch, he observed what he initially thought to be a pitch
                invasion at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.      He described how he
                and his personnel became involved in the rescue operation and
                administered first aid to injured fans.

                Alan Keith Seaman                      Assistant Chief Fire Officer


                Stephen Ellis has been the official club photographer for the past
                sixteen seasons.   He took a position at the Leppings Lane end of the
                ground on the perimeter track, near to Gate 5-      He noticed that the
                outer terraces were not very full.   He described the conditions in Pen
                4, the behaviour of the fans and the actions of Police Constable
                Illingworth who was the Police Officer located at Gate 5*

                Trevor Hicks was re-called to clear up a discrepancy with the timings he
                gave in his evidence.   This was clarified without having to enter into
                any further cross-examination.

                Alan Seaman is the Assistant Chief Fire Officer. He gave evidence from
                reports he had read and advice he had obtained from Officers who had
                been members of working parties.      His evidence related to the safe
                ingress and egress from the terraces, the supervision of the radial
                gates and the emergency evacuation procedure.

Mr. Devonside, that is the only question I am going
to ask you about matters of fact. I would like to    ^
just take this opportunity to do something else. I
think you and Mr. Hicks together have taken a leading
part in organising the relatives of the people who
died at the match, is that right? - A. Yes, that is
correct.                                    ,
What has your position been? - A. I have just
recently resigned my position as secretary of the
Group for personal reasons but X was secretary and I
was the elected spokesman of the Group. I shared
that position of spokesman along with Trevor.
Mr. Devonside, I would like to take this opportunity
to say that for all of us who have sat through this
Inquest the common factor which has been obvious to
us all in the relatives and friends who have given
evidence, and also the people who have attended the
Inquest, for all of whom it must have been a very
painful and continuing very painful experience, the
words that come to mind are courage and dignity. I
would like to say that to you in your capacity which
you have just described. — A. Thank you.

And also to say that the grief which you have
suffered is shared by all who have sat through this
Inquest. - A. Thank you.
     THE CORONER:- Mr. Devonside, I am most grateful
to you. I think kr. Payne expressed it very much
better than I could have done. I think that was very
nicely put, if I may say so, Mr. Payne, and I am sure
I would like to have thought I could have done it as
well. - A. May I just have the opportunity of just
saying one thing please? I do not say this with any
criticism in any quarter in any way. I would like to
think that people within Sheffield, specifically
yourself, sir, once the Inquests are over, will try
and put a report together of some kind and
investigate the incidents that happened in and around
the gymnasium and the effect that it had on people in
the way that they were treated on that evening. If
society is to learn from such a disaster we need to
get together on this and I would like to think that
you and other people would grasp that opportunity.

          lives, but further back fans appeared alright.    He mentioned seeing fans
          five to six rows back climbing over the bodies of those in front.       He
          assisted a young lad with a broken arm from the pen. When the pen cleared

              The following witnesses gave evidence at the Inquest.

              Superintendent Roger Marshall      Police Officer (South Yorkshire Police)
              Trevor Hicks                        Liverpool Supporter

              Jeffrey Rex                         Liverpool Supporter

              Superintendent    Marshall   continued    giving   evidence  under   cross-
              examination by Mr Isaacs, for Chief Superintendent Duckenfield.          He
              asked    questions    relating   to    crowd    behaviour,  C.C.T.V.    and
              communications with Ground Control.      Mr Hale asked questions relating
              to Lord Justice Taylor's recommendations, behaviour of fans, using
              barriers and cordons and mounted Officers to control and direct crowds
              and their effect.    The Coroner concluded by asking questions relating
              to crowd figures and the effect delaying kick-off would have on fans
              outside.

              Trevor Hicks, with his wife Jennifer a n d daughters Victoria and Sarah,
              travelled to Sheffield by private motor car, arriving at 1.40pm. They
              were in possession of match tickets.     Victoria and Sarah died in the
              tragedy.  They entered the Leppings Lane end of the ground at 1.50pm.
              Trevor, Victoria and Sarah went through the tunnel into Pen 3-
              Jennifer went into the North Stand.       He then went into Pen 1.    He
              described the conditions as they developed in^ Pen 3 and the fans
              becoming distressed and agitated. He mentioned his attempts to attract
              the attention of two Police Officers who were on the steps leading to
              the Ground Control box at separate times, without success.            He
              described going onto the pitch via Gate 1 and finding the bodies of his
              two daughters and the medical assistance given to them. He positively
              identified the first Police Officer he saw as Superintendent Greenwood.
              He was able to make this identification after seeing that Officer in
              the corridor outside the chamber being used by the Lord Justice Taylor
              Inquiry on 30 May 1989-

              Mr Isaacs addressed the Coroner in the absence of the Jury as to the
              Coroner's loss of control over witnesses in relation to restricting
              them to what they saw and heard and not what they thought and their
              opinions. The Coroner accepted these comments.

              Paul Hand travelled to Sheffield by private motor car, arriving at 12
              noon.  After visiting licensed premises, he went to the Leppings Lane
              end of the ground, arriving at 1.15pm. He e n t e r e d the groun    roug a
              turnstile and went through the tunnel into Pen 3-          He described the
              conditions in the pen as they deteriorated.       He mentioned seeing two
              girls in front of him. One was supporting the other, who had fainted.
              After a massive surge, he lost sight of the two girls.           These gir
              were Victoria and Sarah Hicks who died in the tragedy.

Shaun Fortune travelled to Sheffield from Bristol by coach, arriving at
1.30pm. He attended immediately at the ground, which he entered by the
turnstile at the Leppings Lane end of the ground, at 1.35pm- He went
through the tunnel and into Pen 3 - He described the conditions in that
pen as they deteriorated.   He mentioned seeing two girls in front of
him, one in a distressed condition.   After an almighty surge, he lost
sight of the two girls. These girls were Victoria and Sarah Hicks.

Jeffrey Rex travelled to Sheffield from Bristol by coach, the same
coach as Shaun Fortune.      His evidence was virtually identical to
Fortune's in every respect, including identifying the Hicks girls.

It was noticable that the evidence of Hand, Fortune and Rex progressed
rapidly, taking forty minutes to complete. The hearing, which normally
concludes around 4.00pm, over-ran to 5 .'20pm.    Fortune and Rex had
travelled from Bristol in one vehicle and the Coroner allowed them both
to give evidence in order that they could both return to Bristol
together, eliminating transport difficulties.

Mr Manning, for Superintendent Murray, addressed the Coroner.        He
advised the Coroner that he felt from 4.00pm justice had not been done,
he felt under pressure not to ask questions.

            Superintendent Marshall continued giving his evidence under cross-
            examination by Mr King.    Mr King asked him, "Did you inform Ground
            Control of the large group attending between 2.15pm and 2.30pm?"   The
            Coroner then interrupted and gave Superintendent Marshall a warning
            under Rule 22 of the Coroners Act.    He replied, "I did not, Ground
            Control have video views of Leppings Lane."     Questioning continued,
            covering tannoy messages, delaying the kick-off, the opening of Gates
            A, B and C, entry into pens through the tunnel and what was obvious to
            Ground Commanders and the Ground Control.   Mr Catchpole for Sheffield
            Wednesday Football Club asked questions relating to the Operational
            Order and the filling of pens. Mr Russell for Superintendent Greenwood
            covered the roles of Sector 1 and 2 Commanders and their liaison with
            Ground Control.

            The hearing today was taken up with legal submissions relating to the
            introduction of Superintendent Marshall's voluntary statement and the
            discharge of the Jury.    The interpretation of Rule 37 of the Coroners
            Act was discussed, the direction the Jury should be given in disregard
            to the contents of the voluntary statement.

            It was decided by the Coroner that he would not discharge the Jury, but
            would direct the Jury to totally ignore everything that took place
            during Thursday's hearings.   He would treat the senior Officers as he
            did all the other witnesses and the PACE statements and tapes would not
            be read or heard.    The Coroner addressed the Jury, advising them to
            totally forget all the evidence given yesterday relating to what was
            read, shown or what they saw.   They should ignore entirely from their
            eventual consideration what was said by Superintendent Marshall.

            What Mr King has done is effectively shot himself in the foot as he has
            now been denied access to the PACE statements and videos.

             The following witness was called to give evidence.

             Superintendent Roger Marshall      Police Officer (South Yorkshire Police)

             Superintendent Marshall was called*and advised by the Coroner of his
             rights under Section 22 of the Coroners Act.   Deputy Chief Constable
             Jones read out Superintendent Marshall's recollection and voluntary
             statement.    The video showing his interview by Officers from West
             Midlands Police was shown.

             At the conclusion of the hearing on Tuesday 8 January 1991* in the
             absence of the Jury, the court discussed the introduction of PACE
             statements.   The decision to introduce the statements without editing
             was accepted by all parties.   Please see copy of attached transcript
             relating to this matter.

             After the lunch recess, Mr King addressed the Coroner wishing to bring
             to   his  notice   his  objection   to   the   voluntary  statement   of
             Superintendent Marshall, parts of which were prejudicial to his
             clients' case, the discharge of the Jury because of that fact and the
             fact that the transcript of Superintendent Marshall's evidence at the
             Taylor Inquiry should be read out to the Inquest. The Coroner replied
             that having read the statements he did not exclude them because Mr King
             may say that we have missed something or supressed something.    He did
             not intend to discharge the Jury, but should Mr King decide on a
             judicial review over this matter, an early hearing rather than at the
             end would save time and money should a re-trialbe necessary.          It
             should be noted that the remainder of the Counsels did not support his
             request for the Jury to be discharged.     Mr Hale informed the Coroner
             that he had no objection to the Taylor transcript being read out at the
             Inquest.

             On Friday 11 January      1991.   there   will   be       legal    submissions   in the
             absence of the Jury.

Q. When was the first semi-final that you worked in that
   position, do you know? - A. No, I could not remember.
Q. I think you said that you were surprised* to learn that
   there were two entrances into the stand? - A. Yes, you
   see we only go there for semi-final matches. We are
   outside the ground normally.
Q. Are you a fan yourself? - A. Yes.
Q. Where do you normally stand or sit when you go and
   watch? Are you a Sheffield fan? - A. Yes.
Q. Where do you normally go? - A. North Stand.
Q. So you really had no occasion to examine this stand? -
   A. None at all, no.
Q. Mr. Wood, thank you very much.
               (In the absence of the J ur y )
       THE CORONER:   What I wanted to mention was this:
  in fact, it was Hr. Payne's instructing solicitors who
  wrote to me with a comment which had half crossed my
  mind once or twice, but I had not pursued it, and 1
  have not yet taken a decision on it, but I thought 1
  ought to put it to you so that you can think about it,
  in case you wanted to make any comment or submission on
  it.
       The point that they raised was this. As you know,
  there are several people who have made PACE statements,
  and these in quite a few cases are exceedingly lengthy
  - we are talking about hours, perhaps more than that to
  hear them. The point which has been put to me is this
  - normally speaking these are, of course, read as we
  already explored ad nauseam in a sense, right at the
  beginning, and that is the reason why I wanted to deal
  with them in the same sort of way.
       The point that has been,<made to me is that if, in
  fact, the witnesses who have given the PACE statements,
  are in fact prepared to answer substantially all the
  questions which are put to them, would it be economical
  of time if instead of listening to the PACE statements
  first we listened to the witnesses, and in in the event
  we had heard everything we needed to hear, we could
  then dispense with the statement.
       Of course, the witnesses would have to be warned
  from time to time about incriminating remarks, or they
  may have to be warned, I don't know - it just depends
  what questions they are asked - and it may be that they
                                                    104




.will wish to exercise that right. If they do then we
either have to take a decision that we do need to
 listen to all the PACE statement, or maybe only that
part of the PACE statement which deals Uith that aspect
of the matter on which they have exercised their
rights, or at the end of the day we say no, we have got
to listen to them anyway.
     Now I, as I say, have not made up my mind on this
matter yet, but I thought that before I take a decision
on this matter it is only right and proper that I
should alert you to it so that you can think about it,
and if, particularly if. you don't like the idea then
please say so. You don t have to say so now because
you may want to think about it overnight and we can
deal with it tomorrow.




              From my point of view
                                                     105


From my point of vi'ew it makes no difference because
whether we are here another five or six days does not
matter to me personally because if I am not sitting here
then I am probably sitting down the road and so it does not
make any difference to me but, on the other hand, we do not
want to waste time if we can find ways of achieving it.
    MR. KING: My immediate reaction would be to be against
the proposal, sir. I would obviously-consider it but until
one hears the PACE statement one does not know what is in
it.
     THE CORONER:   I realise that.
     MR. KING:   It can be very crucially important in the
light of the right of the witness to refuse to answer the
question in this forum that one should know it in advance
in the normal way. I see no advantage in doing it the
other way.
     THE CORONER:   As I say, please do not misinterpret
this, but I think this was a proposal put forward - and I
have accepted it in that way - as a genuine attempt to try
and help the Coroner's Court in dealing with these matters.
I am willing to listen and this is the whole reason why I
mention it.
     MR. MANNING:   I represent a person who has made a
Police and Criminal Evidence Act statement. I would find
it impossible to try and deal with the situation where, for
example, a witness was being asked a question and he very
properly said that that was not a question he should be
obliged to answer and that you then tried to take a bit of
the Police and Criminal Evidence Act statement, as it were,
saying, "This in any event can by read out". It is my very
firm view that the only way to deal with a PACE statement
is for it to be in totality before the Jury. I do not
think there is any differing view from that and I think it
would be endangering upon a miscarriage of justice for it
to be in any way edited by anybody and I say that with the
greatest respect to you, sir. On that basis there is
agreement upon your initial rilling as to the way in which
matters had to come before this Inquest, that you would
cause the statements to be read.
      The only questions that then arise are, should the
 Officer who took the statement be the person who read it,
 should the tape of the interview actually be played because
 it is a contemporaneous tape or should we go further than
 the Police and Criminal Evidence Act ordinarily provides
 and let the Jury see the interview being conducted and the
 answers able to be visualised as well as heard, namely to
 play the video tape? I have reservations about the last
 matter because I would not want, for. example, a Jury to
 think that because I had my jacket off at the time, that I
■may have smiled, that I may have nudged a client or that I
 may have stopped a particular question, to draw any adverse
 inference and what I personally would like, although I
 appreciate you are ultimatelyfthe person who would make the
                                                     106


ruling, is that I would like the oppbrtunity to actually
see what it looks like if it is in your mind to actually
play the audio tape and the visual tape together and to
have that opportunity. That I know is a different point.
     THE CORONER:   It is a different point, yes.
     MR. MANNING: Of course, it is a different point but
it touches on those matters which you ha<re done. I agree,
and it is no surprise that I agree, with Mr. King but
perhaps for a very different reason that it is undesirable
in the extreme to do anything other than hear it from top
to bottom and I think it should be heard first because it
may very well save the necessity for anything else or it
may very well make a question' unnecessary which might have
been asked and for which an objection would be taken, and
it would be quite clear to see that that question could not
possibly be asked. At the end of the day, and I am sure
you have already hinted at this, time is the important
feature of this Inquest, an important Inquest, to determine
how and if it takes a day or so longer or even five days
longer because we have got to listen to five lengthy
statements, well then so be it.
     THE CORONER:   Mr. Hale, did you want to say
something?
     MR. HALE:   All I would say, sir, is that I have an
ambivalent attitude towards it. My client's statement, as
you are probably aware, consists of two lengthy written
statements in addition to the audio and visual. As to
those, I have no idea how they will come out and if you
were to ask me to say am I in favour or not I would say I
have no idea. I would have to wait and see. I am entirely
ambivalent on that and if you wish to do it then I am happy
to go along with that. If you wish to adopt the
alternative I would be happy*to go along with that, largely
because we all know a great deal more now than when those
statements were taken and I have no doubt there will be a
lot of repetition and stuff that we know so much about that
time could have been saved but I will go along with
whatever is the consensus view.
     THE CORONER:   I have heard what you said. As you
know my initial feeling is that I want to play these. I am
conscious of the time. As I say, it does not affect me but
I know that it affects everybody else and it is an
exceedingly expensive business, time is, and I am conscious
of that as well but in the final analysis, as you     say,
whether we spend another five days bearing inmind the
amount of time we have already spent is in the end neither
here nor there. I will sleep on it tonight and make up my
mind on it tomorrow morning. I will then say what I think
on it. I do want to make it quite clear, and Mr.      Payneyou
will realise why I say this, that I have read the     letterof
course because it was addressed to my Officer and it was
perfectly clear to me that the suggestion was an entirely
helpful one and not in any way to try and avoid evidence
                                                    107



being put before the Jury. I have n6*doubt whatever about
that and I want it clearly understood.
     MR. PAYNE:    Thank you.
     MR. HALE: Could I just add one thing, sir? I am not
as young as I used to be. I am going deaf. I am quite
aware of that. If the statements are to be read out, would
it be possible to have them read out by somebody with a
strong and clear voice?
     THE CORONER:   No, I do not want them read out, may I
say, because they are going to be played?
     MR. HALE:   There are quite extensive written parts,
certainly in my client's statement.
                                *
     THE CORONER:   Fair enough. If there is anything
which is not viva voce, so to speak, then I accept we will
try and get somebody to read it who is audible and whose
diction is reasonably clear. Can I come back to your
point, Mr. Maiming?
    MR. MANNING:     Yes.
     THE CORONER:   The position with regard to the format
in which they are going to be used, technically the only
PACE statement there is is the audio tape. That is the
procedure under which the statement is taken and if one
wants to be a purist then that is what we need to listen
to, the audio tape. Now it happens that in some of the
cases, not all, the proceedings were also video-ed. You
know that and I know it but nobody else knows it and the
Jury certainly do not know who was video-ed and who was
not. The videoing was done by consent of the people who
agreed and on the understanding it would only be used if
the person agreed for it to be used.
     If anybody who was video-ed says, "On reflection I
don't want the video to be used" then that is the end of
the story. There is no question of it being shown against
their wishes, bearing in mind that the Jury do not know who
we are talking about and that there are some who were not
video-ed - and I will be making this clear to the Jury so
that no adverse inferences are drawn from those that are
on audio and those who are on video - in those cases where
the person consents to the video being used then I prefer
to use the video. The main reason is because on the whole
we are all used to watching TV now and it is infinitely
easier to actually take in what was being said when we can
see a picture.
     It also has, if you like, a spin off effect which is
not really relevant to this Inquest but you know as well as
I do that one is beginning to talk about videoing
procedures and if there is somebody willing to agree to it
then it is a golden opportunity for somebody to actually
see how it works. That is not the reason why we are doing
it. I just say that as an aside. I do want to make it
                                                      108


absolutely crystal 'clear that any paH:y who has given a
PACE statement and who had agreed to having it video-ed
(and I am not saying who they are) and who feels he does
not wish that video to be played then that will be done.
They cannot object to the audio tape but they can object to
the video tape and they are entitled to do that. No
criticism will be made of that in any shape or form. I
hopethat reassures you a little bit.      ^
     MR. MANNING: It does, sir, and one of the
considerations you will have to take on board is whether it
will in any way influence the Jury that they have seen some
people on film and they have heard other statements. That
is a matter entirely for you.
     THE CORONER:   Yes.
     MR. MANNING: What concerns me, and I do not in any
way seek to be flippant about it,      is that    there are stars
of stage and there are stars of screen. There are those
who can do radio and those who look awful on television.
What I would not want to happfen is in my particular case,
and I put my cards on the table immediately, my client was
one of the people who agreed at that stage to be video-ed,
for there to be anything to his prejudice in anything which
occurred either from him or indeed from the interviewing
Officer which is to his detriment and that is why I said I
would welcome the opportunity of actually seeing them.
     THE CORONER:   I will think about that.
     MR. MANNING:   I have not actually been provided with
a copy.
     MR. HALE: I was going to say, sir, it is surprising
if my friend has not had a copy. I certainly have had a
copy of the interviews and have seen them.
     THE CORONER:   We will look into that.
     MR. MANNING:   Historically, sir, it may be
interesting in your reflection to know it thatwhen it was
put to me that the Police in their interview wanted to use
the usual two concurrent tapes and also wanted to use the
video camera, the reason that was advanced for that was
that there would perhaps one or two occasions during the
course of the interview that they would want to refer to
something themselves on a television screen via video, in
other words, "Will you look at this particular incident
occurring?" which is very difficult to come over on a tape
and, therefore, would be easier to record on a video film.
     THE CORONER:   I was not there.
     MR. MANNING: I make that remark because Iwasthere
and I wondered whether it would be within your knowledge or
not, but again it is just something else to add to the fund
of knowledge being gathered. .
                                                       109


     THE CORONER: 'When I say it is *hot within my
knowledge, it is certainly not within my recollection. Hr.
Beechey will see you and you can have a look at it. As I
say, we do not want to prejudice people unfairly. If there
is prejudice in what was said or what was done that is bad
luck, if you like, but nothing unfair so far as we can
avoid it.

      Just a small aside on the question of editing, and not
listening to the whole of the PACE statement. It is
possible to do because I have done it on occasions when i
do RTAs and I may say that there are pages and pages of
stuff on say minor offences or even on other offences which
have got nothing whatever to do with the Inquest and I do
not say we will listen to every single word of it but in
this particular instance it would be exceeding difficult to
in fact lead pencil it without getting into terrible
trouble.

     MR. MANNING:   I absolutely agree.   I think these
statements ought to be read intotality.
     THE CORONER:   I think ifwe are reading them then I
agree with you that we are reading them as they are. Is
there anything else we want todo? I am most grateful to
you, gentlemen and ladies.   Wei will meet tomorrow at ten
o'clock.

            SUBJECT:   SUMMARY OF INQUEST 9 .1 -9 1



            The following witnesses were called to give evidence.

            Jonathan Grant             Liverpool F.C.   Supporter
            Alfred Langley             Liverpool F.C.   Supporter
            Michael Hollinhurst        Liverpool F.C.   Supporter
            Leslie Campbell            Liverpool F.C.   Supporter
            Derek Richards             Liverpool F.C.   Supporter
            Norman Langley             Coach Driver

            Jonathan Grant, with friends, travelled to       Sheffield by     privatemotor
            car, arriving at 12 noon.    They entered a public house and consumed 2
            pints, leaving about 1.00pm.    They parked their vehicle nearer to the
            ground and visited another public house nearby, consuming a further 4
            pints, leaving about 2.15pm.   They arrived at the Leppings Lane end of
            the ground at 2.30pm.     Grant described the conditions outside the
            Leppings Lane turnstiles area and the behaviour of the fans.         He
            mentioned entering the ground through Gate B and going through the
            tunnel into Pen 4.    He described the conditions in that pen and the
            distressed condition of a male nearby. He mentioned fans climbing the
            perimeter fence and being pushed back by Police Officers.

            Alfred Langley, with friends, travelled to      Sheffield by      privatemotor
            car, arriving at 12.45pm. They arrived at the Leppings Lane end of the
            ground at 12.55pm, entering through a turnstile. They went through the
            tunnel into Pen 4.    Langley described the conditions in that pen and
            how they deteriorated as kick-off time approached.     He mentioned the
            distressed condition of a fan who was crushed against a barrier and of
            a Police Officer who was hitting the hands of fans attempting to climb
            over the perimeter fence. They left the pen via the tunnel at 4.00pm.

            Michael Hollinhurst travelled to Sheffield by private motor car,
            arriving at 2.15pm.  He arrived at the Leppings Lane end of the ground
            at 2.25pm.    He described the conditions outside the Leppings Lane
            turnstiles area and the behaviour of the fans.    He entered the ground
            via a turnstile and went into Pen 4.     He described the condition in
            that pen, of fans climbing into the West Stand and of a body of a young
            fan lying on the ground in the pen.     Due to the crush, he estimates
            that it was ten minutes before he was able to check the condition of
            the fan. This fan was Paul Carlisle who died in the tragedy.

            Leslie Campbell, with a friend, travelled to Sheffield by private motor
            car, arriving at 2.20pm. En route to the ground he consumed sandwiches
            and a couple of cans of beer.        Campbell mentioned seeing Police
            Officers checking fans near to the railway station at Wadsley Bridge
            who were drinking and carrying cans. They arrived in Leppings Lane and
            Campbell described the conditions outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles,

    SUMMARY OF INQUEST 9.1*91



    the behaviour   of the fans and the action taken by Police Officers at
    that location.   They entered the ground through Gate C and went along
    the tunnel, where he was forced by the pressure’of fans into Pen 4. He
    described the conditions in that pen, the distress of some of the fans,
    one of which    he felt had stopped breathing.   This fan was Stephen
    Robinson who died in the tragedy, .i He noticed fans being helped over
    the perimeter fence. He left the pen via the tunnel.

    Derek Richards, with friends, travelled to Sheffield by coach, arriving
    at 2.15pra.     En route the coach stopped at licensed     premises at
    Barnsley, at 12.35pm, where Richards consumed food and four Pernod and
    Lemonades, continuing the journey at 1.45pm. They arrived in Leppings
    Lane and Richards described the conditions outside the Leppings Lane
    turnstiles, the behaviour of the fans and the action of the Police at
    that 'location.  Richards entered the ground through Gate C and went
    through the tunnel into Pen 3-     He described the conditions in that
    pen, the distress of some of the fans.    He noticed fans climbing over
    the perimeter fence. He left the pen via the tunnel.

    Norman Langley is a coach driver for Selwins, a company used to convey
    fans to Sheffield on 15 April 1989- This coach arrived in Sheffield at
    1.55pm.   He mentioned Police Officers in Halifax Road, checking fans.
    He arrived in Leppings Lane at 2.40pm and described the conditions
    outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles and the actions of the Police at
    that location. He entered the ground through Gate C and went into the
    tunnel towards the terrace.   Part way along the tunnel he felt force
    behind him which propelled him into a pen. He remembered falling over
    and getting up on a number of occasions.     On the final occasion he
    became aware of a body of a fan underneath him. As Langley was being
    assisted to his feet, the pressure eased in the pen and together with a
    Police Officer he attempted to resuscitate that fan.      This fan was
    Christopher Traynor who died in the tragedy.            Langley became
    unconscious and found he was on the pitch when he recovered
    consciousness.   He is unsure of which pen he was in, however Traynor
    has been identified as being in Pen 3-

            The following witnesses were called to give evidence.

            David Butler         Police Officer (South Yorkshire Police)
            Ian Crawford         Liverpool F.C. Supporter
            Brian Anderson       Liverpool F.C. Supporter
            Karl Mallee          Liverpool F.C. Supporter
            Geoffrey Bridson     Liverpool F.C. 'Supporter
            Andrew Dodd          Liverpool F.C. Supporter
            Eric Wood             Programme Seller

            David Butler   was re-called in an attempt    to identify the female he
            referred to     during yesterday's hearing.   He was unable to assist
            further.

            Ian Crawford, with friends, including Alan Johnson, travelled to
            Sheffield by mini-coach, arriving at 12 noon.    They were in possession
            of match tickets.    Alan Johnson died in the tragedy.      They visited
            licensed premises at Oughtibridge until 2.00pm.     They arrived at the
            Leppings Lane end of the ground at about 2.25pm. Ian Crawford described
            the behaviour of fans outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles and the
            action taken by Police Officers at that location. He mentioned entering
            the ground through Gate C (first opening) and going through the tunnel
            into Pen 3.      He described the conditions in that pen,    injuries he
            received and his rescue.

            Brian Anderson, with his father, John Anderson, travelled to Sheffield
            by private car, arriving at 1.00pm.      They were in possession of match
            tickets.  Between 1.30pm and 2.15pm they were in The Travellers public
            house. They arrived at the Leppings Lane end of the ground at about

         The following witnesses were called to give evidence.

         Richard Beasley        Steward (Sheffield Wednesday F.C.)
         Ruth Cobb              Police Officer (South Yorkshire Police)

         Stephen Brown          Police Constable (West Midlands Police)

         Richard Beasley has been a steward for 9 years. On 15 April 1990 he was a
         gatemarl on Gate C at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.     He mentioned
         his duties on that day and compared the crowd behaviour with the 1988
         semi-final. He mentioned the opening of Gate Cseveral times, once on the
         instructions of InspectorWhite.   He described the gates swaying, a bang
         on the door and tickets being thrown into the turnstile area from inside
         the ground. The Jury questioned him on fans without tickets attempting to
         enter the ground, in comparison to the 1988 semi-final. The Coroner asked
         Beasley about directing the crowd who came in when Gate C opened.        He
         replied, "Had he been asked, he could have.” The Coroner asked why did
         you have to wait to be asked?       He replied, "Basically because I was
         frightened."    He mentioned one fan coming out of the tunnel onto the
         concourse, who said, "There's going to be another Hysel here."

         Ruth Cobb was a member of Serial 34, whose duties were coach reception at
         Claywheels Lane.     She described her duties there, checking fans for
         prohibited articles and the condition of the fans, some being happy drunk.
         She mentioned several groups of 7 - 8 fans apparently without tickets
         asking for 'spares'.    She was surprised to see large crowds still making
         their way to the ground at 3.15pm.    The Jury asked what instructions she
         had received regarding ticketless fans. She replied that she advised fans
         that they would not get into the ground without a ticket.

         Police Sergeant Christopher Watson is a Police           horseman with the
         Nottingham Police.    On 15 April lf989 he was working with the South
         Yorkshire Police horsemen at the Penistone Road North end of the ground.
         Together with other horsemen, he went to the Leppings Lane end, via the
         rear of the South Stand.    He described the scene aschaotic, there being
         approximately 2,000 - 3.000 fans, most of them         pushing outside the
         turnstile area.   He mentioned the crowd density and the steps he took to
         assist in relieving the pressure.    He mentioned Gate C opening and this
         relieved pressure almost immediatelely.

         Detective Superintendent Beechey and Detective Chief Inspector Tope of the
         West Midlands Police gave evidence relating to the taped interview under
         P.A.C.E. of Police Officers, in order to introduce this evidence as and

             Stuart. Thorpe                  Steward

             Brian Ridge has been a steward for 20 years.    On 15 April 1990 he was
             working as a gateman inside Gate B.     He described his duties at that
             location.   He mentioned seeing Police Officers outside the turnstiles,
             checking fans.   He described opening Gate B and about 500 fans entering
             the ground. Some of the fans lost their shoes, but none stayed to search
             for them.

             Malcolm Bain has been a steward for 12 years.     On 15 April 1990 he was
             working as a gateman inside Gate C.      He described his duties at that
             location.  He mentioned 4 - 5 fans'approaching him and offering him cash
             to enter the ground. He described seeing fans pushing and children being
             crushed outside turnstiles A - G, at about 2.45pm       Gate C _was °Pe" ^
             fully for 5 - 1 0 minutes. He heard a roar and all the fans rushed for the
             tunnel.   He made reference to seeing Police Officers blocking off the
             entrance to the tunnel in 1988.     The Coroner, however, questioned him
             regarding the date when the wall dividing the concourse was constructed.
             Bain agreed that the wall was built about 4 years ago and he therefore
             could not have seen the entrance to the tunnel in 1988.

              During the time Bain was giving evidence, Sergeant Griffiths had to order
              the public sector to be quiet, as relatives, especially Devonside,
              laughing in'a contemptuous manner at points of his cross-examination.

              Garratt with friends, arrived in Sheffield at 10.30am, having travelled
              bv private car.  They were in possession of match tickets. They arrived
              in Leppings Lane at 2.00pm, where they entered the ground. They followed
              fans into Pen 3, which was nearly full, but climbed over the radial fence
              into Pen 4, which was relatively empty.     The reason for this was that
              Garratt is only 5'4" tall and could not see the pitch. At 2.50pm, he felt
              uncomfortable in the pen and as a result of surges he was crushed against
              the perimeter fence. He mentioned seeing Police Officers on the perimeter
              track, looking towards the pens. He remembers someone dragging him away
              from the fence and seeing 4 or 5 bodies lying on the ground within the
              pen. He mentioned losing his hearing, sight and not being able to shout.
              He left Pen 4 via the tunnel and <was conveyed to hospital, treated and
              released.

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club. He was located in a booth near to Gate
A at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.    He described the opening of

Stuart Thorpe has been a steward for 27 years and is chief steward in the
West Stand.   He described his duties and those of his stewards in the
Leppings Lane end of the ground. He mentioned seeing fans climbing over a
wall and being caught by Police Officers.    From his vantage point in the
West Stand, he saw fans in the reception area, pushing.      He described,
"All hell broke loose" as fans gained access into the ground through Gate
C.   The fans came upstairs into the seated area and he instructed his
staff not to prevent this.   He mentioned that no stewards were posted in
pens as he believed this a dangerous practice, especially if the visiting
team were losing.   The Jury asked Mr Thorpe questions regarding visiting
stewards, their clothing and any duties they performed.

                The following witnesses were called to give evidence.

                Colin Milton                           Turnstile Operator
                Ian Marsh                              Steward - Gateman

                Malcolm France                         Police Sergeant (South Yorkshire Police)
                John Bennett                           C h i e f Inspector (South Y o r k s h ir e   Police)
                M a l c o l m Cob b                    Stew a rd - Gateman

                Colin Milton was re-called in order that Mrs McBrien could ask him further
                questions.   These related to holders of tickets for the Spion Kop being
                given access to the Leppings Lane terraces.      He stated that a Police
                Officer gave him instructions to allow this to happen, but is unable to
                identify him.

                Ian Marsh has been a steward for 4 years.     On 15 April 1989 he was the
                gateman on Gate C.   He described the stewards' briefing and his duties.
                He mentioned the first opening of Gate C to allow a fan to be ejected and
                probably 40 or more fans entered the ground before they were able to
                safely close the gate.    He thought prior to the second occasion Gate C
                opened, if the gate had not opened people would die due to the crushing by
                the huge volume of fans outside.      On the second occasion, Gate C was
                opened by Police for five minutes and the fans walked through the open
                gate and headed towards the tunnel. On the final occasion Gate C opened,
                fans who entered had their match tickets checked by the stewards.

                Police Constable Andrew Best was a member of Serial 16, under Police
                Sergeant Payne, and was positioned outside turnstile G in the A - G
                complex of Leppings Lane.   He described the build-up of fans outside the
                turnstiles as being very quick between 2.20pm and 2.40pm.     He mentioned
                fans arriving at the Leppings Lane turnstiles without match tickets,
                tickets for the Spion Kop and thosfc offering cash to gain entrance. Some
                of the fans were drunk, some had obviously been drinking and some were
                still drinking. He mentioned assisting two children, who were distressed,
                from the crowd outside turnstiles A - G. He mentioned arresting a fan who
                was drunk and taking him to the Police Room.        On his return to the
                concourse area behind the West Stand, he described assisting other Police
                Officers and fans in removing injured fans and bodies from the tunnel
                area.

                Police Constable Malcolm France was in charge of Serial 36, under
                Inspector Ellis.   He described his duties as train reception at Wadsley
                Bridge Station and escorting the fans to the Leppings Lane end of the
                ground. He mentioned fans without tickets and fans walking away from the
                ground enquiring about local public houses.     He assisted in forming a
                cordon with the Police horsemen, but after hearing a cheer from inside the
                ground he felt a great surge and the cordon fragmented.       He mentioned
                nqticing the Landrover arrive and hearing messages transmitted from the
                loudspeaker, requesting fans to keep back.   After pressure decreased, he
                mentioned entering the ground and described his action near to Gate 4 of
                the Leppings Lane enclosure.

                SUBJECT:        SUMMARY OF INQUEST 14.12.90



                The following witnesses were called to give evidence.

                Lionel Proctor                        Police Sergeant (South Yorkshire Police)
                David Scholey                         Police Officer (South Yorkshire Police)
                Alistair Taylor                       Police Officer (South Yorkshire Police)

                Police Sergeant Proctor was a member of Serial 19, under Inspector Sykes,
                and was positioned in the reception area, outside the perimeter gates at
                the Leppings Lane end of the ground.     He described the scene outside the
                gates in relation to ticketless fans, fans carrying Cans of alcohol and the
                sudden arrival of a swarm of fans.       He mentioned that he attempted to
                control the pressure on the turnstiles by closing the perimeter gates. He
                was later joined by Police Constable Scholey.     This created a gap between
                the gates and the turnstiles but not easing the pressure as those at the
                rear of the turnstiles queue continued pushing.        Pressure of the crowd
                forced the perimeter gates open, damaging the bolt securing the gate into
                the tarmac.   He saw Gate C open and pressure released.     He went into Gate
                A, into the North Stand, and saw what he thought was a pitch invasion.
                When he realised the situation, he assisted the .'walking wounded'.

                Police Constable Scholey was a member of Serial 19,    under Police Sergeant
                Proctor.   His description of events are almost identical to Police Sergeant
                Proctor's.    His evidence only differs when on entering the ground, he
                entered Pen 2 and caused fans to pass the bodies over the fence to him.

                Police Constable Taylor was a member of Serial 16,   under Police Sergeant
                Payne, and was positioned outside the section of turnstiles marked A - G.
                At 2.15pm he was required to leave that location and escort a fan who
                wished to report the theft of his match ticket to the Gymnasium for C.I.D.
                to complete the necessary reports. The circumstances were that the ticket
                was snatched from the fan's hand.    He described the crowd build-up, the
                fans without tickets, fans who smelled strongly of alcohol and those with
                tickets for the Spion Kop. He mentioned holding one of the perimeter gates
                closed, but the crowd pressure forced it open. The crowd then disappeared
                through Gate C. He went into the ground, onto the pitch and assisted with
                injured fans.

                At the     conclusion   of   the   evidence,   the   Jury was shown the compilation
                video.

                The following witnesses were called to give evidence.

                Stephen Copeland               Turnstile Operator
                Colin Milton                   Turnstile Operator

                Graham Wright                  Police Officer (South Yorkshire Police)

                Stephen Copeland has been a turnstile operator since 1984.     On 15 April
                1989 he was working in turnstile F in the A - G complex of Leppings Lane.
                His description of the situation is similar to the other turnstile
                operators in relation to crowd behaviour and verbal abuse. He mentioned
                fans offering him cash and tickets for the Spion Kop end in order to gain
                entry into the ground. He estimated between 30 - 50 fans offering him cash
                to enter the ground.

                Colin Milton has been a turnstile operator for six years. On 15 April 1989
                he was working in turnstile G in the A - G complex of Leppings Lane. His
                description of the situation is similar to the other turnstile operators.
                He mentioned fans offering him cash and tickets for the Spion Kop end in
                order to gain entry into the ground.    He estimated about 20 fans offered
                him cash to enter the ground.

                Police Constable Buxton was the driver of the Police Landrover on 15 April
                1989. He described his duties on that date, his attending at the Leppings
                Lane end of the ground and the crowd of fans outside the turnstiles.     He
                mentioned using the P.A. system in an attempt to stop the fans from pushing
                forward and crushing those fans at the front.     He referred to his radio
                messages to Ground Control for the kick-off to be delayed but the reply
                from Police Sergeant Goddard was, "too late".     He mentioned Gate C must
                have opened because the crowd began to disappear.   His first impression on
                entering the ground was that it was a pitch invasion by the Liverpool fans.
                He described his role on the playing area as assisting in the removal of
                bodies from Pen 3.

                Police Constable Graham Wright was a member of Serial 16, under Sergeant
                Payne, and was positioned outside turnstile G in the section of turnstiles
                marked A - G.   He described his duties at that location and the action of
                other Officers in the vicinity. He mentioned being passed a young child by
                Inspector Purdy and taking the child into the ground through Gate C to the
                First Aid room set up in the concourse area. He noticed that the crowd in
                the turnstile area had subsided.   He mentioned going round into the South
                Stand and his first impression was that it was a pitch invasion.         He
                described going to the perimeter fence of Pen 3 and assisting in the rescue
                of injured and dead fans.

         Neil Laycock           T u r n s t i l e Operator

         Police Constable Kerry is a Police horseman with the Nottingham Police.
         On 15 April 1989 he was working with the South Yorkshire Police horsemen
         at the" Penistone Road North end of the ground. Together with other Police
         horsemen he went to the Leppings Lane end via the rear of the South Stand.
         He described the fans’ behaviour relating to pushing from the rear of the
         crowd, ignoring instructions given by Police Officers on horseback and the
         opening of Gate C. He described similar experiences involving pushing and
         pressure by late arrivals in a larger turnstile area at the Nottingham
         Forest ground.

         Albert Rhodes has been a turnstile operator for the last ten seasons. On
         15 April 1989 he was working in turnstile C in the A - G complex of
         Leppings Lane.   He described the build-up of fans about 2.30pm and the
         fans’ condition on entering the turnstile - distressed, crying and
         suffering from the effects of crushing.   He mentioned fans attempting to
         enter the ground without tickets (final figure 30 - 40) sneaking in. He
         described the condition of some of the fans entering the ground in various
         degrees of drunkenness.

         David Lackey, with friends, arrived in Sheffieldat 2.00pm, having
         travelled by train. None were in possession of match tickets. They were
         escorted to Leppings Lane, where they attempted to purchase match tickets.
         He did not see any fans drinking or drunk. They were unable to purchase
         tickets and were moved away by Police Officers on horseback. They waited
         on the bridge. He saw the Landrover arrive and instructions were given to
         Police horsemen to form a cordon.       He saw a concertina gate open and
         entered the ground    with hisfriends. They walked      down the tunnel and
         entered Pen 3.    He was not concerned with the pen being full.       He was
         carried forward by a sudden unexpected push, ending up near to the “ *ont
         of the pen.   He felt a couple more surges, the pressure increased and he
         was in fear   for his life. He saw Gate 3 open and a couple of fans go into
         the playing   area. He saw one lad pushed back into the enclosure. Hethen
         saw a Police Officer standing on boards, shouting for fans to push back
         and Gate 3    opened a second time anifl fans entered the playing area.   He
         noticed that there were fans coming from behind him and getting out.       e
         left the pen via the tunnel.    The Jury asked him if he saw any barriers
         break, he replied, ”No."



         complex of Leppings Lane. He mentioned being offered cash and tickets for
         the Kop end .in order to gain e n t r y into the ground. He described crowd
         flow, crowd behaviour, the aggression and Police Officers in the area of
         the turnstiles.
SUMMARY OF INQUEST 12.12.90



Jason Smith has only been a turnstile operator for a couple of seasons.
On 15 April 1989 he was working in turnstiles *in the A - G complex of
Leppings Lane. His description of the situation is similar to Ludlam. Up
to 2.30pm he had taken 700 tickets.  Due to the pressure, he allowed fans
through.    He mentioned approximately 150 fans gained entry without
tickets.

Neil Laycock is a part-time turnstile operator.  On 15 April 1989 he was
working in turnstile No. 5 In the North Stand complex of Leppings Lane.
His description of the situation is similar to the other turnstile
operators. He estimated approximately 30 fans attempting to enter without
tickets and literally hundreds with tickets for Penistone Road North end
of the ground.

Mr Payne addressed the Coroner.    He expressed concern of the fact that
certain Counsels were including disguised speech in their questioning of
witnesses.   This, I believe, was directed against Mr King.    The final
decision was that there would be no disguised speeches and evidence of
opinions to be directed at experts only.

Mr King addressed the Coroner.  He attempted to persuade the Coroner to
allow information of medical conditions of witnesses (i.e. this witness
injured or suffered trauma etc) to be made known to the Jury.  This was
denied as the Coroner did not want the Jury to be swayed by emotion and
sympathy.

After the court had closed, West M idlands Polic e pro d u ce d a v i d e o tape
which South Yorkshire Police T r a ff i c Off i ce r s had taken on the mobile
video and showed litter on the route from W o o d h e a d and the Snake Pass to

            Stephen Thomas

            Police Constable Wilson was re-called and concluded her evidence under
            cross-examination.     She   was questioned ^ r d i n g briefing details,
            monitoring fans' arrival, advising the crowd of de:lay      or
            with kick-off, which tended to calm them down, also her ability
            Usages      teing transmitted over  the radio and the Landrover tannoy
            messages.

            Kenneth Rawlinson, with his friends, arrived in Sheffield at 12.30pm.
            They arrived in Leppings Lane at 2.40pm and at 2.45pm were approximately 3
            to 4 bodies away from the turnstiles A - G. He described the
            very tight.     One of his friends, plus an elderly fan, began having
            difficulty breathing.    They were assisted out of the queue y^ a
            Officer and allowed to enter the ground through Gate C. He waited for h
            friends on the concourse by the entrance to the tunnel.         Ini c p o b s
            examination he stated the natural flow caused him to go to the tunnel         He
            went into the tunnel, saw it w a s blocked, came out and went to.Pen 1,
            which was also full. Whilst making his way to Pen 6 he saw a gatein the
            fence to North Stand open and he went into the N°rth Stand;
            ttame was   still in progress as he entered the stand and saw fans were

 SUMMARY OF INQUEST 11.12.90




Police Sergeant Thomas is a Police horsemean with the South Yorkshire
Police and worked with Police horsemen from the Merseyside Police on 15
April 1989.    He mentioned his duties at the Leppings Lane end of the
ground, crowd behaviour and up to fifty fans who he believed to have
attended without tickets.   He described the arrival of fans, the pressure
in the turnstiles area and his action to relieve it by holding a perimeter
gate in the closed position.   He mentioned shouting to the crowds to stop
pushing.    A surge of the fans ‘forced the gate open.       He mentioned
requesting more horsemen to assist at his location, which they did.     He
saw Gate B open for about five minutes.

 Mr Hale, who is representing Superintendent Marshall, has submitted a
 letter and a copy of an extract from The Sheffield Star (Monday 10
 December 1990) which relates to the legal fees being paid for the six
 Police Officers. A copy of the extract is attached hereto.

               The following were called to give evidence.

               Francis Grunnill               Police Officer (Merseyside Police)
               Philip Smith                   Police Sergeant (Merseyside Police)
               Elizabeth Wilson               Police Officer (South Yorkshire Police)

               Police Constable Francis Grunhill is a Police horseman with the Liverpool
               Police.  On 15 April 1989 he was working with the South Yorkshire Police
               horsemen. He mentioned his duties at the Leppings Lane end of the ground
               and described the build-up of fans after 2.45pm.    He described the fans
               behaviour and his appeals to them to stop pushing, which were ignored. He
               mentioned there was an urgency in the fans, brought on by frustration and
               the fact that his horse became agitated with the build-up of pressure from
               these fans, which began to lift it off the ground. He removed his horse
               from the crowd as he was apprehensive that it would injure someone nearby.
               He noticed that those fans at the rear of the crowd could have eased and
               moved back, reducing the pressure.

               Police Sergeant Philip Smith is* a Police horseman with the Liverpool
               Police.   On 15 April 1989 he was working with the South Yorkshire Police
               horsemen. He mentioned his duties at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.
               He described the behaviour of the fans and the build-up of fans at about
               2.20pm.   He mentioned crowd movement through the turnstile was slow. He
               described how he placed his horse across an open perimeter gate to stem
               the flow of fans and his attempt to slow the fans by verbal commands. He
               mentioned noticing thePolice Landrover arrive and also appealing to fans
               to push back.   He sensed the mood of the fans changing and becoming more
               aggressive, turning into agitation.      He compared this match with a
               Liverpool v. Everton local derby at Goodison Park, which was an all ticket
               match and was a sell out, all 40,000 tickets. There were 300 - 350 fans
               without tickets and on four separate occasions they attempted to gain
               entrance by forcing exit gate6. .

               Police Constable Elizabeth Wilson is a Police horsewoman with the South
               Yorkshire Police and worked with Police horsemen from the Merseyside
               Police on 15 April 1989.    She mentioned her duties at the Leppings Lane
               end of the ground, describing crowd behaviour, fans she believed did not
               have match tickets, fans carrying 4 and 6 packs of lager and 2 litre
               bottles of lager, and smelling strongly of intoxicants. She described the
               build-up of fans outside the turnstiles end and being part of a cordon
               formed across the entrance to the turnstiles area. She also described her
               horse being hit by fans, a fan trying to snatch the horse s reins and
               other fans going under the neck, belly and rear of her horse in order to
               get past her.    She formed the impression that kick-off was delayed or
               being considered and conveyed this to the crowd, who eased off. She heard
               a roar from inside the stadium and the crowd began to push again, forcing
               their way past her.

            SUBJECT:.   SUMMARY OF INQUEST 7-12.90


            The following were called to give evidence:

            John Killock          Police Officer (West Midlands Police)
            Ralph Salt            Licensee (The Owl Public House)
            Stephen Fry           Police Officer (Merseyside Police)

            On conclusion of the hearing, on Thursday 6 December 1990, Police Sergeant
            Killock,   West Midlands Police,     gave evidence   in relation to the
            identification of Richard Jones by his father Leslie Jones.   Mr Jones had
            identified his son on BBC video, Map 1, timed at 1456:31:01, in Pen 3 of
            the Leppings Lane terraces.   On Wednesday 28 November 1990, Mr Jones was
            shown a: still photograph of that same identification and is now unsure of
            his original identification. Stephanie Jones, his daughter, gave evidence
            on Tuesday 28 November 1990 and was adamant that she was crushed against
            Gate C before it opened again at 2.59pm, when she gained access to the
            ground with her brother, Richard Jones.

            Ralph Salt is the Licensee of The Owl public house.      He described the
            amount of stock he had on his premises on 15 April 1989.      He mentioned
            that there were one hundred to one hundred and fifty fans inside the
            premises and fifty plus fans on the car park outside the premises. Sales
            for that day totalled £1,192 and he estimated he sold about one thousand
            pints of beer at the lunchtime session.    He referred to a delivery note
            dated 20.4.89 itemising stock he ordered to replace that which was sold on
             15.4.89.

            The Coroner caused Salt to be called as he wanted to get a fair picture of
            events and to clarify evidence given by Ollerenshaw on 20 November 1990.
            It should be noted that the stock Salt ordered on 20.4.89 exceeded that
            which he stated was sold on 15*4.89.

             Police Constable Stephen Fry is a Police horseman with the Liverpool
             Police.  On 15 April 1989 he was working with the South Yorkshire Police
             horsemen. He mentioned his duties at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.
             He described the fans as good humoured and well behaved until about
             2.30pm, when he was requested to return to Leppings Lane turnstiles. The
             area near to turnstiles A - G was full and he positioned himself sideways
             on, blocking one of the perimeter gates effectively, causing a gap to be
             created behind him. He noticed that fans at the rear of the crowd near to
             the turnstiles were still pushing forward.    There was still pressure as
             the crowd increased in front of him outside the perimeter gates.        He
             appealed to the crowd to stop pushing - some did, others continued, some
             squeezing under the horse's belly.     One fan struck his horse on the
             muzz,le.  He had never experienced the determination, pressure, and the
             size and lateness of crowds arriving at the ground.    He was not aware of
             any gate opening, only that pressure began to ease.

             The West Midlands Police compilation tape which was          used at the Lord
             Justice Taylor enquiry was shown to the Jury again.

                SUBJECT:   SUMMARY OF INQUEST 6.12.90




                  The following were called to give evidence.

                  Inspector Gordon   Sykes                      Police   Officer
                  Inspector Robert   Purdy                      Police   Officer

                  Police Constable   Kenneth Horsefield         Police   Officer

                  Inspector Sykes was re-called and concluded his evidence under cross-
                  examination.   After the announcement over the loud-hailer, Gate C opened
                  and the crowd surged through. Superintendent Marshall instructed Officers
                  to enter the ground.   No further information was given and they went into
                  Pen 1 and then into Pen 3 through the tunnel, having to push fans out of
                  the way. He assisted in the recovery of bodies from the terrace onto the
                  concourse. He mentioned that the, fans in the tunnel had no idea what was
                  happening in the pens.     Interest into the evidence relating to ticket
                  touts was made by the Jury in relation to the law. They were advised that
                  there was no specific law against ticket touts but if they were
                  obstructing the highway they would be arrested for that offence.

                 Inspector Purdy was in charge of Sub-Sector 8, with Inspector Sykes. The
                 serials in his Sub-Sector were briefed regarding their duties behind the
                 West Stand by Inspector Sykes. Inspector Purdy described Police Officers
                 on horseback dispersing ticketless fans away from the turnstile area.
                 After 2.00pm the crowd built up rapidly, were volatile and there was great
                 pressure.  He mentioned Police action to control the crowd, which finally
                 resulted in Gate C being opened and the crowd entering the ground.      He
                 later saw the perimeter gate open and Gate C also open.        He heard a
                 message for all Officers to attend on the pitch and entered the ground
                 through Gate C, then with a Sergeant and a Police Constable went to Pen 2
                 via the players' area and began assisting in the removal of bodies from
                 Pen 3.

                 Police Constable Huckstepp was a member of Serial 16, under Inspector
                 Purdy, and was positioned outside turnstiles A and B, in the section of
                 turnstiles marked A to G.    He described his duties relating to searching
                 fans for alcohol and offensive weapons as normal until 2.30pm, when the
                 situation'changed drastically - no longer queues, great mass of people,
                 could not move freely, was being crushed together with other fans who had
                 been behaving perfectly properly.!:, At 2.30pm he saw Police on horseback
                 trying to regulate crowds. He forced his way through the turnstiles into
                 the concourse area and immediately returned to the area outside the
                 turnstiles, through Gate C.      There was severe crushing and fans were
                 distressed near to the turnstiles, caused by sheer volume of fans pushing
                 from behind.    Gate C opened and fans began to stream away from the
                 tiurnstiles and into Gate C.   He heard a request for Officers to go onto
                 the pitch and entered the ground through Gate C and onto the pitch area.

 SUMMARY OF INQUEST 6.12.90




 Police Constable Horsefield was a member‘of ’Serial 16, under Inspector
 Sykes, and was positioned outside turnstiles 9 - 16 in the section of
 turnstiles marked C.   Between 2.00pm and 2.30pm there was a steady stream
 of fans entering the ground.    He spoke to 3 or 4 separate groups of fans,
 who were without tickets.     Between 2.30pm and 2.45pm the enclosure had
 filled up with fans and he was pushed into a corner. He described it as a
 dramatic change, with a sudden rush of fans all appearing at once.     With
 another Police Constable, he made his way to the perimeter gate.          A
 Policeman on horseback halted the crowd whilst he shut a gate and put the
 bolt into the ground.    Fans climbed over the gate.    He was jostled and
 verbally abused by fans who were intent on entering the ground.      He was
 alsb thumped by one fan, which resulted in him having to release the bolt,
 allowing the gate to open. Gate A opened and fans disappeared through it.
 As a result of hearing a verbal message, he entered the ground through the
 turnsiltes and went onto the pitch. Together with Police Sergeant Morgan
 and others, he returned to the concourse and entered Pen 3 through the
 tunnel and assisted carrying several bodies out through the tunnel.

        SUBJECT:    SUMMARY OF INQUEST 5-12.90

        The following were called to give evidence.

        Chief Inspector Robert Creaser                Police Officer
        James McGauley                                Resident
        Inspector Gordon Sykes                        Police Officer

        Chief Inspector Creaser was re-called and concluded his evidence under
        cross-examination.  He was questioned, regarding briefing and instructions to
        other Police Officers in relation to their duties, the chain of command,
        controlling of fans outside the turnstiles, traffic being stopped in
        Leppings Lane, messages transmitted over the tannoy system and Landrover
        loudspeaker, blocking off tunnel, controlling and monitoring the filling of
        pens, fans finding their own level and gates in the radial fences.

        Mr McGauley was re-called and concluded his evidence under cross-
        examination.   This first part of the evidence related to the match between
        Sheffield Wednesday and Manchester United on 11 February 1 9 8 9 . He attended
        this match and saw a large crowd outside Leppings Lane and at 2.45pm decided
        to go to the Kop area of the ground.    Whilst on the Kop he saw fans climb
        from Leppings Lane terraces into the West Stand during the game.        It was
        established that he did not see if the crowd actually entered Leppings Lane
        turnstiles before the kick-off at that match, he did not see the crowd
        outside Leppings Lane turnstiles on 15 April 1989 and therefore could not
        give a comparison between the two matches.

        Inspector Sykes was in charge of Sub-Sector 8, under Chief Inspector
        Creaser.   He described the duties of his serials in relation to searching
        fans for drink, banners and offensive weapons near the turnstiles.     The
        crowd build-up was greater than anticipated and he caused Inspector Hand-
        Davis to form a cordon with horses at about 2.15pm. He also caused traffic
        in Leppings Lane to stop at 2.30pm, due to the build-up of fans, some
        obviously having been drinking.    He saw Inspector Bennett assisting fans
        over the turnstiles wall.     He also saw the Landrover arrive and heard
        messages transmitted from the loud-hailer.  He saw fans at the rear of the
        crowd pushing and also saw Gate A open.

                The following witnesses were called to give evidence.

                Graham Hirst                      Football Supporter   - Liverpool
                Thomas Hilton                     Football Supporter   - Liverpool
                Graham Richardson                 Football Supporter   - Liverpool
                Roger Houston                     Football Supporter   - Liverpool

                Hirst, with a friend, arrived in Sheffield at 2.15pm and both were in
                possession of match tickets.   They joined a large crowd outside Leppings
                Lane perimeter gates and experienced pressure from behind.     They entered
                the ground through Gate C. His match ticket displayed ’B ’ on it and se®inS
                letter B on the left hand side of the tunnel, he entered the tunnel, which
                was packed.   The flow of fans was slow but he had to go with the force of
                people behind. He went into Pen 4 and moved towards the radial fence. The
                pen was packed and he mentioned the worst crushing he had ever experienced.
                He climbed over the radial fence and into Pen 5-

                 Hilton, with a friend, arrived in Sheffield at 2.30pm and saw manyfans,
                 none carrying alcohol. He arrived at Leppings Lane at 2.40pm and many fans
                 arrived at the same time. There were no queues and mass disorder. He saw
                 several Police Officers on horseback, with fans running under the horses.
                 Fans were anxious to get into the ground and the pressure was severe.    He
                 entered the ground through the turnstiles and walked round to Enclosure 2.
                 He then entered Pens 3 and 4 to look for his friend. He was not deterred
                 by the volume of fans in those pens and did not leave the confines of these
                 pens.   He was in Pen 4 when Beardsley hit the cross-bar at about 3.04pm.
                 He climbed the perimeter fence onto the players area.

                 Richardson and his brother arrived in Sheffield at 2.45pm due to hein&
                 delayed by major roadworks.   In Leppings Lane he joined a large group of
                 fans outside the perimeter gates, these opened under the Pressure of fans.
                 He saw Police Officers on horseback, with fans ducking under the horses.
                 He entered the ground through GateT C and headed for the tunnel, as the
                 crowd was going towards it. The tfcnnel was full but he was able to make
                 progres^ with a bit of a push.       He entered Pen 3, which was packed
                 propelled by pressure from behind, ending up behind barrier 124A.       The
                 conditions were terrible and he was unable t o m o v e     He saw a Pol ce
                 Officer on the fence, trying to bend over the spikes at the top. beards y
                 hit the cross-bar, resulting in a biggish surge forward.’ *
                 further movement forward from the crowd in front of him.     He exited from
                 the pen using the tunnel at the rear of the pen.

                 Houson and his son arrived in Sheffield at about 2.30pm, both in Possession
                 of match tickets.   They jogged to the ground a n d saw a steady S     l °f
                 fans leading towards the ground.    He was approached by at least half a
                 dozen teenagers, asking for tickets.     They arrived at Leppings Lane at
                 about 2.35pm. He described the crowd as a large stationary w e d g e H e saw
                 two Police pfficers on horseback at the side of the crowd,

            effective in any way. He experienced the crowd crushing outside Wembley in
            1986, therefore he was reluctant to enter the crowd.          He climbed the
            banking across the road from the turnstiles and observed the crowd's
            behaviour between 2.45pm and 2.55pm.    The Police Landrover arrived and he
            heard a Police Officer on a loud-hailer telling the crowd to "Ease back",
            with no apparent effect. Attempt was made to delay the kick-off, reference
            was also made to 3* 15pm.   Order were also given to Police on horseback to
            get into line, which they did but to no effect.           The gates opened,
            including Gate C, and the crowd entered the ground.      He mentioned Gate A
            also opened.  He entered the ground as 3 - 4 Police Officers were ejecting
            some youths.     He entered the tunnel, which was empty, but natural
            apprehension prevented him from entering the pens.     He saw some fans run,
            charge and they bulldozed their wajjr through the crowd.     He also saw two
            adults come into the tunnel from the terraces, sweating and having
            difficulty breathing.    He could not detect any concern from the line of
            people who were standing in front of him at the entrance to the terraces.
            Whilst in the tunnel he saw the ball hit the cross-bar. He then left the
            tunnel, turned left and walked behind the stand into Pen 1 (by Police
            Control), where he remembers the game being abandoned.

               SUBJECT:   SUMMARY OF INQUEST 30.11.90




               The following witnesses were called to give evidence.

               Simon Ashley Berry               Manchester United Supporter
               James McGordon                   Resident
               Stephen Boardman                 Liverpool Supporter

               Berry travelled to Sheffield with a friend, who is a Liverpool supporter, a
               both had tickets for the Spion Kop.    They arrived in Sheffield at 12.30pm a
               parked near to The Fox public house, where they stayed until 2.30pm. They we
               amongst a thousand plus fans who approached the turnstiles at Leppings Lan
               At 2.40pm they joined a mass of people outside>the perimeter railings a
               worked their way to within 3 or 4 people from the gate, which was secured by
               Police Officer.   At 2.50pm someone at the front said, "Rush the gates." T
               crowd pushed forward from behind. They entered the turnstile area, where th
               were directed through Gate C by Police Officers.        They walked through t
               tunnel into Pen 4, which was crowded but not uncomfortable.         They mov
               directly to the front of the pen.        Conditions changed with surges and
               climbed over the fence onto the pitch.

               McGordon states that between 1.30pm and 2.30pm he was looking out of the fro
               window of his home address.       He "mentioned the flow of fans walking alo
               Wadsley Lane towards the ground increased, but never encroached onto t
               highway.   He did not notice any unruly behaviour and there was no litter
               evidence on this occasion, which was unusual.     Between 2.30pm and 3.00pm h
               only knowledge of outside his home address was a series of glances.

               This particular witness was put forward by one of the families and the Coron<
               adjourned this evidence due to Mr King attempting to introduce evident
               requiring this witness to make a comparison with the match between Sheffie
               Wednesday Football Club and Manchester United Football Club and the semi-fina
               The Coroner intimated that he may well deny Mr King's application to folli
               this line of questioning.

               Boardman travelled by coach with his brother and friend, all of whom were
               possession of match tickets.    There were twenty coaches at Liverpool and th<
               boarded the next to last coach (19), the reason for this being that other fa>
               were pushing to get on the coaches. Their coach was late, having been delay*
               at Liverpool through the Policesearching all       the coaches and confiscati?
               alcohol found thereon. At 2.45pm they arrived atthe Leppings Lane- end and s;
               fans drinking, but well behaved. He saw some Police Officers on horseback ai
               some on foot near to the turnstiles.    He didn't see the Police Landrover, bi
               heard a message, "Stop pushing .... "        He saw injured fans outside tl
               turnstiles so they stood away from the crowd, next to a group of ten people
               the 20 - 30 age group. He heard them say, "Next time they open the gate the
               would get themselves in."    When Gate C opened, Boardman, his brother and hj
               friend entered the ground, as did the other group.         They walked down tl

            Kevin Carroll           Liverpool S u p p orter
            Roger Knowles           Liverpool Supporter
            Matthew Gould           Liverpool S up p orter

            Gillam was engaged on security duties at perimeter railings in Leppings
            Lane. He mentioned seeing 20 - 30 fans hanging around near to the bridge,
            who appeared to be without tickets.    He noticed large influx of fans at
            about 2.00pm and mentioned actions of Police Officers in the area.

            Carroll arrived in Sheffield at 2.00pm with two friends, all of whom were
            in possession of match tickets. They approached the perimeter railings at
            2.30pm. En route to the ground he saw fans drinking, some carrying cans,
            but not physically drunk. He mentioned large crowd outside the perimeter
            gates, which were closed. He entered the ground through Gate C and walked
            through the tunnel into Pen 3- He described the tunnel and pen as packed,
            however he was not concerned with these conditions and forced his way down
            the terrace to a position somewhere behind barrier 124a . He heard people
            screaming and when Beardsley hit the cross-bar, conditions became worse
            and he saw people start to climb over the perimeter and radial fences. He
            saw Police preventing fans from climbing over the perimeter fence. He did
            not see or hear barrier 124A break, but saw the bar being thrown over    e
            fence, nearly hitting a Policeman.

He himself was approached for tickets.        He saw fans climbing over
turnstiles and heard a Police Officer with*a l’oud-hailer asking fans to
keep calm.   He saw a fan strike out at a Policeman on horseback.     Some
fans appeared distressed in the crowd.    He saw Gate C open and decided
that they would get in a position that if it opened again they would take
advantage of the situation and enter the ground, which they did.      They
went along the tunnel and met a wall of people near to the terraces, then
they entered Pen 3. He described being part of the flow when in Pen 3.
but was not concerned as he wanted to go where the flow was taking him
anyway.   He mentioned, however, that he could not move backwards against
the flow of people. He positioned himself in front of barrier 124A, where
he saw two males (who   it is believed to be A.J. Murray and his son, P.B.
Murray, 14 years, deceased) both having difficulties.  When Beardsley hit
the cross-bar, he felt  a massive surge and ended up near to Gate 3. which
opened and he entered the playing area.      He did not see or hear the
barrier break.

                SUBJECT:   SUMMARY OF INQUEST 28.11.90

                During the morning the court toured the area outside the ground, locating
                public houses, supermarkets, Wadsley Bridge. Station and finally visiting
                Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground.

                At 2,00pm, the court reconvened, hearing evidence from:

                Stephanie Jones           Liverpool Supporter

                Stephanie Jones travelled to Sheffield on Friday 14 April 1989* to visit
                her brother Richard and his girlfriend, Tracey. They were all going to the
                semi-final the next day. They were in possession of four tickets. Richard
                and Tracey both died in the tragedy.     Richard resided in the Crookesmoor
                area of Sheffield and left his home address with Tracey and Stephanie at
                2.00pm, intending to visit a public house on the north side of the ground
                to sell the fourth ticket to a friend.      Stephanie did not see many fans
                during the drive and those she saw were not carrying any cans. She joined
                the crowd, which she describes as a mass of people, at Leppings Lane
                turnstiles and felt pressure from behind.        She saw only three Police
                Officers, one of whom was on horseback. The mounted Officer was attempting
                to split the crowd but failed due to its volume.        She mentioned being
                crushed against Gate C before it opened again- at 2.59pm» when she gained
                access to the ground.    She entered the tunnel, which was clear, and saw
                fans urinating against the wall.     She then entered Pen 3 unhindered and
                described the crowd as normal.    She remembers being shoved from behind and
                after a big surge, lost sight of Richard and Tracey.      She cannot remember
                anything further until shortly afterwards, when she stepped out of Gate 3
                onto the track. She was not aware of any activity on the field or that the
                match was in progress until shestepped onto the track.

                There is photographic evidence showing Jones outside   the ground near to
                Gate C at 2.45pm, with several Police Officers in close proximity to her.
                She has identified her brother in Pen 3 on video, BBC, MAP 1, timed
                1456:31:01.   This evidence appears to be in conflict to her previous
                evidence.

                When questioned regarding the urinating in the tunnel, she appeared to
                accept this sort of behaviour as the norm and not out of place amongst
                Liverpool fans.

                Counsel for Sheffield City Council addressed the Coroner regarding time
                being lost by questions being duplicated by other legal representatives.
                The matter was discussed and the Coroner stated that he was quite happy
                with the way the questioning was going because he wanted the Inquest to be
                as thorough as it could be.

             Richard Thompson      Liverpool   Supporter
             David Lowe            Liverpool   Supporter
             Alison Bennett        Liverpool   Supporter
             Alan Jones            Liverpool   Supporter

             Richard Thompson, Licensee, travelled with his son by private motor car,
             both in possession of match tickets, leaving Liverpool at 12 noon and
             arriving at 2.20pm. He mentioned fans carrying cans but no fans gave him
             cause for concern.    He arrived outside the Leppings Lane entrance at
             approximately 2.45pm.   He became concerned when he joined the crowd at
             that location due to the pressure build-up from behind him. He mentioned
             a horse nearly falling over because of the crush.    Gate C opened and in
             his words, "If gate not opened more death on hands" - as the gates were
             swaying under pressure.    He was in the first 100 to enter the ground
             through Gate C.    He crossed the concourse and went through the tunnel
             into Pen 4 without difficulty.   Initially he was not concerned but then
             the pressure increased and a surge from behind carried him forward,
             hitting a barrier. This resulted in him receiving fractures to his ribs.
             He was unable to remember anything about the 1988 semi-final.

             David Lowe travelled with four others to the ground, leaving Mansfield at
             about 11.00am.   None of the party were in possession of match tick®ts-
             They purchased tickets for the Kop at £20.00 each, then went to the White
             Horse public house. He consumed 3i pints of lager. They left the public
             house at 1.00pm and made their way to Leppings Lane and after a
             conversation with a Steward, entered the ground and went to Pen 4. At
             2.00pm the pen began to fill up and the crowd began to sway, an
             involuntary movement, and they ended up at the front of the pen and began
             to feel uncomfortable as pressure grew gradually.    He climbed over the
             radial fence into Pen 5 and saw a Police Constable standing on the fence,
             pushing people back.    He didn't see any Police Officers attempting to
             assist. The Jury asked questions regarding the purchase of tickets.

             Alison Bennett, Lowe's girlfriend, travelled to Sheffield with him and
             three others.   Her evidence was almost identical, however she saw more
             Police Officers by the perimeter fence giving assistance.

             Alan Jones travelled with his brother and friend by coach, arriving at
             Sheffield at 1.20pm.   They were in possession of match tickets.     iney
             went to The Fox public house, which was overflowing.   He consumed 2 cans
             of lager, purchased from a nearby off-licence, between 1.20pm and 2.35pm.
             He then made his way to the Leppings Lane end of the ground,
             2.55pm.  He joined a large crowd already there and more joined after his
             arrival.  He cannot remember being pushed around by the crowd or pushing
             himself.   He was not crushed.   He did not hear messages on any tannoy
             system and only saw one mounted Police Officer. He cannot rememb.

players on the pitch. Halfway along the tunnel the came to a halt due to
obstruction, then was carried into Pen 4 by 'pressure in the crowd.   Due
to crowd movement he was carried to the front of the pen and climbed over
the perimeter fence.    He saw Police Officers helping others over the
fence, but couldn't remember what was happening on the pitch.

            SUBJECT:          SUMMARY OF INQUEST 26.11.90

            The following witnesses were called to give evidence.

            Philip Lomas                    Police Sergeant
            Ross Wright                     Football Supporter - Liverpool
            Anthony John Murray             Relative (son 14 years died in tragedy)
            Louise Jan Hinton               Supporter

            Police Sergeant Lomas concluded his evidence under cross examination. He
            was questioned on his experiences of policing football matches, his
            expectation of crowd arrivals and numbers (a 1989 semi-final ticket was
            produced to highlight recommended times that fans should be in their
            seats):, and his impression of what was taking place at Leppings Lane.

            Mr Ross Wright travelled to the match by coach.     Due to the organiser
            leaving their tickets in the coach, this caused them to arrive late at
            Leppings Lane turnstiles.  He mentioned a minority of fans carrying cans
            (none drunk).    Outside the turnstiles he joined the crowd and saw a
            Landrover and heard messages over the loud-hailer.   When in the crowd he
            was pushed from behind by other people who arrived later and who took no
            notice of the instructions from the Police in the Landrover.     Emphasis
            was put on the poor signs displayed to assist fans in getting into the
            ground and the lack of assistance given by Police and Stewards within the
            concourse behind the West Stand. Mention was made of fans attempting to
            climb over perimeter fences from the pens and Police forcing these back
            by hitting their hands.     This incident was timed around 3-15pm.     He
            thought the fans climbing over the fence were protesting against being
            allocated Leppings Lane end again. Wright entered the ground through the
            turnstile.

            Anthony John Murray, father of Paul Brian Murray, 14 years, who died in
            the tragedy, described the scene in Leppings Lane outside the turnstiles.
            He saw mounted Officers trying to control the crowd. He was concerned by
            jostling and crowd movement all around him.     He entered the groun    y
            Gate C.    The pressure eased on the concourse and he then entered the
            tunnel and Pen 3 without problem. Once in Pen 3 he began to move to the
            right hand side of the pen, when his son was knocked over and he never
            saw him alive again. In hindsight he would not have joined the crowd in
            Leppings Lane outside the turnstile.

            Louise Hinton and her boyfriend attended the match travelling by train.
            They did not have tickets and purchased two from touts at £20 each, bhe
            saw other fans without tickets also trying to obtain them. She mentioned
            lots of fans, some with cans of beer in their hands, and described crush
            in Leppings Lane outside turnstiles.. On the concourse, she was directed
            by a Steward towards the tunnel and entered Pen 4.      In the crush she
            became separated from her boyfriend and ended up at the front of the pen.
            She could not move and was standing on a body in the pen. She saw Police
            Officers atempting to remove grille from perimeter fence. Hinton and her
            boyfriend entered the ground through Gate C.

          Albert Lindley                      Resident

          Philip Lomas                        Police Sergeant

          Ex Police Sergeant Tissington concluded his evidence             under cross
          examination.  He was questioned regarding his assessment of      drunkenness,
          his knowledge of match operation order, the action he took        when inside
          Pen 3 and Police Officers he could identify in command inside     the ground.

          The two civilian witnesses who live locally mentioned crowds arriving
          late, urinating, ticketless fans, consumption of alcohol and unsociable
          behaviour.   Mention was made of the Police Landrover and messages being
          transmitted from the loud-hailer requesting fans to move back on numerous
          occasions, all of which were ignored.

          Police Sergeant Wilson, who was on duty in Leppings Lane manning barriers
          to side roads, stated that initially fans were friendly and good
          humoured.   Later, at 2.40pm, a large number of supporters in their
          hundreds came running along Leppings Lane past him, towards the ground,
          carrying cans and bottles, intent on getting to the ground.    An attempt
          was made to slow them down, without any effect.

                The following witnesses were called to give evidence:

                Angela Hockenhall               Resident
                John Taylor                     Nottingham Forrest Supporter

                Michael Tissington              Ex Police Officer

                The evidence given by the above people related to fans making their way
                towards the ground in groups, a lot carrying 4 packs of beer/lager, a
                large percentage showing signs of having consumed alcohol, fans openly
                urinating in street (J. Taylor), urinating in gardens and waving their
                genitals towards female occupant (A. Hockenhall).   Mention was made of
                the conspiracy factor (D. Watts, J. Shelley and G. Taylor) who either
                overheard or held conversations with fans who apparently had no tickets
                and whose intention was to enter the ground by causing a disturbance
                outside the turnstiles, forcing the Police to allow them in the ground.
                A practice some of them had carried out with success on previous
                occasions.

                The majority of witnesses made reference to late arrivals, crowd-density
                and a noticable difference' between the 1988 and •1989 • semii-final,
                describing it as, "An unusual atmosphere, worst I've seen".

                Mr King mentioned an article in the Yorkshire* Po3t re: the Coroner being
                paid by Sheffield Council and there might be a conflict of interest,
                however he was satisfied with the current position.

                The Inquest continued with Mr Knight, licensee of Commercial public house,
                giving evidence.  He stated consumption was 3 “ ^ pints per person and the
                fans left between 2 .30pm - 2 .50 pm.

                The remaining witnesses, who consisted of local residents, people employed
                in the area and people travelling through the area, gave their evidence
                relating to unsociable behaviour, i.e. urinating, lateness of fans
                approaching the ground, fans consuming and carrying 4 packs of alcohol in
                the street, drunken behaviour and crowd comparison with the 1988 semi­
                final.   Mention was made by a couple of the witnesses to an air of
                impending trouble, nothing untoward happened but there was an atmosphere.

                During the afternoon, Police Sergeants Wilson and Lomas entered the court,
                to gain a feeling of the court in preparation to their giving evidence. A
                short time later Mr King addressed the Coroner, stating that it may be
                wise that certain witnesses be excluded from, the court prior to their
                giving evidence.    (I took this to mean Police Officers).     The Coroner
                replied that it was his decision that witnesses be allowed in the court
                during the hearing and should this decision be reversed, some of his
                clients, including Mr Hicks, who is also to give evidence, would be


                On Friday 23 November 1990, the court will commence at 9-30am for the
                Coroner to give his decision in relation to transcripts being accepted as
                an alternative to certain witnesses being called.

                On Wednesday 28 November 1990, the room being used for the Coroner's court
                is required for a Council meeting.    The Coroner stated his intention to
                use that time for the Jury to do a site visit at Sheffield Wednesday
                Football Club and there is a likelihood that only a few witnesses will be
                heard that day, if any.

                I have been informed to the effect that Mr Hicks and company have
                approached Mrs McBrien, who is present in the court representing her
                family's interests (her son died in the tragedy).      They consider that
                questions she is putting to the witnesses are apparently detrimental to
                the case which Mr King is presenting and they are putting pressure on her
                (in her words 'bullying' her) in order to prevent her from asking such
                questions.    She has spoken to Mr Russell, who is the Counsel for
                Superintendent Greenwood, who in turn has approached Douglas Frazer and Mr
                King with a view to his advising his clients.  Mr King is also quite keen
                to change his or Mrs McBrien's position so that he is in a position to
                question witnesses after her, obviously to repair any damage she may have
                caused.

                During the morning the compilation video was shown to the court.
                                                                •'   •


                During the afternoon the following witnesses were called:

                1.    Peter Buck - Fox Inn Public House
                2.   Rita Goldsworthy - Silver Fox Public House
                3.   Jack Mountain - Cock Inn Public House
                4.    Keith Ollerenshaw - Owl Public House (former licensee)

                The questions related to (1) alcohol consumption (2) behaviour of fans (3)
                time of arrival and departure from public houses (4) increased takings and
                sales of stock.

                The findings at (1) showed an average consumption per person was
                approximately four pints at all public houses, except the Owl where the
                manager stated some were consuming ten - fifteen pints.   (2) Behaviour was
                good in all pubs except the Owl, where the staff were verbally abused.
                (3) The time of departure from licensed premises was reasonable except the
                Owl, where the fans were leaving as late as 2.30pm - 2.45pm.        (4) All
                public houses showed a substantial increase in sales and takings.

                Finally the court was shown a further video comparing the 1988 - 1989
                semi-finals on a split screen.

                The relevant areas the Coroner appears interested in are outside the
                ground, outside Leppings Lane turnstiles, inside Leppings Lane concourse
                and Leppings Lane terraces.

                Mr Catchpole addressed the Coroner, requesting that witnesses called by
                Sheffield Wednesday Football Club be allowed the same privileges as other
                witnesses in relation to submission of transcripts as an alternative to
                giving evidence.

                   SUBJECT;      SUMMARY OF INQUEST 19-11.9 0 .

                                                                      f
                   At 10.00am on Monday, 19 November 1990, Dr Popper*opened the Inquest and
                   invited the Counsels to introduce themselves.

                  1.    Mr Gregory              Sheffield City Council
                  2.    Mr Hale                 Superintendent Marshall
                  3.    Mr Payne                South Yorkshire Police
                  4.    Mr Issacs               Chief Superintendent Duckenfield
                  5.    Mr Manning              Superintendent Murray
                  6.    Mr King                 43 Families (relatives of deceased)
                  7-    Ms Sinclair             Eastwood
                  8.    Mr Catchpole            Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
                  9-    Mr ’Callaghan           South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance
                  10.   Ms Alderman             Police Federation
                  11.   Mr Russell              Superintendent Greenwood
                  12.   Mr McBrien              Own Family

                  Mr King, Counsel for 43 of the deceased relatives, began his opening
                  address.   He commented on the fact that only the events up to 3 15pm had
                  been covered during the previous Inquest.    The point he was making was
                  that between the times fans were first seen (somewhere around 3.15pm) on
                  the terraces and the time they ,were certified dead in the gymnasium
                  (somewhere around 4.00pm), what was the emergency services doing?     Were
                  their relatives still alive immediately prior to being certified dead?
                  Could the emergency services have provided more assistance, i.e. providing
                  specialist vehicles?    Mr Popper likened the tragedy to a serious road
                  traffic accident, where we produce only evidence up to the victim being
                  transported to hospital.   Evidence is only supplied to that point.   Just
                  because a victim is certified dead at a later time does not mean that they
                  are actually alive up to that time.

                  The Coroner stated that it would still stand at 3.15pm and that it was not
                  his intention to stray down the way Mr King was trying t o direct him.

          m       Mr Issacs then addressed the court and indicated his wish that Chief
                  Superintendent Duckenfield should not have to give evidence at this
                  Inquest. At this point there was an outbreak of 'booing' and 'hissing' by
                  members of the relatives sat at the rear of the court.

                  The Coroner advised the public of his    powers andstated that he would not
                  put up with this sort of behaviour.      He stated that any decision he made
                  would not be influenced by comments      etc. made by the relatives in the
                  court.

                  Mr Issacs then put forward his case as to why Chief Superintendent
                  Duckerifield should not have to take the stand, quoting Rule 22 of the
                  Coroners Rules re: self incrimination.      After much discussion, it was
                  suggested that transcripts of Chief Superintendent Duckenfield's evidence
                  at the Taylor Enquiry be read out to the Jury.

                  Mr King indicated that his families would prefer the real thing, but would
                  accept the transcript being read out to the Jury.

       Counsel for the other Officers, except Mr Hale ;who had left the court,
       indicated that they would also like evidence *in respect of their clients
       to be presented in the same vein.

       Mr Catchpole stated that he would have to speak to his clients before
       making any further comment.

       Dr Popper stated that he would advise him at a later date of any decision
       he would make in relation to the matter.

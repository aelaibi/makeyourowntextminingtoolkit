          Thank you very much for your letter about Lord Justice Taylor's
interest in the research work being carried out at this Centre on the
role that organised sport, especially football, can play in the
prevention of crime.

          This work, which is being carried out by the Football Trust
Research Fellow, David Robins, has, as its first stage, attempted to
survey the various schemes which have been set up in various parts of the
country. The aim has been to evaluate how they are organised, who the
participants are, and what has been achieved. I am hoping that an
interim report will be available before the end of this year.

          Although Mr. Robins' current work is not concerned with crowd
control and safety at" sports events, he has, as you may know, a long
experience of working with young people and knows a great deal about
their attitudes and behaviour, especially as these relate to football. I
am sure he would be very happy to see you, if you think that he could be
of assistance.

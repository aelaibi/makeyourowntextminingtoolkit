      Dear Sir,
                As the daughter of the eldest victim at "Hillsborough',(Mr Gerard
     Baron). I request a new inquiry into that disaster in the light of "totally
     contradictory evidence that came to our attention during Granada's
    ^ s e a r c h for the recent Jimmy McGoverns' Hillsborough programme.''
    ^ffiere are certain matters that my family and I feel were not properly
     addressed by the west midlands police in thier report into my fathers
     death.
     (Deceased Ref:No:69)

     Circumstances:Paragraph 4:
     Quote: "Following the severe crushing in the west stand terracing. P.C.
     53 Richard Liversidge went into pen 3 and assisted injured persons.
     He found a man, he now “believes?" To be Mr Baron at the front of the
     pen and attempted resuscitation but without success. Unquote.
     We ask: At what time did he enter the terrace and gave resuscitation?

     Paragraph 5:
      P.C.'s 492, David Carl Tranter and 2632, Anthony Hayes together
     with P.S. 468, Philip Kenneth Whitlam recieved my father into pen 2
     and then handed him over to other persons through gate 2:(unknown
     persons).
      We ask: Why did they not attempt to resuscitated him?
     Again, what time was this? Off duty fireman Peter Joseph Maher
     attempted to resuscitate my father without success, but he stated that he,
      Quote: "Recalled a doctor telling him to leave Mr Baron which he did”.
     Unquote. But that doctor was not identified. We ask 1. Why was the
     identity of this doctor not pursued?
     2. How was it known that he was INDEED a doctor? This in itself in our
     opinion would have been important to the inquiry!

     Paragraph 12: Quote: "An examination of video and photographic
     evidence has been made by Police Inspector Michael Layton and Mr
     Baron has been identified in pen 3." Unquote. Then why was it stated that
     the C.C.T.V. camera was not functioning in pen 3 ? If that’s the case then
     how did they obtain visual evidence?

     RefParagraph 10:1 can personally say that I was in regular contact by
     phone to the coroners office in Sheffield. Iwas led to believed that an
autopsy was carried out on my father on Monday 17th April 1989
and not on Sunday 16th April 1989 as stated in that paragragh.
 We are concerned that these inaccuracies were accepted by the original
inquiry at face value without, (as we see it) any real attempt to question
them. It is quite obvious that the whole issue has been a FARCE! A blatant
attempt by the system to deprive people of thier fundamental rights to
justice!!

Dear Mr Howard,


        We request that the events of the Hillsborough Disaster be re-examined not
only because of the new evidence produced, but because 7 1 /2 years after the Disaster
the questions we have asked since Day 1, have never been addressed. We ask you to
read the following.


        We write to you not only as parents who lost a much loved member of our
family at Hillsborough , but were also firm believers in the rule of Law and Order, sadly
we now realise that there is no such thing as honesty, integrity or justice.

       The Inquest started our concerns with the Coroner, who we considered, was
himself put in an untenable position, being employed by one of the parties likely to
come under criticism for their decisions leading up the Disaster.

        The Coroner Dr Popper, was carrying out the investigation, and it was he who
selected the evidence to be heard. It was hardly surprising then when questions were
and still are being raised about his impartiality. The way the evidence was selected by
the Coroner was in our opinion, and in the opinion of most independent professionals,
who have looked at the Inquest transcripts extremely biased.

        In our own personal experience, Dr Popper was quite happy to call witnesses,
who had not been within ten miles of the Football Stadium, to discuss the supposed'
drunkenness of fans, while at the same time refusing to call professionals who were at
the scene and attended the injured and dying who possibly could have answered some
of our questions and cast some light on what occurred.

        We personally requested two Doctors and one Senior Nursing Officer who were
at the scene to be called as witnesses (see letter to the Coroner and his reply). All were
refused the opportunity to give the jury the benefit of their knowledge of events, but
as your know the Coroner enforced the unprecedented cut off time of 3-15 and no
evidence of events occurring later th*n this was to be heard, considering a lot of our
questions relating to our son's death was after 3-15 (he was declared dead at 4.0 p.m.)
we knew then that our questions would go unanswered.

        When concluding the Coroner himself commented that the Inquest was not
the place to conduct a major Disaster enquiry, and the current law commission has
expressed views that the system needs major review.
        We as a family consider the system as it is at present to be corrupt and biased,
when one party the Police Authority, had full access to all statements, while the
families and their legal representatives were refused all access, and had to rely on the
Coroner, to present the evidence impartially which he patently did not

       The Police Complaints procedure was another major concern, we know you are
aware, of the general criticism of the complaints procedure, but are you aware that
the complaints procedure is toothless.

         Senior Police Officers closely related to the incident, were seen in Sheffield,
whilst the Inquest was in progress, laughing openly at the plight of the families,
confident that they were under no threat of disciplinary action. Because if found that
disciplinary action was needed, that they could take early retirement unhindered and
unpunished. This was later to prove the way things were allowed to happen, so their
confidence was not misplaced.

       Only in our naive trust did we believe that because theiriwctionswere so
obvious they would somehow be made accountable.

        We were involved in the judicial review procedure before the High Court and
although our faith in the system had been shattered, we were confident that even
with the meagre amount of evidence that we had managed to collect to support the
review, it was of such importance as to require careful consideration.

        One piece of evidence was that the West Midland investigation team had
attempted to coerce witnesses to change statements and this went uncontested,
although West Midland Police were aware what was to be produced, to support this
allegation.

        We were amazed that such strong charges could be dismissed in one of our
major courts in the Country with the words in the judgement "Who's to know what fe
believe" surely the courts exists for just that purpose to have evidence presented and
assessed. If it fails to carry out its prime responsibility it will quickly lose credibility
with the general public.

       I would like to remind you that law and order has to be applied, with the
consent of the people, lose that consent and the future looks very bleak.

       Please try and restore some of our faith in the judicial system and be as
concerned about the events as we are, support our enquiry which of course will be
open with full disclosure.

                                     Yours faithfully,
                         n o - 4-92 ;   934   ; DOUGHTY ST CHAMBERS-      051 225

Dear Dr. Popper.

J p t h e mini inquests we attempted to ask a series of questions concerning
the aftermath at Hillsborough, we were left with the impression that the
questions would be dealt with at a later stage.

However since then you have ruled that it 1s not necessary to proceed after
15.15pm and it now appears that our questions will not be addressed, you
did say that in an Ideal world everyone would have ended up in hospital and
you suggested that we were naive 1n thinking that the medical response was
inadequate, that sort of answer is not conducive to the facts as shown In
the video, and reports from Medical Personnel who were trying valiantly to
assist the injured.

The video shows 1t took till at least 15.35pm before all the casualties
were removed from the pens, a fairly lengthy delay which obviously did
nothing to help their chances of survival.

Reports and recommendations from the Medical Personnel (please find
enclosed) certainly imply that in their opinion, the response left a lot to
be desired.

We also know of people who were removed in an unconscious state, a prime
example being Mr. Edward Spearrltt who according to Mr. Spearritt was not
admitted to hospital until 17.00 hours and who subsequently recovered, that
it was possible for people 1n the crush who suffered severe injury to
survive with a reasonable amount of aftercare.

At the very least this raises questions 1n the eyes of the families that
the inefficiency of the major incident response could have contributed to
the number of deaths occurring at Hillsborough and therefore we consider
that this should have been part of your enquiries into the reason for the
deaths.

You have promised to look into individual questions of concern, therefore
1t would not take a great deal of your time to enquire into this matter.
We would suggest the two most qualified Medical Personnel namely Dr. John
Ashton and Or. Glynn Phillips be called to give evidence at your Inquests,,
so they can be questioned as to their medical opinion of whether the
response contributed at all to the amount of fatalities.

He think you realise the seriousness which we place on this matter, and we
feel that if you fall to address this situation, that this failure will
obviously form part of a case for Judicial revidw no matter what verdict 1s
reached.

Trusting you will give this matter your earnest consideration.

                             Yours sincerely,

Dear Mr Jones
Thank you for your letter dated 12 February 1991, the contents of
which I have noted and have read with care.
Whilst I would not for one moment question the seriousness with which
you view the points raised, I do not think that it is either right
or appropriate for me to enter into a dialogue with you regarding
the issue which you have raised.
However, in order to avoid any possible misunderstanding, I do have
to say that it is not my intention to call either Dr Ashton or.
Dr Phillips.
I have also read your penultimate paragraph. Whether or not you
apply for a judicial review is a matter entirely for you and/or your
                                                  on this either.
Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Howard                                                 /      I

As the parents of Gary Philip Jones who was killed at HUtebwough w^stiongly urge you to foblt af
the new evidence which has recently come to light in the recent TV drama documentary"
Hillsborough".

The experiences in the film were very similar to our own were as parents we were treated
disgracefully by the authorities after identifying our son's body and then being subjected to questions
whilst in a state of shock. Recent events ie the retirement on health grounds of certain individuals and
compensation received has aggrieved us even more.

In this respect we demand that the initial inquest verdict be quashed and a new one be opened. For
seven years we have had to defend our teenage son whose death was not accidental.




Yours Sincerely




Maureen Jones                         Philip Jones

Dear Home' Secretary,

         We are members of the Hillsborough Family Support Group and have been trying
with great difficulty and stress to come to terms with the tragic death of our young Son at the
disaster. We hoped to have carried on with our lives as best we could knowing that it was a
disaster that could possibly have been avoided if certain steps had been taken. Then,
Hillsborough became a reality once again on the television for all to see and although we
never watched this programme, we found it difficult to avoid all the 'talk1 about it.

        Now we feel strongly that in the light of the totally contradictory evidence that has
brought to our attention, the events of Hillsborough should be re-examined so that the people
responsible can be brought to justice and to ensure that this must never ever happen again.
Maybe then part of us can be at peace.

                                     Yours sincerely,

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:            Thank you very much.

                           DOUGLAS JOHN LOCK Called

                           Examined bv M R , GOLDSACK:

Q. Mr. Lock, for some years prior to your retirement from the
   Police in 1985 you were a Superintendent based in FI Sub-
   Division covering Hillsborough? - a . I was, sir.

                                                                           c s tiM


Q. 19B2 to 1985? - A. That is correct, sir.

0.    Were you present at the 1981 Semi-Final? - A. No, I was not
     sir.   I was in Headquarters at the time.

Q.   Were you aware of the memo that had been raised in 1981
     expressing Chief Superintendent’s Herold's dissatisfaction
     with stewarding? - A. I was aware of the original intention of
     the memoranda.  I was very fortunate because my predecessor in
     the post I occupied at FI was Mr. Chapman, and he had moved
     sideways to become Detective Superintendent, so he was able to
     liaise with me and brief me about many things appertaining to
     the Sub-Division.    - -
                                                                           D- LOCK

              1982, My Lord.
                    LORD J U S T I C E TAYLOR:     1982.    Thank you very much.
         Q,        JIU. GOLDSACX:      So a l t h o u g h this was not reduced
              into w r i ti ng it was a r ea so n a b l y formal agreement between
              the club and the Police? - A. Yes.
     B
         Q. About Leppings Lane terrace in part ic ul ar ? - A. Yes, sir.
         0. And so th rou gho ut the rest of your tine in the Poli ce!
            f o r c e is that w h a t in p r a c t i c e you did, naaely, you |
            d i r e c t e d the- fans on t h e^ Lep pin gs Lane terraced - A .
            It v/as i n c o r p o r a t e d into the Police order for each. •
            aatch.* It c l e a r l y s t a t e d the control box w o u l d rnpnl§Qr^
            and w o u l d d i r e c t in the w a y in w h i c h the pens were f i l led /
            The pens were not as they are now. There were only tnree
            pens, the South pen, the central pen, that is 2 and 3 as
            it is now - 3 and 4 as it is now - but there was the
            South pen, the central pen and the North pen and then
            the e l e v a t e d section.
         0. Now, you retir ed ea rly 1985 and you took up your part-
 D          time a p p o i n t m e n t wit h the club later that year. Is that
            right? - A. I a c t u a l l y r e t i r e d on the 2 S t h ’ of February
            but I ceased du ty on the 22nd of February, 1934, because
            I had time owing and a nnual leave to come, so 1 did not
            wo rk into 19S5 and I c o m m e n c e d employment as the Securitv
            O f f i c e r at the club in August, 1985.
         Q. In b e t we en those two I think you had writt en certain
            a rticles for the Police R e v i e w about policing at football
            ma tc he s? - A. I v/rote several articles for Police Review
            an d t h e - S h e f f i e l d Te le gr ap h, sir.
         Q. W o u l d this be correct, Hr. Lock, that in at least one of
            those a rticles you were f airly critical of football
            m a n a g e m e n t in general, clu b m a n a g e m e n t ? - A. V’hich wav
            do you mean, sir?
         0.. In not taking s u f f i c i e n t r e s p o n s i b i l i t y for crowd
             problems. - A. There was an incident at 3arnslev iust
             at the time I was r e t i r e d whe n a lot of damage was
             caused by fans from Leeds U nited again and houses were
             d a m a g e d and the club c o m p l e t e l y refused to accept any
             r e s p o n s i b i l i t v for what was g oing on outside the. g r o u n d
             and in m y ’artic le I did raise the question, what did the •
             club t h i n k t h o s e fans wer e doing in that part of rjBarnslev ::
             at' t h a t ' p a r t i c u l a r moment.
         0. Did you also before taking up your employment with the
            c lu b- - -were .you of the v i e w that very often stewards di.'
            not do that wh ic h they shoul d be doing? - A. It is a

        And you would expect that in every operational order for any
        match? - A. Yes.
        And the typical sort of order which you might expect would be
        the one we have already looked at this morning, but by all
        means have a look at yourself, which is at document 21 in the
        South Yorkshire Police bundle, Serial 9? - A. The format is a
        little different, but in general I think....

        We will pause and have a little look. - A. What do you want me
        to look at specifically?

        Serial 9 in document 21.             Can you see it?      Leppings Lane
        terraces. - A. Yes, sir.

        You see-  "Ensure pens are filled in accordance with
        instructions from control".   Thatis the sort of thing you
        would expect to see.  Is that right? - A. "Maintain order and
        ensure pens are filled in accordance. ... ** No, we were more
        detailed than that.

i. Even more detailed? - A. Yes.

j. But you would certainly expect something like that at least? -
   A. Of course, yes.
q       When you then   transferred to the club did you ever yourself
        have sight of   the operation orders of the Police for any given
        match? - A. Yes, Graham Mackrell used to receive a copy of the
        order.
        Did he ever show it to you? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you see the operational order for 1988? - A. Yes.

                  MR. KING:    Sir, I am now at a.total disadvantage because
             j have not got a copy of the 1988 one.    I don t think I have
             ever seen o n e .
              "   T.ORD j u s t i c e TAYLOR: I think we had it this morning: v
             Serial 14 are you looking for?                           : . .

                   MR. KING 4 .    Yes, indeed, sir:                              r. ,   :

    0   . Could you keep document 21 open, if youwill,   Mr. Lock, and
          turn to the*document you have just been shown, which is-the
          1988 document. - A. I have not been shown that.(Document
          handed to witness)
    O. You see there the orders.                Before I ask you any questions I

        one, presumably there has to a plan in advance of which
        particular pen should be filled first? - A. Of course.

Q. And that no doubt is put down in writing somewhere?            Those are
   the instructions? - A. Yes.

q   . Somebody therefore has to be designated presumably to ensure
      the filling of that particular pen first? - A. Yes.

q   . A specific system? - A. Yes.

Q. And you are controlling the filling at the point of entry, are
   you not? - A. At the point of entry on to the terraces?

q   . Yes, and in so doing you are not waiting for signs of
      discomfort or signs of people in distress.  You are actually
      controlling the numbers going in with a view to not reaching
      that point presumably? - A. That is precisely the object of
      safety, that you don't reach a point where it is too full and
      it   is unsafe for people.

Q. The only way you can monitor for overcrowding by observation
   is      to wait until you  see signs of discomfort, isnot it? That
   is      the only real way   you can do it? - A. You don't have to
   wait and see people standing on each other's heads.      You wait
   until you can see there is no room left on the terrace.      You
   d o n ’t wait until they are pressing down. You then say, as I
   did, "Close the pen".

q   . So are you saying you are expecting somebody to be
    / specifically designated to keep looking at a given pen in
      order to see whether or not the number has been yet ;reached
      which is safe? - A. There was an Inspector in charge of the
      West end of the ground, and he looked and walked around, and
      looked there.   There were serials placed, half used to go on
      the terraces and half used to be employed behind the West
      Stand, I looked there and I designated myself to have a look.
      I couid see quite clearly because it is the best view in the
      ground.   If you look from tt]®^feo*.4XJs.,the best vifwj)f thA
      Lappings Lane terraces, in the ground, and, Is cou W,i§ee quite#
      c l e a r " ! o r not there was any danger to anybody iri
      those"'pens I
q  . Would you if you had been in charge of a fulj. capacity ground
     at that end of the ground have allowed a situation to arise
     whereby there was obviously a disparity arising between the
--- errd^ pens'-and the middle pens? -A. There can always be a:-~
     disparity., but you. are saying a capacity crowd.  Y o u -.don’.t
     allow -the--disparity to arise.  You stop it.          ~r--- '

    O   a capacity crowd is one which is going to fill the whole end?
        - A. Precisely.
    0. And you don't wait you say, I suspect, until you can see the
       middle pens are absolutely full and the side pens half empty.
       That is a situation you d o n ’t want to arise at all? - A. True.

   if you cannot.
            LORD JUS TI CE TAYLOR:  Well, he has said he does not
      tv/ice so why do not you suggest it?
0.         MR. JACKS O ’.1!: Q u i t e c l ea rl y the safety of the fans
      was of no conc er n to Chief Superintendent Ducker.field?
      -A. Well, I cannot ....

      this witness that qu es tion, with respect, M r .'J a c k s o n .
      I have got the flavour of your argument ^but this witness
      cannot be asked u h a t v;as in Mr. D u c k e n f i e l d 's mind.
0.           MR. JACKSOM:            Mr. Lock, may I ask you this then?
      Is it conc ei va bl e to you that anyone who was sitting or
      standing in that control r o o m that day coulc have missed
      the o v e r c r o w d i n g in the central pens? - A. I was not
      there and you are a s k i n g me to make a c on jec tu re that if he
      was sat there and the thing was running normally, they
      were coming through at a no rmal pace, they were finding
      their owr. level and then beca us e of what was ha pp ening
      ou ts id e, an d I can u n d e r s t a n d Mr. Marsha ll 's predicament,
      a request is to open the gates and the s ystem is being
      ov er ri d d e n by the i nflux of so aanv people at that time.
      I do not think that Mr. D u c k e n f i e l d w ou ld have disregarded
      the safety of those people.
0. Mr. Lock, we k n o w there was something like a si:; or seven
   minute delay b e t w e e n the first request for the gates to be
   opened and the eve nt ua l arrival of the suppor te rs at the
   tunnel entrance. ~ A. Yes, sir.
0. Do you find it s u r p r i s i n g that no-one seems to have con­
   sidered the effect on the c rowd inside of the influ:: of
   people through a gate? - A ..

   the m o n i t o r i n g of the crouds by the club control room.
   - A. Yes. sir.
0. 1-7e un de rs t a n d that there w e r e videos recorded by the club.
   - A. That is true, sir.

    which was seen by Che o f f ic er s in the club control room?
    - A. Most of our videos are co nc en t r a t e d on the 95 gates
    and they have static cameras and they are being recorded
    for that alone. Now, w i t h i n our control roor. we also ha^e
    a f acility which enables us to look at the Police cameras
    w i t h i n and witho ut the g r o u n d but to be able to do this
    we have only one m onitor, so we have a selection butto--’
    Mow, we do not record that material.             That' is r e c o r d e d " ^
    the Police control, so all I have recorded is the entrv" '
    of fans through t urnstiles and, coincidentally, the
    entry - the gates being o p en ed at C gate.

   ought to be a v a i l a b l e vide os that would assist this

               The                                     next m o r n i g n when I saw Roger Hold s w o r t h the Sunday

           to the                                  tapes           were    missing.

           Uer e they, by c o i n c i d e n c e , tapes of the entry of fans at

           running                u sinR a n d it was of no use whatsoever.          The

                    d i s t a n c e shot and we had other cameras covering the

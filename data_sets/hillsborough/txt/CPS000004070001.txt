HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

Thank you for your letter of 25 January 1990, setting out the
proposed timetable for the submission of the Final Report at
the completion of the criminal investigation.

I trust that you have sent a copy of this letter direct to
Mr Williams and Mr Birt s . I have no comment to make on the
timetable and I have pencilled the propsed meeting at 11.00am
on 12th April into my diary.

The Director has recently received a letter and report from
Irvine Patnick MP.  I enclose copies for your attention.   I
assume that you have already seen the report as it is said to
have been put before Lord Justice Taylor's public enquiry.
However, I should be grateful if you would give consideration
to Mr Patnick's offer of providing further information.

The Director is writing to Mr Dear personally, and formally
providing him with copies of the correspondence.

Head of Police Complaints Division

         Outline of Stephen Williams case:

         Stephen arrived at the ground at around 1.30. He was the only one of
         his group of friend who had a ticket for the Leppings lane end of the
         ground. Despite the chaos outside, he remembers being in the terraces
         for half an hour without any real problems before the crushing started.
         He w ai ttirse quarters of the way up pen 3 behind the goal. It was about
         2.50 when the crush became serious. When the big surge happened
         { ^ e n ;B|ar<isiey hit the crpss bar)he got pushed against ihe ero^r
         barner. He was there for about 5 * lO minutes, unable to move,
         inconsiderable pain. He looked for someone to help him and

I STEPHEN WILLIAMS will say:




1.    I attended the FA Cup semi-final at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989 and arrived at the
       Ground at around 1,30pm. I had a ticket for the Leppings Lane end o f the ground and
       was in Pen 3.

2.    I was on the terraces, approximately three quarters o f the way up Pen 3, for half an
       hour before any overcrowding problems developed. The crush became serious about
       2.50pm. When Peter Beardsley hit the cross bar a huge surge caused me to be pushed
       against the crash barrier where I was pinned for about 5-10 minutes, unable to move
       and in considerable pain. I was unable to get anyone to help me, I remember biting a
       man’s arm to alert him, but he was not able to help me.

3.    I was subjected to at least thirty minutes o f intense crushing and remember that a point
       came, when I gave up fighting for my life. I said goodbye to my family and fiancee as I
      thought that there was no way out, and eventually lost consciousness.

4.    I woke up on the ground vomiting and with pains in my chest. In addition, I was
       shaking uncontrollably, which I now attribute to shock. I was taken by ambulance to
      the Northern General Hospital NHS Trust in Sheffield, where I stayed for three days.
      X-rays taken during my stay in hospital showed two fractured ribs.

5.    I had also sustained bruising to the right side o f my chest, with reduced air entry in
      addition to a small bruise to the right side o f my head. I was prescribed analgesics and
      discharged on 17 April 1989, Appended hereto is a copy o f my hospital notes
      (Appendix 1) including a letter from Dr Wardrope confirming that I had been crushed
      for 30 minutes.

6.    When I returned home I visited my General Practitioner who arranged for further X-
      rays, these showed that the injuries were more extensive than first thought, and in fact
      I had five fractured ribs. Appendix 2 consists o f specialists’ reports.

1.   I attended the FA Cup semi-final at Hillsborough Football Ground on 15 April 1989. I

      was with my father, a friend and his father. We had tickets for the Leppings Lane end

      and arrived at approximately 2.45-2.50 pm.




2.   The scene was complete chaos, there was no order whatsoever, and we could not find

     our way to the right turnstile. When Gate C was opened I went through along with

     my father, my friend and his father. We could see the tunnel entrance to the pitch and

     were carried along by pressure from a wave o f people. We kept thinking that the

     pressure would ease but the crush continued.




3.   Once the game had been stopped, I realised that my dad was being pulled under by the

     pressure o f the crowd. He was approximately ten metres from the perimeter fence

     behind the goal. He called to me to help him, to get him up, but by the time I got to

     where he was he had already gone under the crowd. I picked my dad up and

     discovered he was lying on top o f a man I now know to be Stephen Williams. I tried

     to put my dad in front o f the barrier for protection and went back to pick Stephen up.




4.   Stephen was blue in the face and his eyes were staring, I thought that he was dead but

     was not sure. I cannot remember how I got Stephen out from the crush but I know I

     dragged him back across the terrace through the tunnel. There was suddenly an

     opening available in the back o f the crowd and I was able to drag Stephen towards the

     tunnel and to the courtyard beyond.
5.    When I arrived I saw that there were at least fifteen to twentyfive bodies laid out in

       rows, they seemed to be either dead or unconscious. I would estimate that they varied

       in age between 60 down to young children.




6.    I handed Stephen over to the care o f a capable-looking policeman. However, he took

       hold o f Stephen and dropped him onto the floor. I was shocked by the uncaring way

       he handled him and I shouted to the policeman to be careful, even though I did not

       know if Stephen was dead or alive. I do remember that he appeared to be completely

       lifeless. I did not see Stephen being put into an ambulance.




7.    At this point I was concerned for the safety o f my dad and the people I had travelled

      with, and I went back to check that they were safe.




8.    Later that day I saw on the television news that Stephen had survived and I got in

      touch with him.

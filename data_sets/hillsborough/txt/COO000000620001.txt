                        FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL


The Prime Minister held a meeting with Ministerial colleagues
this morning to discuss the management of the Football
Spectators Bill in the light of the latest information about the
timing of any recommendations that Lord Justice Taylor might make
on a national football membership scheme.               Present were the'Home
Secretary, the Secretary of State for the Environment, the Lord
President, the Lord Privy Seal, the Chief Whip and the"Minister
for Sport.    Mr     Langdon and M r /P ^ T M u n d y    (Cabinet Office) were
also present.
                                                          /•
I should be grateful if recipients of this letter would restrict
its circulation to those officials with a strict— operational— need
to kn ow .                                         j/

                                               /
The Home Secretary said that, followiriig the Cabinet's discussion
of the handling of the Football Spectators Bill on 20 April, Lord
Justice Taylor had told him that, ^,\(/hile it should be possible to
produce a short interim report beffore the mid-August start of the
new football season to cover th<e question of perimeter fences and
one or two important matters       q f   police procedure,     it would not be
possible to give as wide-ranging an interim report as Mr Justice
Popplewell had made because/ unlike the Bradford fire, there was
considerable disagreement pver the cause of the disaster.               In
particular, he could not promise that any recommendations he
might make on membership/cards would be in time for the passage
of the Bill in the current Session.           L©^d-J:ust 3ree~-Taylox: had
siatee-feold S      t        h           at ©ral hearings were likely to
begin in the following[jweek and to continue until around the end
of June.     It would then be necessary to take written evidence.

Bill to provide for the establishment of a new authority,
which might be known as a Football Safety Authority, which
could take on responsibility            h for the preparation and
oversight of a football membership scheme amd for the
licensing of football grounds under the Bill.                                 However, a
change to the Bill of this magnitude would greatly
complicate its handling, especially in the House of Lords:
it would accordingly be better for the gussent arrangements
to remain in place, with the Secretary of State retaining
responsibility for the licensing of football grounds.

required to draw up a national membership scheme even if the
Government were to decide, in tjie light of any
recommendations which the Lord Justice Taylor^might make,

             Lord Justice Taylor had received about 1050 letters, of which
             more than 900 had argued that a football membership scheme would
                 serve to increase the risks of a repetition of the sort of
             disaster which had occurred at the Hillsborough ground.                   Lord
             Justice Taylor felt that it would not be possible to ignore the
                 i s s u ^ he would probably ask the Department of the Environment
        ■y
                 for a written contribution, and he would consider the availab^ie
        A
                 technology as well as the situation in other countries.               Lord
                 Justice Taylor did not at present feel that it would be possible
                 to cover the question of a national membership scheme until his
                 final report, which he expected to submit at around the end of
                 the year* ^hough it might in fact prove possible for him to be
                 able to indicate after his interim report but before his final
                 report what, if arly*, recommendations he had on the mattejr^


                 In discussion, the following main points were made.


                         (a)    A Newcastle United supporter had/died within the
                         previous few days after having* a l l ^ e d l y been attacked by
                         Wimbledon supporters following^^match between the two
                         clubs.    This meant that, sinci the Bolton disaster in 1946,
                                                      J
                         there had been 293 deat|is/^ssociated with violence at, or
                         connected with, football matches involving British clubs.

                       further consideration should be given to
     whether any of the mandatory requirements in clause 5(2) of
     the Bill, relating in particular to exemptions from the
     national membership scheme, should be made permissive.
     Against that, the withdrawal of mandatory requirements which
     had been inserted in the House of Lords would greatly
     complicate the handling of the Bill.

      (p j    The Government had undertaken at Report Stage in the
     Lords to bring forward amendments to require that the
     Secretary of State's approval of a draft football
     membership scheme should be,/made subject to the negative
     resolution procedure.            It/would not be possible to make this
     subject to the affirmative resolution procedure, since this
     would render the Bill hybrid, but the Government should
     undertake that both/Houses would be given the opportunity to
     debate the Secretary of State's decision.               It had to be
      recognized, however, that this would make it very difficult
      to implement a/national membership scheme in time for the
      start of the 1990/91 football season in August 1990.

     " (d )   The football authorities, whom it was presently
      intended should be appointed to staff the Football
      Membership Authority, were dragging their heels over the

(£ )     The Bill would need to be amended to provide for the
requirement of all-seated acommodation which the Home
Secretary had announced in the House of Commons in his
statement on the Hillsborough disaster.         This amendment
would need to be sufficiently broad to allow for the
implementation of any other recommendations which Lord
Justice Taylor might make on physical measures, including
turnstiles and perimeter fencing.          It would probably be best
for this amendment to be introduced in the Commons rather
than at Third Reading in the Lords.             ^



(-#')'   Opponents of the Bill would cla<Lin that the Government
had committed itself to the deferpll of the final
proceedings on the Bill until a^fter Lord Justice Taylor had
submitted any recommendations/’he might make on a national
football membership scheme./ This was not the case, however,
since Ministers had been Careful to say no more than that
any recommendations whicjfi Lord Justice Taylor might make in
his interim report covylfd be taken into account in subsequent
proceedings on the Bid.1.       The situation had not been altered
as a result of the Expected delay in the submission of any
recommendatons which Lord Justice might make on a national

membership shcem<y the Bill would provide an enabling
framework which should allow any such recommendations to be
                |
taken into accqjint in the preparation of the scheme.

         It would |be important to counter the impression that
the question .whether or not to proceed with a national
membership scfheme was a matter for Lord Justice Taylor: it
was instead av matter for decision by the Government and by
 Parliament.

membership scheme were in any way delayed, then it would be clear
that it was those who had obstructed the passage of the Bill who
would be indirectly responsible for any future tragedies which
might be associated with football matches      As had been
foreshadowed at Report Stage in the Lords, an amendment should be
brought forward at Third Reading in the Lords to provide that the
Secretary of State's decision to approve a draft football
membership scheme should be subject to the negative resolution
procedure, and the Government spokesman should undertake that
time would be made available in both Houses for debating,the
necessary Order.   An amendment should also be brought: forward for
Third Reading in the Lords to provide that the Football
Membership Authority should draw up a scheme only if required to
do so by the Secretary of State; and, while this should not be
made the subject of an Order-making requirement, the Government
spokesman should make clear that both Houses would be given the
opportunity to debate that decision.      THe Bill should not be
amended to make provision for the establishment of a Football
Safety Authority, and the Secretary,of State should retain
responsibility for the licensing of football grounds.        Amendments
would need to be prepared, for introduction in the Commons, to
provide for the requirement of all-seated accommodation to be
part of the licensing arrangements to be made under the Bill, and
those amendments should also ,4nable the implementation of any
recommendations which Lord Justice Taylor could be expected to
make on physical matters, such as turnstiles and perimeter
 fences.   The Secretary of State for the Environment should
 consult the football authorities about the all-seated
 requirement, and should make clear to them that the Government
 was determined to press ahead with the Bill in the current
 Session, though he should not give any further details about the
 timetable for the Bill, f He should also consider, taking account

of the points made in discussion, whether clause 5(2) of the Bill
should be amended to remove any of the mandatory requirements
concerning the nature of a football membership scheme.   /f Third
Reading in the Lords would need to be taken as soon as possible
after the Whitsun Recess, so that Second Reading and as much as
possible of the Committee Stage in the House of Commons could be
completed before the Summer Recess.   The-’Secretary of State for
the Environment, in consultation with,/the Home Secretary, should
accordingly report back on the preparation of the amendments
which the meeting had agreed should be added to the Bill in time
for final decisions on the detailed handling of the Bill to be
taken before the Whitsun Recess.

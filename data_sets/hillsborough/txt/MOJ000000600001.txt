         The disaster at Hillsborough Stadium on 15 April 1989 was one of the most appalling
         events this country has experienced since the war.

                     ^ 6        M-vi,

         2.        The numbers killed - 96 -w ere very high. But the tragedy was compounded by the
         large number of children and young people who were crushed to death^by its ass^iation^1^
         w ith ^ c e r ^ o u r national game; and by the fact that the disaster unfolded via television
         before the eyes of the world.


         3.        There is another reason why that day has been such a trauma for the relatives and
         friends of those killed or injured, and for the City of Liverpool. The deaths could not be
         explained by some Act of God, by some event of nature so unforeseen as to be beyond the
         culpability of any human being. Instead, from the second that the Leppings Lane gate was
         opened, everyone knew that this was a disaster whose root was entirely human, caused by
         the error, incompetence, complacency, or worse, of people entrusted to secure the safety of
         those who attend football matches.


         4.        The Home Secretary of the day, the then Kenneth Baker, was therefore entirely
         right to establish just two days’ later a ^ y full inquiry into the disaster, under one of the
         most senior and respected judges available, Lord Taylor of Gosforth.


         5.        Lord Taylor’s inquiry took oral evidence from 174 witnesses at public hearings
         during May and June 1989 and considered many other statements and over 70 hours of
         video evidence. In his interim report published in August 1989, Lord Taylor found that
         the disaster had a number of causes. He did not attribute all the blame to a single cause or




         Speech:Hills8my
 person, but in paragraph 278 he concluded that “The main cause of the disaster was the
 failure of police control”.


 The Inquests


 6.     Inquests were held by the Coroner for South Yorkshire to determine the statutory
 questions as to who each of the deceased was, and when and how he or she died. In March
 1991, after hearing the evidence of around 200 witnesses, the inquest jury returned verdicts
of accidental death in respect of all the victims.


I b e criminal and disciplinary investigation


7.      There was also an investigation, conducted by West Midlands Police and supervised
by the Police Complaints Authority, to establish whether there were any grounds for
criminal or disciplinary proceedings.


8.      The Director of Public Prosecutions considered the West Midlands report and took
advice from Queen’s Counsel.          The DPP’s decision was that no-one should face
prosecution as a result of the events that day. The Police Complaints Authority, though,
decided that Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendent Murray should face
disciplinary charges of neglect of duty.           In November 1990, Chief Superintendent
Duckenfield retired from the force on the grounds of ill health before disciplinary
proceedings could be completed. Under police regulations, a discipline hearing cannot
proceed when a police officer retires. The Police Complaints Authority subsequently
decided to withdraw the charge against Superintendent Murray because they considered
that it would have been unfair to pursue what in effect was a joint charge, in the absence of
the more senior officer.


9.     Lord Taylor’s inquiry and report was as thorough and impartial as one would
expect of such a great judicial figure. His report has led to lasting improvements in the
safety of football grounds, in crowd behaviour and control. (Though this is of no comfort




                                               2
to the families I doubt that the Premier League would now be enjoying its world-wide
reputation without the changes which Taylor causedTj


10.    But there has been sustained criticism of both the coroners inquests, and above all
of a police discipline system so defective that no one was brought to book.


11.     Concern that the inquests had not properly been conducted led six of the bereaved
families to seek a judicial review (of the inquest^. Their application was heard in 1993. The
Divisional Court investigated the matter with great thoroughness, and looked in particular
at the 3.15 pm cut-off point, but it decided that there were no grounds for overturning the
1990 inquests.


12.    For many of the families, the sense of grievance only increased with the passage of
time, and they decided that more should be done to get at the truth as they saw it of what
happened. During 1995 and 96 [check] the author [McGovern] with the full co-operation
of the Hillsborough Family Support Group decided to prepare a television documentary
for Granada’s World-In-Action programme. Entitled simply “Hillsborough” the [hour]
long programme presented a powerful picture of the tragedy. It suggested that there was
fresh evidence which had not previously been considered which called into question the
verdicts at the inquests, and some other decisions.


Madam Speaker,


13.    I declare an interest. For two years before I entered this House in 1979 I worked
on the staff of World-In-Action.     Some of the people I knew then - like Ian McBride
[check] helped put “Hillsborough” together. I knew and know them to be journalists of
great tenacity and integrity. [ So the effect of the programme on me was all the more
coimpelling/!


14.    Following the programme, my Hon Friend for Liverpool Walton (Peter Kilfoyle)
secured an adjournment debate, on FeJjrdary 1997. I attended that debate, and listened
w ith great atteattotratth c careful and sensitive wtty-nrwhich my predecessor, the Rt Hon



                                              3
Gentleman for Folkestone and Hythe, responded to the debate on the matter and whether
any inquiry should be re-opened, he said this:


[Quote from Hansard please.]


15.    The Election intervened before the Rt Hon Gentleman could make a decision on
this, and it therefore-iell-to me to-deeide whether there should be any re-opening of this ^    ^
matter.


16.    VI thought that there was, on the face of it, sufficient to warrant a further
investigation; but since there had been a very thorough inquiry by Lord Taylor, very
lengthy inquests, and the West Midlands Police inquiry, I decided that what in the first
instance was needed was a judicial scrutiny of the new e ^ fn c e T o determine whether these
               es should be re-ODened.
      . inquiries



17.    Lord Justice Stuart-Smith as a senior Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal was
eminently qualified to conduct an independent thorough scrutiny of the evidence. The
terms of reference I gave him were very wide and enabled him to establish conclusively
whether any material evidence had been overlooked and to recommend appropriate action.
His terms of reference were:


          “To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the
       Hillsborough Stadium on 15 April 1989; which was not available:


          (a)     to the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or


       (b)        to the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the
                  purpose of discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or


       (c)        to the Chief Officer of South Yorkshire police in relation to police
                  disciplinary matters;




                                              4
       and in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
       such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State for the Home
       Department of a further public inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to
       their attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be
       relevant to their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action
       which should be taken in the public interest.”


18.    I appointed Lord Just Stuart-Smith on 30 June 1997. I published his report on
18 February 1998.     I want to place on record, again, my thanks to him for the
thoroughness, and impartiality, with which he conducted the scrutiny.


19.   There are those who rushed to judgement on his report without I suspecthaving
read it through.


20.    Anyone who          read j/a ll through will I believe be bound to come to the same
conclusions as did he, namely that a re-opening of the inquiries would serve no purpose
whatsoever.                  '


21.   Let me explain why that has to be so.


22.   There is, first, the overriding issue of who was to blame for the disaster.


23.   If blame had not so far been allocated^and new evidence^ri^who to blame was now
available the^there would, unquestionably, be very good grounds for further inquiry.

                                                                       .  SX'
                                                                           -

24.    But we have known since Lord Taylor’s report who waslto blame - the police.               /
                                                                                                 t
       \^ L             ^ ^                                I

25.    And far from recoiling from this judgement - or taking part in a “w h ite w a s h e s ^
some have ludicrously charged, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith repeated this conclusion in the
most strident of terms. Indeed (paragraph 100 p. 87) he referred to Chief Superintendent
Duckenfield as having uttered a “disgraceful lie” about Gate C being opened by fans, and




                                              5
 he quoted with approval Lord Taylor’s "stinging rebuke” of South Yorkshire police for
 failing to concede that they were in any respect at fault.


 26.    Lord Justice Stuart-Smith also unearthed the fact that some of the original
 statements made by individual police officers had been edited for solicitors acting for South
 Yorkshire police. At appendix 6 he gives one example. He considered whether the^w ere
however covered by legal professional privilege, and so could not be              public. He
 concluded that such privilege did not apply. In consequence, I have made every such
statement available to the Hillsborough Family Support Group, and placed copies in the
Library of the House.


27.     The new evjtfence put before Lord Justice Stuart-Smith by the television
programme and the Hillsborough Family Support Group fell principally into two areas -
video evidence, and that relating to the 3.15 pm cut-off point for the inquest.


28.    Let me deal with these in turn.


29.    First, there is the question of the missing tapes. Two tapes were stolen. Their theft
- still unsolved - has understandably heightened concerns about “cover-up”, which were
found by the extra-ordinary and pervasive denial of South Yorkshire police at the time.
But the crucial thing about these tapes is that they contained no material evidence not
otherwise available [check]. One was entirely blank as the camera concerned had been
pointing at a wall. The other showed turnstiles 9-16 at the Leppings Lane end, next to
turnstiles A-G [was there therefore other evidence, CCTV? - of this area?].             What
happened on these turnstiles was recorded on tape RJH2.


30.    Counsel for the Hillsborough Family Support Group made five submissions on
behalf of the groups, listed at paragraph 33 on p. 20.


[Summarise please]                                                                                   /
                                                                                                 /

31.    Lord Justice Stuart-Smith goes through each of the submission with great care.



                                               6
 32.    He describes submission 1 as "quite untenable” (paragraph 61), submission 2 as
 “completely unfounded” (paragraph 77), submission 3 as “unfounded” (paragraph 79),
 submission 4 as “evidence wholly insufficient to warrant consideration of criminal
 proceedings against any police officers” (paragraph 93).                            —\


 33.    As to submission 5 [paraphrase paragraph 99 please].


 34.    Lord Justice Stuart-Smith also deals with the credibility of Mr Houldsworth,
the CCTV technician who featured so prominently in the W o r l^ ^ ! r tio n programme.
He said that [.................... can’t read] was “unable to accept” that his recollection of events
now is accurate”, adding that “the importance of his evidence has been exaggerated out of
all proportion”.


Madam Speaker,


35.     The second main issue of “new evidence” related to the inquests.


36.     The use of the 3.15 pm cut-off has long been a matter of controversy to the families.
Lord Justice Stuart-Smith found no grounds to conclude that the conduct of the inquests
was flawed. He says that the cut-off point did not limit the inquiry undertaken by the
inquest and it was ^ s u g g e s te d by the coroner that all those who died did so before
3.15 pm. The inquest jury heard evidence about those who died after arrival at hospital
and of those who were treated and recovered. It was only in relation to how and by what
means the deceased came to their deaths that the cut-off time was imposed. Evidence that
some people died after 3.15 pm would not, therefore, effect the outcome of the inquest.


37.    Other allegations related to the rescue operation, and to alleged improper
interference with witnesses.


[Paraphrase conclusions here please]




                                                 7
 38.    Against this background, the question is what a further opening of full inquiries, or
inquests, or disciplinary procedures could achieve.


39.     A re-opening of Lord Taylor’s inquiry would serve no purpose, and since I
published Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s report on 18 February I have heard no^rgum en?
against that. Since there was cover-up neither by Lord Taylor nor Lord Justice Stuart-
Smith, we know already who was]to blame - the police - and thankfully Lord Taylor’s             L
recommendations about the safety of soccer grounds have already been implemented.


40.    When I talk to the bereaved families much of their anger continues to focus on the
inquests, and on the police disciplinary procedures.


41.    So far as the inquests are concerned, there was no evidence before Lord Justice
Stuart-Smith which could result in application by the Attorney General to set aside the
inquest verdicts, not least giAjgfi that the conduct of the inquests was very thoroughly
examined by the Divisional Court in 1993.


42.    But I accept, as I believe does the whole House, that inquests of this kind turn the
screw on bereaved families without adding understanding on questions of culpability.


43.    Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s report also underlined the need to make improvements
to the inquest system. In the case of Hillsborough, it was clearly unsatisfactory that the
families suffered additional distress as a result of the inquest proceedings and the jury’s
verdicts of accidental death when the causes of the disaster had already been established by
the Taylor inquiry and the DPP had announced that there would not be any prosecutions.


44.    I have made clear that the inquest system, in its present form, is unsuitable for
dealing with disasters such as Hillsborough.      The Home Office Working Group on
Disasters and Inquests, which reported in March 1997, recommended that the role of the
inquest should be limited where a public inquiry has already been held.




                                             8
45.     A comprehensive public inquiry which also addressed the questions before an
inquest would relieve the coroner of the need to resume the formal inquest. The changes
recommended by the Home Office Working Party point the right way forward and the
Government will look for a suitable legislative opportunity to amend the Coroner’s
Act 1988.


46.     It has often been asked of me, if the police were to blame, why has no police officer
been brought to book?       The only answer, very far from satisfactory, is that police
disciplinary procedures have been so defective that individual senior police officers can
utter “disgraceful lies” and .... with contemptible incompetence without penalty.


47.    As I said in my statement to the House on 18 February, I fully understand the
public disquiet that those who have been criticised by the inquiries into this disaster have
not been prosecuted or disciplined in respect of their actions. It is not possible, however, to
turn the clock back and Lord Justice Stuart-Smith is satisfied that there is no new evidence
which he considered which should be put before the Director of Public Prosecutions or
the Police Complaints Authority. I firmly believe, though, that there is a compelling case
in the light of Hillsborough and other cases for reform of the police disciplinary system.


48.    In January the Home Affairs Committee published its report into police
disciplinary and complaints procedures. The report recommended changes in a number of
key areas and I announced to the House in March that I was taking steps to implement
most of its recommendations.


49.    I have decided that the standard of proof in discipline cases should be changed from
the criminal to the civil standard and that it should be possible for officers to face both
criminal and disciplinary action on the same facts. I have also accepted the H A C 's
recommendation that we should implement a system of 'fast track1dismissal for use in the
most serious cases.


50.    In the light of the Hillsborough disaster, I have been particularly concerned to
address the serious defect in the present practice which allows a police officer to retire on



                                              9
medical grounds before discipjinary hearings can be completed. This was quite rightly an
issue of the greatest frustration to the families of the Hillsborough victims,   j
Conclusion


Madam Speaker,


51.    Ninety-six people lost their lives as a result of the disaster at Hillsborough on 15
April 1989. The lives of many others were and continue to be profoundly affected by the
events that day. 0 n e caprfot begin to understand the anguish felt by the families who lost
their loved ones in such tragic circumstances, but we have shared their determination to
establish, to the fullest extent possible, how and why their relatives died. The causes of the
disaster were clearly identified by Lord Taylor in his 1989 report. It was right to consider
whether there was any subsequent information which cast doubt on earlier decisions and I
am satisfied that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has, after rigorous examination, reached the
correct conclusions.


52.    I have taken a very close personal interest in this a s e from the start. I believe I was
right to establish the scrutiny. (My only r%ret is that the families nave not, for their own
reasons which I well understand, felt able to accept its conclusions. I do hope, however,
that, in time, they may be able to view the report in a more positive light.

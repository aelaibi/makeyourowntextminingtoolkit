We all     went      into the     pub acffci had /a couple         of drinks.         The      pub was     full

We left the pub at a b o u t \ 2 . 2 0 pffi (1420) and w a l k e d to the ground.                          The

Poli ce had shut off a number                   of side   roads,        they we re b a r r i e r e d and

there were P o l i c e m e n behind stopping              people        going    down there,

w h e n we got to the          ground entrance         there was just a mass                of    people,

you    c o u l d n ’t see where        to go.    My ticket        s ta te d that    I had to go to

t urn st il e    *8’.       I c o u l d n ’t see where    they were at all.

By this     time we'd met            up w ith a nother        f ri en d of               he was w it h his

son of about          ‘14 years,       he'd got a ticket          for    the    seats.      We    foil owed

him t hrough the            crowd and ended up in the a r e a                 in front    of T u rn s t i l e s

* A’ &     *C ’ .     I4e w a i t e d and made     sure his son was             in the g r ou n d safely.

We    then had. to         come back     out t hrough the w ro u gh t           iron gates        to keep

looking     for      our turnstiles.

We    came out and t urned             left a wf' s a w T u r ns ti l e B above       the      crowd.      I

saw a set       of wrought        i ronydgates shut             "hese were       on the     left as you

looked at the tur nstixifes.                There was one P o l i c e m a n h ol ding            the   gates.

T here was      no m o v e me nt at all.         There were        no queues at all,              it was

just a mass          of    people.      This was at about 2 . 5 0 p m           (1450).

T here were         people    getting      crushed up a g ai n st        these    gates,       in fact

         the girl w ith us, was /right by them.                         She was screaming.              I was

just a couple             of feet b^aftnd her       but there was             nothing you        could do.

Suddenly        these      gatesy/Tpened and we all            f lo od ed     in towards       the

turnstiles.           T h e ryf were    no Police Off i ce r s        or S t e w a rd s a r ou n d at al

it was     just      every man for         himself,    trying      to get to the          turnstilei

'•There were           people      on top of        the turns t i l e s        throwing           complete            unchecKsd

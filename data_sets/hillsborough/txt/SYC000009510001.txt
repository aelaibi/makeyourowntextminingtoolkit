   NOTES

1 Modify this as necessary according to whether the
  inquest is held with or without a jury or partly
  with and partly without a jury.

2 In the case of a death from natural causes or from
  industrial disease, want of attention at birth, chronic
  alcoholism or addiction to drugs insert the immediate
  cause of death and morbid conditions (if any) giving                   Date             19
  rise to the immediate cause of death.

3 Omit this if the cause of death is one to which
  Note 2 applies.

4 a Where the cause of death is one to which Note 2
    applies, it is suggested that one of the following
    forms be adopted:
     C.D. died from natural causes.
                                                                         Re
     C.D. died from the industrial disease of

     C.D. died from dependence on drugs/non-dependable
     on drugs.                                                                                 v.


     C.D. died from want of attention at birth.

     (In any of the above cases, but in no other, it is
     suggested that the following words may, where
     appropriate, be added:
     "and the cause of death was aggravated by lack of                   Cause of death
     care/self-neglect').

  b In any other case except murder, manslaughter,
    infanticide or stillbirth, it is suggested that one
    of the following forms be adopted:

     C.D. killed himself/herself (whilst the balance of
     his/her mind was disturbed).

    C.D. died as the result of an attempted/self­
    induced abortion.                                                    Verdict
    C.D. died as the result of an accident/misadventure.
    C.D. was killed lawfully.

    Open verdict, namely, the evidence did not fully or
    further disclose the means whereby the cause of death
    arose.

  c In the case of murder, manslaughter or infanticide
    it is suggested that the following form be adopted.

    C.D. was killed unlawfully.

  d In the case of a stillbirth insert 'stillbirth' and do not
    complete the remainder of the form.

         Mr & Mrs S Roberts,




         Dear Mr.   & Mrs. Roberts,

         Hillsborough Inquests

         Thank you for your letter of the 26th March, 1992.  I am sorry for the slight
         delay in replying but I have only returned to the office in the past couple
         of days having been absent on leave.

         I gather that the South Yorkshire Police are in fact in the process of
         despatching the statements that you have requested and that in all
         probability these will be going out in the post to you today.

         However, if for any reason these statements do not arrive or there is any
         other difficulty please feel free to contact me again.



         Yours   sincerely,

Dear Sirs,

Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.



If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of w h o m you represent,
on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m.  Details of venue will be notified in
due course.

I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

Subject to the C o r o n e r s ’ Act 1988 and the C o r o n e r s ’ Rules, the Inquest is
u nder my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
witnesses who wish to give evidence.          I am at present engaged in considering
this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me to
consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

Ma y I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision as
to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
he ard from you by the end of September I will assume you have no names to
submit.

Yot         aithfully,
                                                            29th August      90

         Dear Sirs,

         Re: HILLSBOROUGH INQUESTS - GRAHAM JOHN ROBERTS.

         Thank you for your letter of the 24th of August.  It was made clear that the
         full statements relating to various witnesses would not be available and
         nothing has changed to alter this.

         Whether at some point in the future this view can be revised^, I do not yet
         know.

         Yours faithfully,

    MONDAY 30th APRIL, at 3:30 p.nu      !------- —

    We thank you for your letter of the 6 th April, last and as our Mr Cowan
    is presently away from the Office on holiday, we are unfortunately
    unable to confirm whether or not he intends personally to attend the
    Inquest in relation to the above.

             return from holiday on the 2§th April next, we shall ensure
    that the papers are placed before him, so that he may corrmunicate with
    you, prior to the hearing date.

   In the mean time, we have ascertained from the deceased's father that
   both he and Mrs Roberts will be attending the Inquest, together with
                   4-t!f deceased's fiance, her brother^ilaw who was at
            ^    Mat^h * * * the Social Worker who has teen assisting the
   family. There will therefore be a party of six attending.

   S            Wf und^rstand from the Hillsborough Steering Cormdttee
   that details of questions arising from the Surmiary by our client should
   be notified to you in advance.

   We therefore enclose a number of questions on the attached sheet, but
   again, should be grateful if you would bear with us, and if any further
   questions arise upon Mr Cowan's return from holiday, we shall ask him
   to tax them through to you as soon as possible.

  We thank you for your assistance.

   Your^-fflithfully

             INQUEST ; MONDAY 30th APRIL, 1990 at 3:30 p.m.



Questions arising from Summary - Reference Number 79


1.    In paragraph 16 of the Surrmary it is stated that Police Constable

1715 Best helped to carry Mr Roberts into Leppings Lane and at that

time believed Mr Roberts to be breathing.   Despite this, he left Mr

Roberts to assist others.   Why was no basic first aid carried out by

the Officer, and why was Mr Roberts left without attention ?

Did the   lack of provision by the Officer of essential first aid such

as placing Mr Roberts in a recovery position, loosening his clothing

and providing mouth to mouth resuscitation, contribute to Mr Roberts'

death*!

2.   Police Constable 620 Yates in paragraph 15 of the Sutrmary is stated

to have formed the view that when he saw Mr Roberts at the rear of

the West Stand, he had formed the opinion that Mr Roberts was dead,.

and therefore left him where he had found him.     However, Police Constable

1715 Best has stated that when he found Mr Roberts at the rear of the

West Stand, he believed him to be breathing.      These Statements are

clearly in conflict. What steps were taken by the two Officers in

question to ensure that they had reached the correct assumption as

to Mr Roberts' state at that time ?

He.           GS 1 1 M JOHN ROMEO'S (deceased) So.79.

As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
on the 15th of January 1990.

I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not- to resume the
Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
he may wish to undertake.

I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
a substantial period of time before I iam in a position to communicate
on this matter further.

 I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
 is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
 fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

 Yours faithfully,

I refer to your recent conversation with Superintendent
Sleath concerning the release of the deceased persons from
the Hillsborough incident to their respective next of kin,
following the adjournment of the inquest.

After consultation with Professor Usher, I have no objection
to this course of action.

   Dear Sirs

   Re ; HILLSBOROUGH INQUESTS - GRAHAM JOHN ROBERTS
   MONDAY 30th APRIL, at 3;30 p.m7      ---------

   We thank you for your letter of the 6th April, last and as our Mr Cowan
   is presently away,from the Office on holiday, we are unfortunately
   unable to confirm whether or not he intends personally to attend the
   Inquest in relation to the above.

   Upon his return from holiday on the 2$th April next, we shall ensure
   that the papers are placed before him, so that he may communicate with
   you, prior to the hearing date.

   In the mean time, we have ascertained from the deceased's father that
   both he and Mrs Roberts will be attending the Inquest, together with
   their daughter, the deceased's fiance, her brother-in-law who was at
   the Football Match and the Social Worker who has been assisting the
   family. There will therefore, be a party of six attending.

Questions arising from Summary - Reference Number 79


1.   In paragraph 16 of the Summary it is stated that Police Constable

1715 Best helped to carry Mr Roberts into Leppings Lane and at that

time believed Mr Roberts to be breathing.    Despite this, he left Mr

Roberts to assist others.    Why was no basic first aid carried out by

the Officer, and why was Mr Roberts left without attention ?

Did the   lack of provision by the Officer of essential first aid such

as placing Mr Roberts in a recovery position, loosening his clothing

and providing mouth to mouth resuscitation, contribute to Mr Roberts'

death*!

2.   Police Constable 620 Yates in paragraph 15 of the Summary is stated

to have formed the view that when he saw Mr Roberts at the rear of

the West Stand, he had formed the opinion that Mr Roberts was dead,,

and therefore left him where he had found him.     However, Police Constable

1715 Best has stated that when he found Mr Roberts at the rear of the

West Stand, he believed him to be breathing.      These Statements are

clearly in conflict.   What steps were taken by the two Officers in

question to ensure that they had reached the correct assumption as

 to Mr Roberts' state at that time ?

                hours       at    the       Road Traffic                Office,        Main      Street,       Rotherham.             From     there

                I drove          an    unmarked               van w h i c h was        identified         as    number      4    to

               Brightside              Lane        Driving            School       where       Superintendent          Brougham         held a

                parade       and       issued            instructions.

               My     duties          for    that            day were        the    transportation             of P C ’s to       various
                                                        4.                                .


                point       duties          at     the P a r k w a y a n d W i c k e r           area.      I returned           to

               Brightside              Lane        on        stand     by a n d     then       conveyed     other      officers         to

               Commercial              Street           due      to    traffic       congestion.

                I then       returned              to        the a b o v e    p oi n t s ,     collected       the    officers         and

                returned          them       to B r i g h t s i d e          Lane    for       meal.

               As     they were             waiting             in    line    for    their       meal    I heard       ov e r    a Police

                radio       "Operation              Support".

               As     a   result        of       this         I attended           at m y      vehicle    and attended            in    convoy

               to     the    Hillsborough                     Football        Ground with          the    officers         who    had       been     on

                point       duty.

                 n arrival             at    the        ground         the    officers          went    in a n d     I parked         the

               vehicle           outside.               I returned            to    the       ground and went         to    the       stand

               where        I saw       that        officers            were       assisting       at    the L e p p i n g s     Lane       end.       I

             went    onto      the     pitch where            I assisted             in f i r s t      aid     to a n      injured man

             and went         and     directed          an ambulance            onto     t he      p i t c h as      it w a s    apparent

             that    he w a s        seriously          injured.          This       m a n was      conveyed          of f    the    pitch

             by ambulance.              I then assisted with                     t he    injured          people        that     had      been

             .carried a c r o s s       the       pitch     to     the    side       near     to    the P o l i c e        O f f ice.      A

             number      of    these        men.pre         dead and           their     friends          and     relatives          were

            abusive        and       very     upset.        Someone           said    that       all     the    bodies        w h i c h were

             al l   over      the     ground        were    to     be    carried        i nt o     the    gymnasium and              I

             assisted         with     t h is .

             In the      gymnasium            I assisted           handing       out     body       bags       and    for     one    of    the

             deceased,         I obtained a Priest                      who    stated       he w a s      f r o m R o t h e r h a m who

             said    a   prayer        over       the    deceased who            was     unidentified.

             I returned          to    th e    ground where              I assisted           by g i v i n g      first       aid    where,

             required.           ■

             Shortly       after       I collected            the       officers        that       I had       transported           and

             conveyed         them     to     their      Relevant         points        but      they were           not     r e q u i r e d as

             th e   traffic          flow     was    q ui e t .     I returned with                 these       men     to B r i g h t s i d e

             Lane    where       we    were       stood     down.         I transported                these      officers          to    the

             Attercliffe             Police       Station         and    then    r e t u r n e d to M a i n S t r e e t          and      off

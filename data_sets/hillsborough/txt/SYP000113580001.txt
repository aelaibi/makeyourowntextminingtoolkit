              I am Police C on st a b l e 3253 G i l l i a n C A M P B E L L and            I work      in the

             D i v i si on C o m mu ni ty L ia i s o n Department,          based at E c c l e s f i e l d

             Divisi onal        Headquarters.

              I came on duty at 9 am on Saturday,                       15th April        1989,     and      I went    to

              the gy m n a s i u m at S h ef fi el d W e d n e s d a y Football         Ground,       Hillsborough.

              I there met        Inspector Be nnett who was working as L o g i s t i c s Officer

             and to who m        I was      responsible        for   that d a y ’s duties.            I had

              previo usly been          informed that my m a i n duties                for the day would

              involve     the    recording and             custody of    property taken from supporters

              from the L e p pings Lane End of the                   ground     i.e.    the    ' L i v e r p o o l ’ side,

             ac c om p a ni ed by Police Se rgeant              1153 Booth.         After a briefing             by

              Inspector Bennett             I then carried out           some a d m i n i s t r a t i v e    duties    in

              the gy m n a s i u m until          I a t t e n d e d at the mai n briefing         for all

              officers.         This    took       place    in the N o r t h Stand.        Fol l o w i n g    this Police

             The      po rtacabin was        situated at the          rear of the West Stand,                  adjacent

              to the fence         that     runs from the         rear of turnstiles             1-9, and Gate A to

              the N orth Stand.            The      p o rtacabin was     situated a p p r o x i m a t e l y 4- yards

         West Stand enclosure,                    with the door facing              towards       the gate.          The

         w i n d o w to the      left       of the       cabin    looked out        onto the          rear    of

         turnstiles         1-9 and Gate A,               the w i n d o w to the        right     looked out onto

          the    ladies     toilet         situated at the          far    left of the stand.

         Police Sergeant B o o t h and                   I mads    preparations          to     receive       property

         from     12 noon when             the turnstiles          opened.

         Gate A was         shut at         this    time and once          the turnstiles              were    opened a

         steady stream of supporters were                          coming      through to             the N o r t h Stand.

         At this time e v erything a p p e a r e d to be following a                                  similar      pattern to

         the     previous y e a r ’s semi-final,                  on which day          I had         also    performed

MS C.L   by PC Wright          of El Sub Division.                                i t e was h elping           to carry a

          boy,    a p pr ox im at el y      15^^e|a£^CKUl, who a p p e a r e d to be                  i^na    collapsed

         ^5uj^eH^e£S_ a n d I noticed his breathing was                           very        laboured.        He was

          fully    conscious         though weak and              I a s s i s t e d him to use          the    'ventolin5

          spray.       I then sat with him until_he                       r e c o v e r ed.     The    boy was

         years.        Police S e r g e a n t B o o t h and         1 began a c o n v e rsation with this

         man.      The man       informed us that there was a huge                             crowd of       people

          outside      on L e p pings           Lane.     S e r geant Booth        looked at          his w a t c h and

          commented that           it was         only 2.40       pm and there was              still       plenty   of time

          for    people     to get         into the ground.            The            seemed i | L i r U ^ h a k e n and

                                                                                                                   T hey   left

          a short time          later.

          I looked out of the                   portacabin window,           facing onto              the    turnstiles.       1

          saw more Police Officers were                        going   into the back of the turnstiles,

          and that       people a p p e a r e d to be            coming    through the turnstiles

          e x t remely slowly,             as    if there was a problem with them getting

                                                                                                            R2S5

through.         I went       outside the           p ortacabin and faced towards                 the

turnstiles.                I was    immediately aware              of a great      deal     of noise       coming

from the other               side    of the turnstiles.

I saw a young woman,,                  about 20 years,             come out of one of the

turnstiles,            she was       holding        her hand to the side of her face and was

quite      unsteady on her feet.                     I called to her and offered assistance.

She    showed me a large graze                      on her    left    cheek which was            bleeding

slightly.             She    said she had been forced up against                         the side        of the

turnstiles            by the crush of              people    on Leppings Lane.             She    said she was

really frightened.                   She began to cry.               A male     companion then            came

behind her and               led her away           towards       the N orth Stand.

I noticed more               people      corning through           the turnstiles         in obvious        states

of distress.

S o m eti me while           this was        happening       1 became a w ^ ^ ^ ^ f ^ ^ ^ u d ^ ^ ^ n g ^ i g    om^

Gate A, as            if large       numbers       of people were          hitting       it wit h       their

hands      or fists.            I could hear          voices       shouting     "For Christ         sake    o pen

the gates"            "Let us       in you bastards."               The   gate seemed to move              inwards

a nd upwards           from the        pressure       on it and       I was sure         it w o u l d    collapse.

I saw two young men,                   .in their      teens,      appear     on top of the wall             at    the

far    corner of Gate A.                   They     lowered themselves            over    the top and

jumped down to the side where                         I was.        There were 2 or 3 stewards

standing at the Gate.                      I then saw a cordon of Police O f f i c e r s                   being

formed at            the    rear    of the turnstiles,              behind Gate A.             They were

blocking        off any access along                  the back       of the turnstiles.                 As they

were     positioning           themselves           I saw G ate A o pen,          but    I could Tiojl_see_

who    opened         it.     S up p o r t e r s   poured through         in large       numhers-,       I was

shocked at how many                  people were        trying       to   rush in.

E ve r y t h i n g    seemed to become e x t remely                 confused at         this    time.

Sergeant i3ooth joined me outside                           the    portacabin and we went                to the

gate     in the        fence       dissecting        the N orth Stand entrance and West Stand
                                                                                                    page;
                                                                                                    R2S5

enclosure.      Fans    came to the gate            requesting        entry    into       the West

Stand.    C o n v e rs el y fans were a p p r o a c h i n g    from behind wit h N orth Stand

tickets wanting access           through the gate             into    the North S tand            entrance.

As the fans were        entering      through Gate A they started                    to    run and were

pushing   each other        in the back.        About      this      time   I heard a cheer go

up from the fans a lr ea dy         in the stands,.            It    really s u r p r i s e d me and           I

thought   the   teams must       be coming      out onto        the    pitch,       and that       there

were   still a lot of        people    trying       to get     into the Football             Ground.

As soon as the       fans    heard the      cheer     they started to run faster and

push each o t h er m o re.

At this time the        stewards      on the    small      gate where         I was       standing

seemed to be getting           very a g i t a t e d and flustered.            S e r geant B ooth was

vetting   tickets      for them and        1 was     helping to let fans thro u g h the

gate   in both directions.            I then saw a man about 3 5-40 years                         on the

roof   of the   programme       sellers     portacabin,         which was about             10-15 yards

away from us,       on the other       side    of the      fence.       He was       pulling a youth

up beside    him.      The young man was about                14 years      old.      I ran towards

them and told them to get             down.        I was   very worr i e d for the youths

s afety as   there     is barbed wire along            the top of the fence                 and    I

thought   he might      fail    on it.      The man told me to."Fuck                  off".        He    said

he was    going to jump over the fence and                    1 couldn't stop him.                 I told

him not to be so stupid and to go                   round to the gate where                 I w ould      let

him through     if his      ticket was      for the West Stand.                He    climbed down

and helped the young man down.

As   I turned awa y from the fence             I

coming towards me up the tunnel                at the edge of the West Stand.                           They

were   carrying a young man with t he n ^ w h o a & o e ^ j ^ d             to be     in a collapsed

state.     I went    to assist      him.      The    fans were        going    to lower       the young

man to the floor at the side wall                   of the West Stand           but       I saw    it was

very wet along       the wall      and that        liquid was        pouring down the Wall
                                                                                                      PAGE          5
                                                                                                      R283

from the    c o rrugated        panels       of the stand.           I immediately    noticed there

was an ext r e m e l y unpleasant            and strong        smell    of urine    coming     from

this wall.        I requested the young men move the fan to the                         fence,

wh i c h they did.          At first     the man was          conscious    but very weak.              He

complained of pain to his                chest and stomach.              He said his name was

                        and that        he wo r k e d at the                           Waterloo.

He then said;          "There are       people     dead and dying out there,            just          Ilk

at Heysel."        At this       time    I thought        he          was hysterical,       but       he kept

repeating    this.          He then     c omplained       of    feeling    sick and    I told him to

lie down         with his      head to one side. I helped him into the                   recovery

position         and   I noticed        his head and hair were steaming.               I suddenly

became aware       that his breathing was               very shallow,        and then       I c o u l d n ’t

hear    it at all.          I felt for a pulse which was very f l u t t ery and

erratic.    I cleared out his mouth and then turned him onto                            his back

and gave him m ou t h to m o u t h resuscitation.                      While I was   b ending          over

Mr.I      I,became               aware of someone             very     close behind me.           I    heard

a voice    say          u

in the base of          my spine as          if I had b e e n k i c k e d . Two    or three           of the
                                                                  ■■muss*'
men with Mr                       went round behind me               I was aware     of them

standing    close to me           as    if      protecting me.           I heard one         says          " D o n ’t

w o r ry girl,    h e ’s gone."         Mr                    began to breathe on his own.                      I

returned him to the             recovery       position.        When    I had just    e x a mined Mr

            I asked         S e r geant B ooth to      request an ambulance,           on the

Police    radio.        I heard him calling and speech                   coming    back through the

radio,    but S e r geant B ooth         indicated       he    could not get a reply.                 He

said that    he would         go to the g ym n a s i u m or Police          room and    request             one

from there.

After    I had    r e s u s citated Mr,                       I heard sirens       coming    up

L e p pin gs Lane and        then they a p p eared        to stop.        I realised they would

be ambulances.              I looked for Sgt.         B o o t h but    I could not see       him.           I

        fsit    that    I must       get Mr,                      to Leppi n g s Lane     for medical

        assistance.

                                          I asked some men who were                  standing
                                                                                            if near
                                                                                                they Mr.
                                                                                                      could

        assist me to carry him to L e p pings Lane.                           They    lifted     him very

        carefully.        I noticed that two of them smelled very s t r o n g l y of

        intoxicating          liquor.        One of these was           very unsteady on his feet and

        a p p e a re d drunk.        I persuaded          him to move away and asked                 someone       else

        to assist       me.

        Mr.                   was    carried behind the             stands and out onto the                 road on

        Leppin gs Lane         next     to t h e river.           I saw there were a lot of                 people
                                                   WK
        lying or sitting             in the       road.     Some were very obv i o u s l y           injured.          The

        men    carrying Mr                          placed him on the           road next        to the       river

        bank.      I saw there were other                  people    lying     there.     At this         time Mr.

                         condition d et er io ra te d again and he lost                       unco n s c i o u s n e s s

        His    breathing       stopped a gain and            I resuscitated him again.                    Whilst       I

        was    doing    this several          firemen       rushed towards the           injured        people.

        One    came to Mr                         and a d m i n i s t e r e d oxygen from a small

        cylinder       to him.        This    revived Mr                             I stepped       back     to help

        turn    him over and           I stood on s o m e o n e ’s jacket            behind me.          I turned          to

        ap olog ise and I realised the                    person,    a young man about 2 0 - 2 5 years                     of
uni &   age was dead.           I looked along             the    line of     people who were           lying on

        the    road,    next to the          river    bank and       I saw that they all a p p e a r e d to

        be dead.        I counted S people                lying    in the     road.     I was totally

        shocked.        I then heard          people at the          other     side of me and turned to

        see    some Police          O f f icers    lowering another           body to the floor.               The

        deceased had a denim jacket                   over       his face..

        A   line of a mb u l a n c e s     drew up in the           road.      I tried to get Mr.

        to one of them but              I could not attract             the a t t e n t i o n of an ambulance

        officer.        Just    then a line of Police O f f i c e r s                formed     in front of the

        bodies,     between myself and the ambulances.                          I began to get worr i e d
that       I could not a tt r a c t anyone *s a t tention.                       A Doctor        came to

exam i n e Mr                        an d while         he waf> there         I went       to ask       some Police

Officers        to Help me move Mr                                   nearer to the a m b u l a n c e s

I n spector S yk es d ep u t e d some o f f i c e r s to                 carry Mr*                        over the

road.         The y   placed him with a large group of people who all a p p e a r e d

injured.          A lot of them were                 crying and moaning.                  A nurse       carfie to me

and said sh e w o u l d help Mr                                      to an ambulance.            At     that moment

I saw two a m b u l a n c e         o f f icers ar r i v e       wit h a stretcher.              They     lifted Mr,

                onto     it and      I returned b eh i n d the               stands       to the Portacabin,

wh e r e    I a g a i n met     up w i t h S e rg ea nt         1153 Booth.           I e x p l a i n e d to him

what       had t aken      place.

There       were a large          number        of people m i l l i n g about             the area at this

time.         Some    were    being        very a b u s i v e    towards      us,     calling      us "bastards",

"fucking m ur d e r e r s . "

I informed S e r g e a n t B o o th that                I was a member           of both the C a s u a l t y

B u r ea u and H o s pital          L ia is on     team.        He   d i r e c t e d me to the gymnasium.

'As"I      e nte r e d the    g ym na s i u m    I could not           believe      the situation.             There

seemed to be bodies                 all     over    the    floor.       Some     of them were            covered.in

w hite      cloths,      some    not.

1 saw       Inspector        Sewell        and told him where               I should       be.     He    said that

Inspector Bennett,               Po l i c e C o n s t a b l e F l e t c h e r and other          officers        had

already        left    for    the hospitals,              and that       I was needed in the gymnasium.

He    then d i re ct ed me          to Police S e rg ea nt Fidler,                  who    i n s t r u c t e d me how

to take        d es cr ip ti on s    of each body for                identification           purposes.          At

this       ti'me Inspector          Char l e s     a n n o u n c e d that   one Police Officer must                      be

d ep ut e d to stay w i t h one              body.        The    d e c e a s e d were     laid   in rows and as

I took a d e s c r i p t i o n       of e a ch one         I gave      the body a. number.

For     the    remainder        of my duty          I per f o r m e d similar.tasks,              all     connected

with the        i de nt if i c a t i o n    of* the deceased,           under       the d i r e c t i o n of

In s pector Charles.                I worked with Sergeant                  F i d l e r , S e r g e a n t S ^ w e l 1,

        Police C o n stable     Shelton,     De t e c t i v e Con s t a b l e Lewin.    Photographs

        were     taken of the    d e c e a s e d ’s faces and shown to relatives               in another

         part of the gymnasium.           Bodies were         then taken for       id e n t i f i c a t i o n by

         relatives and friends.

        Late S a t u r d a y night,   early Sunday morning,             16th April      1989,     bodies

        w hich were    still    u ni de n t i f i e d were   g r a d u a l l y taken to the Medico

        Legal     Centre,   W a t e r y Street.

         I remember    d i s t i n c t ly that the bodies       seemed to arrive          in the

         gymnasium    in three     distinct       groups.      There were     those who        had been

         brought    straight    to the gym from the            pitch,   those who had been              placed

         on the    road at Leppings       Lane,     and those who        had died either          on their

         way to or    in Hospital.        The     third group did not arrive             until      much

         later    in the evening.

         I f i n i s he d my duty at 2 .30 am Sunday,            16th April     1989.       I returned to

         work at    10 am that     date and together           with Police Con s t a b l e Shel t o n

         and    Inspector Charles       I continued duties as            part of the C o r o n e r ’s

         enqui ry team.

     minu t e s     to three           <1438 hrs),           I found my       brother and           then we went

     towards a tunnel                  which     led to the          terraces.         As we were        going      througn

     the     tunnel       we had a          fairly      free      passage     up until        we    came to the        end      oi

     it and met           the     back      of the      crowd,,      It was        like a wall        of people.           As

     we got here we went                    to our      left and       down the        terraces,         I was       just
VC
     being        carried along             by the      crowd and had to go with the                     flow.        Feopl«

     were     s t i.11    co m i n g     i n from the          back.



     It was        just after            the     kick    off    of the game and             I was about half way

     down     the    terrace,.           The     pressure       of    the    crowd was        building       up.      It wai

     about        this    time.         I heard a young              lad behind me.            He was s h o u t i n g       an*:

     screaming           that     he    couldn't        breathe.        I turned my          head and told him tc

     calm down,           I eouldn* t move my                  arms at all.



     This    young        lad was        continuing            to scream and his            head     was rolling

     ar o u n d    I think        he     lost     consciousness. / I managed                  to get my right arm

     up an d out and took                   hold of this y o u ™             lad's     hair and held his             head

     up.     He was        very white            faced and he either                fainted or died.               The

     pressure        of the          crowd was        getting worse           so    I decided        to get     out.        The

     young        lad whose          hair      I had been holding was a faout                  16 year s o 1d , he he

     f a 1 r short        ha i r .      I c o u l d n ’t see what           he was wearing.             B a s i c a l l y he

     had his head back                  trying      to suck       the air      in.



     Whe n   I decided            to get       near     the    front    of the        terraces       I got across           the

     top of        people       towards a g^te w h i c h was                 open,.         I got   t hrough       this gate

     onto    the     pitch.            W hen    I was    getting       thro u g h     the    gate a P o 1 i c e ma n t o I cl

     rne to get          back     1 n the       ;(ro w d .    I told him       1 c o u l d n ’t and that           people

     were    dying.          I just         pushed      passed this P o l i c e m a n        further       onto     the
I   looked         back          at    the       terraces.            I   could      see    people       pushed         right    up

against           the wire             of the fence.                  I went        to the     fence         I was      telling

p e o p 1e to keep b r eathing and that                                   the     c r a wd w o u 1d ea s e b a c k .           I thin

I must        have          been trying                to    convince myself               that    the       crush would ease

but    it didn't,                     I can       remember a fellow with a thick                              jumper      on.     He

was    pushed           right          up against              the    fence.         I was     telling         him to keep

time     there was                bodies          lying        on the      pitch,,         .1 looked to see              if my

brother           was       one of them?                   bu'o he w a s n ’t,         I went      back       to the      ter race

Some     fans          were       trying          to       kick    the    fencing       and    I told         a Policeman         to

kick     at       the       fence          near       to    where     i t ’s    spot    welded,         which     they     did    and

kicked        a    portion             of    the       fence       in a n d     pulled      some       people     out.         Somehow

I lost        sight          of       my    brother          again.       So      I searched           the    pitch,      I found

him    si 11 i ng           on    the       pi t c h »       We    were   both       shocked       and       stunned,          I just

couldn't           do       anything             to    help.         M y /brother       helped         carry    the      dead    and

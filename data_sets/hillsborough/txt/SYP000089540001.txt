                   On Saturday 15 April                       1989           0489) Liverpool were to play Nottingham

                   Forest at Hillsborough Jgiadium in Sheffield, in the semi final of the

                   FA Cup competition.                        It was my intention to travel to Sheffield to

The               bj^tfXhers both had t i eke        or the stand for this match.

I collected the lads around 8.30 am <0830)                 on match day,     from their

home addresses.            I was driving my own car a Ford F iest^x-,Xl^2^ffiodel .

On the way to Sheffield I got lost and^_I did not have a map with me,

eventually we got directed on to^tfe Snj^k^                           ask i ng a Po 1 i ceman

The four of us met some friends from j A v e r p o o l in a pub,             I c a n ’t

not know the third lad.               These 3 lads all had tickets for the game for

 the stand area.

We had pies and sandwiches              in the pub and a few drinks.         About 2 pm

(1400) my 3 friends and I left the other 3 lads_ in the pub and set off

 to walk to the ground.

     I had heard the sound of fire service sirens as I approached the

     Labour club but did not associate the sirens with any great problem at

     the ground.

     I left this club b e t w ^ n 3.30 (1530) - ^ < 5              (1545? a nd returned to my

     I did not witness any acts of d i s o r d e j ^ t h a t       day while standing outside

     a great rush of people to get^/i nto the oiound through this g a t e .

     inside the ground.              There was about 4 or 5       Policemen trying to close

     these concertina gates, and once the horses arrived they managed to

     shut the gates.             I imagine that most of those who entered this way had

            At Sam     (0800)       on S a t u r d a y   15 April      1989     (150489)           I came on duty at my

            At     the ground we were            brie f e d and       I was a t t a c h e d to %er- \a i         59 w h i c h

            supporters.
                                                                                                       P AGE

At this         time we were m a in ly         involved with the N o t t i n g h a m Forest

su p p o rt er s who were g e n e ra ll y well             behaved a l t h o u g h     it was      quite

a p p a re nt    that many had been drinking and m any were drinking                                from    cans

as    they made       their way to the ground™



The     only     incident    prior     to the m atch that            r e q u i r e d us to    leave    the

a r e a we were       patrolling was           that a public         house       further along

P e ni st on e Rd     in the d i re ct io n of the           city    centre was          having     problems

with     s u pporters      but we were         c a ncelled      prior     to our a r r i v a l .



S ho r t l y after 3pm       (1.500) we were          told      to make         our way to the g r o u n d as

there was         some    problem ex ac t l y what          is not     clear       but there was       some

talk     of a gate        collapsing and a pitch               invas i o n      so we made      our way with

other memb e r s         of the serial         back towards         the ground and went              into    the

ground       through the gate w hi c h gives access                    to the Police Room.                  There

we a w a i t e d deployment         stood by the           side of the Kop.



After 5 or         10 minutes we were d e p l o y e d           in frja'ntTof the Kop to              contain

the N o t t i n g h a m Forest      fans who were d n c ^ / a g a i n           r easonably well       behaved

consid e r i n g     they did not know what was h a p p e n i n g a l t h o u g h               neither      did

we until         1 saw    injured    people        being    carried from the other                 end of    the

gr o u n d   in large numbers and Liverpool                     fans      came    to the Kop end       to

remove a d ve rt is in g      hordings         to use as        stretchers.



I r e m ained on this         d ep l o y m e n t   t h roughout     the    incident and saw           little

or none         of the events w hi ch had o c c u r r e d at              the    other    end of the

g round,



Whe n    it was a n n o u n ce d    that     the m at c h had been a b a n d o n e d         I r e t urned    to

the P e ni st on e Rd as the N o t t i n g h a m Forest              fans       departed.          After    the
                                                                                                page:

             vast m a j o ri ty had   left we were asked to      return to the N orth S t a n d     from

             w here we were    e v e nt ua ll y d i r ected to go to C l a y w h e e 1s Ln where we were

             fed and then stood down and          conveyed back    to D o ncaster and from there

             I was    transported     to my own s e c t i o n from where   I went   off duty at 7pm

             (1900)    the same   day.

           Our       tickets were £ 1 4 . 0 0 p      seating        tickets           for    the North Stand.                We

            t r a v e l l e d down to S h e f f i e l d       stopping      once for          refreshments at a

            motorway       service area.           There was a slight                   delay on the m ot o r w a y for

road works and we a r r i v e d at about                1,30       pm   (1330).

We    parked about a mile            from the        ground and         walked to the stadium.                      I

knew where       the ground was and ws arri v e d at about 2.20                             pm (1420).          I

did not     see any heavy drinking.

We entered the North Stand                  via a turnstile             in Leppings LN.             There were

no queues at the turnstiles                  and a l t h o u g h    I   was   not,    some of       our

party was       searched      by a Police Officer as we                   entered      I had no problems

in finding my seat,            as each of the           blocks were           lettered.       I witnessed

no drinking       or any disorder            between entering.                The    ground and the

m a t c h starting.

I took my seat at about 2 .40                  pm    (1440)    in the North Stand              near       to the

L e p p i n g s LN stand.      I noticed that           the middle         two sections            became

very    crowded,      but    that    the    two sections           one on either side              of the

middle    two    pens had      space       left.      These    gaps      remained even after               the

start    of the match a l th o u g h         from my       position the middle               two    pens    (Pen

3 & 4)    looked      crowded.        W hilst waiting          for      the game to start            I noticed

one    or two    people      on the     dividing       fence       between the        far    pen    (Pen 3)

and the far wing            (Per. 2).       I only noticed them up there                     1 cannot       say

i f they wer e c 1 imbi ng from one                 pen to anothe r .

Prior    to kick off         1 witnessed        no surges          or other      problems      in the

middle    two    standing Pens          of the Leppings             LN stand.

S h o r t l y after   the kick      off     1 noticed        one    or two fans had got onto the

pitch at     the back        of the     goal at       the Leppings LN end.                  I saw one of

the fans go up to the Liverpool                     goal     keeper,      gesticulating.             At    this

stage    I put    it down to         crowd trouble.            I saw a P o l i c e m a n      direct       some

of these     fans to the        free area at           the    side      of the      nearest    pen    (Pen 6).

I carried on watching               the game and the           next thing           I noticed was a man

walk    past our stand w ith a twisted arm.                         I carried on w a t ching              the

game    but glancing         towards       the Leppings        LN stand.            It seemed that more

and more     people were        coming       onto the        pitch but        I cannot      recall        a gate

                                                                                                    S635

being    opened,          I didn't    see any        crowd surges          in the Leppings        LN stand

but    I did see        people    be i ng    p u 3.1 eci up f rorn the middle         of the L e p pings

LN stand area up to the                seating area             by the    spectators    up there.

The Leppings LN standing                  area was        so full       I d i d n ’t realise   there were

two    central     pens.

The    game was       stopped and w hen we saw a fan being                       carried   past our

stand with his            face    covered and his arm hanging                  down   I realised things

were more        serious     than just           crowd    problems and decided to see              if we

as doctors        c o u 1 g as s is C ,

We as a group made               our way down to the Police and were                     d i r e cted to the

gym area.        We     identified ourselves               as doctors.         I tried to      revive     the

fan we had seen st r e t c h e r e d off with                                    but we were too         late,

M ore and more          people were arriving               on stretchers with friends              and    fans

who    had    carried them.          The whole           scene    became     very confusing       with

people       screaming and some arguing with the Police.                              I tried to assist

wit h some       others     but    could only give m outh to m outh or                   cardiac massage,

I was    event u a l l y directed to the                 gym.     The    g y mnasium had been split

into     two areas        one with        live    casualties who          I tried to assist.           The

othe r section had           peo p 1e who we re obv i ous 1y d e a d .

A fter assisting with others,                     in the    casualty       section of the gym n a s i u m

I. was    e ventually asked by a Police Officer                          to attend three       of the

bodies       in the second         section        (Temporary M o r t u a r y ).

The    first     uody     I saw was        that    of a white       l a d y , 24 yrs,    o b e s e , wearing

unde r c 1o t h i n g »    I certified her death at                 1625 hrs on S a t u r d a y    15th

April     1989    (150489)        in the     gymnasium of the H i l l s b o r o u g h      football

ground,       She f f i e l d to PC 1403 JONES            (Body no.       18 Paula Ann S H I T H bn,

27,7.63       (27071963),

I then examined two more                   bodies     both of young males white,               18/19

years.        I cannot      recall        their    clothing       or anything      else about      them.        I

certified them both dead at about                         1630 hours        to a Police Offi c e r       but    I
                                                                                                          PAGE
                                                                                                          S635

             d o n ’t know who that was.

             I believe            both bodies   had been seen by another          doctor    earlier.

             A Police Officer            took my details at         the time   of c e r t i f i c a t i o n on each

             of the three            dead bodies      I examined.

             I left the ground            between 4.30      pm and 4.40    pm after      offering all        the

             a ss i s t a n c e    I could as a doctor and with the            equipment available.

                                                                                         I Roberts S I G N E D

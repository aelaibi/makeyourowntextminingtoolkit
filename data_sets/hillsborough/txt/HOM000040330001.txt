 turnstile 12.   The explanation given for this was that signs for the

 North Stand had been wrongly fixed in place on the outside wall.

This effectively increased the turnstile capacity for the North Stand

 by two and reduced the West Stand turnstile capacity by TgiurZ ~tvJc>

 During the first hour together with PC Larkin I assisted PS Morgan

 'F' Division and two officers on his serial outside the turnstiles to

escort two 'Ticket Touts' to the Police Room.     These two men had

 several hundred pounds in cash and a large quantity of tickets in

their possession.    Having assisted to escort these two men to the

Police room myself and PC Larkin resumed to our original position.

During the first hour relatively few fans entered the ground.     I

overheard one of the turnstile operators, a young man (possibly

turnstile 3) call to the operator in the adjoining turnstile that 74

fans had entered his turnstile in the first hours.     This man had

worked out the rate per minute that fans would have to enter that

turnstile over the next two hours in order to reach his quota.

During the next hour (1pm x 2pm) the rate of fans entering the

ground did not increase significantly.     All entering the ground were

sober, good humoured, complying fully and willingly with Police

directions, requests and searches, etc.

From about 2pm the rate of fans entering the ground began to

increase steadily.    A number of fans also began attempting to enter

the ground without tickets and were prevented from doing so by

Police, Stewards and turnstile operators working together.

At 2.25 pm I assisted DC Friend with the detention of

                                         who had entered the ground

without a ticket.    He was taken to the Police Room, where we

completed an 'Ejection slip' and ejectedf       from the ground into

Penistone Road, at the direction of the Police Room staff.

Having done this myself and DC Friend returned to our original

appeared to be alive and pulled him from the pack.    He was

unconscious and appeared to have an injury to his right hip.     X

began to carry him to the rear of the West Stand and was eventually

assisted in doing so by spectators and another Police Officer

(details not known).   This casualty was left in the yard at the rear

of the tunnel with that officer.     I moved a number of onlookers from

that area into the next yard out of the way of other casualties and

Police Officers.

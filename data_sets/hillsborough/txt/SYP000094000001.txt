The game had been stopped some minutes and                            I went across and stood by

the    left hand         post of the Liverpool        goal,       thats as you          look    from the

Kop end of the ground.                  I h a d n ’t been standing           by that    post for very

long,    when      I saw an a mbulance          driving    down the side          of the       pitch    in

front    of the N or th Stand.              There were a number of other                 people already

out    on the      pitch area.,         1 then spent a lot of time               looking ar o un d for

my sister                    J?         n't find her and started to panic.                     At some

stage     I a sk ed a policeman for help.                 The    policeman d ir ected me to the

g y mn as iu m at     the     rear of the N or th S ta nd and said that was where                       the

injured were          being       taken.    I then spent time walking                 backwards and

forwards         betw ee n    the g ym nasium and the L ap pings Lane                 end looking       for

            with ou t        success.



At some      stage,       I cannot      say what time      it was,          but well a fter      quarter

past    three      (1515),        I was walking across          the    pitch at the Forest             end of

the ground,         whe n     I became aware      of about       ten or eleven Liverpool

supporters walking                towards   the Kop end of the ground.                  I had just

emerged from the              p assageway    in betw ee n the Kop end and the North Stand

and was about            twenty to thirty feet        inside          the    playing are a walking

towards      the     centre       circle when    I saw these          lads.     The    lads were

o bv iously making            for   the forest    fans who were either                chanting    or slow

hand    clapping.            The Liverpool      s upporters      q ui ckened     their    pace towards

the Kop end and              I went   over to one of them and grabbed him,                      I said to

the    lad words         to the effect       “what are you doing,              y o u ’re not helping

mat te r s . "     The    lads stopped making        their way towards                the forest       fans

and    1 think       they turned        round and went      back towards          the Leppings Lane

end.



I then saw other Liverpool                  supporters     pulling a hoarding             down    in the
                                                                                                                         PAGE       3
[                                                                                S3826

                          area    of the    forest       goal   in front      of the Kop.        I went across       to them

                          and helped       pull    the    hoarding down.         I think      it was   the first hoarding

                          to be    pulled down at          the Kop end.



                          T og ether w ith the other            lads,      none of w hom was known to me, we              carried

                          the hoarding       down    the    pitch to the L ep pi ng s Lane and.

                          We    carried the hoarding            into the L ep pi ng s Lane        penalty area and as

                          soon as we ente re d the area,                 a policewoman d ir ected us to            carry a

                          person on our hoarding.                 The    p ol ic ewoman who    I think was wearing a

                          tunic and hat,          indicated       to a person       lying on the       pitch.     T h e person

I                         was    lying on the       pitch about          nine or ten yards       inside     the   penalty

[                         area and about          four    or five yards        to the    left of the six yar d area,

l                         thats as you      look at        the goal       from the Kop end.        The    persons     face was

                          did not see any markings.                     It was obvious    that he was d e a d .       The body

                          just    before you enter          the    courtyard area beyond the             passageway.         We

                          lying on the opposite             side    of the     passageway.        I cannot      describe any

                          of these    bodies.        We    left the hoarding and the body                in that     position

                          and    returned to the Leppings Lane                 end of the ground.           I did not have

                          any further       involvement w ith any d ec eased              people.

The male        that     I carried on the hoarding w a s white and from what                                     little

1 saw of his face,                  I would estimate         him to be a ged              in his      thirties.

He had dark          hair w hi ch was          cut short at the            re_ar.         I only saw the            rear

of the mans          head just above               the neck,    the     rest of his head was

covered with the dark nylon jacket.                            The man was              of m ed iu m b u i l d , but

o v erweight a r o u n d the stomach,                 I cannot, remember what                   type or

colour      top the man wore,                but    it was   /pul led    up above           t.he

stomach,        revealing              beer    gut*           think     t t y # ' man    w/re      denim Jeans,         I

cannot      remember an              ring a b out/his        footwear.          I camnot           describe      the

man any further.



At H i l l s b o r o u g h    I wore       the following       clothing - A red                 coloured        rugby

shirt with a white                  collar and a broad white               band across              the   chest and

each arm.          The white          band on the front of the                  rugby shirt           has      the word

’L i v e r p o o l ’ across         it in red letters.           There        is a Liverpool              PC    crest

on each side           of     'Liverpool*.           I think    I wore a pair of black                      track

suit     trousers and a pair                 of trainers,       either        greyish        coloured

* R e e b o k ", or black and white adi d a s .



I am a white male,                  five    feet    nine   inches     in height and of me di um

build.        I have         dark    hair w hich      is cut above          the ears and wavy on top.

I am     clean shaven.

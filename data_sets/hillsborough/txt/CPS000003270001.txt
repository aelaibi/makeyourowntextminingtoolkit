HILLSBOROUGH: LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S REPORT

I refer to your minute of 9 March 1990, with which you sent a copy of the
Final Report and a copy of a letter from John Goddard.

I attach a note on the proposed new offences from Michael Kennedy, whose
interest stems from the fact that he is handling our file on the
investigation of the conduct of police officers (inter alios) at the time
of the disaster itself.  As Michael Kennedy says, he had to put something
together at very short notice and I apologise for the quality of the
typing.

I agree with Michael Kennedy's comments.  The recommendations are sensible
and straightforward, and should attract widespread support.  I have to say
that I think some of the proposed offences would be easier to prove than
others: the greatest difficulty, I think, would lie in proving an offence
of chanting obscene or racialist abuse.  This is undoubtedly an ugly facet
of football hooliganism, however, and the recommendation should be given
careful consideration.

                         Hillsborough Stadium disaster:          Lord Justice Taylor's
                         report

                         1.         Touting offences (paragraph 273-279)

                                    Existing law

                                    At present the police have no adequate tools to cope
                                    with ticket touts. As Taylor says touts are often
                                    arrested for obstruction but, I would suggest on
                                    flimsy evidence and by liberal use of the ways and
                                    means act. This is clearly the wrong tool for the
                                    job and if the touts are to be fought successfully
                                    then specific legislation could be introduced to be
                                    directed at the problem.

                                    An offence to sell tickets on match days without
                                    authority

                                    I favour this offence.   It should be relatively easy
                                    to prove with co-operation from members of the
                                    public and use of plain clothes officers.   I think
                                    consideration should also be given to creating
                                    offences of offering tickets for sale without
                                    authority and also for possession of larger
                                    quantities of tickets without authority.   This will
                                    discourage the tout who has a runner to use as a
                                    "banker" as mentioned in the report.   Such offences
                                    should be easy to prove.   Careful thought should be
                                    given to creating powers of arrest and seizure of
                                    tickets when police apprehend touts and their
                                    associates.  Exceptions to the general arrest
                                    provisions in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act
                                    1984 may have to be considered.

                                    Prohibition of sales within a radius of the ground
                                    on match days

                                    This offence would have attractions. However it
                                    would be difficult to s e t ^ ^ ^ r a d i u s by statute.
                                    Clearly the measure is designed to discourage
                                    ticketless spectators travelling from their own home
                                    to the vicinity of the match.        For example a radius
                                    of one mile from the ground might easily create
                                    problems at railway stations in city centres a mile
                                    or more from the football ground.

                                    Sale of a ticket only at face value

                                    There are advantages in this recommendation but I
                                    agree with Taylor's suggestion that there would be
                                    difficulties in proving the price at which a tout
                                    had sold the ticket. An additional disadvantage is
                                    that this provision would still encourage ticketless
                                    fans to travel to matches in the hope of obtaining a
                                    ticket at the ground.

               3M GK 0 31 5 . C01



CODE   18-77
                                                                           Reference




                                        In summary, subject to my suggestion that the scope
                                        of the offence be widened slightly I agree with
                                        Taylor's suggestion that it should be an offence to
                                        sell tickets for a particular match on the day of
                                        the game without authority.  The existence of such
                                        an offence will prove a considerable deterrent and
                                        the deterrent effect will be enhanced by the
                                        simplicity of the offence itself and the ease with
                                        which the essential elements can be established in
                                        court.

                          2.            Offences in the ground

                                        Throwing missiles

                                        Throwing missiles at football grounds is clearly
                                        extremely dangerous.  If injury is not caused it
                                        almost certainly provokes a violent response.

                                        The existing legislation can deal with such acts,
                                        gither Section 4 or Section 5 would be appropriate.
                                        The second lj-mb of Section 4 and particularly
                                        Section 5 % s referred to by Lord Justice Taylor as
                                        evidence which might be very difficult to adduce.   I
                                        do not totally agree with that suggestion.
                                        Certainly a simple offence of throwing a missile
                                        inside a football ground would be much easier to
                                        prove than an offence under the existing
                                        legislation. The only evidence would be to prove
                                        that a particular defendant had thrown an object.
                                        The additional elements required by Section 4 and
                                        Section 5 of the 1986 Public Order Act would not
                                        need to be established. There will always be
                                        problems identifying those responsible for such acts
                                        but with the increased use of video cameras and
                                        picture enlarging technology coupled with police
                                        evidence there should be little difficulty in
                                        establishing such offences. Again thought must be
                                        given to providing the police with adequate powers
                                        of arrest.

                                        Chanting obscene or racialist abuse

                                        It is possible that such abuse could be prosecuted
                                        under Section 5 of the 1986 Public Order Act.
                                        However as Taylor mentions at paragraph 296 there
                                        are difficulties in applying this to football
                                        matches where perhaps supporters expect to hear such
                                        chanting and are not caused "harassment, alarm or
                                        distress thereby".

                                        Additionally the possibility of racist remarks
                                        coming under Section 18 of the Public Order Act for
                                        stirring up racial hatred is a non-starter.  In fact
                                        I do not think there has been more than one or two

                                        prosecutions under this Section of the Act since it
                                        came into force.

                                        If obscene and racialist remarks are to be
                                        prohibited frram ^ountiwg then Taylor's suggestion is
                                        clear, concise and simple to understand, even for
                                        football hooligans.
                                                  ^-
                                        It must be^case that by simplifying the nature of
                                        the misdemeanour prosecution will be far easier than
                                        under S—          the 1986 Public Order Act. Once
                                        again/obviously there will be difficulties in
                                        actually identifying wrong-doers* Provided adequate
                                        steps are taken by the police to obtain good
                                        evidence there should be little difficulty in
                                        establishing such before the court.

                                        Pitch invasions without reasonable excuse

                                        As such action often provokes violence and allows
                                        opposing supporters to mix without restraint it is
                                        sensible to restrict the behaviour and I agree with
                                        Lord Justice Taylor's recommendations. Again, fcl-*
                                        suggestion is clear and simple, easy to understand.
                                        Once more#powers of arrest need to be considered.   I
                                        anticipate little difficulty in proving such a
                                        misdemeanour.

                                        How might spectators react to enforcement

                                        I would anticipate that the vast majority of
                                        supporters would agree with police enforcement of
                                        such offences.     The agreement might be somewhat
                                        reduced among the younger elements of supporters so
                                        far as them rertm bg chanting is concerned.  This
                                        appears to have become almost a condition at
                                        football grounds. Of the three separate offences I
                                        feel it will be the most difficult for the police to
                                        enforce whilst realistically expecting the support
                                        of football fans.

                           3.           Attendance centre orders

                                        A sensible and logical suggestion but perhaps
                                        reporting to a designated police station to sign on
                                        say one half hour after kick off on Saturday
                                        afternoons would have a less drastic resource
                                        implication.   Clearly penalties for non-reporting
                                        should follow.

                           4.           Electronic tagging

                                        If this is to be effective I would have thought that
                                        it could be used in place of attendance centre
                                        orders^again with suitable penalties for non-
                                        compliance.

                                    Resource implications for CPS

                                    So far as the suggested offences are concerned I
                                    cannot see that there would be any great resource
                                    implications so far as prosecuting ticket touts is
                                    concerned.  I would anticipate that the legislation
                                    will prove to be a considerable deterrent and that
                                    prosecutions will be few and resource implications
                                    minimal.

                                    The suggested new offences inside football grounds
                                    could actually reduce resources directed at
                                    prosecuting football hooliganism.      Clearly the
                                    observations will have to be taken from Chief Crown
                                    Prosecutors whose officers have considerable
                                    experience in prosecuting crime in and around
                                    football stadia. Although we anticipate the new
                                    offences will be easy to prove this may result in
                                    more arrests and prosecutions than had been the case
                                    under the 1986 Public Order Act legislation.       In
                                    this case there cLflz. also implications that may be
                                    significant.  However it could be argued equally
                                    that the ease with which the new offences can be
                                    prosecuted will release resources already allocated
                                    to prosecution of the offences under the old Act
                                    which were more difficult to prove.

                                    I hope these observations are of some help to you
                                    although I must confess that I have had to put them
                                    together rather quickly.

     Please find enclosed a copy of Lord Justice Taylor's report on the
     Hillsborough Stadium disaster together with a letter from John Goddard (F8
     Division, H o m e Office) requesting the Service's views on each of the
     recommendations 70-73 in that report.

     I would be pleased to receive any comments which members of the Policy
     Advisory Committee have on these recommendations (and indeed anything else
     that strikes you as important in the report) by 23 March 1990.

     All being well, I hope to compile our response by 3 April 1990 and perhaps
     a brief discussion can be had on it at the next meeting of the Committee.

 ferences between the remedies which an applicant was formerly required to select as the most
 appropriate to his case. (The second and third sentences of this p aragraph were cited with
 approval by Ackner L J . in R. v. Inland Revenue Commissioners, ex p. National Federation o f Self-
 Employed and Small Businesses Ltd. [1980] Q.B. 407 [1980] 2 All E.R. 378, C.A.). It has thus
 released the form er system from its procedural constraints which a t times led to technical
 injustices. T his O rd e r may therefore be said to constitute a landm ark in the developm ent of
 adm inistrative law, a new starting point for the growing jurisprudence in this field of law.
    T his O rder was based largely on the recommendations of the Law Commission made in
 their Report on Remedies in Adm inistrative Law (Law Com. No.73; Cm nd.6407 (1976)).
 T heir main recom m endation was that a new form of procedure should be introduced to be
 known as an “ application for judicial review” which would enable a person seeking to chal­
 lenge an adm inistrative act or omission to apply to the High C ourt either for one of the pre­
 rogative orders of m andam us, certiorari, or prohibition, or, in appropriate circum stances, a
 declaration, an injunction, or damages. T he Law Commission had envisaged th at their
 recom m endations would be implemented by Act of Parliam ent. Instead, the changes were
 originally effected by the substitution in 1977 o f this new version of 0 .5 3 . Subsequently, in
 1981, statutory backing was given to the new 0 .5 3 by s.31 of S.C.A. 1981. T hus, unusually,
 the rules preceded the statutory provisions; however, there do not appear to be any pro­
 visions in s.31 which conflict with anything contained in 0 .5 3 , and accordingly there was no
 reason to think th at s.31 would significantly alter the practice and procedure concerning
judicial review. O ne recom m endation of the Law Commission has not been implemented,
 namely the proposal th at the C ourt should be empowered to grant an interim declaration by
 way of interim relief in proceedings against the Crown; neither the statute nor the rules pro­
vides for this.

Summary of th e ch an g es m ade in 1977
    (1) I t created a new procedure called an “ application for judicial review” and in this single 53/1 —14/2
application, the applicant m ay apply for any of the prerogative orders, either jointly or in the
alternative, without having to select any particular one appropriate to his case (rr. 1 ( 1 ) and 2 ).
    (2) In appropriate cases, on an application for judicial review, the C ourt is further empow­
ered to grant a declaration or an injunction (r.l(2 )) or damages (r.7); but where such relief is
claimed and a prerogative order is not appropriate, the C ourt has power to order the pro­
ceedings to continued as if begun by writ, instead o f refusing the application (r.9(5)).
    (3) Subject to the discretion of the C ourt to extend the period for “ good reason,” leave to
apply for judicial review m ust be m ade prom ptly and in any event within three m onths from
the date when grounds for the application first arose (r.4( 1)) and in the case of an application
for certain classes of certiorari, the date when such grounds first arise will be taken to be the
date of the judgm ent, order, conviction or other proceeding in relation to which the order of
certiorari is sought (r.4(2)).
    (4) T he leave of the C ourt is a necessary condition precedent to the making of the substan­
tive application for judicial review (r.3(2)).
    (5) T he m achinery of interlocutory applications such as discovery o f docum ents and inter­
rogatories and orders for a deponent to attend for cross-examination on his affidavit has been
introduced into applications for judicial review, and such applications m ay be heard by a
Judg e or by a M aster of the Q ueen’s Bench Division (r. 8 ).
  , (6 ) T he governing rule describing the right to apply for judicial review, which m ay be said
to be a description o f his locus standi, is that the applicant m ust have “ a sufficient interest in
the m atter to which the application relates” (r.3(7)).
    (7) O n the hearing of an application for judicial review, any person who appears to the
C ourt to be “ a proper person” m ay be heard in opposition to the application, even though he
has not been served with notice of such application (r.9( 1)).
    (8 ) T he am ending powers of the C ourt, particularly in relation to the application for leave,
are enlarged (r.3(6)).
    (9) T he powers of the C ourt to grant interim relief pending the hearing of the application
for judicial review are enlarged; the C ourt is empowered to gran t such interim relief as may
be granted in an action begun by writ, e.g. an interlocutory injunction. (r.3(10)(A). I f the
relief sought is an order of prohibition or certiorari, the grant o f leave to apply for judicial
review will, if the C ourt so directs, operate to stay the relevant proceedings until the substan­
tive application for judicial review is heard or until the C ourt otherwise orders (r.3(10 (a)).
    (10) I f the claim for relief is an order of certiorari, the C ourt is empowered, in addition to
quashing the decision, to rem it the m atter to the authority concerned with a direction to
reconsider it and reach a decision in accordance with the findings of the C ourt (r.9(4))
so that the C ourt m ay operate not only as a “C ourt of C assation” bu t also as a C ourt of
review.

  or dam ages may be obtained in proceedings for judicial review (ibid. s.31 (2 ) and (4 ) and
  0 .5 3 , r.1 (2), and r.7), but such remedies m ay also be sought by way of action. T he claim ant
  does not have a free choice; for a discussion of the authorities on the question w hether
 judicial review or a n action is the appropriate procedure see para.53/1-14/13. Broadly, if the
 proceedings are directed to challenging the decision o f a public law nature an application for
 judicial review is the only permissible course; the C ourt will not perm it an action for a dec­
 laration to be used as a means o f circum venting the procedural restrictions on the avail­
 ability of judicial review, in particular the rule th at leave to apply for judicial review m ust be
 obtained and the requirem ent that the application for judicial review must norm ally be m ade
 w ithin three m onths (O ’Reilly v. Mackman [1983] 2 A.C. 237; [1983] 3 All E.R. 1124, H .L.).
    No Issue estoppel In judicial review proceedings—T he doctrine o f issue estoppel
 cannot be relied on in proceedings for judicial review because in such proceedings there are
 no formal pleadings and it would frequently be difficult, if not impossible, to identify a par­
 ticular issue as having been decided in the earlier application; furtherm ore in such proceed­
 ings there is no ‘ Its” between the Crown, in whose name the proceedings are brought, and
 the respondent, or between the ex parte applicant and the respondent, nor is the decision a
 final determ ination (R. v. Secretary o f Statefo r the Environment, ex p. Hackney London Borough Coun-
 cU [1983] 1 W .L.R. 524; [1983] 3 All E.R. 358, D.C.).
    Leave to apply for judicial review — No application for judicial review can be m ade 53/1—14/8
 (w hether m a civil or crim inal m atter) unless leave to apply for judicial review has been
obtained (S.C.A. 1981, s.31 (3) and 0 .5 3 , r.3). Applications for leave are norm ally dealt with
ex parte by a single Judge, in the first instance without a hearing. (For details o f the relevant
practice and procedure see paras. 53/1-14/17 et seq.). T he purpose o f the requirem ent of
leave is to elim inate frivolous, vexatious or hopeless applications for judicial review without
the need for a substantive inter partes judicial review hearing, and to ensure that a n applicant
is only allowed to proceed to a substantive hearing if the C ourt is satisfied that there is a case
fit for further investigation a t a full inter partes hearing.
   A venues of appeal in judicial review proceedings— In civil cases the avenues o f 5 3 / 1- 1 4 /9
appeal are as follows. If the single Ju dge refuses leave without a hearing, the application can
be renewed before a single Judge sitting in open C ourt (or, if the C ourt so directs, a Div­
isional C ourt o f the Q ueen’s Bench Division) (r.3 (l)(i)). If leave is refused after a hearing,
the application for leave (being ex parte) can be renewed before the C ourt o f A ppeal within
seven days under 0 .5 9 , r. 14(3). I f the C ourt o f Appeal grants leave, the substantive appli­
cation will (unless the C ourt o f Appeal otherwise directs) be sent back to be heard in the
Q .B.D . (See para. 53/1—14/32). If the C ourt o f Appeal refuses leave to apply for judicial
review th at decision is final; there is no appeal to the House o fL ords (Re Poh [1983] 1 W .L .R .
2; [1983] 1 All E.R. 287, H .L . W here leave has been granted and the substantive application
for judicial review has been heard by the single Ju d g e or a Divisional C ourt, any p arty has an
appeal as o f right to the C ourt o f Appeal under s.16 o f S.C.A. 1981; an order granting or
refusing a substantive application for judicial review is a final order and leave to appeal to
the C ourt o f Appeal is therefore not required. (See also the second table in para.
53/1 14/51).
   In crim inal cases, where the single Ju d g e has refused leave to apply for judicial review, the
application for leave can be renewed before a Divisional C ourt (r.3 (l)(a )). No appeal lies to
the C ourt o f Appeal in crim inal judicial review proceedings (S.C.A. 1981, s,1 8(l)(a)).
A ppeal against a decision o f the Divisional C ourt in a crim inal cause or m atter lies to the
H ouse o fL o rd s under s.l o f A. J . A. 1960, but only with the requisite certificate and leave.
(See also the first table in para. 53/1-14/51).

                                W h en Do e s J udicial R eview Lie
  G rounds on which judicial review can be granted —T his is a vast topic and in a com- 53/1—14/10
m entary o f this kind it is not practicable to give more than a very brief outline: (for a detailed
analysis o f the principles and the authorities see: i t Smith on Judicial Review o f Administrative
Action (4th ed., 1980) Wade tm Administrative Law (6 th ed., 1988), and Gordon onJudicial Review :
Laui and Procedure (1985)). T he two principal questions which have to be considered are: first,
against w hat persons or bodies o r persons does judicial review lie? and second, on w hat
grounds can the decisions o f such persons o r bodies be impugned?
   A gainst whom d o es judicial review lie? — At various stages (particularly between the 53/1—14/11
 1920s and the 1960s) it was thought th at w hat were then the prerogative orders o f certiorari,
prohibition and m andam us only lay against persons o r bodies with judicial o r quasi-judicial
functions, and did not apply to an authority exercising adm inistrative powers. T he distinc­
tion between judicial and adm inistrative activities was swept away by the decision of the
House o fL o rds in Ridge v. Baldwin [1964] A.C. 40; [1963] 2 All E.R. 6 6 . Judicial review now
lies against a n interior court o r tribunal, and against any persons or bodies which perform
public duties or functions. In R. v. The Panel on Take-Overs and Mergers, ex p. Datafin Ltd [19871
Q.B. 815; [1987] 1 All E.R. 564, the C ourt of Appeal held that the judicial review would lie
against the Take-over Panel notw ithstanding the fact that it is p a rt o f the “ self-regulatory”
system in the City, and does not derive its authority or powers from statute or the exercise of
the prerogative.

  On what grounds can judicial review b e granted?—T he grounds on which judicial 53/1-14/12
review can be granted fall under the following m ain headings:
    1 Want Or excess Ofjurisdiction—Clearly if an inferior court or tribunal or a public a u th ­
ority charged with a public duty acts without jurisdiction or exceeds its jurisdiction judicial
review will lie. A particularly vexed question is whether every error of law am ounts to an
excess of jurisidiction. O ne school of thought is th at if the decision is founded upon an erro­
neous proposition of law, if follows that the body m ust have asked itself the wrong question
and no such body has jurisdiction to base its decision on the wrong question. T h e other
school of thought, which prevailed in this country for a long time, is th at a distinction m ust
be draw n between errors of law which go to jurisdiction and errors of law which do not. Fol­
lowing the decision of the House o fL o rd s in Anisminic Ltd. v. Foreign Compensation Commission
 [1969] 2 A.C. 147; [1969] 1 All E.R. 208 the first school of thought now obtains in English
law except possibly in relation to inferior courts. In Anisminic it was held th at where the
decision of an adm inistrative authority or tribunal is founded, wholly or partly, on an error of
law the authority or tribunal has acted outside its jurisdiction and accordingly its decision is
liable to be quashed. I t m ay be th at Anisminic does not apply to inferior courts, such as
county courts; there is m uch to be said for the view that, where an inferior court has jurisdic­
 tion to adjudicate upon a particular type of case, it has jurisdiction to decide incorrectly as
 well as correctly the questions of law which go to the merits and do not go to jurisdiction; (see
 Racal Communications Limited [1981] A.C. 374; [1980] 2 All E.R. 634, H .L . and South EastAsia
 Fire Bricks SDN. BH D . v. Non-Metallic Mineral Products Manufacturing Employees Union [1981J
 A.C. 363; [1980] 2 All E.R. 689, P.C.).

   2 Where there is an error o f law on the face o f the record—J udicial review will lie where
 there is an error of law on the face of the record. (R. v. Northumberland Compensation Appeal Tri­
 bunal [1952] 1 K.B. 338; Baldwin and Francis Limited v. Patents Appeal Tribunal [1959] A.C. 663;
 [19591 2 All E.R. 433, H .L .). Recently w hat constitutes the “record” has been widely inter­
 preted- it is not confined to the formal order, bu t extends to the reasoned decision given by
 the Tudee in his oral Judgm ent (R. v. Crown Court at Knightsbridge, ex p. International Sporting
 Club (London) Ltd. [1982] Q .B. 304; [1981] 3 All E.R. 417, D .C .,applying/?, v. Northumberland
 Compensation Appeal Tribunal \ 1952] 1 All E.R. 122).
    3 Failure to comply With the rules Of natural justice—W here the rules o f natural justice
 annlv and the decision has been reached in breach of those rules judicial review will lie (see,
 * V Ridge v. Baldwin [1964] A.C. 40; [1963] 2 All E.R. 6 6 ). In that case a chief constable was
 dismissed by the police authority. T h e first decision to dismiss him was taken without giving
 him a hearing a t all, which was held to be a breach of the rules of natural justice. Although
 the m atter was reconsidered by the police authority on a later occasion after he had been
 given a hearing, the second decision to dismiss him was also found to have been reached in
 breach of the rules of natural justice because he was not informed of the allegations m ade
 a g a in st him or th e reasons why it was proposed to dismiss him.
     Broadly the rules of natural justice embody a duty to act fairly. W hether those rules apply
 and the extent of the duty depend upon the particular type of case concerned. “ T he rules ol
 natural justice— or of fairness— are not cut a n d dried. They vary infinitely (R v. Home Sec­
 retary, exp . Santillo [1981] Q.B. 778; [1981] 2 All E.R. 897, per Lord D enning M .R .). T he
 rules of natural justice will norm ally apply where the decision concerned affects a person s
  rights, for example where his property is taken by compulsory purchase: or^he is dismissed
  from a public office (as in Ridge v. Baldwin [1964] A.C. 40; [1963] 2 All E.R. 6 6 ). T he rules of
  natural justice can also apply where the applicant for judicial review does not have a right,
  for example where is applying for some requisite statutory licence; in such cases, although he
  has no right to a licence unless and until it is granted, there is a duty to comply with the rules
  of natural justice and to act fairly because a legal power which affects his interests is being
  exercised. (For example see R. v. Liverpool Corporation, ex p. Liverpool Taxi Operators Association
  r 19721 2 Q B 299 [1972] 2 All E.R. 589 and R. v. Gaming Boardfo r Great Britian, ex p. Benaim
  and Khaida [1970] 2 Q .B. 417; [1970] 2 All E .R . 528).                       ,. , ,
      W here a tribunal desires to proceed on the basis of some point which has not been
  advanced before it by an party, the person whose case is being considered by the tribunal
  and any other persons represented a t the hearing or enquiry should be altered to the possi­
  bility of the tribunal taking the point concerned into account, so th at all those affected by the
  decision have the opportunity to put forward any m aterial which m ight pereuade the tri­
  bunal differently on the point (R. v. Mental Health Review Tribunal, exp. Clatworthy[\1985] 3 All
   E R 699 ber M ann J. a t p.704, following the observations of Lord Diplock in Mahon v. Air

cases it was held th at the plaintiffs should have m ade an application for judicial review. In
Waserley Borough Council v. Hilden [1988] 1 W ..R. 246; [1988] 1 All E.R. 807 Scott J . held that
* challenge by the defendants, who were gypsies, to the reasonableness of the council’s
decision to take proceedings against them seeking an injunction restraining breaches of
enforcement notices could be m ounted only by way of proceedings for judicial review and not
by way of defence to the action.
  sThere may, however, be exceptions to the general rule; for instance where the invalidity of
the decision of the public authority arises as a collateral issue in a claim for infringem ent of a
rightof the plaintiff arising under private law, or where none of the parties objects to the pro­
ceedings being continued by way or ordinary action (O ’Reilly v. Mackman, above per Lord
Diplock a t p.285/l 134). W hether there are other exceptions is to be decided on a case-to-case
basis (ibid.). In Davy v. Spelthome Borough Council [1984] A.C. 262; [1983] 3 All E.R. 278, H.Li­
the plaintiff commenced proceedings against the defendant council alleging th at it had negli­
gently advised him as to his rights under the Town and C ountry Planning Act 1971 and he
claimed (I) an injunction restraining the council from im plem enting an enforcement notice
which it had served, (2) damages and (3) an order that the enforcement notice be set aside.
The C ourt of Appeal held th at (1) and (3) (but not (2)) should be struck out applying the
rule in O ’Reilly v. Mackman. T he House o fL ords upheld the decision of the C ourt of Appeal
that (2 ) should not be struck out because it was an ordinary common law action in tort con­
cerning his private rights and not rights protected under public law. In London Borough o f
Wandsworth v. Winder [1985] A.C. 461; [1984] 3 All E.R. 976, the defendant pleaded by way of
defence to a claim for possession based on rent arrears th at the rent increases m ade by the
council were invalid. T he council applied for that defence to be struck out in reliance on
O’Reilly v. Mackman. T he H .L. held that the defence was not an abuse of the process of the
Court within the m eaning of the rule in O ’Reilly v. Mackman and refused the application to
strike out.
    A d a im in connection with the dismissal of an employee from an employment with a pub ­
lic authority, where the conditions of employment are governed by a statutory instrum ent, is
nevertheless a m atter of private, not public, law: R. v. East Berkshire Health Authority, ex p.
 Walsh [1985] Q.B. 152; [1984] 3 All E.R. 425, C.A. (senior nursing officer). Aliter where the
employment is one which is the subject of a code of discipline deriving its authority from stat­
ute: R. v. Secretary o f State fo r the Home Department, ex p. Benwell [1985] Q.B. 554; [1984] 3 All
E.R. 854 (prison officer). In R. v. Civil Service Board, ex p. Bruce [1989] 2 All E.R. 907 the
Court of Appeal left open the question w hether a decision upholding the dismissal o f a civil
servant was susceptible ofjudicial review (see para. 53/1—14/11).
    For further discussion of the distinction between public and private law see: Gillick v. West
Norfolk & Wisbech Area Health Authority [1986] A.C. 112; [1985] 3 All E.R. 402, H .L. and Bour-
goin S. A. v. Ministry o f Agriculture Fisheries and Food [1986] Q.B. 716; [1985] 3 All E.R. 585,
 C.A.
  . W here the relief sought in judicial review proceedings is a declaration, injunction or
 damages, and the C ourt considers th at it should not be granted on an application for judicial
 review, but m ight have been granted if it had been sought in an action begun by writ the
 Court may, instead of refusing the application, order the proceedings to continue as if they
 had in fact been begun by writ (0 .5 3 , r.9(5)): and for this purpose, the C ourt m ay follow the
 procedure indicated in 0 .2 8 , r. 8 . T here is no converse power under R.S.C. to perm it an
 action begun by writ to continue as if it were an application for judicial review (O ’Reilly v.
 Mackman [1983] 2 A.C. 237, p.284; [1982] 3 All E.R. 1124, p .l 133, per Lord Diplock). The
 proceedings m ust be commenced afresh by an application for judicial review. (See also para.
 53/1-14/49.)
  Immigration ca se s—illegal en tran ts —W here an official’s decision is one which would 53/1-14/14
restrict or take away a person’s liberty and the exercise of the power to make th at decision
depends upon the existence of certain facts, the C ourt is not limited to inquiry w hether the
official had reasonable grounds for believing that those facts existed. T he C ourt has to be
satisfied on the civil standard of proof to the appropriate degree of probability th at those
facts did exist a t the time when the power was exercised (R. v. Secretary o f State fo r the Home
Department, ex p. Khawaja [1984] A.C. 74; [1983] 1 All E.R. 765, H .L.). T hus where an immi­
gration officer concludes th at a person who has obtained leave to enter the U .K . is an illegal
entrant on the grounds th at he has obtained leave to enter by fraud or deception and detains
him pending removal from the U .K ., the C ourt will in judicial review (or habeas corpus)
proceedings scrutinise the evidence to see whether it has been proved th at leave to enter
was obtained by fraud or deception (ibid. and R. v. Secretary o f State for the Home Department,
ex p. Momin A li [1984] 1 All E.R. 1009, C.A.). (For the position concerning bail see para.
53/1-14/26.)
  No estoppel against th e Crown — T he Crown cannot put itself in a position where it is 53/1-14/15
prevented from performing its public duty, and cannot, by entering into an agreem ent or
arrangem ent estop itself from exercising in the future a power or discretion which it is its
duty to exercise; b ut officers of the Crown (for instance officials of the Inland Revenue) are
amenable to judicial review if they exceed or abuse their powers: R. v. Inland Revenue Com­
missioners, ex p. Preston [1985] A.C. 835; [1985] 2 All E.R., 327, where the H .L. held that the
Commissioners o f Inland Revenue were amenable tojudicial review, but upheld the decision

          of the respondent by pointing first to the com paratively small n u m b er o f seizures                 as well as to the prosecuting authorities. T he applicant referred us m any tim es to
          and searches, to their com parative rarity and to their virtual ineffectiveness as                       the recent decision of the House of Lords in Director o f Public Prosecutions v Whyte1.
          dem onstrated by the fact th at he could and has bought obscene publications from                        I do not find anything in the speeches in th at case, w hether o f the m ajority o r ot the

          further to launch private prosecutions to this end. How much m ore he claim s could                      regard to the problem s created by the Act. Lord W ilberforce said2:

          T he respondent has related in detail in his affidavit how the relevant w ork is done and                      it can only be so in relation to its likely readers. O ne reason for this was no doubt
          the degree o f centralisation which has been operated w ithin the M etropolitan police                         to exem pt from prosecution scientific, medical or sociological treatises not likely

          o f the director. It is im portant in this connection to observe tw o things, first that                       was necessary to give this exem ption, and this gives the courts a difficult task.

          com m itted b y crim inal—Whether liable f o r breach o f du ty o f care

              The plaintiff's 20-year-old daughter was attacked at night in
          a city street o f the police area o f which the defendant was chief
          constable and died from her injuries. Her attacker, who was
          convicted o f her murder, was alleged to have committed a series
          o f offences o f murder and attempted murder against young
          women in the area in similar circumstances over a period of
          years before the d eceased ’s murder. The plaintiff claimed on
          behalf o f her deceased daughter's estate damages against the
          defendant for negligence, in that in the conduct o f investigations
          into the crimes which had been committed the police failed to
          apprehend the perpetrator and prevent the murder o f her
          daughter. On the defendant's application, the judge ordered the
          striking out o f the writ and statement o f claim as disclosing no
          cause o f action.
              On the plaintiff’s appeal:—
              H e ld , dismissing the appeal, that although the police ow ed a
          general duty to the public at large to suppress crime that duty
          did not carry with it a liability to individuals for damage caused
          to them by criminals whom the police had failed to apprehend
          when it was possible to do so; that the conduct o f the
          investigations by the police did not create such a special
          relationship betw een them and the perpetrator o f the crimes as
          to give rise to a duty of-care on the part o f the police to prevent
          the attack on the plaintiffs daughter; that compensation for
          victims o f crimes o f violence was already available under the
          Criminal Injuries C ompensation Scheme and it was undesirable
          that inequalities should be produced in the treatment o f the
          victims by additional remedies for negligence; and that,
          accordingly, it was not just and reasonable that a cause of
          action should lie against the police for the murder o f the
          plaintiff's daughter (post, pp, 1134 d - e , 1137 c~ d , 1138 b , d ~ g , o ,

              Per Glidewel! L.J. and Sir Roualeyn Cumming-Bruce.
          Investigative police work is a matter o f judgment, often dictated
          by experience or instinct. The threat trial a decision which, in
          the en d , proved to be wrong might result in an action for
          damages would be likely to have an inhibiting effect on the

     The plaintiff appealed on the grounds that (1) the judge was wrong                    a
 in law holding that the deceased was not a person to whom the
 defendant ow ed a duty o f care notwithstanding that (a) the defendant
 was under a duty to apprehend offenders, prevent crime and protect life
 and property within the West Yorkshire Metropolitan police area; (b)
 the defendant well knew at all material times that within the area a man
 was carrying out offences o f murder or attempted murder upon                              _       g
 unaccompanied young or fairly young w om en, such attacks being carried                        j
 out in built up urban parts o f the area, in particular in Leeds; (c) the                      •
 defendant had taken the responsibility o f attempting to apprehend the                         j
 murderer and o f protecting the lives and safety o f such wom en; (d) the
 deceased, who was a student in Leeds, aged 20, was at the material time
 in a street in a built up urban part of the city; (e ) it was at all material
 times reasonably foreseeable to the defendant that if the defendant                       C        C
 failed to apprehend the murderer, he would kill or grievously injure
 young wom en in the area; (2) the judge was in error in law and/or
 misdirected him self in holding that the class o f women to whom the
 defendant owed a duty o f care was impossible to ascertain and/or in
 holding that the defendant owed a duty o f care to wom en outside the
area o f the defendant’s responsibility, whether or not it was reasonably                  q        D
foreseeable that such wom en would be attacked by the murderer; (3)
the judge further misled him self in law in holding that it was a legitimate
argument that the class o f persons to whom the duty of care was owed
was too wide and therefore that no duty o f care was ow ed, that such a
duty would be ow ed to a rescuer, notwithstanding that it was not alleged
that any rescuer had ever been attacked by the murderer and it was                         p        g
expressly alleged that the murderer attacked unaccompanied women
and/or notwithstanding that such a widening o f the class o f persons to
whom a duty o f care was ow ed would in no way reduce the validity of
the plaintiff’s contentions; (4) the judge was in error in law in failing to
distinguish betw een those matters lying within the discretion of the
defendant by way of policy decision which would not form a legitimate                               c
subject of an action for negligence and matters o f negligence in the                      F
performance o f his and his officers’ duties which would; (5) the judge
was wholly wrong in treating as a legitimate ground for refusing the
plaintiff a right o f action that (without the assistance o f any evidence to
support any such view) the rights o f a person injured as a consequence
o f the negligence o f the police in carrying out their duties to bring an
action would almost inevitably affect the way inwhich they performed                     G          G
their duties; (6) the judge, in distinguishing K n ig h tle y v. Johns [1982] 1
W .L .R . 349, M a r s h a ll v, O s m o n d [1983] Q .B , 1034 and R ig b y v. C h ie f

their effect and failed to apply the principle which underlay the decisions,
namely that the police when carrying out their duties were like all other
citizens liable for their negligence to those whom they could foresee                               H
might be injured in the event o f their failing to carry out their duties
carefully; (7) the judge was in error in law in holding that it was a
necessary pre-requisite o f liability, where the actual harm was caused by
a third party that the third party should have been under the control o f
the defendant and wrongly rejected the contention o f the plaintiff that
once a duty o f care to persons within a particular class or category was
undertaken to prevent actions by a particular third party, it was not an

answer to a claim for breach of that duty of care that the third party was
not within the control o f the defendant; (8) the judge was wrong in law
in holding that even if the deceased had been a person to whom the
defendant ow ed a duty o f care and that the defendant was negligent as
alleged in the statem ent o f claim and in consequence of that negligence
the murderer had not been apprehended nor had any or any adequate
steps been taken to protect the deceased and in consequence thereof the
murderer murdered the deceased, the death o f the deceased, although a
foreseeable consequence o f the breach o f the defendant’s duty o f care,
was too remote; and (9) the judge ought to have held that it was at least
arguable that in the circumstances set out or referred to in the statement
of claim the defendant ow ed to the deceased a duty o f care of which the
defendant was in breach, that the deceased’s death was a reasonably
foreseeable consequence o f such breach and that no grounds whether of
rem oteness, public policy or otherwise existed to deprive the plaintiff of
a reasonably arguable cause o f action against the defendant.

    19 February.         The following judgments were handed down.

     Fox L.J. This is an appeal from an order o f Sir Neil Lawson, sitting
as a deputy judge o f the High Court, that the writ and statem ent o f
claim be struck out as disclosing no cause of action. The plaintiff is the
mother and sole personal representative o f Jacqueline Hill (“Miss H ill”)
who died, aged 20, on or about 17 N ovem ber 1980. It is the plaintiff’s -
case that about 9.30 p.m . on 17 Novem ber 1980 Miss Hill was attacked
in a street in L eeds by one Peter Sutcliffe and thereby suffered injuries
from which she died on or about the same day. On 22 May 1981
Sutcliffe was found guilty, at the Central Criminal Court, o f the murder
o f Miss Hill on or about 17 Novem ber 1980.
     The p laintiffs pleaded case is broadly as follows. B etw een 1969 and
17 N ovem ber 1980, and in particular betw een 1 July 1975 and 17
Novem ber 1980, Sutcliffe committed a series o f offences against young
or fairly young w om en, mostly in the metropolitan police area o f West
Yorkshire, o f which area the defendant is the chief officer o f police.
Those offences consisted o f 8 cases o f attempted murder and 13 cases
(including that o f Miss Hill, who was the last to be killed) o f murder.
Sutcliffe has been com m only referred to as the “Yorkshire Ripper.”
A lthough his victims were w om en, he was not, we were told, a rapist.
H e killed or attem pted to kill.
     The m ode of assault and the circumstances o f the offences, it is
pleaded, resembled o n e another to such an extent that it was reasonable
 to infer that the offences were committed by the same man; and that,
 accordingly, it was at all material times foreseeable that if he was not
 apprehended the man would commit further similar offences. Accordingly,
 it is contended, it was the duty o f the chief officer o f police and o f the

officers under his direction to exercise all reasonable skill and care to
apprehend the perpetrator o f the crimes, but in breach o f that duty the
police failed to use sufficient skill or care to detect the perpetrator prior
to the murder o f Miss Hill. T he statement o f claim sets out at length
particulars o f alleged failures by the police to use information which
they obtained and to conduct investigations which would have been
appropriate. Inter alia, it is alleged that the police failed to collate
relevant information and to investigate records relating to Sutcliffe;
failed to m ake sufficient use o f photofit pictures; attached undue
importance to hoax letters and telephone calls; failed to re-evaluate
suspects w ho had been eliminated; and failed to take account o f the fact
that Sutcliffe had been provided with an alibi for offences only by his
wife.
    In the prem ises, the plaintiff claims on behalf o f the estate o f Miss
Hill (a) dam ages for loss o f expectation o f life and pain and suffering
caused to Miss Hill prior to death, (b) funeral expenses, (c) damages in
respect o f Miss H ill’s loss o f earnings during the lost years. The main
elem ent in this claim is item (c), the lost years’ claim. Such claims on
behalf o f the estate o f a deceased person w ere abolished by Parliament
in 1982. That was done by section 4 o f the Administration o f Justice A ct
1982. The plaintiff is only able to assert the claim in this case because
Miss Hill died before the section came into force.
    T he defendant is sued under the provisions o f section 48(1) o f the
Police Act 1964 under which the chief officer o f police for the police
area is liable for torts committed by constables under his direction and
control. The statem ent o f claim contains no allegation that the alleged
breach o f duty by the police caused the death o f Miss Hill but that could
be cured by am endm ent.
    The plaintiff was not a dependant o f Miss Hill and w e were informed
by counsel that although she is the sole residuary beneficiary o f the
estate, she does not seek to recover damages for her own benefit but
wishes to use them to establish a charitable trust to com m em orate her
 daughter.
     The defendant applied to strike out the statement o f claim as
 disclosing no cause o f action. The judge, in acceding to that application,
 held that Miss Hill was not in such a relationship with the defendant or
 his officers as to give rise to any duty o f care in relation to the
 apprehension o f Sutcliffe.
     The case com es before the court, not by way o f preliminary issue but
 under R .S .C ,, Ord. 18, r, 19 on an application to strike out as disclosing
 no cause o f action. For the purposes of such an application it must be
 assum ed, in the p lain tiffs favour, that all the facts pleaded in the
 statement o f claim are true. The issue which was argued before us is
 whether under the law o f England any cause o f action lies against the
 police for the consequences o f a direct physical attack upon one citizen
 (Miss Hill) by another (Sutcliffe) in circumstances where the attacker
 was not a police officer and was not in police custody or, having been
 arrested, was allowed to escape from police custody but where reasonable
 care on the part o f the police would have resulted in the attacker’s
 previous arrest.

    If the answer is “N o ,” then the plaintiff must fail and there will be
no need for the lengthy trial which the examination o f the pleaded facts
would otherwise entail. Since the question is purely one o f law and will
probably have to be determined sooner or later whatever course the
action takes, it seem s appropriate to decide it at this juncture. It is, of
course, a novel point, in the sense that it has not previously been
decided, and cannot be said to be unarguable in the sense that there is a
short answer to it. But if at the end o f the argument, be it short or long,
the court is satisfied that no cause of action lies, I apprehend that the
court is entitled to decide the matter accordingly: see W illia m s a n d
H u m b e r t L td . v. W . & H . T ra d e M a r k s (Jersey) L t d . [1986] A .C . 368,
436. N o objection to the procedure is in fact raised and the matter has
been argued at length before us.
    In dealing with the case I will assume that, if the police ow ed Miss
Hill a duty of care in the conduct of their investigations into the
Yorkshire Ripper murders, the facts pleaded in the statement of claim
would, if proved, constitute a breach of that duty. The question is
whether the duty o f care existed. I begin with som e familiar quotations.
Lord A tk in ’s “general conception of relations giving rise to a duty of
care” was:
      “Y ou must take reasonable care .to avoid acts or om issions which
      you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbours.
      W ho, then, in law is my neighbour? The answer seem s to be—
      persons who are so closely and directly affected by my act that I
      ought reasonably to have them in contemplation as being so affected
      when I am directing my mind to the acts or ommissions which are
      called in question:” see D o n o g h u e v, Stevenson [1932] A .C . 562,
      580.

Lord R eid, in D o rs e t Y a c h t C o . L td . v. H o m e O ffic e [1970] A .C . 1004,
observed that Lord A tkin’s formulation was not to be treated as a
statutory definition; it would require qualification in new circumstances*
H e said, at p. 1027:
      “ But I think that the time has com e when we can and should say
      that it ought to apply unless there is som e justification or valid
      explanation for its exclusion. For exam ple, causing econom ic loss is
      a different matter. . . . ”

 Lord W ilberforce, in A n n s . v. M e r to n L o n d o n B o ro u g h C o u n c il [1978]
 A .C . 728, 751-52, said:
      “Through the trilogy o f cases in this House— D o n o g h u e v. Stevenson
      [1932] A .C . 562, H e d le y B y rn e & C o . L td . v, H e lle r & Partners
      L t d . [1964] A .C . 465, and D o rs e t Y ac h t C o . L td . v. H o m e O ffic e
      [1970] A .C . 1004, the position has now been reached that in order
      to establish that a duty o f care arises in a particular situation, it is
      not necessary to bring the facts of that situation within those o f
      previous situations in which a duty o f care has been held to exist.
      Rather the question has to be approached in two stages. First one
      has to ask w hether, as betw een the alleged wrongdoer and the
      person who has suffered damage there is a sufficient relationship o f
      proximity or neighbourhood such that, in the reasonable contem pla­
       tion o f the former, carelessness on his part may be likely to cause

      damage to the latter— in which case a prima facie duty o f care
      arises. Secondly, if the first question is answered affirmatively, it is
      necessary to consider whether there are any considerations which
      ought to negative, or to reduce or limit the scope o f the duty or the
      class o f person to w hom it is ow ed or the damages to which a
      breach o f it may give rise: see D o rs e t Y ac h t case [1970] A .C . 1004,
      p e r Lord Reid at p. 1027.”

A pplying this statem ent, the plaintiff contends first, that there was a
sufficient relationship o f neighbourhood or proximity and that it must
have been within the reasonable contemplation o f the police that failure
to exercise due care in their investigations could put at risk the life o f an
unaccom panied young wom an; and, secondly, it is said that there is no
consideration which ought to negative or limit the scope o f that duty.
    In G o v e rn o rs o f the P e a b o d y D o n a tio n F u n d v. S ir L in d s a y P a rk in s o n
& C o . L td . [1985] A .C . 210, Lord Keith o f Kinkel, with whom the other
members o f the H ouse agreed, after referring to the above observations
o f Lord Wilberforce put the position thus, at p. 240:
     “There has been a tendency in som e recent cases to treat these
     passages as being them selves o f a definitive character. This is a
     temptation which should be resisted. T he true question in each case
     is whether the particular defendant owed to the particular plaintiff a
   * duty o f care having the scope which is contended for, and whether
     he was in breach o f that duty with consequent loss to the plaintiff.
     A relationship o f proximity in Lord A tkin’s sense must exist before
     any duty o f care can arise, but the scope o f the duty must depend
     on all the circumstances o f the case. In D o rs e t Y a c h t C o . v. H o m e
     O ffic e [1970] A .C . 1004, 1038, Lord Morris o f Borth-y-G est, after
     observing that at the conclusion o f his speech in D o n o g h u e v.
     Stevenson [1932] A .C . 562, Lord Atkin said that it was advantageous
     if the law ‘is in accordance with sound com m on sense’ and expressing
     the view that a special relation' existed between the prison officers
     and the yacht com pany which gave rise to a duty on the former to
     control their charges so as to prevent them doing dam age, continued,
     at p. 1039: ‘Apart from this I would conclude that, in the situation
     stipulated in the present case, it would not only be fair and
     reasonable that a duty o f care should exist but that it would be
     contrary to the fitness o f things were it not so. I doubt whether it is
     necessary to say, in cases where the court is asked whether in a
     particular situation a duty existed, that the court is called upon to
     make a decision as to policy. Policy need not be invoked where
     reason and good sense will at once point the way. If the test as to
     whether in som e particular situation a duty o f care arises may in
     som e cases have to be whether it is fair and reasonable that it
     should so arise, the court must not shrink from being the arbiter.
     A s Lord Radcliffe said in his speech in D a v is C o n trac to rs L td , v.
     F a re h a m U r b a n D is tric t C o u n c il [1956] A .C . 696, 728, the court is
     “the spokesman o f the fair and reasonable m an.” ’ So in determining
     whether or not a duty o f care o f particular scope was incumbent
     upon a defendant it is material to take into consideration whether it
     is just and reasonable that it should be s o .”

It is, therefore, proper in the present case to inquire whether it is just
and reasonable that such a duty o f care as the plaintiff contends for
     The Weekly Law Reports 8 May 1987
                                                                                                 1133

A   should be established. In considering that, it is necessary to bear in mind
     throughout that Miss Hill was not killed by the West Yorkshire police.
     She was killed by the deliberate, and murderous, act of Sutcliffe.
         N ow , it is clear that the police have no general exem ption from the
     ordinary law o f the land. Thus, if a police car is driven negligently on
     the highway, the police may incur liability to a person who is injured in
     consequence. In M a r s h a ll v. O s m o n d [1983] Q .B . 1034 the plaintiff was
B   a willing occupant o f a car which had been driven away without the
     consent of its owner and which was being pursued by the police. The car
     eventually came to a halt and the occupants got out. The plaintiff was
     hit by the police car as the latter was drawing to a halt. Dealing with a
     plea o f volenti non fit injuria, Sir John Donaldson M .R . said, at p. 1038:
           “For my part I am bound to say that I do not believe that the
C          defence o f volenti non fit injuria is really applicable in the case of
           the police pursuing a suspected criminal. I think that the duty owed
           by a police driver to the suspect is . . . the same duty as that owed
           to anyone else, namely to exercise Such care and skill as is
           reasonable in all the circumstances.”

n   Further, the police are liable for assault, unlawful arrest, wrongful
u   imprisonment and malicious prosecution.
         A ll the above are, however, cases where the injury suffered by the
     complainant is the direct consequence o f the acts o f the police. Thus,
     the complainant is directly injured by the negligent driving or assault o f
     a police officer or his liberty is directly interfered with by police action
     or he is subjected to an improper prosecution by the positive act o f the
E   police. The present case is quite different. T he death of Miss Hill was
     the direct result o f the criminal act o f a third party. N o case has been
     cited to us, in any o f the United Kingdom or Commonwealth or United
     States o f Am erica jurisdictions, where the police have been made liable
     for the acts o f a criminal on the ground that they should previously have
     apprehended him. The case must be determined on principle and, if
     necessary, policy.
F        The police have a duty to enforce the law. Thus, in Reg, v.
     C o m m is s io n e r o f P o lic e o f the M e tro p o lis , E x p a rte B la c k b u rn [1968] 2
     Q .B . 118, 138, Salmon L.J. said: “In my judgment the police ow e the
     public a clear legal duty to enforce the law .” A nd Edmund Davies L.J.
     said, at pp. 148-149:
          “the law enforcem ent officers o f this country certainly ow e a legal
G        duty to the public to perform those functions which are the raison
          d ’etre o f their existence.”

    Although the duty to the public exists, it is not as wide as it looks. Lord
    Denning M .R . said, at p. 136:
         “I hold it to be the duty of the Commissioner o f Police o f the
H        M etropolis, as it is o f every chief constable, to enforce the law of
         the land. H e must take steps so to post his men that crimes may be
         detected; and that honest citizens may go about their affairs in
         peace. H e must decide whether or no suspected persons are to be
         prosecuted; and, if need be, bring the prosecution or see that it is
         brought. But in all these things he is not the servant o f anyone,
         save o f the law itself. N o Minister o f the Crown can tell him that he
         must, or must not, keep observation on this place or that; or that

       he must, or must not, prosecute this man or that one. Nor can any                     A    A

       lies on him. H e is answerable to the law and to the law alone . . .
       Although the chief officers o f police are answerable to the law,
       there are many fields in which they have a discretion with which the
       law will not interfere. For instance, it is for . . . the chief constable
       . . . to decide in any particular case whether inquiries should be                    g    B
       pursued, or whether an arrest should be m ade, or a prosecution
       brought . . . N o court can or should give him direction on such a
       matter. H e can also make policy decisions and give effect to them ,

         third person. It is, however, exceptional to find in the law a duty to
         control another’s actions to prevent harm to strangers. The general
         rule is that one man is under no duty o f controlling another man to
         prevent his doing damage to a third. There are, however, special
         relations which are the source o f a duty o f this nature. It appears
         now to be recognised that it is incumbent upon a parent who
         maintains control over a young child to take reasonable care so to
         exercise that control as to avoid conduct on his part exposing the
         oerson or property o f others to unreasonable danger. Parental
          control, where it exists, must be exercised with due care to prevent
          the child inflicting intentional damage on others or causing damage
          by conduct involving unreasonable risk o f injury to others.

        In D o rs e t Y a c h t C o . L td . v, H o m e O ffic e [1970] A .C . 1004 som e
    Borstal boys who were working on an island in Poole Harbour under
    the control of Borstal officers escaped during the night and went aboard
    a yacht which they found nearby. They set the yacht in m otion and
    collided with the p la in tiffs yacht which was moored in the vicinity.
    then boarded the latter yacht; much damage was done to it both by the
    collision and by the boys when they boarded it. The H ouse o f Lords, on
>    a preliminary issue, held that the Borstal officers owed the plaintiff a
    duty to take such care as was reasonable in all the circumstances with a
    view to preventing the boys under their control from causing damage of
     which there was a manifest risk if they neglected that duty, and that
     public policy did not require that there should be immunity from action

p    m ST he D o rs e t Y a c h t case is said by the plaintiff to bear a close
     similarity, on its facts, to the present. I do not think it does. In the first
     place the boys had been charged and sentenced and committed to the
     Borstal institution. They were in the custody o f the Borstal officers when
     they escaped. That was the basis of the special relationship which
     existed in that case. In the present case, Sutcliffe was never in the
     custody of the police at all in relation to his assaults. Certainly he had
F      been interviewed by the police on a number o f occasions. But many
      people must have been interviewed in the course o f the long series of
      investigations betw een 1969 and 1980. Secondly, the duty of care which
      the H ou se o f Lords held to exist in the the D o rs e t Y a c h t s was very
      limited. It was not a duty to any person who might s u f f e r damage or
      injury at the hands o f the boys while they were at large. Thus, Lord
G      Morris said, at p. 1039:
           “There was a special relation in that the officers were entitled to
           exercise control over boys who to the knowledge o f he officers
           might wish to take their departure and who might well do som e
           damage to property near at hand. The events which are said to
           have happened could reasonably have been foreseen . . . A duty
H           arose . . . It was not a duty to prevent the boys from escaping or
           from doing damage but a duty to take such                              Je
            circumstances was reasonable in the hope of preventing
            occurrence o f events likely to cause damage to the [plaintiff].

          In the present case the duty which is being contended for, i.e. the
       duty o f care in the conduct of investigations into crime, is a duty of
       great width. It is a duty, in effect, to all unaccompanied young wom en

 in the West Yorkshire police area. Indeed, if the duty exists at all, it is
 difficult to see why it should be restricted to the West Yorkshire police
 area. Sutcliffe might attack wom en in adjoining areas in Yorkshire and,
 for that matter, anywhere else in Britain. And there is no reason why
 the duty should be restricted to young w om en; if it exists it should
 extend to anybody who goes to the help o f a woman w ho was attacked.
 Is it just and reasonable to im pose such a duty upon the police in
 relation to the consequences o f the acts o f a criminal? Lord D iplock in
 the D o rs e t Y a c h t case said, at p. 1070:
      “It is com m on knowledge, o f which judicial notice may be taken,
      that Borstal training often fails to achieve its purpose o f reformation,
      and that trainees when they have ceased to be detained in custody
      revert to crime and commit tortious damage to the person and
      property o f others. But so do criminals who have never been
      apprehended and criminals w ho have been released from custody
     upon com pletion o f their sentences, or earlier pursuant to a statutory
     power to do so. The risk o f sustaining damage from the tortious
     acts o f criminals is shared by the public at large. It has never been
     recognised at com m on law as giving rise to any cause o f action
     against anyone but the criminal himself. It would seem arbitrary
    ^and therefore unjust to single out for the special privilege o f being
    "able to recover compensation from the authorities responsible for
     the prevention o f crime a person whose property was damaged by
     the tortious act o f a criminal merely because the dam age to him
     happened to be caused by a criminal w ho had escaped from custody
     before com pletion o f his sentence instead of by one w ho had been
     lawfully released or w ho had been put on probation or given a
     suspended sentence or w ho had never been previously apprehended
     at all.”

    Lord Diplock went on to say that to give rise to a duty o f care by a
custodian to m embers o f the public to take reasonable care to prevent
an escape, there must be som e relationship between the custodian and
the persons to whom the duty was ow ed which exposes that person to a
particular risk o f damage which is different in incidence from the general
risk o f damage from the criminal acts o f others which he shares with all
m em bers o f the public. That risk in the D o rs e t Y a c h t case he regarded
as extending only to persons w ho had property situate near the place o f
detention (the island) which the detainee was likely to steal or
appropriate or damage in the course o f eluding immediate pursuit. This
is because the detainee is likely to steal property in the immediate
vicinity in order to make good his escape: for exam ple, breaking in and
stealing m oney to get transport.
    In my opinion, and looking at the matter for the m om ent apart from
the state compensation schem e, it would not be a satisfactory state of
the law that persons w ho suffer injury to their person or are killed
by the direct acts o f a criminal, should have an effective cause o f action
if they can show carelessness by the police but not otherwise. I say
“effective” because a cause o f action will lie against the criminal himself,
but that is normally worthless. The problem is sharply illustrated by the
position o f Sutcliffe’s victims. It is not fitting, and it would indeed be
distasteful, that the compensation to , or to the estate of, the various

    victims o f Sutcliffe should depend upon whether their deaths occurrec|,
    or their injuries were sustained, early or late in the sequence of his
    crimes In the case o f the earlier — and certainly the first — o f the
    attacks the likelihood o f the police having information which might have
    prevented them is rem ote. A ll the victims met their deaths or were
    injured by a man who was an enem y of society and there is no valid
    reason why the general approach to compensation should vary accordingly
    [o the amount o f information available to the police as to the identity o f
    the criminal at a particular tim e. Nor, I think, would it be reasonable
    that if, for exam ple, on the day when Miss HiU was m jjrdered.another
     woman who had no dependants was murdered by a killer of whom the
     police had no previous know ledge, the approach to compensation should
     be totally different in the two cases. Both suffered the same consequence
     from the acts o f criminals. A s to the question o f special relationship,
     there is in my view , no special relationship here. Sutcliffe was not
     under the control o f the police. The fact that the police have a general
     duty to the public at large to suppress crime does not mean that the
     police have a special relationship with the possible perpetrator o f a
     crime which they are investigating. Sutcliffe was, of course, a great
     danger. It was in the interests o f the public at large that he shmild be
)     caught. A nd the police had a general duty to the public to try an d M tch
      him. But the fact that they attempted to perform that duty does no
      create a special relationship betw een them and Sutcliffe. So long
      Sutcliffe was at large he might, o f course, commit f u n h e r c n m e s . Bu
      escaped Borstal boys might until recapture commit offences up and
      down the country; but the only cause o f action held to exist was the very
       limited one in relation to property in the vicinity which I have mentioned.
       T he H om e Office was not held to be answerable for any offences which
       the boys might commit before recapture.
            I now com e to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Schem e established
       by the government. Historically, English law has left the consequences
       o f the tortious acts of criminals to be borne by the members o f the
       public who suffered them . What we are c o n c e m e d w i t h i n t h i s c a s e i s
       whether it is just and reasonable that, or, if it be preferred, whether as a
        matter o f policy, a cause o f action should he agamst the police in the
        alleged circumstances o f the present case which I have assumed, solely
        for the purposes o f this application, would constitute a breach of duty if
        one exists. If the state m ade no provision at all for criminalin ju r ie sth a t
        might be a reason for imposing a legal duty of care upon the police in
        the conduct o f their investigations, though, for the reasons which I ha e
        indicated, I think that would produce unfair results betw een th ev ict.m s
        o f crime. In fact, how ever, the s t a t e h a s provided a * h e m e o f
         com pensation for criminal injuries since 1964 when the Crimmal Injuries
         Com pensation Board was established, Claims for ex gratia payments o
         compensation can be made to the board by a victim of a crime of
         violence. A claim is entertained where an applicant, or, in the case of a
         application by a dependant o f a deceased person, t h e deceased, suffered
         personal injury attributable to , inter alia, a criminal offence or the arrest

Fox L .J.                   Hill v. Chief Constable (C.A.)                   {1987}

Criminal Justice Bill 1986, clauses 73 to 82. Apart from dam age to
clothing and som e personal effects arising from the injury, the schem e is
not concerned with damage to property. That will normally be covered
 by insurance.
     The schem e does not provide for claims by a parent o f an unmarried
victim over 18, though the Bill, it seem s, may do so. That, however, is
not, I think, o f consequence for present purposes. What is important, in
my view, is this. The schem e, and the Bill, make quite wide provision
for compensation for such persons as are likely to suffer financial loss as
a result o f a crime o f violence. It is not desirable that inequalities should
be produced by providing additional remedies for negligence. Either
such rem edies will merely duplicate the schem e, or they will give rise to
inequalities which may be offensive to the families of other victims of
crimes o f violence in cases where no negligence by the police was
involved. I quite appreciate that the plaintiff is not seeking financial
benefit for herself and that nothing can compensate her for the tragic
loss of her daughter. But I think that the problems o f compensation for
injury from crimes of violence are best dealt with in the framework of
the schem e as it may be enacted which has been developed for m ore
than 20 years with a view to dealing with the particular difficulties o f the
subject matter and to the establishment o f an acceptable system of
compensation.
     I summarise the position thus: (1) It is not sufficient, in order to
establish a duty of care, to show that the defendant could reasonably
foresee damage in consequence of his alleged carelessness. T he matter
has to be considered much more widely and in particular by reference to
the test whether the imposition o f such a duty is just and reasonable at
all. (2) The cause o f action contended for would impose a duty o f care
o f undue width and does not fall within the principle of the D o rs e t Y a c h t
case [1970] A .C . 1004. (3) There is already in existence a compensation
schem e, financed by the governm ent, for the provision o f compensation
for criminal injuries and which the Bill now before Parliament seeks to
put into statutory form. (4) The cause o f action could lead to unfair and
unacceptable differences in the remedies available in consequence of
criminal injuries. (5) In the circumstances, I do not think that the courts
would be justified in extending the law by providing a remedy for
criminal injury which has never previously been given. I think, therefore,
that the judge was right to strike out the proceedings. I would dismiss
the appeal.


    G l i d e w e l l L.J. I have had the advantage o f reading in draft the
judgm ent delivered by Fox L.J. I agree with both his reasoning and his
conclusion that this appeal should be dismissed. I add som e further
observations because o f the importance o f the issue raised in these
proceedings. That issue can be expressed as follows. D o police officers
who are conducting an investigation into crimes o f violence committed
by a person who has not yet been arrested ow e a duty o f care to
mem bers o f the public, the breach o f which duty is likely to result in the
offender remaining at liberty and killing or attacking further victims?
    Paragraph 6 o f the statement o f claim asserts— for present purpose
w e must assume correctly— that:

Glidewell L .J.                    Hill v. Chief Constable (C.A.)                                       [19871

 give the answer which it thinks justice and public policy require. Mr.
 Rawley submits that public policy clearly dictates that, in the
 circumstances o f the present case, no duty should arise. Like Sir Neil
 Lawson, I agree with him.
      If the police were liable to be sued for negligence in the investigation
 o f crime which has allowed the criminal to commit further crimes, it
 must be expected that actions in this field would not be uncommon.
 Investigative police work is a matter o f judgment, often no doubt
 dictated by experience or instinct. The threat that a decision which, in
 the end, proved to be wrong might result in an action for damages
 would be likely to have an inhibiting effect on the exercise o f that
 judgment. The trial o f such actions would very often involve the retrial
 o f matters which had already been tried at the Crown Court. While no
 doubt many such actions would fail, preparing for and taking part in the
 trial o f such an action would inevitably involve considerable work and
 time for a police force, and thus either reduce the manpower available
 to detect crime or increase expenditure on police services. In short, the
 reasons for holding that the police are immune from an action o f this
kind are similar to those for holding that a barrister may not be sued for
negligence in his conduct o f proceedings in court: R o n d e l v. W orsley
[1969] 1 A .C . 191.
     Fox L.J. has already referred to the Criminal Injuries Compensation
Schem e as providing a remedy for victims o f criminal violence. The
existence o f that remedy would, if I had doubt as to whether there is a
duty o f care, have been a relevant matter to take into account.
     There is one other consideration which supports the jud ge’s decision.
In Reg. v. C o m m is s io n e r o f P o lic e o f the M e tro p o lis , E x p a rte B la c k b u rn
[1968] 2 Q .B . 118 both Lord D enning M .R ., at p. 136, and Salmon L.J.,
at pp. 138-139, made clear their view that, while the police ow e a duty
to members o f the public to enforce the law, the way in which the courts
should, if necessary, enforce that duty was by an order o f mandamus. It
is true that no question o f an action in tort arose in that case, but the
decision is a pointer to the conclusion that the judicial remedy for a
failure by the police to carry out their duty lies, in modern phraseology,
in the field o f public rather than private law.
     For these reasons I would uphold the decision o f the judge to strike
out the writ and statement o f claim and dismiss the action. I would
dismiss this appeal.

was that they had done, The justices in this case accordingly held that
the defendant was still disqualified on December 22, 1980, and on March
14,1981.
    For the reasons I have given there was, in my view, no evidence
which entitled them to take that view, and accordingly in my judgment
this appeal should be allowed.

    D onaldson L.J, I agree. In Reg. v. B o b s h e r [1973] R .T.R , 202, to
which Webster J, has referred, the justices reached an equivocal decision
so far as the record showed. T h e additional period of disqualification
Slight have been consecutive to the primary period or it might have been
concurrent therewith. In those circumstances, authority apart, I can well
Understand their decision being construed in such a way as to comply with
the law rather than in such a way as to contravene the law.
    But this case is quite different. Here, so far as the record of conviction
is concerned, it is quite clear that the justices intended to reach a decision
which inadvertently contravened the requirements of the Road Traffic
Act 1972. But one of the freedoms which we all enjoy in this country is
the freedom of justices to make mistakes, and I see no reason why that
freedom should be abridged particularly when to do so would involve
the commission of an offence by this gentleman who, for the reasons
Webster J. has given, I do not think has committed an offence.

                             On A u g u st 31, 1977, the applicant w as sworn into t h e office
                       o f constable as a probationary m em ber o f the North Wales
                       police force. H e obtained go od progress reports. On January
                       31 1978, a report w as m ad e to the divisional chief superin-:
                       tendent in w hich it w as stated, inter alia, that it was believed
                       that the applicant had married his aunt, Mrs. E, and that there
                       was no p roo f that sh e w as divorced from her previous husband
                       and that prior to their marriage the applicant and Mrs. E had
                       resided at a hippy com m u n e. It w as subsequently^ established
                       that Mrs. E w as not the applicant’s aunt, thoughi she had been ,
                       the mistress o f the applicant’s uncle, and was divorced from
                       her form er husband, and the allegation that the applicant ana
                       Mrs. E had resided at a hippy com m un e was wrong. When
                       the applicant had been given police accom m odation, a council
                       house, he had inquired whether it w o u ld be all right for him to
                       keep his four dogs there, which w as contrary to councU
                       regulations, and had been told by a council official that it
                       w o u ld be all right s o long as n o b o d y complained. N o com­
                       plaint was m ade, but in the autumn o f 1978 t h e applicant was
                       told by the council that he w ould have to get rid o f the dqgs.
                       H e was interviewed about the dogs by a superintendent and
                        indicated that he w o u ld try to find alternative accommodation
                        for them but that the prospect o f success seem ed remote. OB,
                        N o v em b er 6, 1978, the deputy chief constable in a memorath,
                        dum o f an interview w ith the applicant w hich he forwarded to
                        the ch ie f constable said that it w as very doubtful in his view
                        whether people w h o deliberately flouted conditions o f tenancy
                        w ere suitable to b e in the police service. On November 8. the
                        applicant w as briefly interviewed by the chief constable, wno
                        told him that , he had m ade a mistake m accepting him and
                        gave him the opportunity o f resigning as a n alternative to
                        form ally dispensing w ith his services. A s a result, the applicant
                         on N o vem b er 9 signed a form al letter o f resignation. He
                         applied for judicial review o f the ch ief con stables decision. In
                         his affidavit in answer to the applicant’s statement andaffitevit,
                         the ch ief constable asserted that regulation 16 (1) o f the PoLce
                         R egulations 1971 1 gave him an absolute d i s c r e t e to dispense

                         factors: that the applicant had married a w o m a n much oder
                         than him self, the form er mistress o f his u n c le which migW
                         give rise to so m e scandal, which w ou ld not be in the interns
                          o f the force; that the applicant and his w ife were keeping four
                          or five dogs in a p olice council house, where there was *
                          permitted limit o f o n e dog; and that the applicant and m.
                          w ife had lived a “ hippy ” life style. In an affidavit in reply, the
                          applicant answered th ose criticisms and deposed that if he baa

 as held by him on November 7, 1978; and a declaration that the decision ^
 by the chief constable had been illegal, ultra vires and void, on the grounds
 that the decision had been contrary to the established principles of natural >
 justice in that the applicant had not been informed what was alleged against
 him, nor allowed the opportunity to be heard by way of defence or
 explanation and his request for a reason for the decision had been refused
 outright; the decision was ultra vires and void in that the chief constable had
 imposed a particular type o f punishment, namely “ a requirement to resign ®
 from the force as an alternative to dismissal,’* which could only be imposed
 where a charge was found to be proved after the proper procedures laid
 down by the Police (Discipline) Regulations 1977 had been followed; further,
 if, as appeared probable, the chief constable’s decision had been based on
 alleged misconduct he should have followed the procedures laid down by
 the Regulations of 1977; the proper procedures had not been followed at
all, in particular, the applicant had not been informed o f the allegation or
complaint or charge against him nor afforded the right to personal explana­
tion and a hearing; the chief constable in making the decision had been f
activated by extraneous matters outside the scope of his jurisdiction in that
there had been no legitimate grounds on which he could dispense with the
applicant’s services; if, as appeared probable, the chief constable in making
the decision had been activated by the fact that the applicant kept dogs
in a council house, that had n o t been a proper matter on which to order
the applicant's services to be dispensed with; the applicant had never been
ordered to dispose of the dogs, and, indeed, the applicant’s superior officers
would have had no jurisdiction to make such an order; and the chief f
constable in making the decision had failed to act judicially in that the "
applicant had not been informed what was alleged against him, nor allowed
the opportunity to be heard by way of defence or an explanation, and in
that the chief constable had taken into account matters outside the scope
of his jurisdiction and refused outright the applicant's request for a reason
for the decision.
     On March 23, 1981, W oolf J., sitting as a Divisional Court, ordered that
there be no order on the motion save as to costs.
     The applicant appealed, on the grounds that W oolf J. had failed
properly to exercise his discretion when, having reached the conclusion that
the decision made on November 7, 1978, by the chief constable had been ;;
tainted with unfairness and must be regarded as being void, he had refused
to make any declaration to that effect or order pursuant to such conclusion :
save that relating to costs, since (a) such refusal would result in injustice
to the applicant and (b) W oolf J. had exercised the discretion under mis*
takes of law and misapprehensions as to the facts as thereafter set out; that
W oolf J. had been wrong in law in holding that the applicant had only been ,
appointed a police officer for a period of two years and that in any event
after that period his engagement would have come to an end unless he
were established as a police officer and there had been no, or insufficient,-
evidence on which W oolf J. could have so held; that Woolf J. had been'
Wrong in law in holding that the court could give no remedy now that would
enable the applicant to serve the period for which he would have remained-
if his engagement had not been terminated; that W oolf J. had misdirected,
himself in holding that it was not necessary to resolve the dispute as tot
whether the memorandum dated November 6, 1978, of the deputy chief,
constable of the North Wales Police wholly accurately set out what had?
happened at the meeting between the applicant and the deputy chief*
constable on November 3, 1978; that W oolf J. ought to have made an ord

      t that, if he had had to resolve the dispute referred to on the material
    ore him, he would have regarded the memorandum of the deputy chief
       table as being more likely to be accurate than the applicant’s recollect*
      had been against the weight of the evidence, in particular since (a) the
    th of the contents of the memorandum had not been deposed to in any
        ivit (save in so far as the applicant himself had deposed that certain
    its contents were correct), nor had there; been any oral evidence given;
  J the memorandum had not been formally exhibited to any affidavit and
    contents were ambiguous; (c) the applicant had disputed the accuracy o f
   rutin of the contents o f the memorandum in his affidavit of January 15,
 931, and no evidence in rebuttal on that issue had been filed by the chief
 instable; (d) the matters had been of vital importance to the applicant and
   would be highly improbable that they could have escaped his memory;
 ~d that Woolf J.’s view that, had the chief constable confined his decision
    the matter of the dogs, then there would not have been any ground for
      ang to impugn the decision, had been wrong in law and contrary to the
   ;ght of the evidence.
     The chief constable cross-appealed, contending that the decision of
  qolf J. should be varied in any event; alternatively that his decision should
     affirmed on grounds other than those relied on by him; and that his
   :ision had been wrong in whole or in part, and asking the court to make
    order on the application (save as to costs), on the grounds that W oolf J.’s
   ‘.elusion that in reaching the decision to dismiss the applicant the chief
      stable had taken into acount the applicant’s domestic situation (other
        that merely concerning his dogs) had not been justified by the evidence;
that Woolf J. had concluded that the chief constable had been perfectly
Entitled to take the view that the applicant’s conduct in relation to the dogs
       not of the standard that he required of his probationary police officers
        to come to a conclusion that it was evidence that indicated a short-
      ling that fell within regulation 16 of the Police Regulations 1971; he had
  ither concluded that the decision to dismiss made in relation to the dogs
   uld not be impugned; in the circumstances, he had been incorrect in hold­
ing that the decision to dismiss was tainted by unfairness; and that he had
   sn wrong in law in holding that the rules of natural justice had any
   plication to an exercise of discretion o f the sort that the chief constable
   1 been exercising under regulation 16; the applicant had been dismissed
    m an office held during pleasure and as such had had no right to be heard
       re he had been dismissed.
     On December 21, 1981, the Court of Appeal (Lord Denning M .R.,
   :w and Ackner L.JJ.) allowed the applicant’s appeal and dismissed the
  ief constable’s cross-appeal, granting the applicant a declaration that the
     •sion of the chief constable o f Novem ber 7, 1978, was void. On January
      1982, the court refused an application by the chief constable for leave
    appeal to the House o f Lords. On March 11, 1982, the Appeal Com-
   ttee of the House of Lords (Lord Diplock, Lord Fraser of Tullybelton
   d Lord Bridge of Harwich) allowed a petition by the chief constable for
 "veto appeal.

analysis of the facts .and argument contained in the speech of my
 and learned friend, Lord B rightm an,w hich I haV§ read in draft, r
% r o f m u # |5 o f the labour in this case, ari$J|pab& me to
 observations t wish to make to reasonably co n cise proportions. I da
 however, to say a t the outset that 1 agree with every word which is a
 to fall from my noble a n d -learned friend q j j f e theitreattttent to which'
 young respondent has been subjected by the appellant. Like my noble1
-learned friend, I $o not doubt the appellant’s good faith, but m the res
 partly as the result of muddle, partly as the result of a false view of
 law, and partly as the result of a disregard of the elementary principles
 natural jygtige, I-sregard the treatment m eted o u t to^his young man as li
 short of ipulrageous.
       Briefly, the proceedings originated h u m application by the respond
 for judicial review under JR..S.C., O K T s fp jfc ji decision Ijy the appe
 (then chief constable o ftfh e police f o r c e ? # N o # . Wales) whereby
 November 1978 he had given the respondent, at tftat time a probaUo
 constable, the option o f resignation from office or dismissal on a moni
 notice under regulation 16 of the relevant regulations (Police Regulati
  1971). In the event, the respondent had chosen resignation, but had scr
 relief under ’R.S.C.* Ord. 53 on the basis that h e had been treated unf*
 and in a manner, contrary to natural justice.                        . . . .  t
       The first observation, I wish to make is by way of criticism of so
  remarks of LordJDenning M .R. which s e e m H ’me cagal?leof an erron~
 construction of the purpose of the remedy by way of judicial review un
  R.S.C., Ord. 53. This remedy, vastly increased in extent, and tend
  over a long period in recent years, of infinitely more convenient access
  that provided by the old prerogative writs and actions for a declaration,
  intended* to protect the individual against the abuse of power by a wi
  range of authorities, judicial, quasi*judicial, and, as would originally h*
  been thought when I -first practised at the. Bar, administrative. It is
  intended to take away from those authorities; the powers and discreti
  properly vested in them by law and to substitute the, courts as the bod1
  making the decisions. | t is intended to see that the relevant authorities
   their powers in a proper manner.                                       .        .
        Since the range of authorities, and the circumstances of the use ot tn
   power, are almost infinitely various, it is of course unwise to lay down ru
   for the application of the remedy which appear to. be of universal vau
   in every type of case. But it is important tQ remember in every case that
    purpose of the remedies is to ensure that the individual is given fairtreatm-
    by the authority to which he has been subjected and that it is no part of
    purpose to substitute the opinion of the judiciary or of individual j
    for that of the authority constituted by law to decide the matters kn
    tion. The function of the court is to see that lawful authority is not a’
    by unfair treatment and not to attempt itself the task entrusted to
    authority by the law. There are passages in 'th e judgment of I
    Denning M .R . (and perhaps in the other judgments of the Court
    Appeal) in the instant case and quoted by my noble and learned fn
    which might be read as giving the courts carte blanche to review
    decision of the authority on the basis of what the courts themselves consi
    fair and reasonable on the merits. I am not sure whether the Master of
    Rolls really intended hi& remarkOT.be construed in such a, way as to -
    the court to exaniine., as for instance in the present case, the reasoning
    the subordinate futhority with a view to substituting its own opinion. If

connection with the relevant inquiry, whether at the delegated hearing or
otherwise. Moreover, it was conceded by the appellant’s counsel that, at
the time of the extremely brief interview at which the decision was made
by the appellant, the appellant had already made up his mind to dispense
with the respondent’s services on the basis o f the report made to him by
the deputy chief constable, and the respondent was given no chance to say
anything by way of denial of the facts alleged in the report or in mitigation
o f them.
     A s an example of the extreme danger of proceeding in this way, it must
be observed that, as one of the two clinching matters which seem to have
influenced him, the appellant says in his affidavit: “ Further, it became
known ” (sic) “ to senior officers that the applicant and his wife had lived a
‘ h ip p y ’ type life-style at Tyddyn M ynyddig Farm, Bangor.” -This had
 never been put to the respondent at all, and had the appellant or his deputy
to whom he delegated the inquiry taken the trouble to ask the respondent
about it, he would have discovered at once that this allegedly clinching
 allegation was palpably untrue, and simply the result of a mistaken address.
 It was, in short, an utterly incorrect statement relied upon precisely owing
 to the failure of natural justice of which complaint is made.                       :
      There is room for greater controversy regarding the other matter sup­
 posedly clinching. There was a finding by the deputy who conducted the
 inquiry that the respondent had “ deliberately flouted ” the conditions of;
 tenancy at his council house by keeping dogs in excess of the number
 permitted by the council and that this exhibited an attitude to authority
 improper in a member of the police force. This matter had indeed been put
 to the respondent in som e form, but there is a conflict of evidence relating
 to the interview, of which only the respondent’s version is on oath. Without
 seeking to resolve this conflict, I am of the opinion that natural justice
  required that it should have been put precisely to the respondent that exact
 compliance with the conditions of tenancy within the extended time per*
  mitted by the council, which at the time of the interview had not >“
 expired, would probably be a condition of his continuance in office a st
  probationary constable. It is clear that this was not done and it is fa!
  to the respondent to say that he deposed on oath that, had it been put'
  this way, “ I would have disposed of the dogs.” Without going into ”
 conclusively, I must express doubt whether, on a fair view of the evide
  the appellant, had he applied his mind at all to the correct criteria, or to
  evidence available to him in his file, or had he given the respondent
  chance to speak, could possibly have com e to the conclusion that the ‘
  relating to this aspect of the matter betrayed an attitude to authority in
  sistent with the view that the respondent could at the conclusion of
  probationary period become an efficient or well conducted constable, or
  he was in any sense deliberately flouting authority. However this may
  the decision of the appellant was, it seems to me, vitiated beyond re.
  partly by the fact that the appellant does not appear to have directed
  mind to the correct criteria laid down in the Regulations, and partly by
  fact that he certainly took into account matters which were never put
  the respondent in connection with the relevant inquiry, one of which,
  not the least important, had it been put, would have been immedi*
  cxposed as nonsense.
       Like my noble and learned friend, I find much more difficulty in deci
  the order which it is. appropriate for the House to make in a casesu:
  the present. In R id g e v. B a ld w in [ 1 9 6 4 ] A.C. 40 , a majority of the Hr

the chief constable was “ void.” This was the language adopted by the
Court of Appeal in the instant case, Personally, I find difficulty in applying
 die language of “ void ” and “ voidable ” (appropriate enough in situations
of contract or of alleged nullity of marriage) to administrative decisions
which give rise to practical and legal consequences which cannot be reversed.
Under pressure, which I have considered to be inappropriate and unfair,
the respondent, nearly four years ago, was compelled to resign as an alter­
native to dismissal from office. That was in November 1978. H e was then
a probationary constable with 10 months of service to run. I am inclined
to think that his decison, though made under duress, to pursue the option
of resignation did put an end to the tenure of his office as constable. If
so, a declaration simply to declare void the decision of the appellant to offer
the respondent a H obson’s choice between resignation and dismissal is a
mere brutum fulmen without practical consequences. This may be illus­
trated by asking a number of quasi-rhetorical questions. If the decision
was “ void,” has the respondent been a constable in the police force in
North Wales in the intervening four years and what has happened to the
10 months of uncompleted probationary service? Since the only decision
removing him from office was the decision now impugned has he now
become an established constable? Has he acquired pension rights? Is he
entitled to back pay? The respondent has moved house. We are told that
he has found other, though less rewarding, employment in the Civil Service.
Can we simply put the clock back as if nothing has taken place? Presum­
ably the respondent has lost much of his training and experience. If he
returned, and if he is still a probationary constable, he would still be subject
to regulation 16 and the possibility, after a fair inquiry, of dismissal on a
month’s notice. It might well be thought that after what has happened it
might be considered by the new chief constable that the respondent could
not become an efficient constable or at least not without further training.
His counsel said that, if reinstated, he would apply for a transfer to another
force. But what possible guarantee have w e that another force would now
have him, or that the transfer would be in the public interest if it did?
These would be matters for the the relevant authority. The respondent has
not sought damages, which, in my view, might well have proved substantial,
and, though the appellant stated to us that he would be prepared to pay
compensation if the appeal went against him on the merits, even in the
face of this, through his counsel, the respondent firmly stated that he was
not interested in money and simply wanted “ reinstatement ” whatever that
might mean. This problem did not arise in R id g e v. B a ld w in where the
chief constable did not seek reinstatement, and was content with a
declaration and his pension rights.
    Are we then to leave the respondent wholly without remedy without
spelling      the consequences? In that case, the order of the Court of
Appeal stands and the decision of the chief constable is declared “ void ”
without spelling out what this means. It would be possible, of course,
Simply to quash the decision o f the appellant as in the old writ of certiorari.
But this, too, would leave the parties without a clue as to their present
position or any direction as to their future conduct. But what the respond­
ent wishes is reinstatement. There is no cross-appeal, but it must be within
the power of your Lordships’ H ouse to vary the order of the Court of
Appeal. M y own belief is that this would have been pre-eminently a case
which would have been dealt with most effectively either by re-engagement
perhaps on a fresh term, which the appellant does not offer, or by substantial

           monetary* compensation for which the respondent does not ask. Your
           Lordships’ House is therefore put in a position in which it is compelled to
           make an order within the limits o f the powers given the court by R A U
           Ord. 53 which must in any circumstances be less than satisfactory. 1 must
           confess to surprise, and even to some degree of indignation, that, despite
           the offer of compensation should the tide of argument go against him, the
           appellant gave no instructions to counsel to tender to the respondent toe
           smallest expression of regret at the really extraordinary treatment metea
           out to him or even the most qualified offer of re-engagement in the face ot
           the respondent’s persistent desire to rejoin the force (described in much

           A s it is, the order of the Court of Appeal cannot stand unaltered, and the
            best that your Lordships’ House can properly do for the respondent is the
            course proposed by my noble and learned friend with which I now concur.
            Happily, the Appeal Committee, as a condition of giving leave to appeal
            directed that the appellant bear the respondent’s costs of the appeal in any

 %i".          I wish to emphasise that the only matter which I am deciding is that tne
|gr>.       process by which the chief constable reached his decision in this case was
Ilf-'       unfair in respect that the respondent was never told the reasons why ms
 I "■       dismissal was being considered, and that he was given no opportunity of
            making an explanation about the matters of complaint against him. I tun
ill         far from saying that, if the procedure had been fair, the chief constable
tc          would not have been entitled to reach the decision that he did. Whether
            the decision itself was fair and reasonable is not a matter that can be raised
            in the present proceedings, but, having regard to the criticisms of the chief
            constable’s decision made by the Court of Appeal, I think it is only right
■m-         to say that if he had decided, after hearing the respondent’s explanations,
M.          that the respondent’s conduct in marrying a woman who had been living
            in the same house as him on the footing that she was his aunt showed that
            he was not likely to become a well conducted constable, I very much doubt j
            whether the decison could have been said to be unreasonable.                   I
                I agree that the two declarations proposed by Lord Brightman should j
            be made.

            with which I agree and I too would dismiss the appeal.

                L o r d B r id g e o f H a r w ic h . M y Lords, the facts o f this most unhappy I
             case are fully set out in the speech of my noble and learned friend, Lord]
             Brightman. There are only certain aspects of the case on which I wish toj
             comment.                                                                        .
                 The chief constable’s decision to force the resignation of the respondent!
             was vitiated both by his erroneous assumption that he had an absolutel
             discretion and by his total failure to observe the rules of natural justice,!
             T he matters considered fell into two categories, first the respondent’s privtttj

I A category because the chief constable gave the respondent no opportunity
I    to refute the allegations against him, he acted on false information. If the
I    truth had been established, the only matters for consideration under this
I    head would have been that the respondent was married to a lady some 14
I    years older than himself whom he had previously treated as an aunt, because
I    she had for some years lived as man and wife, although not married, with
1    the respondent’s uncle by whom she had four children. For my part, I
i B should regard these matters as irrelevant to the question whether the
    respondent was likely to become an efficient or well-conducted constable.
         With regards to the dogs, I do not dissent from the view that a chief
    officer of police who is contemplating dispensing with the services of a
    probationer constable under regulation 16 of the Police Regulations 1971
    may delegate to a suitable subordinate the investigation of a specific com-
  C plaint with a view to giving the constable a fair opportunity to meet the
    allegations made against him. But in the case of such delegation certain
    conditions should be observed. First the delegate should make clear to the
    constable the precise nature of the complaint and that he, the delegate,
    is acting on behalf o f the chief officer of police to hear whatever the
    constable wishes to say about it. Secondly, the delegate should make a
    full report to the chief officer of what the constable has said. Thirdly, the
  u chief officer should himself show the report to the constable and invite any
    comment on it before reaching any decision under regulation 16.
        The evidence as to what happened with regard to the respondent’s dogs
    is the least satisfactory part of this case. The memorandum of November 6,
    1978, of the deputy chief constable exhibited to the affidavit of the chief
    constable contains matter which has never been verified by an affidavit of
  E the deputy chief constable, although much of it is flatly contradicted by the
    affidavit o f the respondent.      O f the three conditions I have referred to
    above as necessary to the investigation of a complaint by a delegate of the
    chief officer o f police, it is doubtful if the first two were observed. It is
    certain that the third was not. On the probabilities, it is hard to believe
    that the respondent, whose dedicated enthusiasm for a police career has
  _ never been doubted, if faced with the stark alternatives o f removing three
  r of his dogs from his council house o r being dismissed from the force, would
    have chosen the latter.
        My Lords, I agree with my noble and learned friends, the Lord Chan­
    cellor and Lord Brightman, that the most difficult problem posed by this
    appeal is to decide what remedy is appropriate and further that the form
    of declaration made by the Court o f Appeal is unsatisfactory in that its
    practical consequences are uncertain. So far as it lies within our power,
    we should, above all, make clear to the parties what their respective rights
    and obligations are in consequence o f any order to be pronounced. There
    is no doubt in m y mind that the respondent has suffered a grievous wrong.
    It should not be beyond the power of the courts to provide a suitable
    remedy. The respondent has throughout disclaimed any interest in mone-
    tary compensation. What he seeks is reinstatement. This could only be
    secured by an order o f mandamus requiring the present chief constable of
    the North Wales Police to reinstate him as a probationer constable who has
    already completed 14 months of his probationer service. I have no doubt
    your Lordships have power to make such an order and was at one time
    strongly inclined to think that it should be made. I know now that none
    of your Lordships favour such an order and it would therefore be an empty
    gesture for me to express a formal dissent on the point. But, that apart, I

^ So cases of dismissal need to be considered on their own. Lord Reid
  divided these into three categories. First, dismissal o f a servant by his
  master. Here no relevant question arises as to whether the master has
  heard the servant in his defence unless, presumably, the principle of audi
  alteram partem has been made a term of the contract. The question is
  whether the facts em erging at the trial prove a breach o f contract. If
  so, damages are payable for the breach. Secondly, dismissal from an
® office held during p leasu re:
        “ It has always been held, I think rightly, that such an officer has no
        right to be heard before he is dism issed, and the reason is clear.
        As the person having the power of dismissal need not have anything
        against the officer, he need not give any reason ” ( p er Lord Reid, at
        p. 65).”
c
    Thirdly, dismissal from an office where there must be som ething against
    the office holder to warrant his dismissal.
        “ There I find an unbroken line o f authority to the effect that an
        officer cannot law fully be dismissed w ithout first telling him what is
        alleged against him and hearing his defence or explanation ” ( p er
P       Lord Reid, at p. 66).
      I turn secondly to the proper purpose of the remedy o f judicial review,
   what it is and what it is not. In my opinion the law was correctly stated
   in the speech of Lord Evershed, at p. 96.            His was a dissenting
   judgment but the dissent was not concerned with this point. Lord Ever-
   shed referred to “ a danger o f usurpation o f power on the part of the
t. courts . . . under the pretext of having regard to the principles o f natural
   justice.” H e ad d ed :
        “ I do observe again that it is not the decision as such which is liable
        to review; it is only the circum stances in which the decision was
        reached, and particularly in such a case as the present the need for
        giving to the party dismissed an opportunity for putting his case.”

P Judicial review is concerned, not with the decision, but with the decision­
  making process. U nless that restriction on the power of the court is
  observed, the court will in my view, under the guise of preventing the
  abuse of power, be itself guilty of usurping power.
     I leave these preliminary observations in order to consider the judg­
  ments in the Court o f A p p ea l It was accepted by each member of the
  court that the case fell within the third o f Lord R eid’s categories; that
  the respondent was entitled to a fair hearing; and that he had not had
  one. However Lord D enning M .R. added this:
         “ I go further. N ot only must he be given a fair hearing, but the
         decision itself m ust be fair and reasonable. T hat is the protection
         afforded to every servant who is em ployed under a contract o f service.
         He is protected against unfair dismissal. N o less protection should
         be afforded to a probationer constable.”
     The learned Master o f the R olls then concluded by saying that “ it is my
     opinion that the chief constable was not justified in dispensing with the
     services of Constable Evans or in requiring him to resign.” Shaw L.J.
     and Ackner L.J. concurred.
        In his submissions to this H ouse, counsel for the appellant subm itted
     that the chief constable took into account all the matters which appeared

  unexceptionable. O ther c o n sid era tio ns arise w h e n an a d m in is trative d ecisio n

  the well k n o w n ju d g m e n t o f Lord G r e e n e M . R . in Associated Provincial
  Picture Houses Ltd, v. Wednesbury Corporation [ 1 9 4 8 ] 1 K .B . 223,
      I agree enti rely with the C our t o f A p p e a l , and in d eed with the D iv is io n a l
   Court, that the resp on d en t did not h a v e the fair h ea ring to w h ic h h e wa*
C entitled. I differ o n ly from the Court of A p p e a l o n the ex ten t o f thc court s
  supervisory jurisdiction.
      I turn n o w to th c qu estion o f remedies. T h e C ourt o f A p p e a l granted
  the respondent a declaration that the d ecisio n requiring thc respondent^ to
  resign or be dism issed w a s void. I feel s o m e m isg iv in g s a b o u t a declara tion
  in that form b e c a u se it is not clear to m e w hat c o n s e q u e n c e s flow from it.
D Whatever rem e d y m a y be granted b y thc co urt in this ca se, 1 think it i*
  highly desi rable that the N o r th W a le s P olice an d the resp o n d en t sh o u ld be
  in no doubt h o w , un der the order, th ey will stand in relation to ea ch other.
      The c o n c l u s io n rea ch ed by the D iv is io n a l C o u r t, the C o u r t o f A p p e a l
  and by this H o u s e , if y o u r L ord sh ip s are in a g r e e m e n t with m e, is that the
  chief co n stable ac te d un la w fu lly and in breach o f his duty undei regulation
   16 in th reaten in g to d is p en se with the resp o n d e n t's serv ices unless h e re-
E signed fr om the N o rth W a le s Poli ce and in thus ca u sin g him to resign. T h a t
   having been es tab lished, the respondent is, in m y v ie w , en titled at least to a
   declaration to that effect. But th e matter c a n n o t b e satisfactorily left there.
   One must k n o w w hat are the c o n s e q u e n c e s that fl ow fr o m th e breach ol
   duty.
        One p ossib ilit y w o u l d be to a dd to that d eclaration an order o f
 F mandamus. T h e respond ent h as o n e desire a nd o n e d esi re on ly , n a m ely ,
   to be reinstated in the p o li c e force. T h is w o u l d be secured if an o rd er o f
   mandamus w e r e to issue, directed to the c h ie f c o n s t a b l e n o w in office,
   requiring h im , for e x a m p l e , to restore th e re sp o n d en t to the office ol
   probationer c o n s t a b l e as held by h im on N o v e m b e r S, 3978.
        An altern ative to an order o f m a n d a m u s w o u ld be a dccia ra tio n affirm-
 - ingthat. hv reason o f such u nla w fully in d u ccd resignation, thc resp onden t
   thereby b e c a m e enti tl ed to the s a m e right'-* and rem ed ies, not in clu d in g
    reinstatement, as he w o u l d have had if the ap p ell a n t had u n la w fu lly d is­

   would leave h im free to pursu e such re m edies, short of reinstatem en t, as
    may be o p e n lo him . I h a v e in m ind that u nder R .S .C ., Or d. 53. r. 7 an

Introduction
1.   On 15th April 1989 the worst disaster in British football
history occurred inside the Hillsborough Stadium at Sheffield
where Liverpool were playing Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup
semi-final. 95 people died and over 400 were injured as a
result of gross overcrowding and crushing in the two pens
immediately behind the goal at the western (Leppings Lane) end

of the ground.
      We are instructed to advise whether there exists
sufficient evidence to justify bringing criminal proceedings
against any of the organisations or individuals concerned.


2.   We have been provided with the Interim Report of the
Inquiry headed by Lord Justice Taylor published in August 1989
("the Taylor Report") and the report to the Director of Public
Prosecutions of the criminal investigation carried out by the
West Midlands Police ("the West Midlands Report").


3.    Our views were sought at an early stage on the scope of
the investigation and the format of the report, and the
material which has been placed before us is very extensive. In
addition to the reports mentioned, we have been provided with
the bulk of the documentation placed before Lord Justice
Taylor's Inquiry, the full transcript of the evidence given at
the Inquiry, and a large quantity of visual evidence in the

form of photographs and video film.
      We have also visited Hillsborough stadium and have had
the opportunity of seeing for ourselves the physical
characteristics of the ground which played such an important

part in the disaster.


4.    Throughout our consideration of this case we have kept
constantly in mind the appalling scale of the tragedy for the
bereaved and those injured, some of whom suffered devastating
psychological injuries from which they are unlikely to
recover. We have borne in mind, too, the strong feelings of
anger and bitterness which the disaster has provoked within
the Liverpool community and elsewhere, and the important role
in the pursuit of justice which criminal proceedings are

perceived to have by those aggrieved.


5.    In the light of the prominent part played by the South
Yorkshire Police in the disaster, we have reminded ourselves
in particular that police officers are in no different
category to others in a criminal investigation. We should say
that we are fully satisfied that that has been the approach of
the West Midlands Police, who have conducted a meticulous
investigation in which no stone has been left unturned.


 6.   Given the serious nature of the criminal liability under
 consideration, however, it is essential that the available
 material should be examined in an entirely dispassionate

 manner. This we have tried to do.



                                  2
The facts
7.   A notable feature of the disaster is the absence of
conflict of fact as to what happened at Hillsborough. This
consistency of evidence was remarked on by the Taylor Inquiry
(see the Taylor Report para 113). Further, the criminal
investigation, for all its thoroughness, has not significantly
added to or contradicted Lord Justice Taylor's findings. In
our judgment, therefore, the Taylor analysis of the facts is
as firm a base as any from which to approach the question of
criminal liability and where necessary we shall make reference

in this Opinion to the Report and its Appendices.


Summary
8.   At 2.52 pm on 15th April 1989 one of the exit gates at the

Leppings Lane end of the Hillsborough Stadium was opened on
the instruction of Chief Superintendent Duckenfield, the
Commander responsible for policing the match. The purpose was
to relieve unprecedented overcrowding and crushing at the
turnstiles caused by a build up of supporters arriving after
2.30 pm for the semi-final due to kick off at 3 pm. In the
ensuing 5 minutes, some 2,000 supporters passed through the
gate and entered the tunnel under the West stand giving access
 to the central pens of the terrace. Those pens were already
 overfull because of the physical layout of the terrace and the
 uncontrolled way in which supporters were allowed to enter
 them. Gross overcrowding and crushing occurred. Moreover, the
 intense pressure exerted by the additional influx caused the
 collapse of a crush barrier situated near the front of pen 3.


                                 3
Supporters were hurled down into the front of the pen and
crushed up against the low wall and the perimeter wire fence
above it. Many died from suffocation and crushing injuries;
some were trampled on. The crushing was not immediately
recognised, partly because those trampled upon were not
visible behind the wall, partly because police operational
orders prohibited officers on the perimeter track from opening
the perimeter gates without permission from a senior officer,
and partly because the crushing and distress was not expected.
The response of the police was therefore slow. Even when the
nature and extent of the emergency was appreciated and the
perimeter gates were opened, the small number of gates and the
height of the fence itself made rescue and evacuation a

hopelessly difficult task.
     The build up outside the ground which led to the opening
of the exit gate was due to the layout, numbers, designation
and marking of the turnstile entrances at the Leppings Lane
end, and to a loss of police control of the crowd as
supporters became desperate to get in before the kick-off.


9.   It will be clear from the above summary that the disaster
had three separate causative elements which need to be
examined: the layout of the ground; the opening of the exit
gate; and the build up outside the ground.




                               4
The layout of the ground
10.   Sheffield Wednesday Football Club ("the Club") was formed
in 1867 and moved to the Hillsborough ground in 1899. In the
90 years that elapsed before the disaster it was successfully
used for numerous sporting events, including FA Cup semi­
finals, international matches and 3 World Cup matches. Very
large crowds were accommodated, the record being over 72,000
in 1934. Significant changes were made to the layout of the
ground over the years and these need to be understood.


11.   The present South stand was built in 1913, the Spion Kop
(at the Eastern end) was added in 1914, and the West stand was
built in 1965. Before then the Leppings Lane end was entirely
terraced. Until fairly recently, not only were there no
perimeter fences between the terraces and the pitch, there
were relatively few crush barriers on the terraces themselves.
The plan at Appendix 4 to the Taylor Report shows the
arrangement of the barriers at the Leppings Lane end.


12.   Before 1979 there were continuous barriers along the
front, with two intermittent rows of barriers behind (coloured
black on the plan). There were no "radial" barriers, that is
fences running at right angles to the crush barriers from back
to front of the terrace so as to form pens. The perimeter
fences were installed in 1977 as a response to the hooliganism
and pitch invasions of the 1970s.




                                5
•
    13.   In 1978 Dr Eastwood, a highly experienced civil and
    structural engineer and a principal of the firm of Eastwood
    and Partners who had been advising the Club on minor matters
    since the 1950s, was formally retained to act on the Club's
    behalf in its dealings with the local authority, then the
    South Yorkshire County Council, but which later became the
    Sheffield City Council ("the Council"). The Safety of Sports
    Ground Act 1975 had recently been passed and it was necessary
    for the Club to take expert advice if it was to receive a
    Safety Certificate under the Act from the Council. Dr Eastwood
    advised that further barriers should be installed in order to
    comply with the Home Office "Green Guide" then in force and
    the additional barriers shown and marked blue on the plan at
    Appendix 4 were installed in 1979.


    14.   The Council set up an Officer Working Party consisting of
    representatives of the police, the fire services, and the
    Council's building surveyors' division and legal and
    administration department and, as a result of inspections and
    consultations with the Club and Dr Eastwood, a Safety
    Certificate was issued for the ground in 1979.


    15.   In 1981, on the occasion of the semi-final between
    Tottenham Hotspur and Wolverhampton Wanderers, a serious
    crushing incident at the Leppings Lane end led to further
    changes to the layout of the terrace. Late arrivals who surged
    forward when a goal was scored at the Kop end caused the
    crushing of several supporters at the front of the terrace.


                                    6
•
    There were injuries but no deaths. This incident, the further
    significance of which will be returned to, prompted the police
    to suggest that it had been caused by the sideways movement,
    of supporters to positions behind the goal, and that the
    installation of radial fences would prevent such movement as
    well as providing segregation of supporters of opposing teams
    who could thus be accommodated on the same terrace.


    16.   The police view was accepted by the Club and the Officer
    Working Party, and the two radial fences shown pale green in
    Appendix 4 were installed in 1981. The terrace was thereby
    divided into three pens, with neither forward nor sideways
    movement by supporters being possible once a pen became full.
    The fences had gates at the top end to be locked once the pens

    had filled up.


    17.   Further changes to the layout in 1985 and 1986 resulted
    in the addition of two more radial fences, the consequential
    removal of some posts and rails, and the removal of a barrier
    at the top of the terrace near the entrance tunnel, Barrier
    144. The result of the addition of the central radial fence
    was to divide the pen immediately behind the goal into the two
    pens 3 and 4. These were to be the scene of the disaster in
    April 1989.


    18.   All these changes were discussed between the police, the
    Club and Dr Eastwood, and the Officer Working Party approved
    the removal of Barrier 144 in August 1986, by which time Mr


                                    7
Bownes had become the Licensing Officer responsible for the
Safety Certificate on behalf of the Council.


19.   Alterations to the turnstiles and concourse of the
Leppings Lane entrance were also made at this time in the
interests of segregation. To this end Dr Eastwood had
suggested a plan for separate access to the North stand, to
each end of the West stand, and to each of the three central
pens by means of separate banks of turnstiles. This plan was
not adopted for financial reasons, but it seems that separate
entrances would have enabled the numbers of supporters
entering each of the pens to be monitored by mechanical or
computerised counting at the turnstiles. As it was, there was
no numerical monitoring or other means of limiting the numbers
of supporters entering the penned areas, including the popular
pens 3 and 4 immediately behind the goal.


20.   The effect was that these areas were likely to attract
more than their proper share of the 10,100 supporters allowed
into the Leppings Lane end under the Safety Certificate and
there was no physical way of preventing this. All had to be
left to visual monitoring by the police and the Club stewards
as the supporters took their places inside the ground.


21.   The police had requested the removal of Barrier 144 in
pen 3 for two reasons: first, to assist the flow of supporters
into the pens and, secondly, to assist evacuation through the
tunnel in an emergency. Unhappily, as later events showed, the


                                8
•
    first purpose was all too successfully achieved. A further
    consequence, however, unappreciated at the time, was to
    increase the capacity of pen 3.


    22.   The Safety Certificate should have been amended to take
    account of these changes, which the Club notified to the
    Council in accordance with its statutory obligations. Equally
    importantly, it should have contained maximum figures for

    individual pens.


    23.   The Certificate was not amended and maximum figures were
    not inserted partly because Mr Bownes, as Chief Licensing
    Officer responsible for 32 other licensing systems, was
    overworked, and partly because Dr Eastwood thought that the
    maximum stated capacity for the Leppings Lane end need not be
    altered providing the police could ensure even distribution of
    the supporters throughout the terrace by leaving the radial
    gates open. The Taylor Report found that the insertion of
    proper maximum figures into the Safety Certificate might have
    prompted the Club and the police to find some way of limiting
    the numbers entering pens 3 and 4. One way would have been the
    adoption of Dr Eastwood's plan for separate turnstile
    entrances mentioned above.


    24.   The Taylor Report concluded that the fact that the Safety
    Certificate was not amended and individual pen capacities not
    reviewed could not be laid solely at Dr Eastwood's door. The
    Council was ultimately responsible for the Certificate.


                                      9
                .)




25.   Entry to pens 3 and 4 was via the tunnel running from
the concourse area behind turnstiles A-G, underneath the West
stand and out into the terrace (see Appendices 1 and 3 to the
Taylor Report). The effect of the changes to the layout of the
Leppings Lane terrace, all of which were purportedly licensed
under the Safety Certificate, was that the only means of
controlling the numbers entering those pens was by cordoning

off the tunnel access.


26.   Moreover, it was the policy of the police at semi-finals
(but not at League matches) to allow free movement of
supporters between pens prior to the kick off, when the radial
gates would be closed and locked. Unless steps were taken to
control the numbers entering the tunnel access, therefore,
pens 3 and 4 were liable to become grossly overcrowded at all
times. The police had accepted de facto responsibility for
monitoring the pens and their policy of "letting the fans find
their own level", was severely criticised in the Taylor Report

(see paras 172 to 183).


The opening of the exit gate
27.   As already stated, the exit gate (Gate C) was opened at
2.52 pm on the day of the disaster following an instruction
from Mr Duckenfield. Gate C is situated almost immediately
opposite the tunnel (see Appendix 1 to the Taylor Report) and
no steps had been taken to cordon off the tunnel or to divert
the influx away to the sides of the West stand. The result was


                               10
that the supporters effectively had nowhere to go but the

already overcrowded pens 3 and 4.


28.   As the supporters entered the tunnel some were swept off
their feet, accelerated by a 1 in 6 downward gradient in the
tunnel itself. A huge crush built up in pens 3 and 4 and some
supporters tried to escape on to the pitch. Others climbed
over the radial fences to the side pens where, ironically,
there was still plenty of room. Later some began to be hauled
up out of the pens to safety in the West stand.


29.    The match kicked off just before 3 pm. The evidence
before the Taylor Inquiry satisfied that tribunal that it was
the near goal for Liverpool at 3.04 pm that caused a powerful
surge forward in pen 3, the force of which caused a crush
barrier at the front of the pen, barrier 124A, to collapse.
This in turn hurled supporters down against the wall and to
their deaths, putting yet more pressure on those already
suffocating at the perimeter wire at the front. The collapse
of this barrier appears to have been a major factor in the
deaths, since there were far fewer deaths in pen 4 where no
barrier collapsed.


30.   The Taylor Report found that a further contributory cause
of the collapse of barrier 124A was the removal of barrier 144
in 1986 already referred to. The absence of the latter
barrier, in the exceptional conditions prevailing, meant that
the supporters met no retarding structure as they emerged from


                               11
•
    the tunnel into pen 3, and that there was unbroken diagonal
    pressure from the mouth of the tunnel down to barrier 124A.
    Further, as the plan at Appendix 4 to the Taylor Report shows,
    barrier 124A was vulnerable to downward pressure as a result
    of the removal of the barrier immediately above it - one of
    the alterations consequential to the installation of the two
    additional radial fences. The Taylor Report's conclusions are
    supported on this point by the evidence of Inspector Bullas
    (see para 234) and by a concession made by Dr Eastwood.


    31.   The Taylor Report's findings on the timing of the
    collapse of barrier 124A and its probable cause and effects
    are supported by the BBC video tape and the evidence of the
    supporters near to the barrier itself. They are reinforced by
    the probability that, had the barrier collapsed earlier, the
    police on the track would have appreciated that this
    catastrophe had occurred and would have taken rescue action
    much earlier.


    32.   We have viewed the evidence and we are impressed by it.
    With respect, we share the opinion of the Taylor Report that
    this is what occurred. The collapse of barrier 124A was, of
    course, a major factor in the causation of the deaths.


    33.   The Taylor Report also found, on the basis of expert
    evidence which is before us, that barrier 124A, although
    corroded, had been tested by Dr Eastwood in July 1988 and had
    passed the loading tests specified in the Green Guide.


                                   12
Although the corrosion played a part in the collapse, the
effective cause, the Report found, was the excessive and
unanticipated pressure to which it was exposed at the time of
the forward surge mentioned above. The Green Guide made no
specific reference to testing for corrosion as a cause of
deterioration.


34.   The crushing in pens 3 and 4 was not recognised either by
the police officers in the control box in the South West
corner of the ground (see Appendix 1), or by the officers
detailed to the perimeter track, for several minutes after the
first signs of distress appeared, resulting in time being lost
before rescue efforts began. It is plain also, from our
reading of the statements, that the crushing and distress was
not recognised by nearby civilians, by many (but not all) of
the broadcasters and press, nor by stewards of the Club.
Having seen the video evidence, we can readily understand how
this situation arose. The truth is that no-one was expecting
to happen what in fact happened.


35.   There was no effective leadership until the arrival of
Chief Superintendent Nesbit just after 3pm and it was not
until 3.06pm that Mr Duckenfield appreciated that there had
been a major disaster rather than the pitch invasion that he
had assumed. The ambulance service was called at 3.06pm but no
request for cutting gear or the fire brigade was made until
3.13pm. The Taylor Report concluded, however, that it is



                               13
unlikely (although possible) that these services could have
saved lives had they been called promptly. We agree.


36.   The evacuation of the supporters and those injured was
achieved mainly through the perimeter gates. These were not
designed as exits and those to pens 3 and 4 were narrower than
provided by the Green guide. The Taylor report concluded,
however, that even if their width had complied with the Green
Guide, the gates would have been wholly inadequate to relieve
the pressure and release spectators swiftly. The Guide was
silent as to any recommended number of such gates and it is
clear that their use for large scale evacuation was not
intended or anticipated.


37.   The opening of gate C, which precipitated the disaster,
was made necessary by the massive build up of supporters at
the Leppings Lane turnstiles between 2.30 and 2.50 pm. The
perimeter gates to the ground (see Appendix 1) were open from
the outset, and severe congestion and crushing developed at
the turnstiles, the number and capacity of which were
inadequate to cope in time with the large numbers. The
crushing worsened as kick-off time approached and supporters
realised they would be late into the ground. The police lost
control of the crowd and the crush became unmanageable and
dangerous, with many fearing for their lives. The kick-off was
not postponed because it had been agreed withy the Club that
this course would only be taken if there was a major cause of
delay such as an accident on the motorway or fog. Mr


                               14
Duckenfield gave inconsistent evidence to the Inquiry about
his decision on this point and the Report concluded that the
kick-off could and should have been postponed.


38.   The request to open gate C was made by Superintendent
Marshall, the Commander in Leppings Lane, who told Mr
Duckenfield by radio that someone would be killed if the gate
was not opened. There is a very considerable body of evidence
to show that Mr Marshall's view was correct and that Mr
Duckenfield had no alternative but to agree to the opening of

the gate.


39.   However, neither Mr Duckenfield nor any other police
officer took any steps to deal with the consequences of the
opening of the gate. In particular, the tunnel was not closed
off. This action, which had been taken in 1988 by serial
police officers apparently on their own initiative, could and
should have been carried out by a small number of police
forming a cordon and directing supporters to the unfilled wing
pens. Mr Duckenfield did order police serials to go to the
concourse to monitor an influx when another gate, gate A, was
opened a little earlier, because he feared a pitch invasion
from the North stand where there was no perimeter fence.


40.   The Taylor Report concluded that Mr Duckenfield's failure
to give a similar order on the opening of gate C was "a
blunder of the first magnitude". Plainly, this error was the
immediate, or proximate, cause of the crushing in pens 3 and 4


                               15
and the pressure which led to the collapse of the barrier in

pen 3.


41.   But it was not of course the sole cause. In addition to
the layout characteristics of the terrace described earlier,
the other main cause was the build up outside the ground which
led to the need to open the gate. This itself was due to a
combination of factors to which reference must now be made.


The build up outside the ground
42.   The first factor contributing to the build up outside the
ground was the layout of the Leppings Lane turnstiles and the
narrowness of the neck or forecourt at the bend in the Lane
itself where, coming from the North, it turns to the South-
West and crosses the river (see Appendix 1). Not only were the
turnstiles not in a straight line, affording adequate space
for the formation of orderly queues, therefore, but the
waiting area itself was extremely confined. Next, there was
the designation and marking of the turnstiles, with the 10,100
ticket-holders for the West terrace all being required to
enter through turnstiles A-G at entrance "B", although the
three blocks of turnstiles serving the Leppings Lane entrance
were confusingly lettered "A,C,B". In addition, the colour
coding on the turnstile walls was too low to be seen through a
crowd. The Taylor Report found these to be factors
contributing to the delay in the turnstile operation.
43.   However, the turnstile operation itself was slow because
there were only seven turnstiles to admit the 10,100 ticket-
holders, an average of 1450 through each. This is to be
compared with the 60 turnstiles at the Penistone Road end
which served 29,800, a little under 500 per stile. The Green
Guide provided that in general no more than 750 could be
admitted in one hour. The Club, taking into account that it
was an all-ticket match with no cash passing, reckoned this
could be increased to 1000 per hour. However, as Lord Justice
Taylor observed, even at this higher rate it would have taken
almost 1h hours to admit all those with terrace tickets; at
750 per hour it would have taken 2 hours. The Taylor Report
concluded that the police and the Club should have foreseen
that the turnstiles and the waiting area would be under strain
to admit all the Liverpool supporters in time.


44.   Many supporters arrived after 2.30 pm, the request on the
ticket being simply "to take up position 15 minutes before
kick off". Some arrived without tickets and tried to get in by
paying cash, others by trying to go over or under the paddle
of the turnstile or by sliding through with a ticket-holder.
All these activities slowed the admission rate and contributed
to the frustration of the crowd as kick-off approached.


45.    There is no question on the evidence that many of the
supporters had been drinking and some were abusive as a
result. Probably few offered violence and the Taylor Report
acquitted the majority of being affected by drink, finding


                                17
that some police had overestimated this factor in their
evidence. Having read the relevant statements, it seems to us
that drink and unruliness of the supporters certainly
contributed to the pushing from the back and was a factor in
making supporters less amenable to police requests to move
back. In some cases, too, drunk supporters tried to force
themselves in at the turnstiles, causing fighting with other
supporters and scuffles with the police trying to prevent
their entry. This minority contributed to the loss of control
of the crowd by police in our view.


46.   Nevertheless, the main factor in this loss of control was
a failure of police strategy in not planning properly for the
crush likely to be caused by a large concentration of arrivals
from 2.30 pm onwards, and in failing to stem the flow of
supporters or filter them towards the turnstiles from some
position outside the perimeter gates. Such action had been
successfully carried out in 1988, as numerous witnesses have
confirmed. The Taylor Report concluded that a combination of
controlled filtering and a postponed kick-off would probably
haver obviated the need to open the gate.


Apportionment of responsibility
47.   The layout of the ground as it stood on the day of the
disaster was the responsibility of four organisations, and
some of the individuals acting on their behalf, namely the
Club, Eastwood and Partners, the Council and the police.
However, none of them foresaw that the progressive alterations


                               18
made to the ground from about 1977 onwards in the interests of
safety and good order would come to constitute, in effect, a
death trap for supporters entering pens 3 and 4. This was
principally because no-one foresaw that up to 2000 supporters
would be allowed to enter these pens at a time when they were
already overcrowded, and when spreading out to the side to
absorb the extra numbers would be impossible. Plainly, no-one
foresaw any circumstances akin to the opening of gate C, nor
the unprecedented crushing outside the ground which made that
action necessary on the day of the disaster. That said, all
four organisations share some responsibility for the lack of
safe maximum capacities, the lack of controlled entry to the
pens and the absence of any proper system of monitoring, as
they must for the departures from the Green Guide and the
inadequacy of the Safety Certificate. The police must take the
main responsibility for the policy of letting the fans find
their own level although, as the lengthy exploration of the
borders of their duties at the Inquiry demonstrates, the Club
must share some responsibility for the way in which supporters
were allowed to fill the pens at semi-final matches.


48.   It may be argued that the 1981 crushing incident already
mentioned ought to have alerted the police and the Club to the
dangers of admitting large numbers of supporters via the
tunnel access to the West terrace, where they were capable of
being crushed against the perimeter fence, and that knowledge
of this incident increased the responsibility on the police
and the Club for affording safe access to the West terrace. We


                               19
•
    consider that this is not so, because the response of the
    police in 1981, accepted by the other parties involved, was to
    instal the radial fences with the aim of preventing the
    inwards movement of supporters to the area behind the goal,
    and until the disaster it was assumed that this was a correct
    response. Whether it was correct or not, the incident in our
    view has no direct bearing on the disaster eight years later
    and does not add to the potential criminal responsibility of
    the police and the Club.


    49.   The opening of gate C was the responsibility of Mr
    Duckenfield and, as already noted, his decision was correct in
    the circumstances. However, the failure to give any order to
    accommodate the influx was a serious error which must in our
    view be Mr Duckenfield's responsibility and his alone. Mr
    Duckenfield had been promoted to Chief Superintendent of F
    Division only three weeks before the match, and it is
    reasonable to ask whether he was competent to take charge of a
    match of this importance. However, there is no evidence to
    suggest that those responsible for his promotion so erred in
    appointing him as to share responsibility for errors made by
    him on the day.


    50.   The fact that the tunnel was cordoned off in 1988 by a
    handful of junior police officers apparently on their own
    initiative — an action that almost certainly would have
    averted the disaster a year later - is one of the most
    unfortunate aspects of the case, and at first sight the


                                   20
operational organisation of the police might seem responsible
for failing to incorporate this tactic in its match planning.
However, Mr Duckenfield's dispatch of a serial to deal with
the opening of gate A demonstrates to our mind that it was
within his power to accommodate the opening of gate C, and the
blame for his not doing so cannot in our view be laid
elsewhere.


51. The build up outside the ground was again the
responsibility of the four organisations identified above.
Given the restrictions of space attendant on the geography of
Leppings Lane itself, the layout of the turnstiles and their
numbers, designation and marking was primarily a matter for
the police and the Club. But the Council was also partly
responsible for ensuring that there was safe ingress to the
ground (see Chapter 5 of the Green Guide).


52.   Allowing for the policing difficulties to which the
layout and slow admission rate of the turnstiles gave rise,
the loss of police control, and in particular the failure to
follow the filtering tactics employed in 1988, was solely a
police responsibility. The responsibility was, however, a
collective one and cannot be attributed to any individual
officer.


Criminal Offences




                               21
53.   We turn to consider whether any criminal offence is
disclosed against any of the organisations or individuals
identified or referred to above.


(1) Manslaughter
54. The police authority, the Club and the Council are in law
all corporations of one kind or another (see Halsbury's Laws
of England, 4th ed, Vol 9 at paras 1201-3) so an important
first question is whether a corporation can be indicted for
manslaughter.


55.   This question was considered at length by Professor J.C.
Smith in relation to the shipping company's liability for the
sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise in an Opinion dated
25th November 1987. We have had the advantage of seeing that
Opinion, which concluded that the company in that case could
be properly indicted for manslaughter by gross negligence or
recklessness, assuming it could be proved that one or more of
the directing minds of the company caused the deaths, and did
so with the fault required by the definition of manslaughter.
In due course proceedings were begun against the company and
others and on 5th June 1990 Turner J, sitting at the Central
Criminal Court, dismissed a motion to quash the indictment
against the company, holding that both on the authorities and
on principle a corporation is capable of committing
manslaughter. We have seen a note of the Reserved Judgment,
which includes a full consideration of the authorities, and in
our respectful view it represents a correct view of the law.


                               22
56.   We accordingly advise that each of the corporations
mentioned above could properly be indicted for manslaughter if
it could be proved that one or more of the directing minds of
the corporation concerned committed manslaughter as that
offence is currently defined.


(2) Definition of manslaughter
57.   Involuntary manslaughter is committed when a person
causes the death of another either (1) intending to do an act
which, whether he knows it or not, is unlawful and dangerous
in that it is likely to cause direct personal injury ("an
unlawful and dangerous act"), or (2) intending to do an act
which creates an obvious and serious risk of causing personal
injury (a) not giving thought to the possibility of such risk,
or (b) having recognised that there was some risk involved,
nonetheless going on to take it ("recklessness" as defined by
Lord Diplock In R v Lawrence [1982] AC 510).


58.   To amount to manslaughter a person's conduct need not be
the only cause of the death, but it must be a substantial
cause in that it contributed significantly to the result.
Whether it did so contribute is generally a question of fact
for the jury: Paaett (1983) 76 Cr App Rep 279, 287-91.


59.   It may also be that manslaughter is committed if the
person causing the death intends to do an act, or omits to do
an act where there is a duty to do so, being grossly negligent


                                 23
whether death or serious personal injury results ("gross
negligence"): see eg Smith and Hogan, Criminal Law, 6th ed
(1988) at p 345. The law is at present uncertain whether gross
negligence still exists as a separate head of liability, two
recent authorities having held that the earlier cases where
manslaughter is defined in terms of negligence should not be
followed and that Lord Diplock's test should be applied
universally.


60.   In Sevmour (1983) 76 Cr App Rep 211, Watkins LJ, giving
the judgment of the Court of Appeal in a reckless driving
case, said:
      "...we are of the view that it is no longer necessary or
      helpful to make reference to compensation and negligence.
      The Lawrence direction on recklessness is comprehensive
      and of general application to all offences, including
      manslaughter involving the driving of motor vehicles
      recklessly and should be given to juries without in any
      way being diluted. Whether a driver at the material time
      was conscious of the risk he was running or gave no
      thought to its existence, is a matter which affects
      punishment for which purposes the judge will have to
      decide, if he can, giving the benefit of doubt to the
      convicted person, in which state of mind that person had
      driven at the material time."
61.   In Kong Cheuk Kwan v R (1985) 82 Cr App Rep 18 Lord
Roskill, giving the opinion of the Privy council, said at p
25:
      "Their Lordships are of the view that the present state
      of the relevant law in England and Wales... is clear. The
      model direction suggested in Lawrence and held in Seymour
      equally applicable to cases of motor manslaughter
      requires, first, that the vehicle was in fact being
      driven in such a manner as to create an obvious and
      serious risk of causing physical injury to another and
      secondly that the defendant so drove either without
      having given any thought to the possibility of there
      being such a risk or having recognised that there was
      such a risk nevertheless took it.
           In principle their Lordships see no reason why a
      comparable direction should not have been given in the
      present case as regards that part of the case which
      concerned the alleged navigation of the Flying Goldfinch
      by Kong and indeed as regards the alleged navigation of
      the Flying Flamingo by the other two defendants. Did
      their respective acts of navigation create an obvious and
      serious risk of causing physical damage to some other
      ship and thus to other persons who might have been
      travelling in the area of the collision at the material
      time? If so did any of the defendants... so navigate
      either without having given any thought to the
      possibility of that risk or, while recognising that the
      risk existed, take that risk?"


                               25
At p 26, Lord Roskill said:
      "Their Lordships... respectively agree with the comment
      made by Watkins LJ... in Seymour."


62.   However, as pointed out by Smith and Hogan (6th ed (1988)
at p 353), while the clear implication from Kong Cheuk Kwan is
that there is no longer any separate test of gross negligence
in manslaughter, it may be that the courts would not be
prepared to exclude it altogether in an appropriate case. Some
support for this view is found in Goodfellow (1986) 83 Cr App
Rep 23, where Lord Lane LCJ said that the question in Kong
Cheuk Kwan was whether the defendant was "guilty of
recklessness (or gross negligence)".


63.   We consider it right in the circumstances of Hillsborough
to approach the evidence on the basis that the gross
negligence test is sufficient to establish the offence of
manslaughter and we propose to advise accordingly.


(3) Neglect bv police
64.   When gross negligence or manslaughter by neglect is
alleged against the police, however, authority indicates a
more detailed test of liability. In R v West London Coroner's
Court, ex p Gray [1988] QB 467, allegations were made against,
police following the death of a man while in police custody
concerning the use of force against him and failure to summon
an ambulance promptly when he became unconscious. The
coroner's directions to the jury as to unlawful killing were


                               26
•
    quashed by the Divisional Court, which held that a coroner
    directing a jury on manslaughter comprising unlawful killing
    alleged to have occurred because of neglect by police was
    required to direct them as follows:
          (1) that they had to be satisfied of four ingredients,
          namely (a) that the police were under a duty to have
          regard to the health and welfare of the deceased, (b)
          that in the circumstances there was a failure to do what
          should have been done for the health and welfare of the
          deceased, (c) that the failure amounted to a substantial
          cause of death, and (d) that the failure amounted to
          recklessness;
          (2) that the test of "recklessness" was whether a police
          officer, having regard to his duty, was indifferent to an
          obvious and serious risk to the health and welfare of the
          deceased or, recognising that risk to be present,
          deliberately chose to run it by doing nothing about it;
          (3) that a failure to appreciate that there was such a
          risk was not by itself sufficient to amount to
          recklessness; and
          (4) that the jury could only return a verdict of unlawful
          killing if they could attribute the unlawful conduct to a
          single police officer.


    65.   Plainly those directions are those to be given in any
    criminal prosecution of a police officer where omission to act
    is alleged to have caused death. In our view they have a



                                   27
direct bearing on our consideration of the evidence in this
case.


(4) Culpable misfeasance
66.     We turn next to consider the common law offence of
culpable misfeasance or misconduct in public office. We are
satisfied that this offence exists, and that it is committed
where a public officer, such as a police officer, wilfully
neglects to perform a duty which he is bound to perform by
common law or statute. But the neglect has to be wilful, not
merely inadvertent, and must be culpable in the sense that it
is without reasonable excuse or justification. The element of
culpability is not restricted to corruption or dishonesty,
however, but must be of such a degree that the misconduct is
calculated to injure the public interest: R v Dvtham [1979] 2
QB 722.


67.     Even if the words "likely to" are substituted for
"calculated" in this definition, as we think they might be, it
is clear that this little known offence is a difficult one to
prove to the satisfaction of a jury.


Evidence to support manslaughter
68.     We consider in turn the possible liability of (i) the
Club, (ii) Eastwood and Partners, (iii) the Council and (iv)
the police. It will be convenient to consider the evidence
first against the four organisations, and secondly in relation



                                 28
to the individuals who acted on behalf of the organisations

concerned.


(i) The Club
69.   The Club's responsibility for the crushing and deaths
lies in its responsibility for (1) the layout of the inside of
the ground as a result of the alterations to the West terrace
and (2) the layout, number, designation and marking of the
turnstiles in Leppings Lane. Whilst, on our factual analysis
of the disaster, these two factors might be regarded as
substantial causes of the deaths in that they contributed
significantly to the result, it is clear not only that they
were not the sole causes, or even the major causes, but that
the Club's actions and omissions only partly contributed to
them. As already observed (see para 47 above), the layout of
the ground was the responsibility of the four organisations
and in varying degrees. The Club not only relied on its own
consultant engineer Dr Eastwood, but it responded to the
suggestions and advice of the police in important respects.
The Council played its part.


70.   For the purposes of the criminal law, where it is
axiomatic that a case against each defendant must be given
totally separate consideration, we consider that there is no
sufficient evidence to support a prima facie case that the
Club caused the deaths.




                               29
71.   In case we are wrong in that conclusion, we have
considered whether the requisite intention for manslaughter
could be proved against the Club. It seems to us, however,
that the evidence does not begin to show either recklessness
or gross negligence on its part.


72.   It follows that there is in our view no sufficient
evidence to support a charge of manslaughter against either
the Club or any of its officials.


(ii) Eastwood and Partners
73.   Since Dr Eastwood was the principal of the firm, it is
his actions and omissions alone that fall to be considered. As
consultant to the Club he too was responsible for the layout
of the inside of the ground and the layout and operation of
the turnstiles. However, his advice formed part only of the
sequence of events that led to the structural condition of the
ground as it was immediately before the disaster and by no
rational yardstick could his advice be said to have caused the
deaths. There are two further factors in his case, moreover.
First, his advice in relation to the forming of separate
turnstile entrances to the North stand, each end of the West
stand and each of the central plans, not acted on for
financial reasons, would if adopted have led to numerical
monitoring of the central pens, and might well have led to the
insertion of maximum figures for those pens in compliance with
the Safety Certificate. Second, so far as the Safety



                               30
Certificate is concerned, this was the ultimate responsibility
of the Council.


74.   There is no evidence that Dr Eastwood caused the deaths.
Nor is there any evidence that he was either reckless or
grossly negligent. We have no hesitation, therefore, in
concluding that there is no evidence to support a charge of
manslaughter against Dr Eastwood or indeed against Eastwood
and Partners.


(iii) The Council
75.   The Council bears responsibility for the Safety
Certificate, which should have been amended to provide for the
alterations and for the insertion of maximum figures for the
pens. The Council was also responsible for ensuring compliance
with the Green Guide in the respects detailed above, as well
as in some other respects. There were departures from the
Green Guide, some more important then others. Of course, it
does not follow that the disaster would not have happened even
if the Safety Certificate had been amended, since compliance
depended on the Club and Dr Eastwood. In common with the Club
and Dr Eastwood, however, the Council's errors only partly
contributed to the ground conditions identified above as
causes of the deaths and on any view were too remote to amount
to a prima facie case of manslaughter. There is no evidence of
recklessness or gross negligence on their part.




                               31
76.   There is accordingly no evidence to support a charge of
manslaughter against Mr Bownes.


77.    It is unnecessary to consider the liability of the
Sheffield District Council for the errors of its predecessor,
the South Yorkshire County Council, though we would assume
such liability to have been inherited on the reorganisation.


(iv) The police
78.   The main responsibility for the disaster at Hillsborough
rests on the police in the respects identified above and
clearly set out in the Taylor Report. As an organisation they
were partly responsible for the layout of the inside of the
ground. They were responsible for the policy, heavily
criticised in the Taylor Report, whereby supporters were left
"to find their own level" and not monitored as they entered
the pens in semi-final matches. They were also partly
responsible for the Leppings Lane turnstiles and, together
with the Club, should have foreseen the difficulties of
admission of such large numbers. There was a serious failure
of policing in Leppings Lane, due in part to a failure to
follow filtering tactics used effectively in 1988.


79.   These errors too, however, can only be viewed as part of
a complex sequence of events, many of which were outside the
control of the police. The layout of the ground, both inside
and out, was the main responsibility of the Club as advised by
Dr Eastwood, with the Council and the Officer Working Party


                               32
superintending the alterations to the West terrace. Likewise,
the contents of the Safety Certificate were not the main
responsibility of the police. The difficulties inherent in the
policing of Leppings Lane, which were partly geographical, and
the arrival of supporters in very large numbers after 2.30 pm
were not and could not be under police control. Finally, the
unruly behaviour of a minority of them, although no doubt
foreseeable, created added difficulties.


80.   Once responsibility for the failure to postpone the kick-
off and to cordon off the access tunnel is confined to Mr
Duckenfield, as we consider it should be (see para 48 above),
the conclusion becomes inescapable in our view that the police
as an organisation cannot be said to have caused the deaths by
their strategy and operational errors.


81.   We have examined the structure of the police command,
both on the day of the disaster itself and in previous years.
We have considered the operational orders for 1988 and 1989
and police practice at Hillsborough, inside and outside the
ground, as detailed in the Taylor Report. We have also
considered the interviews of Mr Marshall and Mr Murray.
However, there seems to us to be no evidence that in making
what were undoubtedly errors of judgment and practice, the
police organisation, or any individual within it, acted
recklessly or in a grossly negligent manner either on the day
of the disaster or beforehand.
•
    82.   We accordingly find no basis on which to advise a charge
    of corporate manslaughter against any directing mind within
    the police organisation.


    Chief Superintendent Duckenfield
    83.   Mr Duckenfield was heavily criticised in the Taylor
    Report for failing to cordon off the access tunnel, and his
    decision not to postpone the kick-off was regarded as a bad
    error of judgment. We think both of these criticisms are
    entirely justified. Moreover, as the operational commander of
    the match, he was ultimately responsible for the policing both
    within and outside the ground. He was personally slow to
    recognise the crushing or signs of distress in the central
    pens which were going on before his eyes. He failed to notice
    the gross imbalance of filling between those pens and the
    outer wings which the video shows so clearly. His
    preoccupation with the possibility of a pitch invasion caused
    him to delay putting the Major Disaster Plan into operation.


    84.   Yet Mr Duckenfield had under his command officers with
    considerable experience of policing the match and the ground
    who also made operational errors or failed to react as they
    should have done. It is unnecessary to set out here the chain
    of police command; suffice it to say that in the senior
    positions were officers who had successfully policed
    Hillsborough in previous years, particularly in 1988, when the
    operation was regarded as successful. Under them were other
    experienced inspectors and sector commanders. If the


                                   34
•
    operational orders or police intelligence was inadequate, as
    seems likely, it was not the fault of Mr Duckenfield who
    inherited a ready made match plan compiled by others and tried
    to follow it. The slowness of his response to the disaster,
    while much to be regretted, was doubtless due in part to his
    lack of experience of this particular match.


    85.   Mr Duckenfield, who declined to be interviewed for the
    purposes of the criminal investigation, would no doubt argue
    that none of these errors caused the deaths because of the
    interposition of the many other factors already rehearsed. It
    seems to us that that argument would be likely to succeed in
    relation to many of the criticisms. However, there is a case
    to be made in our view that his failure both to postpone the
    kick-off and to take no action to close the tunnel after the
    opening of gate C was a substantial cause of the deaths, in
    that it significantly contributed to the crowd pressure which
    led to the crushing and the collapse of barrier 124A.


    86.   If that is so, it is necessary to consider whether there
    is evidence that Mr Duckenfield, when failing so to act, had
    the requisite intention to support a charge of manslaughter.


    87.   Clearly there was no unlawful and dangerous act on his
    part or intended by him which would found the first head of
    liability in involuntary manslaughter. But in failing to
    postpone the kick-off, or to order the closure of the tunnel
    after the opening of gate C, or both, did he intend an act


                                   35
•
    which created an obvious and serious risk of causing personal
    injury, either not giving thought to the possibility of such
    risk, or having recognised that there was some risk involved,
    nonetheless go on to take it?


    88.   We consider that there are difficulties in proving that
    he intended to do an act which created an obvious and serious
    risk of causing personal injury. In the first place there was
    no "act" as such, but an omission or omissions to act which
    contributed to a rapidly developing state of affairs ending in
    serious risk of injury. But was it an obvious risk at the
    time? We think not. The complexity of the disaster as now
    known to those who have analysed it in hindsight demonstrates
    that there must be grave doubt as to whether the omissions
    created a risk which was obvious to anyone at the time. The
    considerations here are, of course, wholly different from the
    driving cases or the collision at sea in the Kong Cheuk Kwan
    case.


    89.   We conclude, therefore, that there is insufficient
    evidence on which to found a charge of recklessness against Mr
    Duckenfield. Nor is there evidence that he was grossly
    negligent in failing to act as mentioned above. We bear in
    mind particularly the judgment of the Divisional Court in the
    West London Coroner's Court case the requirements of which are
    not in our view satisfied.




                                    36
•
    90.   It follows, and we have come to the clear conclusion,
    that there is no evidence that Mr Duckenfield was wilfully
    neglectful of his duty or was culpable so as to have committed
    the offence of culpable misfeasance.


    91.   We conclude that there is no sufficient evidence of any
    criminal offence having been committed by Mr Duckenfield.


    Police Constables Smith and Illingworth
    92.   We note the complaints made against these two officers
    who were stationed on the perimeter track at gates 3 and 4
    respectively and we have considered the interviews of both.
    There is conflicting evidence in the case of each as to how he
    reacted and when each gate was opened (see the West Midlands
    Report Part VII at pp 252 to 259) and in the case of Smith
    there is substantial doubt as to whether he pushed spectators,
    including the complainant Hendry and an unidentified boy, back
    into the crowd and if so when, ie whether before or after he
    had appreciated the true nature of the disaster.


    93.   There is no evidence before us that either of these
    officers was guilty of manslaughter or culpable misfeasance,
    and we advise that the allegations made against them be
    investigated further and if appropriate pursued in
    disciplinary proceedings.




                                   37
94.   The balance of allegations against the other officers
mentioned in the West Midlands Report must likewise be a
matter for disciplinary proceedings.


95.   We therefore find no sufficent evidence to support
criminal proceedings of any kind against those persons
mentioned in the West Midlands Report whom we have not found
it necessary to identify in this Opinion.

       You will of course be aware that the above named case (which
       centres around the decision of the Director not to prosecute in
       the Hillsborough disaster) is listed for hearing in the
       Divisional Court on 12 November 1990. Andrew Collins has been
       instructed to represent the Director.
       Please find enclosed a set of papers for Mr Collins.      Having
       discussed this matter with him, he has kindly agreed that formal
       instructions are not required as the issues raised are very
       similar to those canvassed in the Marchioness application
       concluded yesterday.

      Dear Mrs Knapman
      I understand from our telephone conversation this morning that
      an application for leave to apply for judicial review in the
      Hillsborough case is to be heard on 12th November.
      I am fully aware that under Order 53 rule 3(2) , such applications
      are ex parte. As I indicated, however, the Director of Public
      Prosecutions is greatly concerned by this application and would
      welcome being heard through Counsel on the 12th if the Court
      considered this to be appropriate. I should be very grateful if
      you would place this matter before the Court so that we might
      receive an indication whether or not the Court would consider it
      helpful to have the putative respondent present.
      At the same time, may I take this opportunity to mention the
      Marchioness case.   You will recall that on the telephone, I
      indicated that a press report in the Sunday Telegraph for the
      21st October mentioned the fact that an application for leave to
      review the Director's decision not to prosecute for more serious
      charges was to be made on Thursday, 25th October (though I now
      understand it may be in Friday's list).    I am aware that your
      staff do not have any record of this application. If, however,
      such an application is notified to you, I should again be very
      grateful if you would let me know so that consideration can be
      given to whether the Director should seek the Court’s leave to
      appear as the putative respondent again on the application when
      it is heard.
       I am grateful for your very considerable assistance in these
       matters and indeed in the matters of LINES and BEGUM with which
       I have troubled you in recent weeks.

       Dear Sir

                                RE: THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER


      Your letter of 25 October 1990 addressed to the Director of
      Public Prosecutions has been passed to me for reply.
      First, may I thank you for enclosing a copy of the documents
      which you have lodged in the High Court to support your
      applications for judicial review.  I understand a hearing is
      fixed for 12 November 1990.

      With regard to the questions you asked, the Crown Prosecution
      Service does not maintain statistics which answers questions 1
      and 2.

      With regard to question 3, whilst I am unable to be categoric,
      to the best of our recollection, no announcement was made about
      this case until after the inquest

THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER
THE DECISION BY THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS

SYNOPSIS OF EVENTS
The Hillsborough Stadium Disaster occurred on the 15th of April
1989. On that day an FA Cup Semi Final match was being played
at the Stadium which is the home ground of Sheffield Wednesday
Football Club.   95 people died. A Public Enquiry was ordered
under the chairmanship of Lord Justice Taylor. The West Midlands
Police were asked to assist the Enquiry and the Coroners Court
hearings which were due to follow. The Chief Constable of The
West Midlands Police, Mr Geoffrey Dear was appointed as the
Coroners Officer and to assist the Enquiry.
The Public Enquiry heard evidence from numerous witness and
viewed large numbers of still photographs and video recordings
of the events which took place at the Stadium on that Saturday
afternoon.
On the 4th of August 1989 Lord Justice Taylor published his
Interim Report. On that day the Chief Constable of the South
Yorkshire Police asked the Director of Public Prosecutions to
consider the Report and its findings and whether the question or
criminal responsibility of the Police and others should be
investigated.
Having read the Report the Director made a request to the Chief
Constable of South Yorkshire for a criminal investigation to .
                                                             be
conducted.   The investigation was to consider the possible
criminal responsibility of the Police and any other persons
involved in the events which incurred on that day.
The West Midlands Police were requested to expand their
involvement beyond assisting the Public Enquiry and the Coroner,
and to conduct a criminal investigation. Mr Dear was appointed
as Investigating Officer and the investigation was supervised by
The Police Complaints Authority.

In late August 1989 Mr Gareth Williams QC and Mr Peter Birts
were retained to advise the Director.
On 30th August 1989 the first meeting took place between members
of the CPS Headquarters Office, Mr C Newell, Mr C Cleugh and
Mr M Kennedy and senior members of The West Midlands Police Team.
Copies of all the Public Enquiry statements were supplied to
Mr Kennedy at CPS Headquarters and to Counsel.




                                1
On the   10th November 1989 both Counsel and the three members of
CPS HQ   visited the Hillsborough Stadium and later that day the
centre   of operations for the criminal enquiry at Nechells Green
Police   Station, Birmingham.
During the next months as the Enquiry progressed various
statements and documents were delivered to CPS HQ by The West
Midlands Police Team. Duplicate sets of the same documents were
also delivered to the PCA and to Mr Williams and Mr Birts.
Papers were delivered on this ad hoc basis as they became
available and in manageable bundles so that the reading could
take place over a period of time rather than all the papers been
delivered once at the end of the Enquiry.
Mr Williams and Mr Birts advised in writing, on the telephone
and in conference on several occasions during the course of the
investigation.
Although several potential defendants had not been interviewed
the Report was delivered to the CPS Headquarters dated the 30th
of March 1990. All the interviews under caution were finally
completed in July 1990 and each interview once completed was
transcripted and copies of the transcript delivered to the PCA,
Counsel and CPS HQ.
Mr Williams and Mr Birts delivered a 38 page opinion to the CPS
Headquarters dated the 6th of August 1990.      The opinion w^s
considered by senior lawyers at CPS Headquarters and also by the
Director personally.   The Director agreed with the conclusion
expressed in the opinion, that there was insufficient evidence
for a realistic prospect of convicting any person or any
corporate body of any criminal offence.
The Police Complaints Authority issued Interim Statements
confirming that the Police Investigation had been conducted to
their satisfaction.   These Statements were dated the 15th ot
August 1990.
The Attorney General also saw Counsels opinion and he expressed
his agreement with the conclusion which had been reached by
Counsel and the Director.
The decision not to prosecute on the basis of insufficient
evidence was communicated to interested parties by faxed letter
on the 30th of August 1990. A Press Release was issued later
that same day.




                                  2
I should make it clear that if an Affidavit is required then
neither Mr Kennedy, Mr Cleugh, Mr Newell or indeed the Director
can say that they have read all the papers submitted or viewed
all the video evidence. The Police were instructed to send all
the material to us, however, for practical purposes it proved
impossible for all the documentation to be considered by CPS
lawyers.   It was agreed that Counsel should be asked to read
through the documentation and provide advige. Any Affidavit to
cover the question of reading the documentation would have to be
made by Counsel.

      Dear Sir
      Thank you for your letter of 18th May 1989.
      The   Crown Prosecution    Service does     not  undertake   the
      investigation of alleged criminal offences, such investigation
      is the function of the police. If and when an investigation is
      conducted, the results would be referred to us and consideration
      would then be given to the possibility of proceedings.
      Yours faithfully

   Dear Mr Edey

   May I reply to your letter of 12 June on behalf of the Chief Constable.

   As you know the tragic events which unfolded at the Hillsborough
   Football Stadium on 15 April 1989 are being considered in the most
   intimate detail by Lord Justic Taylor's Inquiry.  An independent enquiry
   team from the West Midlands Police have conducted exhaustive enquiries
   and furnished the Inquiry with all the relevant available information.

   If it had been felt at any time during the gathering of information that
   criminal offences had been committed then the appropriate investigations
   would have been commenced.  At this stage there is no evidence to
   suggest that an offence of the nature you suggest has been committed and
   accordingly no criminal charges have been brought.

   Yours sincerely
6th July 1989.

          Dear Mr Edey

          I refer to your recent correspondence to the Chief Constable of South
          Yorkshire Police, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Right
          Honourable Lord Justice Taylor.  The correspondence has been passed to
          me by Mr P Wright, Chief Constable, South Yorkshire Police.

          I am responsible, on behalf of Mr G Dear, Chief Constable of West
          Midlands Police, for the conduct of the investigation into the events at
          Hillsborough on 15 April 1989.  My responsibilities are not only to
          service the needs of Lord Justice T a y l o r ’s Judicial Inquiry, but also to
          provide the necessary facts for the Coroner's Inquests into the 95 who
          died, which at this time are scheduled to commence early next year.
          Consequently the enquiries we are undertaking are most thorough.        If,
          during the course of assembling the evidence, allegations of criminal
          offences arise then these will be dealt with via normal procedures.
          However, at this stage, there is still a lot to be done before we are in
          a position to consider the issues you raise.

          I am grateful for your letter and I have noted your concern.

          I have passed a copy of the letter to the Director of Public Prosecutions
          for his information.

          Yours sincerely

It was in fact the cause of the disaster. Had the perimeter fencing allowed
access to the pitch the pressure in pens 3 and 4 could have been relieved
and Gate C need not have been opened until a sufficient number of spectators
had gone on the pitch to enable the 2400 spectators outside the ground to
be assimilated on the terraces without death and injury resulting.

In any event Lord Justice Taylor finds in Paras 108 and 112 of his interim
report that only 21 of the dead and only 30% of those who were injured entered
through Gate C after it opened at 2.52 pm. In other words 74 of the deaths
and 511 of the injured would have been casualties regardless of the opening
of Gate C.

The reason I have felt it necessary to write to you again is because Mr. Mervyn
Jones forwarded my letter to Mr Wright of the 6 th July and because Mr Justice
Taylor's interim report gives further reasons for manslaughter charges to
be preferred against the management of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.
I am also puzzled at the approach by the police to criminality for this disaster.

When Mr Watson wrote to me on the 15th June the West Midlands Police had
gathered together all the information put to Lord Justice Taylor's inquiry.
I was told then there was no evidence to suggest the offence of manslaughter
had been committed and accordingly no criminal charges had been brought.
In his letter of the 2nd August Mr J Mervyn Jones told me that the West Midlands
Police had to provide the necessary facts for the Coroners Inquests into
the deaths. This is referred to in Paragraph 15 of Lord Justice Taylor's
report. The final sentence reads: "I am assured by Chief Constable Dear
and Assistant Chief Constable Mervyn Jones that it is most unlikely any further
evidence gathered will significantly alter or add to the history of events
which emerged at the hearing".

Yet Mr J Mervyn Jones letter to me went on:- "If during the course of assembling
the evidence (i.e. for the Coroners inquests) "allegations of criminal offences
arise then these will be dealt with via normal procedures". If Mr Justice
Taylor was told that it was unlikely that there will be any further significant
evidence forthcoming these comments are difficult to understand. It would
seem to suggest that the police had made up their mind not to lay charges
despite what was said in the letter to me.

What particularly exercises my mind in all this is that there is abundant
evidence of reckless disregard of life and limb by Sheffield Wednesday Football
Club not for the first time and in exactly parallel circumstances which clearly
establishes a prima facie case of manslaughter. The police should have acted
and not concerned themselves with the Coroner's inquests. Unless it is an
act of God violent death must be looked upon as criminal, in the first instance.
This has not been happening as evidenced by the Herald of Free Enterprise
disaster where it took an unlawful killing verdict by an inquest jury and
a further two years deliberation to decide that a ship going to sea with
its doors open constituted a criminal offence1

I agree it is important to be able to establish a case to put before judge
and jury which has a reasonable chance of success. One can be too hasty.
I believe the arrest of the captain and first mate in the recent incident
on the River Thames to be a case in point. I read that Scotland Yard sent
a report on this incident to you for determination within two weeks of the
disaster! I do not believe that tragedy was any more than a problem of navigation
which is by no means criminal. There may of course have been a look out
problem.
- 3-


On the other hand I have little doubt that the ignition of a pile of rubbish
under a wooden stand at a football ground which went up like a tinder box
with the loss of 56 lives amounts to manslaughter and that the Directors
of Bradford City Football Club were extremely fortunate in 1986 not to be
charged.
I enclose a copy of a letter I have written to Mr J Mervyn Jones for your
information.

Yours sincerely.

     Jo**           h.. £J.
     Thank you for your letter of 14th September 1990 addressed to
     the Director of Public Prosecutions about the Hillsborough
     Football Stadium disaster and the decision not to institute
     any criminal proceedings. The letter has been passed to me
     for reply.

     The possibility of criminal proceedings being instituted was
     given the most careful consideration. The same evidential
     criterion was applied in this case as is applied in all cases
     considered by the Crown Prosecution Service. This criterion,
     set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors, is whether or not
     there is a realistic prospect of a conviction based on the
     available evidence.

     The case was thoroughly investigated by the West Midlands
     Police. The investigation produced extensive evidence; and in
     addition, all the evidence and documentation received by Lord
     Justice Taylor's Public Enquiry was made available to the
     Crown Prosecution Service. The combined and individual merits
     of each of the points which you mention in your letter was the
     subject of detailed assessment. After a very full and
     thorough scrutiny of all this material, the Director concluded
     that the evidence was not sufficient for there to be a
     realistic prospect of convicting any person or corporate body
     of any criminal offence. In reaching this conclusion the
     Director had the benefit of the advice of two experienced
     Leading Counsel.



                                                                                               contd...

decision. I can assure you, however, that the decision was

                        NOTE


This Joint Opinion should be read in conjunction with the
Interim Report of Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry into the
Hillsborough Stadium Disaster Cm 765 presented to
Parliament in August 1989, and in particular with the
Appendices to the Report.
                         JOINT OPINION



Introduction
1.   On 15th April 1989 the worst disaster in British football
history occurred inside the Hillsborough Stadium at Sheffield
where Liverpool were playing Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup
semi-final. 95 people died and over 400 were injured as a
result of gross overcrowding and crushing in the two pens
immediately behind the goal at the western (Leppings Lane) end

of the ground.
      We are instructed to advise whether there exists
sufficient evidence to justify bringing criminal proceedings
against any of the organisations or individuals concerned.


2.   We have been provided with the Interim Report of the
Inquiry headed by Lord Justice Taylor published in August 1989
("the Taylor Report") and the report to the Director of Public
Prosecutions of the criminal investigation carried out by the
West Midlands Police ("the West Midlands Report").


3.    Our views were sought at an early stage on the scope of
the investigation and the format of the report, and the
material which has been placed before us is very extensive. In
addition to the reports mentioned, we have been provided with
the bulk of the documentation placed before Lord Justice
Taylor's Inquiry, the full transcript of the evidence given at
the Inquiry, and a large quantity of visual evidence in the

 form of photographs and video film.

                                 1
      We have also visited Hillsborough stadium and have had

the opportunity of seeing for ourselves the physical
characteristics of the ground which played such an important

part in the disaster.


4.    Throughout our consideration of this case we have kept
constantly in mind the appalling scale of the tragedy for the
bereaved and those injured, some of whom suffered devastating
psychological injuries from which they are unlikely to
recover. We have borne in mind, too, the strong feelings of
anger and bitterness which the disaster has provoked within
the Liverpool community and elsewhere, and the important role
in the pursuit of justice which criminal proceedings are

perceived to have by those aggrieved.


5.    In the light of the prominent part played by the South
Yorkshire Police in the disaster, we have reminded ourselves
in particular that police officers are in no different
category to others in a criminal investigation. We should say
that we are fully satisfied that that has been the approach of
the West Midlands Police, who have conducted a meticulous
investigation in which no stone has been left unturned.


 6.   Given the serious nature of the criminal liability under
 consideration, however, it is essential that the available
material should be examined in an entirely dispassionate

 manner. This we have tried to do.



                                 2
The facts
7.   A notable feature of the disaster is the absence of
conflict of fact as to what happened at Hillsborough. This
consistency of evidence was remarked on by the Taylor Inquiry
(see the Taylor Report para 113). Further, the criminal
investigation, for all its thoroughness, has not significantly
added to or contradicted Lord Justice Taylor's findings. In
our judgment, therefore, the Taylor analysis of the facts is
as firm a base as any from which to approach the question of
criminal liability and where necessary we shall make reference

in this Opinion to the Report and its Appendices.



Summary
8.   At 2.52 pm on 15th April 1989 one of the exit gates at the

Leppings Lane end of the Hillsborough Stadium was opened on
the instruction of Chief Superintendent Duckenfield, the
Commander responsible for policing the match. The purpose was
to relieve unprecedented overcrowding and crushing at the
turnstiles caused by a build up of supporters arriving after
 2.30 pm for the semi-final due to kick off at 3 pm. In the
ensuing 5 minutes, some 2,000 supporters passed through the
 gate and entered the tunnel under the West stand giving access
 to the central pens of the terrace. Those pens were already
 overfull because of the physical layout of the terrace and the
 uncontrolled way in which supporters were allowed to enter
 them. Gross overcrowding and crushing occurred. Moreover, the
 intense pressure exerted by the additional influx caused the
 collapse of a crush barrier situated near the front of pen 3.


                                 3
Supporters were hurled down into the front of the pen and
crushed up against the low wall and the perimeter wire fence
above it. Many died from suffocation and crushing injuries;
some were trampled on. The crushing was not immediately
recognised, partly because those trampled upon were not
visible behind the wall, partly because police operational
orders prohibited officers on the perimeter track from opening
the perimeter gates without permission from a senior officer,
and partly because the crushing and distress was not expected.
The response of the police was therefore slow. Even when the
nature and extent of the emergency was appreciated and the
perimeter gates were opened, the small number of gates and the
height of the fence itself made rescue and evacuation a

hopelessly difficult task.
     The build up outside the ground which led to the opening
of the exit gate was due to the layout, numbers, designation
and marking of the turnstile entrances at the Leppings Lane
end, and to a loss of police control of the crowd as
supporters became desperate to get in before the kick-off.


9.   It will be clear from the above summary that the disaster
had three separate causative elements which need to be
examined: the layout of the ground; the opening of the exit
gate; and the build up outside the ground.




                                4
The lavout of the ground
10.   Sheffield Wednesday Football Club ("the Club") was formed
in 1867 and moved to the Hillsborough ground in 1899. In the
90 years that elapsed before the disaster it was successfully
used for numerous sporting events, including FA Cup semi­
finals, international matches and 3 World Cup matches. Very
large crowds were accommodated, the record being over 72,000
in 1934. Significant changes were made to the layout of the
ground over the years and these need to be understood.


11.   The present South stand was built in 1913, the Spion Kop
(at the Eastern end) was added in 1914, and the West stand was
built in 1965. Before then the Leppings Lane end was entirely
terraced. Until fairly recently, not only were there no
perimeter fences between the terraces and the pitch, there
were relatively few crush barriers on the terraces themselves.
The plan at Appendix 4 to the Taylor Report shows the
arrangement of the barriers at the Leppings Lane end.


12.   Before 1979 there were continuous barriers along the
front, with two intermittent rows of barriers behind (coloured
black on the plan). There were no "radial" barriers, that is
fences running at right angles to the crush barriers from back
to front of the terrace so as to form pens. The perimeter
fences were installed in 1977 as a response to the hooliganism

and pitch invasions of the 1970s.




                                5
13.   In 1978 Dr Eastwood, a highly experienced civil and
structural engineer and a principal of the firm of Eastwood
and Partners who had been advising the Club on minor matters
since the 1950s, was formally retained to act on the Club's
behalf in its dealings with the local authority, then the
South Yorkshire County Council, but which later became the
Sheffield City Council ("the Council"). The Safety of Sports
Ground Act 1975 had recently been passed and it was necessary
for the Club to take expert advice if it was to receive a
Safety Certificate under the Act from the Council. Dr Eastwood
advised that further barriers should be installed in order to
comply with the Home Office "Green Guide" then in force and
the additional barriers shown and marked blue on the plan at

Appendix 4 were installed in 1979.


14.   The Council set up an Officer Working Party consisting of
representatives of the police, the fire services, and the
Council's building surveyors' division and legal and
administration department and, as a result of inspections and
consultations with the Club and Dr Eastwood, a Safety
Certificate was issued for the ground in 1979.


15.   In 1981, on the occasion of the semi-final between
Tottenham Hotspur and Wolverhampton Wanderers, a serious
crushing incident at the Leppings Lane end led to further
changes to the layout of the terrace. Late arrivals who surged
forward when a goal was scored at the Kop end caused the
crushing of several supporters at the front of the terrace.


                                6
There were injuries but no deaths. This incident, the further
significance of which will be returned to, prompted the police
to suggest that it had been caused by the sideways movement,
of supporters to positions behind the goal, and that the
installation of radial fences would prevent such movement as
well as providing segregation of supporters of opposing teams
who could thus be accommodated on the same terrace.


16.   The police view was accepted by the Club and the Officer
Working Party, and the two radial fences shown pale green in
Appendix 4 were installed in 1981. The terrace was thereby
divided into three pens, with neither forward nor sideways
movement by supporters being possible once a pen became full.
The fences had gates at the top end to be locked once the pens

had filled up.


17.   Further changes to the layout in 1985 and 1986 resulted
in the addition of two more radial fences, the consequential
removal of some posts and rails, and the removal of a barrier
at the top of the terrace near the entrance tunnel, Barrier
144. The result of the addition of the central radial fence
was to divide the pen immediately behind the goal into the two
pens 3 and 4. These were to be the scene of the disaster in

April 1989.


18.   All these changes were discussed between the police, the
Club and Dr Eastwood, and the Officer Working Party approved
the removal of Barrier 144 in August 1986, by which time Mr


                                7
Bownes had become the Licensing Officer responsible for the
Safety Certificate on behalf of the Council.


19.   Alterations to the turnstiles and concourse of the
Leppings Lane entrance were also made at this time in the
interests of segregation. To this end Dr Eastwood had
suggested a plan for separate access to the North stand, to
each end of the West stand, and to each of the three central
pens by means of separate banks of turnstiles. This plan was
not adopted for financial reasons, but it seems that separate
entrances would have enabled the numbers of supporters
entering each of the pens to be monitored by mechanical or
computerised counting at the turnstiles. As it was, there was
no numerical monitoring or other means of limiting the numbers
of supporters entering the penned areas, including the popular
pens 3 and 4 immediately behind the goal.


20.   The effect was that these areas were likely to attract
more than their proper share of the 10,100 supporters allowed
into the Leppings Lane end under the Safety Certificate and
there was no physical way of preventing this. All had to be
left to visual monitoring by the police and the Club stewards
as the supporters took their places inside the ground.


21.   The police had requested the removal of Barrier 144 in
pen 3 for two reasons: first, to assist the flow of supporters
into the pens and, secondly, to assist evacuation through the
tunnel in an emergency. Unhappily, as later events showed, the


                                8
first purpose was all too successfully achieved. A further
consequence, however, unappreciated at the time, was to
increase the capacity of pen 3.


22.   The Safety Certificate should have been amended to take
account of these changes, which the Club notified to the
Council in accordance with its statutory obligations. Equally
importantly, it should have contained maximum figures for

individual pens.


23.   The Certificate was not amended and maximum figures were
not inserted partly because Mr Bownes, as Chief Licensing
Officer responsible for 32 other licensing systems, was
overworked, and partly because Dr Eastwood thought that the
maximum stated capacity for the Leppings Lane end need not be
altered providing the police could ensure even distribution of
the supporters throughout the terrace by leaving the radial
gates open. The Taylor Report found that the insertion of
proper maximum figures into the Safety Certificate might have
prompted the Club and the police to find some way of limiting
the numbers entering pens 3 and 4. One way would have been the
adoption of Dr Eastwood's plan for separate turnstile
entrances mentioned above.


24.   The Taylor Report concluded that the fact that the Safety
Certificate was not amended and individual pen capacities not
reviewed could not be laid solely at Dr Eastwood's door. The
Council was ultimately responsible for the Certificate.


                                  9
25.   Entry to pens 3 and 4 was via the tunnel running from
the concourse area behind turnstiles A-G, underneath the West
stand and out into the terrace (see Appendices 1 and 3 to the
Taylor Report). The effect of the changes to the layout of the
Leppings Lane terrace, all of which were purportedly licensed
under the Safety Certificate, was that the only means of
controlling the numbers entering those pens was by cordoning

off the tunnel access.


26.   Moreover, it was the policy of the police at semi-finals
(but not at League matches) to allow free movement of
supporters between pens prior to the kick off, when the radial
gates would be closed and locked. Unless steps were taken to
control the numbers entering the tunnel access, therefore,
pens 3 and 4 were liable to become grossly overcrowded at all
times. The police had accepted de facto responsibility for
monitoring the pens and their policy of "letting the fans find
their own level", was severely criticised in the Taylor Report
(see paras 172 to 183).


The opening of the exit gate
27.   As already stated, the exit gate (Gate C) was opened at
2.52 pm on the day of the disaster following an instruction
from Mr Duckenfield. Gate C is situated almost immediately
opposite the tunnel (see Appendix 1 to the Taylor Report) and
no steps had been taken to cordon off the tunnel or to divert
the influx away to the sides of the West stand. The result was


                               10
that the supporters effectively had nowhere to go but the
already overcrowded pens 3 and 4.


28.   As the supporters entered the tunnel some were swept off
their feet, accelerated by a 1 in 6 downward gradient in the
tunnel itself. A huge crush built up in pens 3 and 4 and some
supporters tried to escape on to the pitch. Others climbed
over the radial fences to the side pens where, ironically,
there was still plenty of room. Later some began to be hauled
up out of the pens to safety in the West stand.


29.    The match kicked off just before 3 pm. The evidence
before the Taylor Inquiry satisfied that tribunal that it was
the near goal for Liverpool at 3.04 pm that caused a powerful
surge forward in pen 3, the force of which caused a crush
barrier at the front of the pen, barrier 124A, to collapse.
This in turn hurled supporters down against the wall and to
their deaths, putting yet more pressure on those already
suffocating at the perimeter wire at the front. The collapse
of this barrier appears to have been a major factor in the
deaths, since there were far fewer deaths in pen 4 where no
barrier collapsed.


30.   The Taylor Report found that a further contributory cause
of the collapse of barrier 124A was the removal of barrier 144
in 1986 already referred to. The absence of the latter
barrier, in the exceptional conditions prevailing, meant that
the supporters met no retarding structure as they emerged from


                               11
the tunnel into pen 3, and that there was unbroken diagonal
pressure from the mouth of the tunnel down to barrier 124A.
Further, as the plan at Appendix 4 to the Taylor Report shows,
barrier 124A was vulnerable to downward pressure as a result
of the removal of the barrier immediately above it - one of
the alterations consequential to the installation of the two
additional radial fences. The Taylor Report's conclusions are
supported on this point by the evidence of Inspector Bullas
(see para 234) and by a concession made by Dr Eastwood.


31.   The Taylor Report's findings on the timing of the
collapse of barrier 124A and its probable cause and effects
are supported by the BBC video tape and the evidence of the
supporters near to the barrier itself. They are reinforced by
the probability that, had the barrier collapsed earlier, the
police on the track would have appreciated that this
catastrophe had occurred and would have taken rescue action
much earlier.


32.   We have viewed the evidence and we are impressed by it.
With respect, we share the opinion of the Taylor Report that
this is what occurred. The collapse of barrier 124A was, of
course, a major factor in the causation of the deaths.


33.   The Taylor Report also found, on the basis of expert
evidence which is before us, that barrier 124A, although
corroded, had been tested by Dr Eastwood in July 1988 and had
passed the loading tests specified in the Green Guide.


                               12
Although the corrosion played a part in the collapse, the
effective cause, the Report found, was the excessive and
unanticipated pressure to which it was exposed at the time of
the forward surge mentioned above. The Green Guide made no
specific reference to testing for corrosion as a cause of

deterioration.


34.   The crushing in pens 3 and 4 was not recognised either by
the police officers in the control box in the South West
corner of the ground (see Appendix 1), or by the officers
detailed to the perimeter track, for several minutes after the
first signs of distress appeared, resulting in time being lost
before rescue efforts began. It is plain also, from our
reading of the statements, that the crushing and distress was
not recognised by nearby civilians, by many (but not all) of
the broadcasters and press, nor by stewards of the Club.
Having seen the video evidence, we can readily understand how
this situation arose. The truth is that no-one was expecting

to happen what in fact happened.


35.   There was no effective leadership until the arrival of
Chief Superintendent Nesbit just after 3pm and it was not
until 3.06pm that Mr Duckenfield appreciated that there had
been a major disaster rather than the pitch invasion that he
had assumed. The ambulance service was called at 3.06pm but no
request for cutting gear or the fire brigade was made until
3.13pm. The Taylor Report concluded, however, that it is



                               13
unlikely (although possible) that these services could have
saved lives had they been called promptly. We agree.


36.   The evacuation of the supporters and those injured was
achieved mainly through the perimeter gates. These were not
designed as exits and those to pens 3 and 4 were narrower than
provided by the Green guide. The Taylor report concluded,
however, that even if their width had complied with the Green
Guide, the gates would have been wholly inadequate to relieve
the pressure and release spectators swiftly. The Guide was
silent as to any recommended number of such gates and it is
clear that their use for large scale evacuation was not
intended or anticipated.


37.   The opening of gate C, which precipitated the disaster,
was made necessary by the massive build up of supporters at
the Leppings Lane turnstiles between 2.30 and 2.50 pm. The
perimeter gates to the ground (see Appendix 1) were open from
the outset, and severe congestion and crushing developed at
the turnstiles, the number and capacity of which were
inadequate to cope in time with the large numbers. The
crushing worsened as kick-off time approached and supporters
realised they would be late into the ground. The police lost
control of the crowd and the crush became unmanageable and
dangerous, with many fearing for their lives. The kick-off was
not postponed because it had been agreed with the Club that
this course would only be taken if there was a major cause of
delay such as an accident on the motorway or fog. Mr


                               14
Duckenfield gave inconsistent evidence to the Inquiry about
his decision on this point and the Report concluded that the
kick-off could and should have been postponed.


38.   The request to open gate C was made by Superintendent
Marshall, the Commander in Leppings Lane, who told Mr
Duckenfield by radio that someone would be killed if the gate
was not opened. There is a very considerable body of evidence
to show that Mr Marshall's view was correct and that Mr
Duckenfield had no alternative but to agree to the opening of

the gate.


39.   However, neither Mr Duckenfield nor any other police
officer took any steps to deal with the consequences of the
opening of the gate. In particular, the tunnel was not closed
off. This action, which had been taken in 1988 by serial
police officers apparently on their own initiative, could and
should have been carried out by a small number of police
forming a cordon and directing supporters to the unfilled wing
pens. Mr Duckenfield did order police serials to go to the
concourse to monitor an influx when another gate, gate A, was
opened a little earlier, because he feared a pitch invasion
from the North stand where there was no perimeter fence.


40.   The Taylor Report concluded that Mr Duckenfield's failure
to give a similar order on the opening of gate C was "a
blunder of the first magnitude". Plainly, this error was the
immediate, or proximate, cause of the crushing in pens 3 and 4


                               15
and the pressure which led to the collapse of the barrier in

pen 3.


41.   But it was not of course the sole cause. In addition to
the layout characteristics of the terrace described earlier,
the other main cause was the build up outside the ground which
led to the need to open the gate. This itself was due to a
combination of factors to which reference must now be made.


The   build   up   outside the ground
42.    The first factor contributing to the build up outside the
ground was the layout of the Leppings Lane turnstiles and the
narrowness of the neck or forecourt at the bend in the Lane
itself where, coming from the North, it turns to the South-
West and crosses the river (see Appendix 1). Not only were the
turnstiles not in a straight line, affording adequate space
for the formation of orderly queues, therefore, but the
waiting area itself was extremely confined. Next, there was
the designation and marking of the turnstiles, with the 10,100
ticket-holders for the West terrace all being required to
enter through turnstiles A-G at entrance "B", although the
three blocks of turnstiles serving the Leppings Lane entrance
were confusingly lettered "A,C,B". In addition, the colour
coding on the turnstile walls was too low to be seen through a
crowd. The Taylor Report found these to be factors
contributing to the delay in the turnstile operation.




                                    16
43.   However, the turnstile operation itself was slow because
there were only seven turnstiles to admit the 10,100 ticket-
holders, an average of 1450 through each. This is to be
compared with the 60 turnstiles at the Penistone Road end
which served 29,800, a little under 500 per stile. The Green
Guide provided that in general no more than 750 could be
admitted in one hour. The Club, taking into account that it
was an all-ticket match with no cash passing, reckoned this
could be increased to 1000 per hour. However, as Lord Justice
Taylor observed, even at this higher rate it would have taken
almost 1h hours to admit all those with terrace tickets; at
750 per hour it would have taken 2 hours. The Taylor Report
concluded that the police and the Club should have foreseen
that the turnstiles and the waiting area would be under strain
to admit all the Liverpool supporters in time.


44.   Many supporters arrived after 2.30 pm, the request on the
ticket being simply "to take up position 15 minutes before
kick off". Some arrived without tickets and tried to get in by
paying cash, others by trying to go over or under the paddle
of the turnstile or by sliding through with a ticket-holder.
All these activities slowed the admission rate and contributed
to the frustration of the crowd as kick-off approached.


45.    There is no question on the evidence that many of the
supporters had been drinking and some were abusive as a
result. Probably few offered violence and the Taylor Report
acquitted the majority of being affected by drink, finding


                               17
that some police had overestimated this factor in their
evidence. Having read the relevant statements, it seems to us
that drink and unruliness of the supporters certainly
contributed to the pushing from the back and was a factor in
making supporters less amenable to police requests to move
back. In some cases, too, drunk supporters tried to force
themselves in at the turnstiles, causing fighting with other
supporters and scuffles with the police trying to prevent
their entry. This minority contributed to the loss of control
of the crowd by police in our view.


46.   Nevertheless, the main factor in this loss of control was
a failure of police strategy in not planning properly for the
crush likely to be caused by a large concentration of arrivals
from 2.30 pm onwards, and in failing to stem the flow of
supporters or filter them towards the turnstiles from some
position outside the perimeter gates. Such action had been
successfully carried out in 1988, as numerous witnesses have
confirmed. The Taylor Report concluded that a combination of
controlled filtering and a postponed kick-off would probably
haver obviated the need to open the gate.


Apportionment of responsibility
47.   The layout of the ground as it stood on the day of the
disaster was the responsibility of four organisations, and
some of the individuals acting on their behalf, namely the
Club, Eastwood and Partners, the Council and the police.
However, none of them foresaw that the progressive alterations


                               18
made to the ground from about 1977 onwards in the interests of
safety and good order would come to constitute, in effect, a
death trap for supporters entering pens 3 and 4. This was
principally because no-one foresaw that up to 2000 supporters
would be allowed to enter these pens at a time when they were
already overcrowded, and when spreading out to the side to
absorb the extra numbers would be impossible. Plainly, no-one
foresaw any circumstances akin to the opening of gate C, nor
the unprecedented crushing outside the ground which made that
action necessary on the day of the disaster. That said, all
four organisations share some responsibility for the lack of
safe maximum capacities, the lack of controlled entry to the
pens and the absence of any proper system of monitoring, as
they must for the departures from the Green Guide and the
inadequacy of the Safety Certificate. The police must take the
main responsibility for the policy of letting the fans find
their own level although, as the lengthy exploration of the
borders of their duties at the Inquiry demonstrates, the Club
must share some responsibility for the way in which supporters
were allowed to fill the pens at semi-final matches.


48.   It may be argued that the 1981 crushing incident already
mentioned ought to have alerted the police and the Club to the
dangers of admitting large numbers of supporters via the
tunnel access to the West terrace, where they were capable of
being crushed against the perimeter fence, and that knowledge
of this incident increased the responsibility on the police
and the Club for affording safe access to the West terrace. We


                               19
consider that this is not so, because the response of the
police in 1981, accepted by the other parties involved, was to
instal the radial fences with the aim of preventing the
inwards movement of supporters to the area behind the goal,
and until the disaster it was assumed that this was a correct
response. Whether it was correct or not, the incident in our
view has no direct bearing on the disaster eight years later
and does not add to the potential criminal responsibility of
the police and the Club.


49.   The opening of gate C was the responsibility of Mr
Duckenfield and, as already noted, his decision was correct in
the circumstances. However, the failure to give any order to
accommodate the influx was a serious error which must in our
view be Mr Duckenfield's responsibility and his alone. Mr
Duckenfield had been promoted to Chief Superintendent of F
Division only three weeks before the match, and it is
reasonable to ask whether he was competent to take charge of a
match of this importance. However, there is no evidence to
suggest that those responsible for his promotion so erred in
appointing him as to share responsibility for errors made by
him on the day.


50.   The fact that the tunnel was cordoned off in 1988 by a
handful of junior police officers apparently on their own
initiative - an action that almost certainly would have
averted the disaster a year later - is one of the most
unfortunate aspects of the case, and at first sight the


                               20
operational organisation of the police might seem responsible
for failing to incorporate this tactic in its match planning.
However, Mr Duckenfield's dispatch of a serial to deal with
the opening of gate A demonstrates to our mind that it was
within his power to accommodate the opening of gate C, and the
blame for his not doing so cannot in our view be laid
elsewhere.


51. The build up outside the ground was again the
responsibility of the four organisations identified above.
Given the restrictions of space attendant on the geography of
Leppings Lane itself, the layout of the turnstiles and their
numbers, designation and marking was primarily a matter for
the police and the Club. But the Council was also partly
responsible for ensuring that there was safe ingress to the
ground (see Chapter 5 of the Green Guide).


52.   Allowing for the policing difficulties to which the
layout and slow admission rate of the turnstiles gave rise,
the loss of police control, and in particular the failure to
follow the filtering tactics employed in 1988, was solely a
police responsibility. The responsibility was, however, a
collective one and cannot be attributed to any individual
officer.


Criminal Offences




                               21
53.   We turn to consider whether any criminal offence is
disclosed against any of the organisations or individuals
identified or referred to above.


(1) Manslaughter
54. The police authority, the Club and the Council are in law
all corporations of one kind or another (see Halsbury's Laws
of England, 4th ed, Vol 9 at paras 1201-3) so an important
first question is whether a corporation can be indicted for
manslaughter.


55.   This question was considered at length by Professor J.C.
Smith in relation to the shipping company's liability for the
sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise in an Opinion dated
25th November 1987. We have had the advantage of seeing that
Opinion, which concluded that the company in that case could
be properly indicted for manslaughter by gross negligence or
recklessness, assuming it could be proved that one or more of
the directing minds of the company caused the deaths, and did
so with the fault required by the definition of manslaughter.
In due course proceedings were begun against the company and
others and on 5th June 1990 Turner J, sitting at the Central
Criminal Court, dismissed a motion to quash the indictment
against the company, holding that both on the authorities and
on principle a corporation is capable of committing
manslaughter. We have seen a note of the Reserved Judgment,
which includes a full consideration of the authorities, and in
our respectful view it represents a correct view of the law.


                               22
56.   We accordingly advise that each of the corporations
mentioned above could properly be indicted for manslaughter if
it could be proved that one or more of the directing minds of
the corporation concerned committed manslaughter as that
offence is currently defined.


(2) Definition of manslaughter
57.   Involuntary manslaughter is committed when a person
causes the death of another either (1) intending to do an act
which, whether he knows it or not, is unlawful and dangerous
in that it is likely to cause direct personal injury ("an
unlawful and dangerous act"), or (2) intending to do an act
which creates an obvious and serious risk of causing personal
injury (a) not giving thought to the possibility of such risk,
or (b) having recognised that there was some risk involved,
nonetheless going on to take it ("recklessness" as defined by
Lord Diplock In R v Lawrence [1982] AC 510).


58.   To amount to manslaughter a person's conduct need not be
the only cause of the death, but it must be a substantial
cause in that it contributed significantly to the result.
Whether it did so contribute is generally a question of fact
for the jury: Paqett (1983) 76 Cr App Rep 279, 287-91.


59.   It may also be that manslaughter is committed if the
person causing the death intends to do an act, or omits to do
an act where there is a duty to do so, being grossly negligent


                                 23
whether death or serious personal injury results ("gross
negligence"): see eg Smith and Hogan, Criminal Law, 6th ed
(1988) at p 345. The law is at present uncertain whether gross
negligence still exists as a separate head of liability, two
recent authorities having held that the earlier cases where
manslaughter is defined in terms of negligence should not be
followed and that Lord Diplock's test should be applied
universally.


60.   In Seymour (1983) 76 Cr App Rep 211, Watkins LJ, giving
the judgment of the Court of Appeal in a reckless driving
case, said:
      "...we are of the view that it is no longer necessary or
      helpful to make reference to compensation and negligence.
      The Lawrence direction on recklessness is comprehensive
      and of general application to all offences, including
      manslaughter involving the driving of motor vehicles
      recklessly and should be given to juries without in any
      way being diluted. Whether a driver at the material time
      was conscious of the risk he was running or gave no
      thought to its existence, is a matter which affects
      punishment for which purposes the judge will have to
      decide, if he can, giving the benefit of doubt to the
      convicted person, in which state of mind that person had
      driven at the material time."
61.   In Kong Cheuk Kwan v R (1985) 82 Cr App Rep 18 Lord
Roskill, giving the opinion of the Privy council, said at p
25:
      "Their Lordships are of the view that the present state
      of the relevant law in England and Wales... is clear. The
      model direction suggested in Lawrence and held in Seymour
      equally applicable to cases of motor manslaughter
      requires, first, that the vehicle was in fact being
      driven in such a manner as to create an obvious and
      serious risk of causing physical injury to another and
      secondly that the defendant so drove either without
      having given any thought to the possibility of there
      being such a risk or having recognised that there was
      such a risk nevertheless took it.
           In principle their Lordships see no reason why a
      comparable direction should not have been given in the
      present case as regards that part of the case which
      concerned the alleged navigation of the Flying Goldfinch
      by Kong and indeed as regards the alleged navigation of
      the Flying Flamingo by the other two defendants. Did
      their respective acts of navigation create an obvious and
      serious risk of causing physical damage to some other
      ship and thus to other persons who might have been
      travelling in the area of the collision at the material
      time? If so did any of the defendants... so navigate
      either without having given any thought to the
      possibility of that risk or, while recognising that the
      risk existed, take that risk?"


                               25
At p 26, Lord Roskill said:
      "Their Lordships... respectively agree with the comment
      made by Watkins LJ... in Seymour."


62.   However, as pointed out by Smith and Hogan (6th ed (1988)
at p 353), while the clear implication from Kona Cheuk Kwan is
that there is no longer any separate test of gross negligence
in manslaughter, it may be that the courts would not be
prepared to exclude it altogether in an appropriate case. Some
support for this view is found in Goodfellow (1986) 83 Cr App
Rep 23, where Lord Lane LCJ said that the question in Kong
Cheuk Kwan was whether the defendant was "guilty of
recklessness (or gross negligence)".


63.   We consider it right in the circumstances of Hillsborough
to approach the evidence on the basis that the gross
negligence test is sufficient to establish the offence of
manslaughter and we propose to advise accordingly.


(3) Neglect by police
64.   When gross negligence or manslaughter by neglect is
alleged against the police, however, authority indicates a
more detailed test of liability. In R v West London Coroner's
Court, ex p Gray [1988] QB 467, allegations were made against
police following the death of a man while in police custody
concerning the use of force against him and failure to summon
an ambulance promptly when he became unconscious. The
coroner's directions to the jury as to unlawful killing were


                               26
quashed by the Divisional Court, which held that a coroner
directing a jury on manslaughter comprising unlawful killing
alleged to have occurred because of neglect by police was
required to direct them as follows:
      (1) that they had to be satisfied of four ingredients,
      namely (a ) that the police were under a duty to have
      regard to the health and welfare of the deceased, (b)
      that in the circumstances there was a failure to do what
      should have been done for the health and welfare of the
      deceased, (c) that the failure amounted to a substantial
      cause of death, and (d) that the failure amounted to
      recklessness;
      (2) that the test of "recklessness" was whether a police
      officer, having regard to his duty, was indifferent to an
      obvious and serious risk to the health and welfare of the
      deceased or, recognising that risk to be present,
      deliberately chose to run it by doing nothing about it;
      (3) that a failure to appreciate that there was such a
      risk was not by itself sufficient to amount to
      recklessness; and
      (4) that the jury could only return a verdict of unlawful
      killing if they could attribute the unlawful conduct to a
      single police officer.


65.   Plainly those directions are those to be given in any
criminal prosecution of a police officer where omission to act
is alleged to have caused death. In our view they have a



                               27
direct bearing on our consideration of the evidence in this
case.


(4) Culpable misfeasance
66.     We turn next to consider the common law offence of
culpable misfeasance or misconduct in public office. We are
satisfied that this offence exists, and that it is committed
where a public officer, such as a police officer, wilfully
neglects to perform a duty which he is bound to perform by
common law or statute. But the neglect has to be wilful, not
merely inadvertent, and must be culpable in the sense that it
is without reasonable excuse or justification. The element of
culpability is not restricted to corruption or dishonesty,
however, but must be of such a degree that the misconduct is
calculated to injure the public interest: R v Dvtham [1979] 2
QB 722.


67.     Even if the words "likely to" are substituted for
"calculated" in this definition, as we think they might be, it
is clear that this little known offence is a difficult one to
prove to the satisfaction of a jury.


Evidence to support manslaughter
68.     We consider in turn the possible liability of (i) the
Club, (ii) Eastwood and Partners, (iii) the Council and (iv)
the police. It will be convenient to consider the evidence
first against the four organisations, and secondly in relation



                                 28
to the individuals who acted on behalf of the organisations
concerned.


(i ) The Club
69.   The Club's responsibility for the crushing and deaths
lies in its responsibility for (1) the layout of the inside of
the ground as a result of the alterations to the West terrace
and (2) the layout, number, designation and marking of the
turnstiles in Leppings Lane. Whilst, on our factual analysis
of the disaster, these two factors might be regarded as
substantial causes of the deaths in that they contributed
significantly to the result, it is clear not only that they
were not the sole causes, or even the major causes, but that
the Club's actions and omissions only partly contributed to
them. As already observed (see para 47 above), the layout of
the ground was the responsibility of the four organisations
and in varying degrees. The Club not only relied on its own
consultant engineer Dr Eastwood, but it responded to the
suggestions and advice of the police in important respects.
The Council played its part.


70.   For the purposes of the criminal law, where it is
axiomatic that a case against each defendant must be given
totally separate consideration, we consider that there is no
sufficient evidence to support a prima facie case that the
Club caused the deaths.




                               29
71.   In case we are wrong in that conclusion, we have
considered whether the requisite intention for manslaughter
could be proved against the Club. It seems to us, however,
that the evidence does not begin to show either recklessness
or gross negligence on its part.


72.   It follows that there is in our view no sufficient
evidence to support a charge of manslaughter against either
the Club or any of its officials.


(ii) Eastwood and Partners
73.   Since Dr Eastwood was the principal of the firm, it is
his actions and omissions alone that fall to be considered. As
consultant to the Club he too was responsible for the layout
of the inside of the ground and the layout and operation of
the turnstiles. However, his advice formed part only of the
sequence of events that led to the structural condition of the
ground as it was immediately before the disaster and by no
rational yardstick could his advice be said to have caused the
deaths. There are two further factors in his case, moreover.
First, his advice in relation to the forming of separate
turnstile entrances to the North stand, each end of the West
stand and each of the central plans, not acted on for
financial reasons, would if adopted have led to numerical
monitoring of the central pens, and might well have led to the
insertion of maximum figures for those pens in compliance with
the Safety Certificate. Second, so far as the Safety



                               30
#

    Certificate is concerned, this was the ultimate responsibility
    of the Council.


    74.   There is no evidence that Dr Eastwood caused the deaths.
    Nor is there any evidence that he was either reckless or
    grossly negligent. We have no hesitation, therefore, in
    concluding that there is no evidence to support a charge of
    manslaughter against Dr Eastwood or indeed against Eastwood
    and Partners.


    (iii) The Council
    75.   The Council bears responsibility for the Safety
    Certificate, which should have been amended to provide for the
    alterations and for the insertion of maximum figures for the
    pens. The Council was also responsible for ensuring compliance
    with the Green Guide in the respects detailed above, as well
    as in some other respects. There were departures from the
    Green Guide, some more important then others. Of course, it
    does not follow that the disaster would not have happened even
    if the Safety Certificate had been amended, since compliance
    depended on the Club and Dr Eastwood. In common with the Club
    and Dr Eastwood, however, the Council's errors only partly
    contributed to the ground conditions identified above as
    causes of the deaths and on any view were too remote to amount
    to a prima facie case of manslaughter. There is no evidence of
    recklessness or gross negligence on their part.




                                   31
76.   There is accordingly no evidence to support a charge of
manslaughter against Mr Bownes.


77.    It is unnecessary to consider the liability of the
Sheffield District Council for the errors of its predecessor,
the South Yorkshire County Council, though we would assume
such liability to have been inherited on the reorganisation.


(iv) The police
78.   The main responsibility for the disaster at Hillsborough
rests on the police in the respects identified above and
clearly set out in the Taylor Report. As an organisation they
were partly responsible for the layout of the inside of the
ground. They were responsible for the policy, heavily
criticised in the Taylor Report, whereby supporters were left
"to find their own level" and not monitored as they entered
the pens in semi-final matches. They were also partly
responsible for the Leppings Lane turnstiles and, together
with the Club, should have foreseen the difficulties of
admission of such large numbers. There was a serious failure
of policing in Leppings Lane, due in part to a failure to
follow filtering tactics used effectively in 1988.


79.   These errors too, however, can only be viewed as part of
a complex sequence of events, many of which were outside the
control of the police. The layout of the ground, both inside
and out, was the main responsibility of the Club as advised by
Dr Eastwood, with the Council and the Officer Working Party


                               32
superintending the alterations to the West terrace. Likewise,
the contents of the Safety Certificate were not the main
responsibility of the police. The difficulties inherent in the
policing of Leppings Lane, which were partly geographical, and
the arrival of supporters in very large numbers after 2.30 pm
were not and could not be under police control. Finally, the
unruly behaviour of a minority of them, although no doubt
foreseeable, created added difficulties.


80.   Once responsibility for the failure to postpone the kick-
off and to cordon off the access tunnel is confined to Mr
Duckenfield, as we consider it should be (see para 48 above),
the conclusion becomes inescapable in our view that the police
as an organisation cannot be said to have caused the deaths by
their strategy and operational errors.


81.   We have examined the structure of the police command,
both on the day of the disaster itself and in previous years.
We have considered the operational orders for 1988 and 1989
and police practice at Hillsborough, inside and outside the
ground, as detailed in the Taylor Report. We have also
considered the interviews of Mr Marshall and Mr Murray.
However, there seems to us to be no evidence that in making
what were undoubtedly errors of judgment and practice, the
police organisation, or any individual within it, acted
recklessly or in a grossly negligent manner either on the day
of the disaster or beforehand.




                                 33
82.   We accordingly find no basis on which to advise a charge
of corporate manslaughter against any directing mind within
the police organisation.


Chief Superintendent Duckenfield
83.   Mr Duckenfield was heavily criticised in the Taylor
Report for failing to cordon off the access tunnel, and his
decision not to postpone the kick-off was regarded as a bad
error of judgment. We think both of these criticisms are
entirely justified. Moreover, as the operational commander of
the match, he was ultimately responsible for the policing both
within and outside the ground. He was personally slow to
recognise the crushing or signs of distress in the central
pens which were going on before his eyes. He failed to notice
the gross imbalance of filling between those pens and the
outer wings which the video shows so clearly. His
preoccupation with the possibility of a pitch invasion caused
him to delay putting the Major Disaster Plan into operation.


84.   Yet Mr Duckenfield had under his command officers with
considerable experience of policing the match and the ground
who also made operational errors or failed to react as they
should have done. It is unnecessary to set out here the chain
of police command; suffice it to say that in the senior
positions were officers who had successfully policed
Hillsborough in previous years, particularly in 1988, when the
operation was regarded as successful. Under them were other
experienced inspectors and sector commanders. If the


                               34
operational orders or police intelligence was inadequate, as
seems likely, it was not the fault of Mr Duckenfield who
inherited a ready made match plan compiled by others and tried
to follow it. The slowness of his response to the disaster,
while much to be regretted, was doubtless due in part to his
lack of experience of this particular match.


85.   Mr Duckenfield, who declined to be interviewed for the
purposes of the criminal investigation, would no doubt argue
that none of these errors caused the deaths because of the
interposition of the many other factors already rehearsed. It
seems to us that that argument would be likely to succeed in
relation to many of the criticisms. However, there is a case
to be made in our view that his failure both to postpone the
kick-off and to take no action to close the tunnel after the
opening of gate C was a substantial cause of the deaths, in
that it significantly contributed to the crowd pressure which
led to the crushing and the collapse of barrier 124A.


86.   If that is so, it is necessary to consider whether there
is evidence that Mr Duckenfield, when failing so to act, had
the requisite intention to support a charge of manslaughter.


87.   Clearly there was no unlawful and dangerous act on his
part or intended by him which would found the first head of
liability in involuntary manslaughter. But in failing to
postpone the kick-off, or to order the closure of the tunnel
after the opening of gate C, or both, did he intend an act


                               35
which created an obvious and serious risk of causing personal
injury, either not giving thought to the possibility of such
risk, or having recognised that there was some risk involved,
nonetheless go on to take it?


88.     We consider that there are difficulties in proving that
he intended to do an act which created an obvious and serious
risk of causing personal injury. In the first place there was
no "act" as such, but an omission or omissions to act which
contributed to a rapidly developing state of affairs ending in
serious risk of injury. But was it an obvious risk at the
time? We think not. The complexity of the disaster as now
known to those who have analysed it in hindsight demonstrates
that there must be grave doubt as to whether the omissions
created a risk which was obvious to anyone at the time. The
considerations here are, of course, wholly different from the
driving cases or the collision at sea in the Kong Cheuk Kwan
case.


89.     We conclude, therefore, that there is insufficient
evidence on which to found a charge of recklessness against Mr
Duckenfield. Nor is there evidence that he was grossly
negligent in failing to act as mentioned above. We bear in
mind particularly the judgment of the Divisional Court in the
West London Coroner's Court case the requirements of which are
not in our view satisfied.




                                 36
90.   It follows, and we have come to the clear conclusion,
that there is no evidence that Mr Duckenfield was wilfully
neglectful of his duty or was culpable so as to have committed
the offence of culpable misfeasance.


91.   We conclude that there is no sufficient evidence of any
criminal offence having been committed by Mr Duckenfield.


Police Constables Smith and Illingworth
92.   We note the complaints made against these two officers
who were stationed on the perimeter track at gates 3 and 4
respectively and we have considered the interviews of both.
There is conflicting evidence in the case of each as to how he
reacted and when each gate was opened (see the West Midlands
Report Part VII at pp 252 to 259) and in the case of Smith
there is substantial doubt as to whether he pushed spectators,
including the complainant Hendry and an unidentified boy, back
into the crowd and if so when, ie whether before or after he
had appreciated the true nature of the disaster.


93.   There is no evidence before us that either of these
officers was guilty of manslaughter or culpable misfeasance,
and we advise that the allegations made against them be
investigated further and if appropriate pursued in
disciplinary proceedings.




                               37
t

    94.   The balance of allegations against the other officers
    mentioned in the West Midlands Report must likewise be a
    matter for disciplinary proceedings.


    95.   We therefore find no sufficent evidence to support
    criminal proceedings of any kind against those persons
    mentioned in the West Midlands Report whom we have not found
    it necessary to identify in this Opinion.

THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER
THE DECISION BY THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS
SYNOPSIS OF EVENTS
The Hillsborough Stadium Disaster occurred on the 15th of April
1989, on that day an FA Cup Semi Final match was being played at
the Stadium which is the home ground of Sheffield Wednesday
Football Club.   95 people died. A public enquiry was ordered
under the chairmanship of Lord Justice Taylor. The West Midlands
Police were asked to assist the enquiry and the Coroners Court
hearings which were due to follow.      The West Midlands Chief
Constable Mr Geoffrey Dear was appointed as the Coroners Officer
and to assist the enquiry.
The Public Enquiry heard evidence from numerous witness and
viewed large numbers of still photographs and video recordings
of the events which took place at the Stadium on that Saturday
afternoon.
On the 4th of August 1989 Lord Justice Taylor published his
Interim Report and Recommendations.      On that day the Chief
Constable of the South Yorkshire Police asked the Director of
Public Prosecutions to consider the report and its findings and
in particular whether the question of criminal responsibility of
the Police and others should be considered arising from the
findings of the Interim Report.
Having read the Report the Director made a request to the Chief
Constable of South Yorkshire for a criminal investigation to be
conducted.   Investigation was to consider possible criminal
responsibility of not only the Police but any other persons
involved in the events which incurred on that day.
The West Midlands Police were requested to explain their
involvement beyond assisting the Public Enquiry and the Coroner
and to conduct a criminal investigation. Mr Dear was appointed
as Investigating Officer and the investigation was supervised by
The Police Complaints Authority.

In late August 1989 Mr Garreth Williams QC and Mr Peter Berts
were retained to advise the Director.
On 30th August 1989 the first meeting took place between members
of the CPS Headquarters Office, Mr C Newell, Mr C Clue and
Mr M Kennedy and senior members of The West Midlands Police Team.
Copies of all the Public Enquiry statements were supplied to
Mr Kennedy at CPS Headquarters and to Counsel.




                                1
On the 10th November 1989 both Counsel and the above three
members of CPS HQ visited the Hillsborough Stadium and later that
day the centre of operations for the criminal enquiry at Nechells
Green Police Station, Birmingham.
During the next month as the Enquiry progressed various
statements and documents were delivered to CPS HQ by The West
Midlands Police Team. Duplicate sets of the same documents were
also delivered to the PCA and to Mr Williams and Mr Berts.
Papers were delivered on this ad hoc basis as they became
available and in manageable bundles so that the reading could
take place over a period of time rather than all the papers been
delivered once at the end of the Enquiry.
Mr Berts and Mr Williams advised in writing, on the telephone and
in conference on several occasions during the course of the
investigation.
Although several potential defendants had not been interview the
Report was delivered to the CPS Headquarters dated the 30th of
March 1990.    All the interviews under caution were finally
completed in July 1990 and each interview once completed was
transcripted and copies of the transcript delivered to the PCA,
Counsel and CPS HQ.
Mr Williams and Mr Berts delivered a 38 page opinion to the CPS
Headquarters dated the 6th of August 1990.       The opinion was
considered by senior lawyers at CPS Headquarters and also by the
Director pertinently. The Director agreed with the conclusion
expressed in the opinion that there was insufficient evidence for
a realistic prospect of convicting any person or any corporate
body of any criminal offence.
The Police Complaints Authority issued Interim Statements
confirming that the Police Investigation had been conducted to
their satisfaction.   These Statements were dated the 15th of
August 1990.
The Attorney General also saw Counsels opinion and he expressed
his agreement with the conclusion which had been reached by
Counsel and the Director.
The decision not to prosecute on the basis of insufficient
evidence was communicated to interested parties by faxed letter
on the 30th of August 1990. A Press Release was issued later
that same day.




                                2
I should make it clear that if an Affidavit is required then
neither Mr Kennedy, Mr Clue, Mr Newell or indeed the Director can
say that they have read all the papers submitted or viewed all
the video evidence. The Police were instructed to send all the
material to us however, for practical purposes it proved
impossible for all the documentation to be considered by CPS
lawyers.   It as agreed that Counsel should be asked to .read
through the documentation and provide advise. Any Affidavit to
cover the question of reading the documentation would have to be
made by Counsel.

      Dear Mrs Knapman
      I understand from our telephone conversation this morning that
      an application for leave to apply for judicial review in the
      Hillsborough case is to be heard on 12th November.
      I am fully aware that under Order 53 rule 3(2) , such applications
      are ex parte. As I indicated, however, the Director of Public
      Prosecutions is greatly concerned by this application and would
      welcome being heard through Counsel on the 12th if the Court
      considered this to be appropriate. I should be very grateful if
      you would place this matter before the Court so that we might
      receive an indication whether or not the Court would consider it
      helpful to have the putative respondent present.
      At the same time, may I take this opportunity to mention the
      Marchioness case.   You will recall that on the telephone, I
      indicated that a press report in the Sunday Telegraph for the
      21st October mentioned the fact that an application for leave to
      review the Director's decision not to prosecute for more serious
      charges was to be made on Thursday, 25th October (though I now
      understand it may be in Friday's list) . I am aware that your
      staff do not have any record of this application. If, however,
      such an application is notified to you, I should again be very
      grateful if you would let me know so that consideration can be
      given to whether the Director should seek the Court's leave to
      appear as the putative respondent again on the application when
      it is heard.
      I am grateful for your very considerable assistance in these
      matters and indeed in the matters of LINES and BEGUM with which
      I have troubled y o u in recent weeks.

THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER
THE DECISION BY THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS
SYNOPSIS OF EVENTS
The Hillsborough Stadium Disaster occurred on the 15th of April
1989. On that day an FA Cup Semi Final match was being played
at the Stadium which is the home ground of Sheffield Wednesday
Football Club.   95 people died. A Public Enquiry was ordered
under the chairmanship of Lord Justice Taylor. The West Midlands
Police were asked to assist the Enquiry and the Coroners Court
hearings which were due to follow. The Chief Constable of The
West Midlands Police, Mr Geoffrey Dear was appointed as the
Coroners Officer and to assist the Enquiry.
The Public Enquiry heard evidence from numerous witness and
viewed large numbers of still photographs and video recordings
of the events which took place at the Stadium on that Saturday
afternoon.
On the 4th of August 1989 Lord Justice Taylor published his
Interim Report. On that day the Chief Constable of the South
Yorkshire Police asked the Director of Public Prosecutions to
consider the Report and its findings and whether the question of
criminal responsibility of the Police and others should be
investigated.
Having read the Report the Director made a request to the Chief
Constable of South Yorkshire for a criminal investigation to be
conducted.   The investigation was to consider the possible
criminal responsibility of the Police and any other persons
involved in the events which incurred on that day.
The West Midlands Police were requested to expand their
involvement beyond assisting the Public Enquiry and the Coroner,
and to conduct a criminal investigation. Mr Dear was appointed
as Investigating Officer and the investigation was supervised by
The Police Complaints Authority.

In late August 1989 Mr Gareth Williams QC and Mr Peter Birts
were retained to advise the Director.
On 30th August 1989 the first meeting took place between members
of the CPS Headquarters Office, Mr C Newell, Mr C Cleugh and
Mr M Kennedy and senior members of The West Midlands Police Team.
Copies of all the Public Enquiry statements were supplied to
Mr Kennedy at CPS Headquarters and to Counsel.




                                1
On the   10th November 1989 both Counsel and the three members of
CPS HQ   visited the Hillsborough Stadium and later that day the
centre   of operations for the criminal enquiry at Nechells Green
Police   Station, Birmingham.
During the next months as the Enquiry progressed various
statements and documents were delivered to CPS HQ by The West
Midlands Police Team. Duplicate sets of the same documents were
also delivered to the PCA and to Mr Williams and Mr Birts.
Papers were delivered on this ad hoc basis as they became
available and in manageable bundles so that the reading could
take place over a period of time rather than all the papers been
delivered once at the end of the Enquiry.
Mr Williams and Mr Birts advised in writing, on the telephone
and in conference on several occasions during the course of the
investigation.
Although several potential defendants had not been interviewed
the Report was delivered to the CPS Headquarters dated the 30th
of March 1990. All the interviews under caution were finally
completed in July 1990 and each interview once completed was
transcripted and copies of the transcript delivered to the PCA,
Counsel and CPS HQ.
Mr Williams and Mr Birts delivered a 38 page opinion to the CPS
Headquarters dated the 6th of August 1990.      The opinion was
considered by senior lawyers at CPS Headquarters and also by the
Director personally.   The Director agreed with the conclusion
expressed in the opinion, that there was insufficient evidence
for a realistic prospect of convicting any person or any
corporate body of any criminal offence.
The Police Complaints Authority issued Interim Statements
confirming that the Police Investigation had been conducted to
their satisfaction.   These Statements were dated the 15th of
August 1990.
The Attorney General also saw Counsels opinion and he expressed
his agreement with the conclusion which had been reached by
Counsel and the Director.
The decision not to prosecute on the basis of insufficient
evidence was communicated to interested parties by faxed letter
on the 30th of August 1990. A Press Release was issued later
that same day.

    I should make it clear that if an Affidavit is required then
    neither Mr Kennedy, Mr Cleugh, Mr Newell or indeed the Director
    can say that they have read all the papers submitted or viewed
    all the video evidence.  The Police were instructed to send all
    the material to us, however, for practical purposes it proved
    impossible for all the documentation to be considered by CPS
    lawyers.   It was agreed that Counsel should be asked to read
    through the documentation and provide advise.   A ny Affidavit to
    cover the question of reading the documentation woul d have to be
    made by Counsel.

Dear Mr Green

Re: The Hillsborough Disaster

In accordance with my telephone conversation with Mr Kennedy and as arranged
I enclose a copy of the documents lodged at the High Court to support my
application for judicial review of your decision not to prosecute Sheffield
Wednesday Football Club and its Directors for the Hillsborough disaster.
I also enclose a copy of Mr Justice McCullough'sreasons for refusing my
table afjblication which I do not accept.

Mr Kennedy thought you might wish to be represented at the hearing of the
application which is due to be heard on the 12th November before the Divisional
Court. Would you please let me know as soon as possible if you are to
be represented on my ex parte application.

Would it please be possible to let me know the following information:-

1.   Has there been a successful prosecution for manslaughter on the basis
     of an unlawful killing verdict by an inquest jury when the police and
     prosecuting authorities have not taken action in the first instance?

2.   How   many private prosecutions for manslaughter have (a) been initiated
     (b)   been accepted as cases to be answered by the magistrates and
     (c)   have ended in conviction since the verdict of unlawful killing
     was   introduced.

3.   Am I right in thinking that you publicly announced that there was
     no sufficient evidence or realistic prospect of obtaining a conviction
     for the Zeebrugge disaster after the official inquiry and before the
     inquest opened. If so would you please let me know the date of such
     announcement.

    Please let me have this information as quickly as possible bearing in mind
    the court hearing is on the 12th November.

    Yours sincerely




    (ROY EDEY)

Form 86 A
IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUSTICE
QUEENS BENCH DIVISION
CROWN OFFICE LIST
In the matter of an application for Judicial Review
THE QUEEN -v- THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS
Ex parte - ROY EDEY



                            AFFIDAVIT


I ROY EDEY of
MAKE OATH AND SAY as follows

1.     I am a sports spectator and football supporter.
2.     The Hillsborough disaster was the fourth disaster at a British
football match involving crushing of spectators leading to death and
serious injury. In 1923 there were 1,000 casualties at Wembley Stadiumj
in 19^6 33 spectators were crushed to death at Bolton Wanderers ground
and in 1971 66 spectators lost their lives through being crushed to death
at Ibras? Park.
3.     In I985 there was a disaster at Bradford City football ground when
an acc mulation of rubbish was ignited under a wooden stand and 56 spectators
lost their lives and over 300 were injured.
4.     Nobody has appeared before the courts on criminal charges in respect
of any of these incidents. I allege gross criminal negligence amounting to
manslaughter was evident at Hillsborough Stadium on the l8 th April, 1989 .
5.     I submit that my letter of the 14th September, 1990 to the Director
of Public Prosecutions sets out in detail a prima facie case of manslaughter
for determination by judge and jury.
6.     It should be borne in mind that originally no prosecution was
envisaged by the D.P.P. of the evidence in respect of the Herald of Free
Enterprise disaster at Zeebrugge. The trial now taking place of seven
individual persons and P. and 0. as a company for corporate manslaughter
is incontrovertible proof of the original decision having been wrong.
7.     In view of recurring disasters it is important that responsibility
for the safety of spectators is brought home to the football clubs in the
public interest.
                                          -2 -




8.      That there is no reason to suppose that an indictment cannot be
f,ramed alleging gross negligence amounting to manslaughter against
the Directors of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and if considered
appropriate the Club itself.
9.     That such a prosecution would act as a deterrent to not
providing proper safety for spectators at football grounds.

Dear Sir,

Disaster at Hillsborough.

     Would you please let me know as soon as possible whether you intend
to institute proceedings against the Directors of Sheffield Wednesday
Football Club for manslaughter of those who died in Hillsborough stadium
on 15th April 1989.

     Mr. Justice Taylor went on record at a preliminary hearing, before
taking any evidence, that he would not be looking at a crime having been
committed or apportioning blame for what occurred.

     The terrible fire at Bradford four years ago made it clear beyond
all reasonable doubt that there must be inmediate access to the pitch
in an emergency. The government guidelines published in 1986 lays this
down as a requirement for safety at football grounds. I would hardly
have thought that anybody with a grain of common sense could have looked
at it in any other way. Had there been fencing not allowing access to
the pitch at Bradford, instead of 56 deaths, the death toll would almost
certainly have been numbered in hundreds.

     Yesterday, Mr. Trevor Hicks testified to the Taylor Enquiry that
he saw one of his daughters being manhandled over the fencing. It had
unfortunately been too late and both his daughters died in the crush.
Mr Hicks tells me he is willing to testify at a trial for manslaughter.

     It is in the public interest that the gross criminal negligence which
has occurred is brought home to football management. If the sanction
of the criminal law is not invoked, further tragedies are much more
likely. The deaths which occurred at Hillsborough were wholly avoidable.

     Had access to the pitch been available whatever the circumstances
outside the ground those penned behind the fencing could have been allowed
on to the pitch before the police felt obliged to open the gate. The
police outside could have informed the Security Officer inside that they
had an emergency on their hands and to relieve pressure they needed to
open the gate. He could then have ordered the opening of the fencing
allowing access to the pitch before the gate was opened and no deaths
would have ensued.
 m    -
       have to tell you, sir, that i£ you inform me that you do not intend
to prosecute in this matter I will, in the public interest, be seeking
judicial review of the decision of the Stipendiary Magistrate at Sheffield
given on the 3rd May, refusing me consent for a private prosecution.

Yours faithfully,

Dear Lord Justice Taylor,

                      DISASTER AT HILLSBOROUGH

      I think it right that I should let you know that on 3rd May I applied
to Mr Crompton the Stipendiary Magistrate at Sheffield for a summons to
be issued against the Directors of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and
Mr Peter Wright the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire that they killed
Victoria Hicks and Sarah Hicks at Hillsborough Stadium on 15th April, 1989.
The Magistrate* refused the application on the grounds that I had no direct
interest and could not bring direct evidence before the court.

      I enclose herewith a copy of a letter I have written to the Director
of Public Prosecutions. I think you should see this as a matter of courtesy.
Had the 95 deaths occurred to animals the RSPCA would have been down on
those responsible like a ton of bricks. Football management has to be made
to face up to its responsibilities.

      I am struck by the fact that after the disaster at Bolton in 1946
Mr Moelwyn Hughes KC laid dowi^a blueprint for such a disaster not happening
again and yet similar disasters have occurred in 1971 at Ibrox Park and
at Hillsborough resulting in a further 165 people losing their lives.

      Even today grounds are not safe and you could have had to take on
board a further tragedy at Port Vale five short weeks after the disaster
in respect of which you are at present hearing evidence. I enclose a newspaper
cutting of the incident to which I refer. I hope you will recomnend that
the Home Secretary issues regulations laying down minimum standards of safety
at sports grounds as recorrmended by Mr Moelwyn Hughes 43 years ago and as
he is impended to do by Section 6 (2) of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act
1975.

Yours faithfully,

Dear Lord Justice Taylor,

       Thank you for the letter of the 8 June acknowledging my letter
of the 31st May.

       Having just received a letter from the Senior Crown Prosecutor
I have, as a result, written today to the Chief Constable of South

Dear Me. Wright,

                        DISASTER AT HILLSBOROUGH

       I enclose a copy of my letter to the Director of Public Prosecutions
dated the 18th May together with a copy of the reply I have just
received from the Senior Crown Prosecutor, Mr. E.C.S. Williams.

       Since I wrote my letter evidence has been given to the Taylor
Inquiry by Chief Superintendent Mole that the Football Association
and Liverpool and Sheffield Wednesday Football Clubs had made approaches
in an attempt to change police plans so that Liverpool supporters
couLd be properly accommodated. They were told by Chief Superintendent
Mole that he was only prepared to police the match under the plans
laid down by the police. By their representations Sheffield Wednesday
must have known that that method of policing put the Liverpool supporters
at risk.

       The fact that the match was held with that basic disagreement
over safety of the spectators from Liverpool at the Lepping Lane
terraces reinforces my belief that the Directors of Sheffield Wednesday
Football Club were criminally negligent in allowing the match to
be held at all let alone the perimeter fencing situation referred
to in my copy letter sent herewith. On these two grounds there must
be a prima facie case of manslaughter for the Directors to face before
judge and jury.

       Unless you assure me within the next seven days that you agree
with my contention and will carry out an investigation referring
it to the Senior Crown Prosecutor for consideration for proceedings
to be instituted, I intend to apply to the High Court for a writ
of mandamus requiring this to be done.

       I have sent a copy of this letter to the Right Honourable
Lord Justice Taylor for his information.
Yours sincerely,



R. Edey (Mr)

   Dear Mr Edey

   May I reply to your letter of 12 June on behalf of the Chief Constable.

   As you know the tragic events which unfolded at the Hillsborough
   Football Stadium on 15 April 1989 are being considered in the most
   intimate detail by Lord Justic Taylor's Inquiry. An independent enquiry
   team from the West Midlands Police have conducted exhaustive enquiries
   and furnished the Inquiry with all the relevant available information.

   If it had been felt at any time during the gathering of information that
   criminal offences had been committed then the appropriate investigations
   would have been commenced. At this stage there is no evidence to
   suggest that an offence of the nature you suggest has been committed and
   accordingly no criminal charges have been brought.

   Yours sincerely
6th July 1989.


P. Wright Esq.,
South Yorkshire Police,
Snig Hill,
Sheffield,
S3 SLY.

Dear Sir,

        I have the reply to my letter of the 12th June from
Mr. T. Watson on your behalf. It is said that there is no evidence
to suggest that the management board of Sheffield Wednesday Football
Club have committed a criminal offence and accordingly no criminal
charges have been brought.

        Before seeking judicial review in the High Court I thought
you should have the opportunity to reconsider the facts of the
matter. It is in my opinion only too clear that there is overwhelming
and abundant evidence of gross criminal negligence on the part
of the football club. It clearly constitutes a prima facie case
of manslaughter to put before judge and jury for determination.

        In the first place the match should not have been held
at Hillsborough Stadium. Evidence was given to the Taylor Inquiry
that representations had been made by Liverpool and the Football
Association which had been put forward to the police by Sheffield
Wednesday Football Club that the Liverpool spectators could not
be properly acconroodated in the Leppings Lane terraces. Superintendent
Mole made it clear that the match would only be policed with.Liverpool
being allocated the much smaller Leppings Lane terraces. The decision
to hold the match was entirely that of the Club.

        It meant that Liverpool were allocated accommodation for
less than 25% of their average gate whereas Nottingham Forest received
room for over 50% of their average gate at the Kop end of the ground.
It was a recipe for disaster. At the Kop end there were 42 turnstiles
to admit 21,000 spectators and the Leppings Lane terraces only
had 7 turnstiles for the capacity of 10,100 people on those terraces.
        Evidence was given by the chief steward for that part of
the ground that the Leppings Lane terraces had never been stewarded
and that he had never seen the Government's Green Guide and it
had never been brought to his attention and that he did not even
know of its existence. This was obviously known, or should have
been known, to the Club and was in direct contravention of the
Popplewell report and the detailed procedures laid down for stewarding
in the Green Guide.
    2

#
            Popplewell and Paragraph 215 of the Green Guide make it
    abundantly clear that if there is perimeter fencing there must
    be immediate access to the pitch as a place of safety in the event
    of an emergency. This was completely ignored by the Club. Evidence
    was given to the Taylor Inquiry that the fire brigade had to be
    contacted for bolt cutters. The Club doctor said the likely period
    of survival in the crush was only four minutes. Those crushed
    died of traumatic asphyxia. They had no chance of escape. In
    this connection, I would particularly refer you to the sixth paragraph
    of my letter to the Director of Public Prosecutions dated the 18th
    May, a copy of which was enclosed with my last letter.

            For all these reasons I think it is your clear duty to
    prepare and submit a case to the Crown Prosecution Service of manslaughter
    against the DirectocS'of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and,
    if thought appropriate, against the Club itself - bearing in mind
    the recent P & 0 decision - in respect of the incident which occurred
    at Hillsborough Stadium on the 15th April 1989. Would you please
    let me have your decision in the light of this letter as soon as
    possible.

    Yours faithfully,




    R. Edey (Mr).

        Dear Mr Edey

        I refer to your letter of 6 July and previous correspondence in
        respect of criminal charges arising from the events at
        Hillsborough on 15 April 1989.

        You will be aware that the investigation is being conducted by
        Mr Geoffrey Dear, Chief Constable of West Midlands Police, and
        it is he and not the South Yorkshire Police who is in possession
        of the evidence arising from the investigation. Consequently
        any action along the lines you suggest must be initiated by his
        investigation.

        I have forwarded a copy of your correspondence to Mr Dear who
        will no doubt be writing to you in due course.

         Yours sincerely

          Dear Mr Edey

          I refer to your recent correspondence to the Chief Constable of South
          Yorkshire Police, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Right
          Honourable Lord Justice Taylor. The correspondence has been passed to
          me by Mr P Wright, Chief Constable, South Yorkshire Police.

          I am responsible, on behalf of Mr G Dear, Chief Constable of West
          Midlands Police, for the conduct of the investigation into the events at
          Hillsborough on 15 April 1989- My responsibilities are not only to
          service the needs of Lord Justice Taylor's Judicial Inquiry, but also to
          provide the necessary facts for the Coroner's Inquests into the 95 who
          died, which at this time are scheduled to commence early next year.
          Consequently the enquiries we are undertaking are most thorough. If,
          during the course of assembling the evidence, allegations of criminal
          offences arise then these will be dealt with via normal procedures.
          However, at this stage, there is still a lot to be done before we are in
          a position to consider the issues you raise.

          I am grateful for your letter and I have noted your concern.

          I have passed a copy of the letter to the Director of Public Prosecutions
          for his information.

          Yours sincerely

Dear Lord Justice Taylor/
     I enclose herewith a copy of a letter I have today written to
the Director of Public Prosecutions. I also enclose a copy of a letter
I have written to Mr. T. Mervyn Jones both of which are for your information.

     Yours sincerely/

Dear Mr. Mervyn Jones/

     I refer to your letter of the 2nd August and previous correspondence.
We did of course have a long discussion on the telephone following
your letter. I have today written to the Director of Public Prosecutions
and enclose a copy of my letter for your information.

     I do not agree with Lord Justice Taylor's finding that the police
were mainly responsible for the disaster. I have always believed
for the reasons stated in my letter that the football club were wholly
responsible for what occurred.

     It is interesting to note that Lord Justice Taylor's report does
not even support his finding. 74 deaths and 511 of the injuries would
have occurred regardless of the opening of Gate C as clearly stated
in Paragraphs 108 and 112 of the Report. Paragraph 202 shows there
were only 10124 people on the terraces/ only 24 above the maximum
o£ 10100! The disaster mainly occurred in pens 3 and 4 which were
getting uncomfortably full by 2.15 p.m. and crushing was occurring
long before Gate C was opened at 2.52 p.m.

     I am always driven back to my starting point that no deaths and
injuries would have occurred had immediate access from the perimeter
fencing to the pitch been available in an emergency. The club was
well aware that crushing could occur as it had in 1981. That it had
been greatly exacerbated through there being no control of the numbers
entering the pens being monitored to avoid overcrowding makes a manslaughter
charge against the club management of Sheffield Wednesday Football
Club unavoidable.
     Yours sincerely/

Dear Sir

Disaster at Hillsborough

I feel that I must pursue with you my contention that there is a prima
facie case of manslaughter against the Directors of Sheffield Wednesday
Football Club. In this connection I refer to my letter to you of the
18th May/ and your reply of the 3rd June.

I understand from Mr J Mervyn Jones that the correspondence I conducted with
the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire/ and the Right Honorable
Lord Justice Taylor has been passed to you by him for your information.
I do not know whether you have a copy of a letter written to me by Mr T Watson BA
Assistant Chief Constable of the South Yorkshire Police dated the 15th June
and so I enclose a copy. I also enclose a copy of Mr J Mervyn Jones letter
to me of the 2nd August.

The deaths and serious injuries which occurred in Hillsborough Stadium on
the 15th April must be laid at the door of the football club. They knew
that the Liverpool spectators could not be properly accotnnodated on the Lepping
Lane terraces. They knew that serious crushing of spectators had occurred
in 1981 and that there were broken arms, legs and ribs requiring hospital
treatment. They knew that on that occasion the gates had to be opened and
about 250 spectators used the pitch as a place for safety. They knew that
the police said after that incident that 10/100 was too high a figure for
safety on those terraces. The figure was not reduced.

The 1981 incident led to the terraces being sub-divided into pens. They
did nothing to ensure that those pens were properly monitored so that they
were not overfilled unsafely. They did nothing to ensure that there was
immediate access to the pitch as a place of safety in an emergency as laid
down by Paragraph 215 of the Government's Green Guide. In fact the gates
in the perimeter fencing were not designed as exits thereby ensuring that
in an emergency there was no means of escape. Having had previous warning
in a crushing incident that such access would be required in an emergency
such conduct is so grossly negligent it must be looked upon as criminal.
- 2 -



It was in fact the cause of the disaster. Had the perimeter fencing allowed
access to the pitch the pressure in pens 3 and 4 could have been relieved
and Gate C need not have been opened until a sufficient number of spectators
had gone on the pitch to enable the 2400 spectators outside the ground to
be assimilated on the terraces without death and injury resulting.
In any event Lord Justice Taylor finds in Paras 108 and 112 of his interim
report that only 21 of the dead and only 30% of those who were injured entered
through Gate C after it opened at 2.52 pm. In other words 74 of the deaths
and 511 of the injured would have been casualties regardless of the opening
of Gate C.
The reason I have felt it necessary to write to you again is because Mr. Mervyn
Jones forwarded my letter to Mr Wright of the 6th July and because Mr Justice
Taylor's interim report gives further reasons for manslaughter charges to
be preferred against the management of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.
I am also puzzled at the approach by the police to criminality for this disaster.

When Mr Watson wrote to me on the 15th June the West Midlands Police had
gathered together all the information put to Lord Justice Taylor's inquiry.
I was told then there was no evidence to suggest the offence of manslaughter
had been committed and accordingly no criminal charges had been brought.
In his letter of the 2nd August Mr J Mervyn Jones told me that the West Midlands
Police had to provide the necessary facts for the Coroners Inquests into
the deaths. This is referred to in Paragraph 15 of Lord Justice Taylor's
report. The final sentence reads: "I am assured by Chief Constable Dear
and Assistant Chief Constable Mervyn Jones that it is most unlikely any further
evidence gathered will significantly alter or add to the history of events
which emerged at the hearing".
Yet Mr J Mervyn Jones letter to me went on:- "If during the course of assembling
the evidence (i.e. for the Coroners inquests) "allegations of criminal offences
arise then these will be dealt with via normal procedures". If Mr Justice
Taylor was told that it was unlikely that there will be any further significant
evidence forthcoming these comments are difficult to understand. It would
seem to suggest that the police had made up their mind not to lay charges
despite what was said in the letter to me.
What particularly exercises my mind in all this is that there is abundant
evidence of reckless disregard of life and limb by Sheffield Wednesday Football
Club not for the first time and in exactly parallel circumstances which clearly
establishes a prima facie case of manslaughter. The police should have acted
and not concerned themselves with the Coroner's inquests.Unless it is an
act of God violent death must be looked upon as criminal, in the first instance.
This has not been happening as evidenced by the Herald of Free Enterprise
disaster where it took an unlawful killing verdict by an inquest jury and
a further two years deliberation to decide that a ship going to sea with
its doors open constituted a criminal offence!
I agree it is important to be able to establish a case to put before judge
and jury which has a reasonable chance of success. One can be too hasty.
I believe the arrest of the captain and first mate in the recent incident
on the River Thames to be a case in point. I read that Scotland Yard sent
a report on this incident to you for determination within two weeks of the
disaster! I do not believe that tragedy was any more than a problem of navigation
which is by no means criminal. There may of course have been a look out
problem.
#
^ O n the other hand I have little doubt that the ignition of a pile of rubbish
   under a wooden stand at a football ground which went up like a tinder box
   with the loss of 56 lives amounts to manslaughter and that the Directors
   of Bradford City Football Club were extremely fortunate in 1986 not to be
   charged.

    I enclose a copy of a letter I have written to Mr J Mervyn Jones for your
    information.

    Yours sincerely.

         Thank you for your letter of 14th September 1990 addressed to
         the Director of Public Prosecutions about the Hillsborough
         Football Stadium disaster and the decision not to institute
         any criminal proceedings. The letter has been passed to me
         for reply.
          The possibility of criminal proceedings being instituted was
          given the most careful consideration. The same evidential
          criterion was applied in this case as is applied in all cases
          considered by the Crown Prosecution Service. This criterion,
          set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors, iswhether or not
          there is a realistic prospect of a convictionbased on the
          available evidence.
          The case was thoroughly investigated by the West Midlands
          Police. The investigation produced extensive evidence; and in
          addition, all the evidence and documentation received by Lord
          Justice Taylor's Public Enquiry was made available to the
          Crown Prosecution Service. The combined and individual merits
          of each of the points which you mention in your letter     wasthe
          subject of detailed assessment. After a very     full and
          thorough scrutiny of all this material, the Director concluded
          that the evidence was not sufficient for there to be a
          realistic prospect of convicting any person or corporate body
          of any criminal offence. In reaching this conclusion the
          Director had the benefit of the advice of two experienced
          Leading Counsel.

JUDICIAL REVIEW

Some of you will be aware that an application for judicial
review of a CPS decision to prosecute is currently awaiting
hearing before the Divisional Court. The applicant is a
juvenile by the name of Glynn Lines.
The applicant is contending that the CPS should either have ^
marked the file suitable for a caution or "no further action
rather than prosecution.
It has recently (and belatedly) come to Headquarters attention
that leave has been granted in a second case (R v Begum) to
apply for judicial review on similar grounds. This has
complicated an already difficult situation at a time when it
is vital that the Service adopts a consistent approach in
seeking to rebut the arguments put forward by the applicants.
Both matters have been consolidated by the Crown Office and
are being handled by Policy and Communications Group.
 Recipients are reminded of the need for all applications for
 judicial review to be notified to Policy and Communications
 Group in accordance with paragraph 0.5.2 of the Practice and
 Procedure Manual. This notification must be given at an early
 stage.
 CCPs should be aware of the possibility of further
 applications of this nature once it becomes known that leave
 is being granted for review. CCPs should personally notify
 Roger Daw (071 222 7944 x203) Policy and Communications Group,
 immediately upon receipt of any such applications.

                              R v LINES



  CONSULTATION WITH ANDREW COLLINS QC, 4/5 GRAYS INN SQUARE



                       18th September 1990



            In attendance: RK Daw and Alison Saunders




Counsel recognised immediately that the importance of this case
went way beyond what happened to LINES as the application for
judicial   review   tackled    the       independent    exercise    of   the
discretion which the CPS has with regard to the public interest.
As a preliminary point,       Counsel considered that he did not
believe that the court would uphold the application in LINES as
the decision taken by the CPS in Kent was wholly tenable.


Counsel went on to make the following points


     1.    Whilst he was prepared to argue the point, he did not
     think the court would accept that the CPS had an unfettered
     right in the prosecutorial decision making process.                  ne
     cases of Blackburn and more recently ex p Percival offered
     dicta to the effect that the courts do have a power to
     review a decision of the DPP in cases where a decision not
     to prosecute may have been taken on perverse or corrupt
     grounds.    Indeed, unless the courts had that power, there
     would not be any external check upon the decision not to


                                     1
prosecute.


2.   Counsel distinguished, however, the present case where
the challenge was to a decision to prosecute.          Counsel
considered that the court may be persuaded that it did not
have jurisdiction in cases where the prosecuting authority
was simply exercising its discretion in favour of putting
the matter    before the courts.      It   is clear that    the
cautioning guidelines do not carry the weight of law and
that the discretionary power vested in Crown Prosecutors in
the Code for Crown Prosecutors was sufficiently wide so as
to allow for cases such as LINES to go before the courts.


3.   Counsel also made the point that if the court accepted
jurisdiction it could lead to prosecutors "looking over
their   shoulders"   for   the   subsequent   application   for
judicial review of their decision which he doubted would be

acceptable.


4.   He indicated that the court might well be slow to deny
itself jurisdiction on the basis that it did not            like
simply to surrender the exercise of a discretion to another
body without retaining any means for review.


5.   This, coupled with the acceptance of the fact that the
decision not to prosecute may well be reviewable,            led
Counsel to the view that the best we should seek to obtain
is a ruling from the court that it had jurisdiction to


                            2
\
eti^ertain    an
                        .
                    application       for
                                             . . .
                                             judicial
                                                             .
                                                          review   of   the
decision     to     prosecute     but       could   not    envisage     any
circumstances where it would be proper to go behind that
decision.


6.   Counsel also said that the court would have in mind
that there are other prosecutors besides the CPS and it
would be loathe to deny itself jurisdiction in those cases.


7.   The upshot on jurisdiction therefore was that Counsel
would seek to persuade the court that it did not have
jurisdiction to judicially review any decision of the CPS
but that the court was likely to reject such a submission
in general terms because of the authorities re the decision
not to prosecute.        There was a possibility that the court
might be persuaded that it did not have jurisdiction in
cases where the decision was to prosecute but that more
likely the court would conclude that technically it had
jurisdiction in such cases but that there would hardly ever
be in circumstances where it could be right to review such
a decision.        Counsel also placed weight upon the fact that
to review a decision to prosecute could be seen as taking
something away from the trial court.


8.   Counsel also discussed whether or not any argument
could be run on the basis               that    the   courts   could    not
interfere with the exercise of the public interest since in
this case, as put in the papers, the applicant must accept


                                  3
#
    that there is sufficient evidence for the matter to proceed
    either to court or for a caution to                be administered.
    Counsel made the point that whilst the court traditionally
    did not have any say on the exercise of the public interest
    except by way of comment at the end of the trial and by way
    of the actual sentenced imposed,           there were cases with
    regard to abuse of process in which the courts clearly have
    considered the public interest.            In such cases, usually
    occasioned by delay, the court does have power to stay
    proceedings on a ground akin to the staleness ground in the
    Code.      This has to be seen as the exercise of a public
    interest criterion being used by the courts to prevent
    proceedings and it is therefore dangerous to argue that the
    courts did not have any say over the exercise of the public
    interest.     Counsel took the point that it may be possible
    to isolate that particular strain of public interest cases
    and argue that there are no other public interest grounds
    which the court can invoke to prevent prosecution.


    9.   Counsel also made the point that the court may not be
    happy to accept the fact that the public interest could not
    be exercised independently of the courts by all                Crown
    Prosecutors.      Whilst it might be possible to argue that the
    AG   and    the   DPP   had   the   sole   right   to   exercise   the
    discretion re the public interest in pursuance of the fact
    that the former was its guardian, the courts were unlikely
    to permit the exercise of that same discretion by 1600
    lawyers all acting in the DPP's name.


                                    4
1(1.   Counsel also made the point that in his view policy
issues were a matter for the CPS as was the manner of its
application; this argument could also be run to persuade
the court that it did not have jurisdiction.


11.    Counsel    indicated that any       argument    based on   the
"floodgates" approach was going to be unpopular with the
courts.    The arguments used in Percival were defeated by
the court which indicated the pivotal role to be played by
the single judge in preventing spurious cases from delaying
the process.           Counsel    said that he    could   distinguish
Percival on the grounds that the prosecuting authority was
different but he did not hold out too much hope of success.


12. Counsel agreed that there was no argument mountable on
the basis that the applicant did not have a locus standi to
seek judicial review.


13. As to the merits of the case, Counsel took the view
that the decision arrived at was tenable as the case was a
nasty one of assault.        There had been two blows to the head
and a kick on the ground in the course of an unprovoked
assault.         The   injuries    sustained   were   serious   though
clearly not as serious as first thought.


14. Counsel recognised that the initial decision of the
prosecutor to continue with the charge levelled by the
police might be open to some comment.            It is clear that the


                                   5
prosecutor was not in possession of the JOLT report at that
stage and it could therefore be said that he was not in
possession of all the information required in order for a
proper decision to be taken at that time.                      However, that
was   corrected when          the prosecutor         spoke     to the    Chief
Inspector       (Prosecutions)    when the           content    of the JOLT
report    was     then   known.        Furthermore,          the    prosecutor
concerned spoke to the juvenile specialist and the Branch
Crown    Prosecutor      in    Kent    both    of     whom     supported    the
decision taken.          Moreover, the fact that the charge was
reduced   from GBH        to ABH was          evidence       that   a   careful
analysis of the case had been undertaken in the light of
all the available information.                  As    far as Counsel was
concerned the decision was the right one even in the light
of the cautioning guidelines.             There was therefore little
prospect of the applicant obtaining an order for certiori
to quash the decision to prosecute and mandamus to instruct
the CPS to advise a caution.             Counsel concluded by saying
that in his view it was not remotely arguable that the
discretion to prosecute was exercised wrongly.


15. As to the way forward, Counsel took the view that there
was little point in returning to the single judge.                       First,
Judges were loathe to reverse a decision of one of their
colleagues and secondly if the point is remotely arguable
it will have to go before the full court.                    Given also that
a delay would be introduced if the CPS were to apply in
this fashion, Counsel took the view that it was better to


                                   6
argue directly before the full court.


16. He advised the CPS to seek an expedited hearing even at
the expense of not appearing in front of a three man court.
It was wise to ask the Crown Office for both but to make it
clear that if it was one or the other, expedition was to be
preferred.


17. The arguments re jurisdiction should be argued as a
preliminary point and Counsel's estimate on time was about
one day.


18.   Counsel was also slightly concerned as to why the
police had been joined in the proceedings.                  Whilst he
accepted     that      the   initial    decision   was   theirs,    that
decision was clearly subsumed by the CPS's decision to
continue the prosecution.
NB. RKD thought that the applicant might have joined the
police to obtain an order for mandamus to caution, but of
course     in    the   light   of   a   successful    application    for
certiori,       such an order would not be necessary and the
applicant may be acting under a misapprehension that it is
in his interest to order a caution as opposed to NFA.


19. Counsel considered that affidavits area required from
the   Branch     Crown Prosecutor        in Kent     and the   juvenile
specialist, simply confirming the way in which the decision
was reached.        These should be short and Counsel is to draft
them.    At this stage an affidavit from the DPP re the wider
issues was not necessary.


20. The subject of PII was addressed in the context of the
letter from the Solicitor to the Chief Constable of Kent.
The police wish to exhibit the JOLT reports and the Crime
report.       Counsel      was   firmly   of   the    view    that   these
documents are covered by PII and therefore it is not open
to    the   parties   to    produce   them     in    this    way.    These
documents are akin to the police report.                If necessary in
due course the DPP might have to produce a certificate
claiming PII but this was not required at this stage.
Since the decision of JOLT was common knowledge there was
no need to hide it under the cloak of PII but clearly the
way in which that recommendation was arrived at should

remain under PII.


21. Counsel added the supplementary point that since the
JOLT report was covered by PII, this may offer another
reason why the court should not review our decision as they
may not be able to see it.


22.     Counsel indicated that if the court found for the
applicant, it should be invited to certify a point for the

House of Lords.

Dear Mr. Green,
                   Re: THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER.

       The Directors of the Club and/or Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
knew, or should have known, the following when the disaster occurred at
their ground on the lSbh April, 1989 ,
1.     That despite the 1981 incident and the overcrowding of the
       Lefpings Lane terraces in 1987 and 1988 nothing had been
       done to ensure immediate access to thepitch in an emergency
       contrary to Paragraph 215 of the Government's Green Guide
       and Recommendation 35 of ^r* Justice Popplewe11‘s Final Report
       following the Bradford fire.
2.     That at an P.A. Gup semi-final at Hillsborough in 1981 there was
       crushing at the Leppings Lame terraces; that 250 spectators had
       to go on to the pitch to escape the crush, and that there were .
       38 casualties which included broken legs, anas and ribs. (Baras
       123 and 124 of Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report (hereinafter referred
       to as "'HR".)
3      That Liverpool Football Club maintained that their supporters could
        not be safely accommodated on the Leppings Lane terraces. (Para.36
        of TIR.)
k.     That the pens were uncomfortably over crowded at Gup semi-finals
       in 1987 and 1988 . (Para 215 of TIR)
5.     That the police were only prepared to police the match with
       Liverpool supporters being allocated the Leppings Lane terraces.
       (Para. 21 of TIB.)
6.     That the decision to hold the match at Hillsborough was their own.
       (Para. 21 of TIB.)
7.     That that decision meant that less than Z % of Liverpool's average
       gate could be accommodated. (Para. 36 of TIR and evidence given to
       Lord Justice Taylor.
8.     That there were only 7 turnstiles to admit 10,100 to the terraces.
       At the ffeniston*. Road end there were 60 turnstiles to serve
       29,800 spectators. (Paras. 39 and 187 of TIR.)

9.     That no reduction had been made in the 10,100 capacity as recommended
       by the Police after the 1981 incident. (Paras. 124 and 1^9 of TIB.)

                                                                                     Contd. oifer
A.D. Green Esq., QC
Director of Public Prosecutions.                      1 4 .9 .1 9 9 0 .




10.    That no account was taken of the sub division of the terraces
       by way of amendment of the Safety Certificate. (Para. 121 of TIR.)
11.    That there was no monitoring of the numbers entering the individual
       pens. (ParasS. 134 and 135 of TIR.)
12.    That there was no stewarding of the terraces contrary to Para. 195
       of the Government's Green Guide. (Para. 167 of TIR.)
13.    That a number of deaths were caused by the collapse of a crush
       barrier corroded with rust. (Para. 237 and 240 of TIR.)
       In my opinion the above constitutes a formidable prima fteie case
of gross negligence amounting to manslaughter to go before judge and jury
for determination. It is my contention that your decision not to prosecute
for the 95 deaths involved or any of them is perverse and against the weight
of evidence.
       I feel sure you should reconsider your decision in the light of this
letter. Unless you advise me within the next seven days you will do so and
let me have your reconsidered decision, I hereby give you notice that I
intend to take the matter to the High Court and to seek judicial review of
your decision not to prosecute in this matter.
       Could I please hear from you as soon as possible.
                   lours sincerely,


                    ROY EDEI.

                    R V DPP EX PARTE EDEY (HILLSBOROUGH)

     The renewed application of Roy Edey before the Divisional Court
     (Watkins LJ and Otton J) was heard yesterday. Mr Edey appeared
     in person and the Director was represented by Andrew Collins QC.
     Mr Edey's arguments were not convincing. He relied heavily on
     the fact that previous accidents had occurred at the football
     stadium and sought to draw the inference that the Directors of
     Sheffield Wednesday ought therefore to have improved the safety
     measures at the ground before the Hillsborough disaster.
     Despite the best efforts of the Deputy Chief Justice, the
     applicant did not approach the hearing on the basis that the
     Director had failed to review the evidence properly or at all.
     After a brief response from Mr Collins, the Court refused the
     application to move for Judicial Review.
     Mr Collins applied for costs. Watkins LJ rejected the approach
     adopted by Nolan J in the Marchioness application who had said
     that it was the "invariable practice" of the court not to award
     costs to the putative respondent in these circumstances. Watkins
     LJ ruled that each case was to be considered on its merits and
     that there was no reason why the Crown in such applications
     should not be awarded costs.     In this instance, however, the
     court refused the application.
     Private Office has informed our Press Office and LSLO of this
     ruling.

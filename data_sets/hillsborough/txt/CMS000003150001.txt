       DEALING WTIH DISASTER: HOME OFFICE GUIDANCE

       Thank you for your note of 11 November. I am sorry not to have replied before now to
       your letter of 30 August, particularly since all I need do is confirm that nothing has been
       included in the document about which we would have reservations - evidence of the great
       effort made to ensure that all the Home Office Divisions agreed with you before the wider
       consultation process was started.

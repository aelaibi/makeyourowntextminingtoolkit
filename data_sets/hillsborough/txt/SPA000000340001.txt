POLICE (DISCIPLINE! (SENIOR OFFICERS! REGULATIONS 1985

Report of the Clerk and Financial Officer

1      Matter for Consideration
1.1    A further complaint from Mr Trevor Hicks against Assistant Chief
        Constable, Mr Walter Jackson, arising from the Hillsborough disaster. The
        complaint is one of collusion with Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and a
        copy of Mr Hicks’ statement making the complaint is attached.
2      Background Information
2.1    The Police Authority, at its meeting on 29 September considered a
       complaint from Mr Hicks against Assistant Chief Constable Jackson in which
       it was alleged Mr Jackson failed to take control of the disaster.
2.2    This complaint was recorded under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act and
        is currently being investigated by West Midlands Police under the
        supervision of the Police Complaints Authority.
3      Legal Position
3.1    Section 86 (1) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act requires the Police
        Authority to record complaints against senior officers and an Assistant
        Chief Constable is such an officer.
3.2        Section 82 (2) of the Act empowers the Police Authority to deal with the
           matter according to their discretion, if satisfied that the conduct
           complained of, even if proved, would not justify a criminal or
           disciplinary charge. In any other case the Authority must appoint an
           officer (of at least the rank of the officer complained about) to
           investigate the complaint.
3.3        Where it is decided to investigate a complaint consideration must be given
           to whether it is necessary or desirable to bring the case to the attention
           of the Police Complaints Authority, and in this respect, members are
           reminded that by virtue of Section 105 of the Police and Criminal Evidence
           Act, the Authority is required to have regard to Home Office guidance on
           police complaints and discipline procedures. This guidance indicates that
           in deciding to invite the Complaints Authority to consider the supervision
           of an investigation, Police Authorities will wish to have regard to the
           role of that Authority as providing a public demonstration that the
           investigation has been properly conducted. The guidance goes on to say it
           may be particularly important to provide that kind of public reassurance
           involving very senior officers of a police force.
4      Recommendation
           1 That the complaint be investigated.
                                      -2-



         That the complaint be referred to the Police Complaints Authority to
         supervise the investigation.
         That the Chief Constable of West Midlands be appointed to investigate
         the complaint, subject to the approval of the Police Complaints
         Authority.

In making this     complaint against C / S u p e r i ntencient DUCKENFIELD a

 personally have no haro evidence at this time I wis.i this matter                to i*e

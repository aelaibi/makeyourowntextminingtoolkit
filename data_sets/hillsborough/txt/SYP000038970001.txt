 This report is submitted in the normal and accepted

 complaint format.       However, some explanation is

 required to assist the reader in identifying where to

 find certain statements and documents.




 In the margin of the repbrt it will be seen that

 Document numbers, Statement pages, Appendices and on

 occasions Lord Justice Taylor’s interim and final

 report are referred to as well as to extracts from the

 transcripts of his Public Inquiry.




Where a document number or statement is prefixed with a

 part number this can be found within the seven volumes

 (parts) of evidence submitted to the Director of Public

Prosecutions.




eg:        PART IV            or          PART IV

           Document No 6                  Statement

           Pages 44-52                    Pages 2331-2356




If a document number or statement is not prefixed with

a part number that particular item can be found within

this file.




Where reference is made to a video then each VHS tape

has been given a separate, Part III, document number.

Not only that but within the same Part III is a written

description/schedule of what the video contains.        For

example;
                                                          4
                    Part III (Documents)

                    (Video)

                    Pages 757




 identifies the VHS tape number as 115 and the schedule

 page in the documents where the description can be

found.




A similar system is used to identify photographs which

also feature in Part III.     For example;




                   Part III (Documents)

                   Document No 150

                   Photo No 14




This easily identifies that this photograph can be

found in the Album marked Document Number 150 and

within each album the photographs are numbered

consecutively.

 CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING COMPLAINTS



R1     On 15 April 1989 a Football Association Cup Semi

 Final match was played between Liverpool and Nottingham

 Forest Football Clubs at the neutral Sheffield

Wednesday ground at Hillsborough.   It is well

documented that shortly after ’kick-off’ the match was

abandoned due to crushing in pens 3 and 4 of the

Leppings Lane/West Stand terraces, which resulted in

the death of 95 Liverpool Supporters and injuries to

many others.




R2    As a result of the tragedy Mr 6 J DEAR, QPM,

Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police was

appointed to investigate the disaster and to collate

evidence for H M Coroner and for a Judicial Inquiry

which was carried out by Lord Justice TAYLOR.     On 27

September 1989 following submission of the TAYLOR

Interim Report into the disaster to the Director of

Public Prosecutions Mr DEAR agreed to accept additional

responsibility for the criminal and disciplinary

aspects of the investigation.   On 1 April 1990, with

the retirement of Mr DEAR, these responsibilities were

transferred to Mr L SHARP, QPM, LLB, Chief Constable of

Cumbria.




R3    Because the deaths and injuries occurred at the

Leppings Lane end of Hillsborough Stadium, this report

concentrates on the Liverpool supporters and the events

which surrounded them on the day of the disaster.
«

    Part IV               R4      Because of the Liverpool Football Club’s success

    Documents 183 & 184   Over a long period of time it has a large following by

    Statement Pages       fans.    Their behaviour is well documented by police.

    1152-1154             Among other details, a tendency to arrive late and

                          without tickets is noted.




    Part IV               R5      Police Sergeant George CHARLESWORTH collated the

    Statement Paces       pre-match intelligence by liaising with both Merseyside

    1145-1151             Police and Nottinghamshire Constabulary and presented

                          the information in report form at the pre-match

                          briefing.




    Part IV               R6      Once Hillsborough had been selected as the venue

    Document 185          for the semi-final in 1989, an undated letter was

    Page 929              circulated by Walter JACKSON, Assistant Chief Constable

                          (Operations), South Yorkshire Police, in which he

                          details recommended routes to Sheffield, parking

                          arrangements, search procedures and opening times for

                          the ground.    The letter asked supporters to arrive

                          between 1030 hours and 1400 hours to ensure they were

                          in the ground for the start of the match at 1500 hours,

                          and indicated that ticketless fans should not attend.




    Part IV               R7      The Liverpool Football Club’s programme for the

    Document 186          home game at Anfield on 8 April 1989 contained an

    Pages 930-931         article in the same vein and this was repeated in media

                          broadcasts and publications, both locally and

                          nationally.




                                                                                     7
                     R8    Some 102 coaches containing Liverpool supporters

                     travelled to Sheffield on 15 April 1989.     Most of these

                     were accompanied by a Liverpool steward and either

Part IV              they, or the drivers were advised prior to departure

Statement Pages      about the arrangements in South Yorkshire.     Additional

1155-1161            arrangements were made by Merseyside Police.




                     R9    The largest proportion of supporters travelled in

                     private or hire cars, vans and mini-buses.     It is

                     impossible to quantify these vehicles numerically but

                     there were no significant traffic delays to cause late

                     arrival of fans in Sheffield.     This matter is

Part IV              considered again later in this report.     A detailed

Documents 187-188    report from British Transport Police confirms that one

Pages 932-938        special train and three service trains from Liverpool

      939-962        conveyed 825 supporters to Sheffield, and other trains

                     from other areas brought the total to 1,337.




                    RIO    By comparison, 1,932 Nottingham Forest supporters

                    travelled by a combination of special and service

                    trains to attend the match.      The conclusion was that

                    the supporters were happy and good natured with few

                    signs of intoxication.

Part IV

Statement Pages     Rll   There is evidence of Liverpool and other

1208-1211           supporters procuring and consuming alcohol en route        to

1212-1214           the game.
                  R12   Despite the entreaties for fans to arrive early

                  (previously referred to) some of the gates into

Part IV           Hillsborough Stadium were not opened until 1130hours

Statement Pages   and some even later than that.   Fans were already in

1241-1243         Sheffield and drinking alcohol by 0845 hours.




Part IV           R13   There are many descriptions of the behaviour of

Statement Pages   supporters in various parts of Sheffield but

1237-1240         predominantly in the area within two miles or so from

1246-1247         the ground between 0845 hours and 1500 hours.      They

Statement Pages   present a picture of drinking, boisterous and rowdy

1293-1294         behaviour, some drunkeness and urinating in public and

Statement Pages   secluded places.    But not all of the statements are

1244-1245         critical, some praise the behaviour of Liverpool

Statement Pages   supporters.    At one location seven dustbin liners were

1295-1298         collected full of cans, bottles and other alcoholic

                  drink containers, and that was on one garage

                  forecourt.    One public house sold out of beer.




                  R14   As part of the policing arrangements on 15 April

                  1989 many of the public houses within one mile radius

                  of the stadium were closed for the sale of alcohol.

                  Those licensed premises which did open instigated

                  various controls on the door but the further away from

                  the stadium the premises are situated, the more

                  attractive they were to supporters wishing to drink.

                  The further away from the stadium the premises are

                  situated, the more likely was a late arrival at the
                  stadium.   This may have put more customer pressure on

Part IV           other retail outlets where alcohol Is sold and police

Statement Pages   control is more difficult.    Most of the supermarkets

1291-1292         and off-licenses did open and they sold a considerable

1325-1329         amount of drink on the day.     Public houses and

1330-1334         off-sales describe the significant increases in

                  their takings on 15 April 1989.     The pattern of this

                  evidence is that whilst sales increased considerably,

                  in general the behaviour of the supporters was good

                  although there were incidents of very bad behaviour.




                  R15   This bad behaviour was perhaps naturally more

                  acute nearest to the stadium.     People living near to

                  any football stadium are well accustomed, some would

                  say long-suffering, to the disruption which occurs in

                  their neighbourhood when a football match takes place.

                  By reason of their experience the local residents

                  develop the ability to identify those teams whose

                  supporters cause them the most trouble.    Given the

                  dangers of bias, prejudice and stereotyping, as a

                  result some supporters are attributed with a group

                  reputation, but the local residents are in a position

                  to compare and balance the behaviour of various

                  supporters week by week, and even year by year.




                  R16   On the day in question a picture emerges of cars

                  being parked early, those roads nearest to the stadium

Part IV           at the Leppings Lane end (the Liverpool end) being full

Statement Pages   of parked cars by 1100 hours.    A considerable amount of
1345-1349         alcohol was seen being carried and consumed.    Fans were

1353-1358         seen walking towards the stadium with little or no

1359-1364         chance of being there for the start of the game.      There

1429-1432         is some evidence that on 15 April 1989 at the Leppings

                  Lane turnstiles the behaviour of the fans was the worst

                  ever seen.   Through the eyes of the local residents the

                  Liverpool supporters were generally more badly behaved

                  in 1989 than they were on the occasion of the

                  semi-final in 1988; the bad behaviour was influenced by

                  alcohol; and too many fans arrived late.




                  R17   But from the evidence of witnesses it is not at

                  all clear that the only cause for the fans late arrival

                  at the Leppings Lane turnstiles was drink-related.     The

                  day of the match was warm and sunny with a temperature

                  of 12 degrees Celsius or 53.6 degrees Fahrenheit.     Many

                  of the supporters attending the match were intent upon

                  enjoying a traditional pre match drink.    In some cases

                  the alcohol led to rowdy, boisterous or disorderly

                  behaviour, in others it led to a reluctance to leave

Part IV           licensed premises until the last minute.   However,

Statement Pages   although traffic volume was heavy on all approach

1208-1211         routes and traffic delays were not a serious problem.

1212-1214         some traffic hold-ups did occur to cause late arrival

1415-1423         at the ground.   The police search operation inevitably

1424-1428         caused some delay to some supporters, for example the

                  search of one private mini-bus took twenty minutes to

                  complete, the occupants arriving at the ground at 1455
                         hours.     On balance it is likely that one cause of late

                         arrivals at the Leppings Lane turnstiles was

Part III                 drink-related.    The build-up started at about 1420

Document 109             hours and continued until Gate C was opened at 1452

Schedule Pages 740-741   hours.




                         R18      The evidence suggests that very many of the fans

                         who arrived at the ground after 1430 hours, had been

                         drinking at public houses or from containers brought

                         from home or bought from off-licenses and other retail

                         outlets.    But there is little evidence of arrestable

                         drunkenness and there is no evidence of wide-scale

                         prosecutable drunkenness.     There was certainly an

                         element in the crowd outside the Leppings Lane

                         turnstile who were the worse for drink but the evidence

                         suggests that element was in a minority.     That element

                         contained young people influenced by drink who were

                         pushing shoving and weaving about among the crowd

                         either through impatience or bravado and there seems

                         little doubt that those arriving at Leppings Lane at a

                         time nearest to the kick-off had drunk the most and

                         were the worst behaved.     This "late arrival element"

                         would have been most likely to be among those who

Part IV                  entered the ground through Gate C at 1452 hours and

Document 191             made their way to the back of pens 3 and 4.     Of the

Pages 991-997            95 who died in pens 3 and 4 it can be shown that 23

Statement Pages          entered through Gate C after 1452 hours and of these

2433-2456                some had significantly high blood/alcohol levels, but

Document 1               to deduce more than that from the evidence available

Page 1                   would be no more than speculation.
                                                                                   19
                  R19      A not unrelated difficulty was caused by fans

                  arriving without tickets despite the all-ticket nature

                  of the match and the entreaties previously mentioned.



Part IV           R20      Evidence from the supporters themselves suggests

Document 183      that a considerable number of people travelled without

Pages 910-922     tickets in the hope of purchasing them at or near to

Part II           the stadium.     The police evidence suggests large

Statement Pages   numbers of ticketless fans.     An estimate calculated

1152-1154         from the statements suggests something in the region of

Part IV           2.000 fans arriving at Hillsborough without

Document 184      tickets.

Pages 923-928

Part IV           R21      From the turnstile count print-out it is possible

Document 189      to calculate the number of fans outside Leppings Lane

Pages 963-986     turnstiles just before the opening of Gate C at 1452

                  hours.     The estimate is 3,264 still waiting to enter

                  the ground.     Add to that the estimated 2,000 non-ticket

                  holders and there is a potential crowd of 5,246 still

                  to come into the stadium just before the opening of

                  Gate C.




                  R22      The calculation as to the number of ticketless

                  fans who entered the stadium at the Leppings Lane end

                  is open to dispute.    There is a considerable amount of

                  evidence which suggests that there were frequent

                  requests and negotiations for tickets during the time

                  that the crowd build up outside Leppings Lane

                  turnstile.    The police officers intervened on many
occasions in the interests of preventing obstruction

and to detect forged tickets.   Many of the supporters

moved on in this fashion, returned, predominantly to

the bridge area over the River Don.     From the CCTV

video evidence there was a large number of fans

loitering in the area outside of Gate C making no

attempt to enter though the turnstiles.     That may have

been because they were waiting for the crush to clear

before presenting their tickets at the turnstile, but

it may have been the case that they had no tickets to

present and were waiting the opportunity to buy a

ticket or enter the ground "illegally."




R23   It has been suggested that as the kick off time

approached, the West Terraces and the North Stand still

had many spaces in pens 1 and 2, 6 and 7 and the North

Stand seats, the Liverpool supporters accommodation.

Because the match was "all-ticket" and a "sell out"

these spaces must indicate that there were many ticket

holders still to come into the stadium and that would

account for the large crowd still outside the Leppings

Lane turnstiles.   If those spaces had been filled by

about 1420 hours it would have indicated that the large

crowd outside the turnstiles had no tickets, but these

spaces were still empty at that time.




R24   In an attempt to resolve the matter account has

been taken of the Club’s electronic monitoring system.

This shows that a total of 7,038 people passed through
                  turnstiles A-G, the entrance to the West Terraces.

                  However, the counting mechanism on turnstile G was

                  defective.     The Health and Safety Executive from a

                  study of the CCTV film which portrays turnstiles A-G

                  and Gate C, estimated that as many as 7,644 people

                  entered through turnstiles A-G but that estimate is

                  based upon not only a "head-count" of the video film

                  but also a projection of figures from other

                  turnstiles.     Again using the video film, the Health and

                  Safety Executive estimated that as many as 2,480 people

                  entered the ground through exit Gate C.     The best

                  estimate available from the Health and Safety Executive

                  is that 10,124 people entered through turnstiles A-G

                  and Gate C.     However, this estimate does not take into

                  account those people with tickets for the West Terraces

                  who were allowed through turnstiles 1-16, and other

                  factors such as the opening of Gate A, which distort

                  the figures.     Bearing in mind that 10,100 tickets were

                  sold for the West Terraces, the evidence, such as it

                  is, does suggest that non-ticket holders entering the

                  West Terraces (the Liverpool end) could have been as

                  high as 2,000 or as low as 200.     It is impossible to be

                  more precise.

Statement Pages   (19 years - deceased) and Victoria Jane HICKS (15 years

2331-2356         - deceased) and attended the match with his wife

                   Jennifer HICKS and the two daughters.    Whilst he went

                   and stood in pens 1/2 and his wife went to a seat in

                   the North Stand, both girls went into pen 3.    Mr HICKS

                  makes two complaints which relate to Assistant Chief

                   Constable Mr JACKSON, concerning failure to control the

                   disaster and collusion with Chief Superintendent

                  DUCKENFIELD to tell lies in relation to the opening of

                   exit Gate C into the ground.




                  DETAILS OF COMPLAINTS




                  R27    The first complaint by Mr HICKS was made on 24

                  August 1989 in a formal statement to Mr Kenneth Philip

                  Douglas COOPER, Assistant Chief Constable,

                  Northamptonshire Constabulary, when he saw Mr HICKS in

                  relation to an earlier complaint against Chief

                  Superintendent David Godfrey DUCKENFIELD.     Mr COOPER

                  was appointed to investigate that complaint by

Document 2        letter dated   25 July 1989, under the supervision of

Page 2            Captain E N TAYLOR from the Police Complaints Authority

Document 3        who ratified   that appointment and informed Mr HICKS by

Page 3            letter dated   4 August 1989.   Details of the complaint

                  are as follows:-




                  a)    That you failed to take control of the disaster.
                 R28     Subsequent to this interview Mr COOPER received a

Document 4       letter dated 5 September 1989 from Captain TAYLOR

Page 4           informing him that the enquiry would be dealt with by

                 another force.    On 27 September following protracted

                 negotiations, responsibility for all criminal and

                 disciplinary aspects of the investigation into the

                 Hillsborough disaster, including the complaints by Mr

                 HICKS, were passed to Mr DEAR for enquiries by West

                 Midlands Police.




                 R29    Arising from that transfer of responsibility, Mr

                 HICKS was re-interviewed on 22 November 1989 by

                 Detective Superintendent TAYLOR with a view to

                 clarification of the complaint against Chief

                 Superintendent DUCKENFIELD.   He then made a second

                 complaint against Assistant Chief Constable Mr JACKSON

                as follows:-




                b)      That he may have colluded with Chief

                        Superintendent DUCKENFIELD to mislead the public

                        and senior police officers in respect of the

                        opening of Gate C in Leppings Lane.




Documents 5-6   R30     Correspondence relating to the acceptance of this

Pages 5-6       investigation by Mr DEAR and supervision of the

                investigation by Captain TAYLOR is included in the

                file.




                                                                            17
                  R31     These complaints raise allegations of both

                  criminal and disciplinary offences.    Files on the

                  criminal aspect of the investigation are already with

                  the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Police

                  Complaints Authority.    This report deals solely with

                  the disciplinary aspects.




                  DETAILS OF INVESTIGATION




                  R32     That he failed to take control of the disaster.



Part IV           R33     This complaint is made only by Mr HICKS and he

Statement Pages   explains it by a description of the events on the day

2331-2356         as seen through his eyes, and from a consideration of

                  the evidence heard by Lord Justice TAYLOR at the Public

                  Inquiry, which leads him to conclude that Mr JACKSON

                  neglected to discharge his duties relating to the

                  staging of the semi-final at Hillsborough on 15 April

                  1989.




                  R34     The disciplinary offence which has to be

                  considered iss-




                  Neglect of Duty.




                  Being a member of a police force without good and

                  sufficient cause neglected or omitted to attend to or

                  carry out with due promptitude and diligence anything

                  which it is his duty as a member of a police force to


                                                                            18
                  attend to or carry out, viz he failed to take control

                  of the disaster at Hillsborough stadium on 15 April

                  1989.




                  Contrary to the Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985

                  Schedule 1 Regulation 4(i) paragraph 4(a ).




                  R35     The evidence to support such a disciplinary

                  charge is the same as is currently being considered by

                  the Director of Public Prosecutions in respect of Mr

                  JACKSON’S culpability for Manslaughter or Culpable

                  Malfeasance.    The offence of Manslaughter requires

                  proof of a high level of gross negligence or

                  recklessness, but the offence of Culpable Malfeasance

                  requires proof only of neglect of a duty.      Should the

                  Director decide that there is insufficient evidence to

                  prosecute for those criminal offences then the same

                  must be said in respect of the disciplinary offence of

                  Neglect of Duty.




                  R36     In that case this complaint is unsubstantiated.



Part V            R37     That he may have colluded with Chief

Statement Pages   Superintendent DUCKENFIELD to mislead the public and

2457-2469         senior police officers in respect of the opening of

                  Gate C in Leppings Lane.

Part IV

Statement Pages   R38     This complaint is made only by Mr HICKS and he

2331-2356         explains it by saying that he doubts whether Mr JACKSON
was unaware that Gate C had been opened by police at

1452 hours because he can see no reason why Chief

Superintendent DUCKENFIELD would not have told him that

this had occurred.




R39   The disciplinary offence which has to be

considered is:-




Falsehood or Prevarication.




Being a member of a police force knowingly colluded

with Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD on 15 April 1989

to make a false, misleading or inaccurate oral

statement that Gate C at Hillsborough stadium had been

forced open by football supporters at 1452 hours on 15

April 1989, whereas the gate had in fact been opened on

the instructions of Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD.




Contrary to the Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985.

Schedule 1. Regulation 4(i). paragraph 5(a).




R40   Although the evidence to support this

disciplinary charge forms a part of the evidence

submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions to

consider the culpability of Mr JACKSON for the criminal

offences of Manslaughter or Culpable Malfeasance,

should the Director decide that there is insufficient

evidence to prosecute these criminal offences, it would

still be possible to prosecute the disciplinary charge

of Falsehood or Prevarication.
Part II           R41     On 15 April 1989, and before, Mr JACKSON was the

Statement Pages   Assistant Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police

860-869           with specific responsibilities for Operations,

                  including the policing of football matches at

Part V            Hillsborough.    He had produced the South Yorkshire

Document 192      Police Standing Instructions for the Policing of

Pages 998-1044    football Matches amended in the light of the Popplewell

                  recommendations, he gave final approval for the

Part V            Divisional Operation Orders for policing football

Document 194      matches at Hillsborough    and he was custodian of the

Pages 1128-1210   South Yorkshire Police Major Incident Plan and

Document 206      Operation Support Plan.    It was he that decided that

Pages 1352-1444   Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD, newly promoted, would

Document 205      be in operational charge of the policing of

Pages 1315-1351   Hillsborough Stadium and its environs, on 15 April

                  1989.




                  R42     On that date he was on duty and "on call" in the

                  sense that he was the nominated Chief Officer for the

                  force available to deal with any matter which required

                  the personal attention of a Chief Officer.     He was in

                  plain clothes and after some routine duties to satisfy

                  himself that the plan for policing the semi-final

                  football match was progressing satisfactorily he went

                  to the Police Control Box at Hillsborough and briefly

                  spoke to Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD.    The time

                  was shortly after 1400 hours and the only occurrence of

Part II           note at that time was his remark while in the Control

Statement Pages   Box that the Liverpool fans seemed to be slow in
                  entering the West Terraces at the Leppings Lane end by

                  comparison with the Nottingham Forest supporters in the

                  Spion K op.



Part II           R43     Mr JACKSON took his seat in the South Stand near

Statement Pages   to a point over the players’ tunnel and saw nothing

860-869           untoward until after the match had started and fans

                  were coming onto the perimeter track through the

                  perimeter fence at the front of the West Terraces.      The

                  match was still in progress and he left his seat

                  promptly and went to the Police Control Box, arriving

                  at about 1507 hours, the match having been stopped by

                  then.




                  R44     He was in the Control Box for a very short time,

Part V            just long enough to enquire of Chief Superintendent

Statement Pages   DUCKENFIELD as to what was happening.    The response was

2457-2469         inconclusive and seemed to suggest that some sort of

                  pitch invasion was occurring, so he went onto the pitch

                  to find out for himself.



Part V            R45     Here he spoke to Superintendent GREENWOOD and

Statement Pages   learned of the injuries and fatalities so he returned

2515-2526         to the Control Box to ensure that ambulances and

                  resources (Operation Support) had been sent for.



Part VII          R46     He acknowledges that at that moment he was in

Appendix C        overall command of the incident and began to imnlement

Page 1297         the Major Incident Plan.   At that time he was aware

                  that crushing had occurred due to overcrowding but was
                         unaware that Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD had

                         approved the opening of Gate C or any other gates.



Part II                  R47   At about 1515 hours he was present in the Police

Statement Pages          Control Box, which was extremely busy, when Mr Graham

819-829                  KELLY and Mr Glen KIRTON of the Football Association

Statement Pages 829A-J

Part I                   to Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

Statement Pages 36-59

Part II                  R48   They spoke to Mr JACKSON and to Chief

Statement Pages          Superintendent DUCKENFIELD and although he was engaged

860-869                  with other matters, Mr JACKSON believes that it was on

Part V                   this occasion that Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD

Statement Pages          told Mr KELLY that Liverpool supporters had forced open

2457-2469                C gate and had flooded into the ground.




                         R49   There is no evidence at all that Chief

                         Superintendent DUCKENFIELD told any of the visitors to

                         the Control Box that police had opened Gate C, or any

                         other gates, on his express approval.




                         R50   At 1530 hours Mr JACKSON was present in the Board

                         Room when Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD explained

                         his reasons for not wanting the decision to abandon the

                         match, to be made public knowledge.     Mr JACKSON

Part VII                 explains that when he entered the Boardroom he believed

Appendix C               that fans had broken down a gate and had forced entry

Page 1320                into the ground, he was not aware that Chief

                         Superintendent DUCKENFIELD had authorised the opening



                                                                                   23
                  of any exit gates; and that was still his belief when

                  he left the Boardroom.




                  R51   On return to the Police Control Box he continued

                  to implement the Major Incident Plan and at about 1545

                  hours, when the injured and dead were being safely

Part V            dealt with, he called his ground Commanders to him,

Statement Pages   including Superintendent MARSHALL.     While Mr JACKSON

2527-2547         was debriefing them, the then Chief Constable, Mr Peter

                  WRIGHT, made contact by telephone, to find out what had

                  been going on.     As Mr JACKSON was speaking to Mr

Part VII          WRIGHT, Superintendent MARSHALL explained how Gate C

Appendix C        had been opened at his request.     The time at that

Pages 1348-1349   moment was about 1615 hours although it could have been

                  as early as 1600 hours, and that was the first

                  occasion, so he claims, that Mr JACKSON was aware of

                  the true circumstances surrounding the opening of Gate

                  C at 1452 hours.




                  R52   Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD has refused to

                  answer any questions about this or any other matter,

                  but the following matters of evidence are significant.




                  R53   Mr MACKRELL was on the pitch as the Liverpool

Part I            team came out of the playing tunnel at 1454 hours.     At

Statement Pages   about that moment he was approached by Mr Douglas John

598-616           LOCK, the Club Security Officer, who told him that Gate

                  C had either been opened or broken down, it is not

                  certain which, and between 300 and 400 fans had got
                         into the ground through the gate.     Mr LOCK had learned

                         this from the Club Control Room where there is

                         a facility for monitoring the CCTV cameras.     It is

                         clear that this reference by Mr LOCK was in respect of

                         the opening of Gate C at 1448 hours to eject a

                         non-ticket holder and about 150 fans forced their way

                         into the ground, because at about 1450 hours Mr LOCK

Part V                   gave the same account to Inspector Trevor HARVEY.        But.

Statement PsRes          of course, that was unknown to Mr MACKRELL at that

3311A-J                  time.




Part I                  R54      Mr MACKRELL went to investigate, stonning to talk

Statement ..
           p.a&es        to one or two people about the arrangements for the

36-59                   game, and when he reached Gate C he found it slightly

                        open with a trickle of fans coming through it under the

                        control of a mounted officer.     By the time Mr MACKRELL

                        would have got to Gate C, he would be witnessing the

Part V                  tail-end of the otiening authorised by Chief

Statement Pages         Superintendent DUCKENFIELD at 1452 hours.      He would not

2457-2469               know that the opening of Gate C he was witnessing was

                        not the same opening reported to him by Mr LOCK.      If Mr

                        LOCK had referred to the breaking down of a gate, and

                        that is not clear, then the seeds were sown in Mr

                        MACKRELL’S mind that Gate C had been broken down.




Part I                  R55      This is important only because Mr MACKRELL was
Statement Pages 36-59
Part II                 present with Mr KELLY and Mr KIRTON when they visited
Statement Pages
819-829                 the Police Control Box at 1515 hours and were allegedly
829A-J
                        misinformed about the opening of Gate C.     It was Mr
                        MACKRELL who actually took Mr KELLY and Mr KIRTON to

                        the Police Control Box at about 1515 hours and despite

                        his own quick visit to the Control Box prior to that,

                        nothing had been said to change what Mr LOCK had told

                        him.   It is likely that it was that version of events

                        which Mr MACKRELL would have passed on to Mr KELLY on

                        their way to the Police Control Box.




Lord Justice Taylor’s   R56    In giving his unsworn testimony to Lord Justice

Public Inquiry          TAYLOR at the public inquiry. Mr KELLY was not sure

21 June 1989            whether he had spoken to Mr MACKRELL about the opening

Page 33-103             of the gates before he went to the Police Control Box

                        at about 1515 hours.




                        R57    Because Mr MACKRELL was engaged in conversation

                        in the Control Box he cannot help as to what Mr KELLY

Part II                 was told there, but Mr KELLY claims he was told by

Statement Pages         police, he believes by Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD

860-869                 that a gate or gates had been forced and he was

Lord Justice Taylor’s   referred by an officer to a picture being transmitted

Public Inquiry          on a TV monitor from a CCTV camera which was pointed at

21 June 1989            the Leppings Lane turnstiles and Gate C.   Whilst he is

Pages 33-103            sure that Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD and Mr

                        JACKSON were in the Police Control Box at that time,

                        and he remembers being told that when the gates were

                        forced there had been an influx of Liverpool

                        supporters, he cannot be sure Mr JACKSON heard what

                        transpired.
Part II                 R58   Mr KIRTON. who gave evidence to the Lord Justice

Statement Pages         TAYLOR Public Inquiry, remembers going with Mr KELLY

869A-J                  and Mr MACKRELL to the Police Control Box at about 1515

Lord Justice Taylor’s   hours, and speaking to Chief Superintendent

Public Inquiry          DUCKENFIELD.   He has no doubt that it was Mr

22 June 1989            DUCKENFIELD who told them that the cause of the

Pages 48-75             injuries had been the forcing of a gate and an inrush

                        of Liverpool supporters.     He remembers the reference to

                        a CCTV monitor which was showing live pictures of the

                        gate at that time.   He cannot remember Mr JACKSON in

                        the Control Box at that time and the major concern of

                        Messrs KELLY, KIRTON and MACKRELL at that time was

                        whether or not to abandon the game.



Part II                 R59   On leaving the Control Box, Mr KELLY called a

Statement Pages         meeting of interested parties including representatives

819-829                 of the three clubs, the referee, Chief Superintendent

Lord Justice TAYLOR’S   DUCKENFIELD and Mr JACKSON.

Public Inquiry

21 May 1989             R60   The meeting was held in the Boardroom at about

Pages 33-103            1530 hours and there is no evidence to suggest that

                        anything other than the question of abandoning the

                        match was discussed there.




                        R61   At 1640 hours Mr KELLY was interviewed live on

                        television and he spoke of two versions concerning the

                        cause of the overcrowding - the fans’ account that the

                        police had opened the gate, and the police assertion

                        that the Liverpool fans had forced their way in.
Lord Justice Tavlor’s   R62   At about 1915 hours a Press Conference was held

Interim Report          at Snig Hill when Chief Constable. Mr Peter WRIGHT,

Para 257                made it clear that a gate had been opened by police

                        because of a danger to life through crushing outside

                        the ground, and he also made reference to the forcing

                        of the iron perimeter gates outside Leppings Lane

                        turnstiles.

                        the service of notices was as a result of medical

                        JACKSON maintained his assertion that he was unaware of

                        the true nature of the opening of Gate G until

                        Superintendent MARSHALL explained it

available to show that there was any collusion between

Mr JACKSON and Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD in

respect of the opening of Gate C, or any other gate.

This complaint is, therefore, unsubstantiated.




ANTECEDENTS




R66   Walter JACKSON is 53 years of age having been

born on                 a married man

          and owner/occupier of his detached house at Q




R67   He joined Manchester City Police on 13 October

1961 after 3 years service in The Royal Air Force

Police serving in Kuala Lumpur, Malaya and Changi,

Singapore.




R68   He has performed duties throughout his career in

Manchester City Police and Salford Police on

amalgamation in 1968 and Greater Manchester in 1974

which has encompassed uniform patrol, detective duties

and in 1980 he was seconded to the Police Staff

College, Bramshill Directing Staff on the Intermediate

Command Course.




R69   He was promoted to the rank of Sergeant in

January 1968, Inspector in September 1971, Chief

Inspector in April 1974.   On promotion to



                                                          29
Superintendent in September 1976 he commanded the CID

in P Division, Rochdale, Greater Manchester Police and

January 1978 became Deputy Divisional Commander in B

Division (North Manchester).   On return from the

Directing Staff at the Police Staff College he took

command of D Division (South East Manchester) which

included Manchester International Airport and then in

September 1983 he was posted to E Division (South West

Manchester) where he commanded the area that included

Moss Side and Maine Road Football Ground.




R70   On 1 May 1985 he transferred to South Yorkshire

Police and was promoted to the rank of Assistant Chief

Constable being responsible for Operations and Traffic

and in July 1989 took charge of the Management Services

Department.




R71   He has no matters of a disciplinary nature

recorded against him and was commended in 1971 by a

Crown Court Judge for the manner in which he dealt with

serious crime investigations regarding robbery.




R72   He is the holder of the Police Long Service and

Good Conduct Medal and the Royal Air Force General

Service Medal (Malaya).
RECOMMENDATION




R73   One copy of this file is submitted to the Police

Complaints Authority for consideration as to the

sending of a statement to the South Yorkshire Police

Authority that this investigation has, or has not been

conducted to the satisfaction of the Police Complaints

Authority.   A copy of this report is enclosed for

onward transmission to the South Yorkshire Police

Authority with the Police Complaints Authority

statement.   This would be desirable because the

references in the margins of the report relate to

statements, documents and video exhibits which are

contained in the Main File already with the Director of

Public Prosecutions, and the Police Complaints

Authority, but which is not yet with the Chief

Constable of South Yorkshire Police or his Police

Authority.




R74   By agreement with the Chief Constable of South

Yorkshire Police the Main File will not be forwarded to

him until after the Director of Public Prosecutions has

made the decisions as to prosecution in respect of all

the main participants in the causes of the disaster.

It seems sensible to delay the sending of the JACKSON

file to South Yorkshire Police Authority until the Main

File is sent to Chief Constable, South Yorkshire
Police, after the Director of Public Prosecutions has

notified his decisions as to prosecution.

Dear

Hillsborough Disaster

A letter of complaint, directed through the Home Secretary, has been made
against Chief Superintendent Duckenfield of this Force arising out of the
above.

I write to formally request that you allow Assistant Chief Constable,
Mr X P D Cooper, of your Force to undertake this enquiry on my behalf.

For your information, ray Chief Constable has asked the Police Complaints
Authority to supervise the investigation.

I refer to today's telephone conversation regarding the Hillsbrough enquiry. As discussed
   require Assistant Chief Constable Cooper, as the current Investigating Officer, to
serve Regulation 7 notices on the officers named by Mr Hicks in his statement of 24
  ugust 1989. It js important that the notices are served without delay.

I confirm that Mr Cooper is only required to serve the notices and the enquiry will then
  e dealt with by another force. As soon as the situation regarding the appointment of
the new Investigating Officer is resolved, I will inform both yourself and Mr Cooper in
order that arrangements can be made for the transfer of documents etc.

Again thank you for your assistance in this matter.

   N A TU R E OF *              COMPLAINT


              On Saturday 15 April 1989 at Hillsborough Football Ground, Sheffield, a
              disaster occurred in which 95 people died.

              Trevor HICKS of                                         [Middlesex, has
              made a previous allegation in relation to your duties at the ground.
              He has now made the following further allegation;

              That he, Mr Hicks, made an allegation against Chief Superintendent
              DUCKENFIELD that he was deceitful and intentionally misled the public
              and senior Police Officers, including yourself, in relation to the
              opening of Gate ’C* in Leppings Lane. However Mr Hicks now alleges
              that he questions whether you were unaware of the real circumstances
              relating to the opening of gate ’C*. Mr Hicks therefore considers
              there may have been collusion between yourself and Mr DUCKENFIELD
              concerning this point.

 Following our telephone conversation of recent date I write to you with a
 proposition in connection with the routeing of the papers arising from the
 crime investigation into the Hillsborough disaster.

You will know that my investigation into the criminal and disciplinary aspects
is being supervised by the Police Complaints Authority. At the end of my
investigation, which is not far off, the PCA must make a statement that it is
satisfied with the conduct of the investigation. That statement will be sent
to you, the complainants and to the officers whose conduct has been called into
question.  The only exception to that will be the PCA statement in respect of
your Assistant Chief Constable Mr Walter JACKSON.   In his case the PCA
statement will go to your Police Authority.

In strict accord with the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, the way for
this to be achieved is for me to submit my original report to the PCA, and at
the same time send a copy to you (or your Police Authority). Once the PCA is
satisfied with my investigation it sends the forementioned statement to that
effect, to you (or to your Police Authority).

You (or your Police Authority) are then required first to consider matters
related to any criminal offences revealed in the report and refer them to the
Director of Public Prosecutions.  Thereafter you are required to submit a
report to the PCA setting out your opinions as to the merits of the complaints
against police officers; any disciplinary charges preferred or proposed; the
merits or otherwise of convening a disciplinary tribunal; and any reasons for
not preferring disciplinary charges.

My proposition is that for various reasons; including the referral of the
matter by Peter Wright to the DPP in the first place; the complex circumstances
of the investigation; the bulk of the documentary and other evidence; and the


                                                      Continued...




                                                                                  9

need for expediency; you allow me to deal direct with the DPP in so far as the
crime aspects are concerned. Of course, you will receive the PCA statement at
the appropriate time and you will receive all of the evidence and reports in
time for your consideration of the disciplinary aspects with the PCA. The
matters relating to your Assistant Chief Constable would not be affected.

I hope that this letter is comprehensible and that you will agree to ray
proposal, in which case a short letter of reply would be appreciated.

Many thanks for your letter      of   17 July 1990 which concerns the routeing
of your report to the DPP.

I quite understand that there are exceptional circumstances which surround
your investigation and that the bulk of the material which accompanies
your report isconsiderable.   It is also relevant     that the  matter was
referred to the   DPP by Peter Wright in the first instance, and the need
for expediency should require no argument.

Of course, I am directly concerned only with the matters which involve
°fficers    and below the rank of Chief Superintendent, so I cannot speak
for my Police Authority which is concerned with officers of ACPO rank.

I have no objection to your submitting        your   report   to    the     DPP     through
the PCA without sending a copy to me.

I understand that in due course I shall receive a statement from the
PCA in respect of your conduct of the investigation and that I shall
receive all the    reports and supporting evidence in good time for me to
consider any disciplinary aspects of the case.

I trust that this letter is sufficient for your purposes                  and       that   it
will help to bring the matter to a swift conclusion.

               You Will recall that 1 served notices of two separate complaints by
               Mr Trevor Hicks on you on 8 November 1989 and 12 January 1990. The
               -service of the notices by me was on behalf of Mr G J Dear, Investigating
               Officer. The service of the notices complied with Regulation 6 of the
               Police (Discipline) (Senior Officers) Regulations 1985 and not, as was
               indicated on the form, in respect of Regulation 7. The content of the
               notices indicating that Mr Hicks had made these two separate complaints
               was not affected in any way and, therefore, the notifications are still
               relevant.

                I trust this clarifies the authority under which you received the advice
                as far as the existence of the complaints made by Mr Hicks. I do
                ap
                apologise if this has caused you any inconvenience.

Dear Sir

Thank you for your letter of 25th August asking for our assistance in implementing one of
the Taylor Report recommendations relating to the use of CCTV for safety purposes at
football grounds.

I also received a letter from Mr Anderton and I enclose my reply to him. From this you will
see that SRDB proposes to assist police forces via Mr Andertonâ€™s committee in the way I
outlined to him.

I hope that in this way we can help you (and others) to implement the Taylor
recommendation.

                                        Yours sincerely




                                           / /;


                                       DR P A YOUNG

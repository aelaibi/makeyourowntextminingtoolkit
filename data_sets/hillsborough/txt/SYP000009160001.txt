          to wait         until       the other         fans       Had got       into the          ground.           Some    listened

          getting         into       the ground at any                 cost.         They started to force                   their way

          past         the horses          some     crawling        under      the horses              -forcing gaps         between

          each horse.                They simply          ignores          everything         I said.



          It was at this                  time    I saw the         blue      gates                                the M o r t h S t a n d

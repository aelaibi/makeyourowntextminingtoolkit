Dear Mr. Whalley,

Re:     H illsborough D isa ster Inq u iry

I r e f e r to th e c ir c u la r of 26th A p ril 1989 from th e F ootball League
and note th e contents th e r e in .

Obviously i t is v e r y d iffic u lt for Clubs o th e r than those d i r e c tl y
involved to pass comment on th e h o r r i f i c d i s a s t e r at H illsborough
on 15th A p r il.  L ike many o th e r Clubs we th in k th a t p o s itiv e
lessons should be learn ed from the v ary in g problem s th a t will
su re ly be commented upon by Lord Ju stic e T ay lo r when he makes
h is fin d in g s.

One area which seems a p p a re n t, from our conversations w ith people
who a c tu a lly attend ed th e game, was the f r u s tr a tio n f e l t Jbv„..maDV
pesuljja. Jit, jaoi, being able, to be of any d ire c t ass is tance during
th e ^ in c id e n t. By th e s e people I mean those who are q u alified
do cto rs, sta te r e g is te r e d n u rse s , members of the amtmlanyce s e rv ic e
e tc . Although being p re se n t at th e game~'*lliey" were unable to
go to th e scene of the d i s a s t e r and be of d i r e c t a s sista n c e .
What we as a Club would ask people to consider is th a t each
Club opens up i t s own r e g i s te r of sup p o r te r s , who attend on a
reg u lar b a s is at t h e i r p a r tic u la r ground and a re p ro fessio n ally
q u a lifie d , and if w illing th ey can then be issu ed WttK'^wKat we
would term as a ' Qgn&cupass' which would allow them d ir e c t access
to the area of the ground where any incid ent occurs.                    The Stew ards
at a p a r tic u la r Club would be a d v is e d of th e p a ss and know th at
th ese people would be e n title d to move fre e ly around the ground
in case of emergency. I feel, from my e x p e rie n c e , th a t each
Club could r e g is te r up to two dozen s u ita b ly q u alified p erso n s.

Lord Ju s tic e T a y l o r 's prim e concern w ill be, I am c e rta in , to
give h is findings on the causes of th e H illsborough d i s a s t e r but
he may well find th a t he wishes to v i s i t o th e r F ootball League
Clubs to obtain th e o b se rv atio n s of o th e r fo o tb all club o ffic ia ls
as i t does seem a p p aren t th a t given th e same s o r t of situ atio n
th e d is a s t e r could well have o ccurred at any of our F ootball League
g ro unds.

Rest a s su re d th a t the Board of D irectors of Derby County Football
Club would welcome Lord Ju s tic e T ay lor and h is team to th e B aseball
Ground should he w ish to ta lk to us p e rs o n a lly .

Police C o n s table 1709


I am a Const a b l e with the South Y o r k shire Police and since June 1988 I

have been a Police T r a iner at the Force T r a ining School, Ecclesfield,

Sheffield.


At 9 . 45am S a t u r d a y 15 April                 1989 I commenced duty at the Sheffield

W e d n e s d a y Football Ground, Hillsborough, Sheffield, in relation to the

F.A. Cup Semi Final between Liverpool and N o t t i n g h a m Forrest.



At     10.45am   the        same             morning,      f o l l owing        a    briefing     by    Chief

Su p erintenden t Dukenfield                     and other Senior Officers,                  I was deployed

with    the   rest   of       my            Serial     (Serial   58)       to       patrol    Herries   Road,

Sheffield, f r o m the Five Arches Public House to the r oundabout where

Herries Road meets M o o n s h i n e Lane.


During that time I saw a large number of N o t t i n g h a m Forrest supporters

making their w a y along                     Herries    Road,    both on foot and in vehicles

towards the ground.                   A substantial proportion of these fans had been

drinking, m a n y in the Devonshire Arms and Five Arches Public Houses

situated on Herries Road.



A p p r o x i m a t e l y 3 .10pm the same date I, together with the other officers

on m y Serial, were p a s sing the front of Hillsborough Football Ground on

the way to the Force coach when we answered an assistance call from

within the ground.
On e n t e r i n g the ground we were held with   some 20 to 30 other officers

between the North Stand arvd the Kop.



Some three minutes later 8 or 9 Dog Handlers            entered the   ground and

made their w a y under the North Stand towards the Leppings Lane terrace,

only to return several minutes later.



After another short wait all         the officers in the holding area were

d irected'on to the pitch.      Some were sent down to the Leppings Lane end

and some, m yself included, were sent to stand facing           the   Nottin g h a m

Forrest supporters in the Kop.



At that stage       I had no idea of the real nature or enorm i t y of the

situation.


I saw,     and indeed assisted with,     the ripping up of the advertising

boarding around the pitch.        The boards were taken to the Leppings Lane

end and I saw people being stretchered back across the pitch on these

boards.



After     awhile   a number   of Liverpool   supprters ran towards us in an

attempt to get -to the N o t t i n g h a m Forrest supporters in the Kop.     Many

were crying and in an o b v i o u s l y distressed state.   I tried to calm and

console these fans and assisted them back across the pitch towards the

Leppings Lane end.


The next 40 minutes or so was spent stood on the pitch talking to and

consoling distressed supporters.
                                                                         3.



A p p r o x i m a t e l y 4 .05pm the same date an announcement was made over the

tannoy that the match had Been abandoned.


As   the   ground    started   to clear    I was     directed,     along with     other

officers,     to    patrol   Leppings   Lane   to   assist    in   the    dispersal   of

supporters.


At 6 . 0 0 p m I went to the Sheffield Traffic Headquarters to re-join my

Serial     Sergeant and the rest of the group.               We were held there on
standby before being released from duty at 7.00pm.

               I have      been the L i ce ns ee       of the Magnet Public House,

               S h e f f i e l d for    the   past 9 months.



               I was working            behind the     bar on S a t u r d ay       15th April,     1989   (150489)         on

               the      day of the Liverpool           and Notts Forest FA semi               final.



               I opened the            bar at   11.00 am    (1100 hrs)         and we had a few regulars               in,

              At about          11.20 am      (1120 hrs)    we had a family of N o t t i n g ha m Forest

               s uppo r t e r s    come    in and then g radually we               had a build up of both

              Liv e r p o o l     and Notts Fo re st     supporters        and filled up both side              rooms

               I w o u l d say about          150 - 200 supporters           in total      came to the        pub.

              E v e r y o n e was mixing well,          they were all          singing     songs    together,        the

              Liverpool,           Notts Forest       and the    locals.           The atmos ph er e   in here       before
                                                                                                            PAGE
                                                                                                            S I 116

     *        the m at c h was         great.

         *%

              It was       busy   I had to get extra staff             to    cope.



              I think my busiest               time was about one to two o'clock               (1300 hrs - 1400

              hrs)    the supporters            began to    leave    for    the ground about       two - to

              quarter       past two      (1400 hrs -       1415 hrs).        O nly a handful      was    left I

              think      they were Liverpool           supporters,         at about    three o ’ clock      (1500

              hrs)    and they         left soon after       three.



              I had a b s o l u te l y    no    problems w ith any of the            supporters    that   came     to

              my    pub they were all            in good    moods and       there was a friendly rivalry

              betw e e n    the   fans    but    it was     taken as       itwas    in great   spirit.



              After      the m at c h was abandoned,          we had       people    returning    to   pick up

              their      cars and to gather            up their     friends.        B ot h Notts Forest and

              L i verpool       were    sharing    in the grief       of the missing and          injured    people

                                                                                                            SIGNED

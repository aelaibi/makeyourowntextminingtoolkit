The a m b u l a n c e w o m a n was a cr os s    this m a n trying a rt if i ci a l         respiration.

T he re was a l r e a d y an a i r w a y       f itt ed to this man.           I don't krfow how           long

they had been w orking              on him,      his face was         normal     colour a n d     I f itted

the    r es us ci ta to r     to him.    I was w i t h this m a n for a sriort time a nd at

no point did           I see him move          or hear him breathe. / A n a m b u l a n c e a r r i v e d

a short        time    later a n d took        this m a n a w a y all Jm e       time a m b u l a n c e   staff

were     t rying      to   revive    him.      I don't know wh\e#ner he was a li ve                 or dead,

but    I saw no m o v e me nt        from him.



I then m ade my way on to the                   pitch a n d over to the L ep p in g s L n end

stand.



T h ey were a lot of people m il l i n g a r o u n d on the                  pitch,       a n d quite a few

people       lying d own on the          pitch.       Ho w ev e r   I c he cked a lot of these

a nd    could see          no one   req ui re d oxygen.         I went    near    to the      peri me te r

fence       of the L e p p in gs Ln end a n d saw that              in Pens 3 and 4 people were

okay,       there were        some s itting      down     crying a nd g e n e r a l l y   I saw a lot         of

upset       people.        I could see      no bodies      on the    p itch or in the stands.                 No

one    I    could see was still               left   in the stands        on the floor.



I saw that          there was       no one     needing     o x yg e n at this     stage a n d d e c i d e d

to make my way back off                 the    pitch to see         if I could be of use

No one       in this       s ec t i o n    looked as t h ou g h         they were going to               die.

H o w e v e r a lot had serious                injuries      s uc h     as b ro ke n limbs.

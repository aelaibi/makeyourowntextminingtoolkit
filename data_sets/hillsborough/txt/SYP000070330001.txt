               I am a supporter                  of Liv e r p o o l       F.C.     and have        been tor some          ten years



               On S a t u r d a y , 15 April                 1989     (150489)       I went       to the H i l l s b o r o u g h

               I went with a                                           ind three       others                          and

                                    whose       s u r names         I do not know,



               We all         went    in                         :ar we    left York at about                10 am   (1000).          We

               all      had tickets             for the L a p pings LN,                s t a n d i n g area,     I got my ticket

    On    route    to the gro u n d we f o l l o w e d the d i v e r s i o n signs                for the

    football       traffic      but we e nded up getting                  lost      in S h e f f i e l d C ity

    Centre,       but after       some    thirty minutes we               Pound our way to the

    g round we went          down the mai n          road passed the             ground on our           left and

    under    the       railway bridge and we               parked       in a side       road on our          left.          It

    was about          12.15 pm     <1215)      whe n we     parked.



    We then       bought some          fish and      chips from a shop n e a r b y ,/ a f t e r               w h i c h we

    w a l k e d to a p u b .      I do not know            the     name    of the     pub, /but it was           up a

    hill    a way from the g r o u n d .            The    pub was        packed t i g h / wit h L i verpool

    fans and       it was      nearly      impossible        to get a drink, il              e v e n t u a l l y got

    served,       by this time          I had split         from the       other j/o u r as we d e c i d e d

^   to get     to the bar         i n d i v id ua ll y to give       us a better           chance       of    being

    served.



    I then f ound them a g a i n outside,                  as    there wis         no    room in the          pub,     we

    s tood outside wit h           our    drink after whi c h , ywhere we went                      back      into     the

    pub    it was       empty because         it had run out             c/f beer.        The a t m o s p h e r e    at

    the    pub was great          they were all L i v erpool               fans      in good humour            singing

    w h en the     bar shut       because      the    beer      ran/out      the     fans went       down the          hill

    to the o f f - l icence        to get      some drink and             brought        it back to the             pub

    and    drank       it outside       the   pub.        I am Enable        to estimate          the    number        of

    people at the          pub,    but they were a l 1 well                beha v e d and       in good humour

    a n d a lt h o u g h they were        chanting         I fid    not    see anyone who was                 actually

    drunk.        We    left the       pub at about         7.45    pm    <1345)        and went     down to the

    o ff -l ic e n ce    situa t e d   just    below yhe         pub,     but whe n we got           there       they

    also    had    run out      of beer,       but    sqprieone from the             shop had gone            to fetch

    some    more.       There were        quite a /few L i v e r p o o l         fans outside           the    off-

                to the ground.             We got       to the ground a y a bout                S . 13 <1415).         At     this

                                                                                        i
Dear Sir,

Hillsborough

Further to previous correspondence, we have been asked to bring to
your attention the attached copy note, the original of which is in
the possession of our Leading Counsel, Mr. W. C. Woodward Q.C.

The note represents an exchange between Mr. Woodward and Leading
Counsel to the Inquiry, Mr. Andrew Collins Q.C.  Our reading of it
is as follows:


            "Andrew - Did you manage to spedk to P.T. on the
             question of prosecutions.

             Yes - he said that (because in        of his view of
             the unreality of suggesting manslaughter) he would
             leave it to you to raise the issue if you thought it
             necessary"


The context is that at the time that senior South Yorkshire Police
Officers were about to commence giving evidence to the Inquiry, a
question was raised as to whether they - or for that matter any
other witness - ought to receive a warning and a reminder of their
right not to give evidence which might tend to self incrimination.



                                                                                                                       /... contd.

 In the event, no such warning or reminder was given.

In passing this copy note to you, we do not seek to put forward any
view as to whether it bears any significance to the decisions which
will ultimately have to be taken by the DPP when the West Midlands
Inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster has been concluded.

The view expressed by our clients is that, as the note is in
existence, it ought to be made available both to yourself and to the
representatives of those against whom complaints have been raised as
a result of the occurrence of the disaster.

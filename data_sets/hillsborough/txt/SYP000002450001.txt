was      so    great          that       we    arrived          very       late.

Once      in L e p p i n g s         Lane          I could          see    tha t      there        were        several              thousand

people        massing              outside          the    turnstiles                and    it w a s          obvious             t h at    many            of

these         people          didn't          have       tickets.

I think         tha t         there       were       only about                six    or    seven         turnstiles                   open       and        I

was      aiining         to    enter          the    ground          via       entrance          B.

The      crowd       seemed          to       be    surging          forward          and       b ac k    towards                the    turnstiles

and      there       was       no    order          and    no       queuing          at    all.

At     about        2.40       pm the          same       date       I became             aware        that        the       outer         wrought

iron      g a t e s were            closed          in a n      obvious          attempt           to     release                some      of     the

pressure            on    the       turnstiles.                 This       had       the    effect            of       stopping            the

crush         getting          any       worse       but       the    situation             as     it w a s            at    the       turnstiles

remained            the       s am e *

A 11     four       of    our       party          then moved             to    one       side     away        from          the       worst         area

where         the    crush          seemed          to    be    to    wait       for       the     crowds              to    subside.

At     about        2.45       pm trie s a m e            date       1 became             aware        tnat        a    iarge          b 1 ue     door

to     the     right          of    the       turnstiles             became          ope n,        A     number             of    people          who

had      been       waiting          to       use    the       turnstiles             began        to     filter             through            that

door.          After          only       a short          t im e     th is      sma l l     filter            became             a heavier

flow      and       ej^eryone wn o                 had    b e e n wai ting            to    get        into        the       ground         fnade           tor

t hi s    open       door,,

W e al l       found          our    way       then       inside          the    ground.               Kester           and                     went         to

the      toi l e t .          As    we    waited          1 saw       hundreds             of    people            making          their          way

down      the       tu nn e l       which          leads       to    the       centre       part         of    the          terracing.

When      the       b oy s     returned             to    us    all       four       of    us    made         our       way       down      the
                          S'                          ’
same      tu nn el        and       we    were       followed             by    hundreds           more        people.

We     eventually              got       onto       the    terrace             itself       and        out     of       the       t u n n e 1,.

However         o nce         we    were       there       the       ground          at    that        area        w as      so    full         that

we     had     no    control             over       where       we    were       going          a n d we       were          carried            by     tne
                                                                                                                                      PAGE         3
                                                                                                                                      S24S

We     were       ail    carried           down    the       terracing             to    the    rig ht         and    towards          the

front        of    the       ground        getting       closer          and       closer       to       the    front       fe n c e .       We

were     then          carried       to     the    left       until       eventually                we    were       only       a matter

of     feet       from       the    front       f e n c e.

At     this       time       my    son was        to    my    left       with       2 or        3    people          between          us,

I was        aware       t ha t     th e    game       kicked       off.           Play       went       to    the    far       end    of

th e    pitch and             then       came     back       to    the    L e p p i ngs        Lane       end.

The     pressure             he ca me      steadily          worse.           I was       finding             difficulty          in

breathing              and    I was        very    concerned             at    t hi s     stage          about       the    vast

numbers           of    people       in the        ground.

I was        of    course          very     concerned             about       my    s o n at        this       stage       as    w e ll .

I couldn't move at all                           but    I glanced over                   towards K e s t e r .              A l t h o u g h he

looked a little                    pale,        other    than that             he a p p e a r e d         to be a 1r 1g h t »               The

gate at           the    f r ont     of     the    t e r rac:e had by now been o p e n e d .                               I passed out

s h o r t l y after           this and           came    to outside                the ground.                 I was       given       some

assistance              by a g e n t l e m a n         outside            the ground and after a while I

    Throughout            his    life        Kester          was    very        healthy        and         had       no    cause        to     enter

    hospital.              The       nam e      of    his     local       doctor          is Dr        Ferguson,                w h ose

    St    Albans.             Kester         had      no     visible          marks       or   scars            on his          body.




    Over     the     past       few years             myself        and my          son    have        been          supporters              of

    Liverpool            Football         Club,         with myself              a supporter                for       thirty           years.

    Last     season        we    had      difficulties                in o b t a i n i n g       tickets              for       matches           and

    therefore            Kester        and      I together           with        two      friends           became             season        ticket

    holders         at A n f i e l d      for        the     1 9 8 8 — 1 98 9    season.               We       also       went        to all

    the    cup matches               Liverpool             were     involved           in a n d        intended                going      to      the

    F A Cup         Semi      Final       against            Nottingham             Forest       at        Hillsborough,

    We    were      going       to     t h is     match       with       two     friends         of H e s t e r ' s             wh o

    ticket       allocation             for       this       match       only                  and         1 qualified                 for

    tickets         for    the m a t c h .              However          we     ail    decided             to    go       to    the     game        in

    the    hope      t ha t     we     could         obtain        two    match        tickets             on    the       black

    market,,             If we       hadn't          got     more    tickets           then      I would              give       mine        to

    Kester.

We    travelled along                    the    Ml       and     stopped               at       the    Trowel 1 Ser vic es                      near

Nottingham              at     about       1 2 . 3 0 pm       ( 1 2 3 0 h r s ) for              the       boys       to     go      to       the

toilet.                Whilst         there     we       noticed          a       group          of    Liverpoo1 supporters

there       and        I enquired             about       spare       tickets.                        Amongst             the     supporters               was

a    Supporters              Club      Official           who       sold          us       two     tickets            at     f ac e       value       for

the      s a me    turnstile             and     entrance            as       the          two     I already               had.

Eventually              we     came      to a       standstill                and          on    looking             at    the       dashboard

clock       I saw           it was       1 . 5 6 pm      ( 1 3 5 6 h r s ).                As    time       wa s      going          on       I was

becoming           anxious            about     getting             into          the       ground          so       I made          a    t hr e e

At    2.10pm           ( 1 4 1 0 h r s ) we     had       reached             a    po i n t        approximately                     one       and a

         behaved.                On     arriving           at     the    ground          I realised              that       I was          at    the

         wrong        end     of      the     ground.              I referred              to    my    ticket          to    see       whic h way

         to     go    but     I found            the     plan      of    the       stadium        on       the    back       of       the       ticket

         very        confusing.

         street        obviously              without            tickets       but       there        was    no    rowdyness                or

         trouble.                They       were        s o me    people       asking           for    spare       tickets.

         Immediately               on    seeing          the      amount       of       people        by    the    turnstiles.                     I

         became        concerned              at    the      situation             as    there        appeared          to    be       no       order         01

knocked            o v er    by a        police       horse    and    so    I told         the    boys      to    l e a ve    the

crowd and             stand         next    to a f e n c e      by    the    r iv e r      and    wait      there       u n ti l    the

situation             ease d,             I then       noticed       that    the     large,        b lu e     wrought          i ro n

gates         ha d    been c l o s e d          to stop more          suppo rt er s joining              the      crush.             At

t hi s       time     it was         appro:: i m a te ly 2 . 4 0 pm         (1440 h rs ) and          I did       not     think         we

would         ge t    into         the    ground       before     kick      off.




I then         saw        t ha t   a few        suppo rt er s had bro ke n              through       the        police        cordon

who      were        protecting            the     wrought      iron       gates.           However         it was       only a

handful 1 who                managed        this.         It a p p e a r e d      t ha t    the    supporters            who       were

pressed            against          these       gates    on the       outside           of the    ground         were     in

distress             due     to     the    numbers       behind       them.




About         15 y a r d s         and    to m y      right,    around       the     corner        from       the    turnstiles

Immediately                 opposite        the       gate we     had      come    t h r o u g h was a tunnel

for.            Also       t h ere     was       no       stewards           or    police          officers around                   to ask

advice          from.            We    did       not       even       see     a    programme               seller.




To     the      left       of    the    tunnel             entrance           wa s      a    gents         toilet        which                        and

although             there       was    no        r us h       they    were        all       heading          for    the       s a me     tunnel

we     were      standing             by.            The       behaviour           of       the    f ans      was    orderly            and       I

W h e n K e s t er         and                    returned            I led all              three         down     the    tu nn el .

Once       in t h e r e , t h e r e             was       no w a y     of     turning             b ac k    due     to    the       volume            of

people          following             behind.                  At    the     end       of    the     tunnel         I thought             we

would        have         been    able          to    turn          r ight    or       left       along       a gangway             but      we       got

fraught         up     in the         crowd          and       at    the     end       of    the     t u n n e 1 we       j ust      spilled

onto       the       cong e s t e d t e rra c e s .                   The     matter          wa s      not      helped        by w h a t

appeared             to    be a       slope          at    the       end     of    the       tun n e l .          I shouted             to     the

boys       to    go       to    the    right          of       the    goal,,            1 was        concerned            that       we      were

directly             behind       the       g oa l        as    it    seemed           to    be    the      most     congested

I then saw that                   there was a v e r t i c a l , blue                              fence       blocking          us in

completely                on the       right.                  The    crowd        surged and we were                      car r i e d         to

                and|                  but Kester was                   in front              of me,         just to my              left with

        both       of    us a b o u t         two      or    three       fe et       away        from       the    front         fence        and

        immediately                behind        the        goal.          At     t h is       point        the m o v e m e n t       of      the

        crowd       s t o p p e d and           th e      p.ressure        from       behind           became         such       t h at    we    were

        stationary.                     I was        facing        the     wrong          way        but    with      the     help        of a

        supporter             I managed              to     turn around.




        I was       very          concerned            at    the    situation              as        I have       been      in     l ar g e     crowds

        before          but       had    never         been       in a     crush          like        t h is .        It    seemed         then       that

        the      game      kicked         off        and     K e s t e r was         about           a yard       to m y      left.             I

        managed          to       get    my     l e ft      arm    f ree    and       I reached              out      and     pressed           it

        a qa i n s t t h e f e n c e            in f r o n t       of me        to    try and              remove       the      pressure.



        I can       then          only    remember            s ome      things           but        I do    not      know       if   t h e y a re         in

        our      end.             The    pressure            on rne t h e n          became           intolerable             and     I wa s

        having          difficulty              in     breathing.                 I tried             to    r a ise    myself         on      t ip    toes

        to     enable         me    to    breathe.                 I sa w K e a t e r            on m y      left a n d          felt      that       as

        little          pale       but    I thought               1 was      in m o r e          trouble.               ihis w a s         the       last

leg    knocked          my     spectacles             off.           My watch           had      also        been       ripped       off.

I then        passed          out.




When     I. came        to     I was       lying        on a         tarmac       path        outside           the     g a te    that        had

been     opened         by     the       police       to     let     us     in.         I was         hav i ng         difficulty

breathing           and       somebody          checked my             pulse.               I was      unable           to m o v e .

With     the       help       of   a man        c a l l e d _________ I               raised         myself         on one        elbowand

then     crawled          to a w a l l          beside        the      g a te     to     prop myself               up.           I saw

other        people       lying          around       by     the      fe nc e,        some      completely              c o ve red .




 Eventually           I got         to    my    feet       and       began       to    1 o o k for         Kester         and

I went        back      toward           the    tunnel        entrance            and wandered                  around        the

courtyard           a r e a.         However,           i dxcln^t           nav e      my     spectacles               and    couldn't

see     properly.                  I drank       s om e      water         and    realised            I had        grazing          on m y

forehead,           bruises          on m y      r i gh t     upper         arm       and     bruises           on o t h e r      pa r t s     of

my    body.

could        not    get       onto       the    pitch        due      to    the       fencing.

                 against         the        fence         in f r o n t      of me         to    try a n d        remove       the       pressure.

                   Last     s e a s o n we       began       to    have       some         difficulty          in g e t t i n g    into       certain

wanted       to    follow              the       team       until          they won             the       trophy         or w e r e       knocked

but      we all      decided                to    go    anyway             in    the       hope          t hat    we      could       obtain          the

other       two    tickets              on       the    black          market.              If       this        failed        it w a s         my

2.       On Saturday               the       15th A p r i l            (150489)             we       set     off        f r o m St.       A l b a n s at

about       11 a m       (1 100).                Hillsborough                   is    the       only        current           First       Division

researched           the       stadium             and       the       route          with       the a s s i s t a n c e            of     ’The

estimated           that       by       leaving             at     11.00         am    (1 1 0    0   ) t h e re         was    adequate              time

to    get    to S h e f f i e l d ,              get    parked             and       into       the       ground          by 2 . 0 0       pm

(1400)       at     the       l at es t.




I went       up     the       Ml       and       decided          to       stop       at    the          Trowell         Services              as    the

boys      wanted         to    use          the    toilet.                 We    noticed             a    group         of L i v e r p o o l

supporters           in       the       car       park       and       enquired             about           spare        tickets.

Travelling           on       their          coach was                a Supporters                   Club Official                  who        sold    us

two      tickets         we    required                at    the       face          price.




We    arrived        at       Exit          34    from       the       motorway             at    about           1 . 30      pm    (1330)           but

immediately              hit       a    long       line          of    cars.           I subsequently                      discovered                that

th i s    stretched            all          the    way       towards             the       city          c en tr e.        There         were        police

and      I was       becoming             anxious          about         getting         into      the      ground.             I made             a

three        point        turn and           travelled              in the        general          direction              of    the       ground

along        various           side       r o a ds    and      on    to     B a r n s l e y R o ad ,        referring            from          time

to     tim e    to       the    M i c h e l i n map.          At     about       2.10         pm    (1410)        we       reached             a

point        about         one       and    a h alf m i l e s            from    the        ground where             the        traffic                was

so     bad     that        X d^tid>^d t h at it w a s                     better         to    park    and walk.                 We        left

were      many Nottingham                    Forrest           supporters              travelling              in the          same

direction.                 They       weregenera ll y                orderly        and well           behaved.                 It s e e m e d              a

long      way      to      the       ground          and when        we    got     there          I realised              that       we     ha d       to

make      for      the     other          end.             R e m e m b e r r e f e r r e d to m y           ticket         a s I knew

confusing.                It is        i m p o r t a n t to         record       that         neither          did      t h i s p l an         have

reached         the       turnstile             area       I was         immediately              concerned           at       the

situation            t he r e .       There          were      hundreds           of     supporters              milling         around                in

the      street,          obviously without                     tickets.               They were            not      aggressive                or

rowdy        but     seemed          resigned           to     the       situation.               There      was      a    l a rg e       pair          of

b lu e   wrought           iron       gates          through which               we      passed       to     the      area

     mounted          pol i                           making        things          worse,        being       u n ab l e to            c on t r o l

     taking          place       in a d m i t t i n g       the m a n y        hundreds           of    people          through             the

     4.     We       joined       the      edge       of    the m e l e e       and       very     quickly           became            embroiled

     in    it.        I was       very anxious                about       the       safety        of    the       boys.           I saw a man

     almost          knocked        over        by    one     of    the       police        horses          and    told       the       boys       to

     l e a ve     the      crowd and            come       and     stand       n ex t     to    the     fence        n e ar       the       river

     dow n.          I then       noticed            that     the    l a rg e       blue       wrought        i ron         gates       had       been

     closed          in o r d e r     to      stop     arr/ m o r e             porters           joining          the       c h ao s       outside

     the    turnstiles.                  At     t h i s p q ^ n t j (Wp-pr-rlo x            4£3^pm      (1440))             1 was        convinced

     that       we    would        not     get       into     the    ground          bef'd-e-e the           kick       off       as     the      crowd

     outside          the     turnstiles              did     not    seem       to      reduce         at all        o ve r       a    period          of

     about        5 minutes.




     3.     There          was     pressure           on    the     blue       wrought          i ron       gates       and       the       cordon

     of    police          protecting            them was           broken          a t on e      po i n t    a n d a fe w s u p p o r t e r

This      appeared                to    be       the     safest         way     of      entering          the       ground        in    the

circumstances                     and       I told          the    boys       to     follow         me; t h r o u g h       it.        We    all      had

our      tickets             ready          but    nobody           looked         at    t hem.          Once       through        the       g at e

there         was       a kind          of       court       yard.           This       is w h e r e      programmes              are       normally

sold and            I immediately                      looked          for    this       facility          but        I could          see      nobody

either         selling             programmes                or    directing             supporters             into        the    ground.

Immediately                  opposite             the       word       “S t a n d i n g "     over       the    top and           the       le t t e r

"A"      to    the          left,       and       the       letter        "B"      to    the       right.           These       letters

obviously               related             to    th e      two    sets       of     turnstiles.



It      is v e r y          important             to     n ote      that      there         was     no    indication              that       there

were      other             points          of a c c e s s        to    the     terraces,             neither          was      there        anyone

to      direct          us    to       them.




6   .    To the             left       of    the       tunnel          entrance          was       a gents          toilet        which

ai>d K e s t e r            decided          to    use.           While       _________a n d          I waited            for     them       1 saw

several         hundred                spectators                pass     through           the     open       side       gate.         They were

walking         in a n            orderly          fashion             and    there         was     no    evidence           of    rowdy

behaviour.                   I thought             that          it w o u l d      be    impossible             for       there        to    be a

sudden         surge          of       supporters                into     the      ground          in a n y     case,        as    there was              a

blue       railing            to       the       side       of    the     turnstiles               which       all     those       queuing

outside         would             h a ve     had       to    go     round.

        having         difficulty             breathing.                   I tried           to       raise       myself          on    tip       toe      to

        enable         me    to    expand          my    lungs.              I looked             at       Kester        to m y left            and        felt

tunne 1 , reyn/ing                 W-'i'et a n y o n e           into       it.        I was       st ill       not     aware         that

there       were       other       entrances              on    to    the       terraces.            1    was       becoming          more

and    more       anxious          at     not    seeing          the       other       boys       and     tried       again        to    gain

 ntranee          to    the      tunnel         saying          that       I had       been       separated           from my           son.

The    Police          still       refused           to    let a n y o n e        into       it.         I was       s t i ll    not a w a r e

 hat    there          were      other         entrances             on    to    the       terraces,            I remember              asking

someone       the       t i me     and     was       surprised             to    be    told       it w as       as    late       as     4.05

pm    (160 5 ) ,        I was           becoming          more       and    more       anxious           at    not    seeing          the

other       boys       and     tried again                to    gain       entrance          to    the        tunnel,        saying         that

I had       been       separated           from       my       son.        The    police          s t i ll     refused          to a l l o w

me    through.           I overheard                 one       police       saying          to    someone           else     t ha t     if he

wanted       to    see       what        was    going          on he       only       had    to    go a r o u n d       the      corner.

I then       realised            that      there          must       be a n o t h e r       way    on to        the     terraces            and

      went     to       find       it.        I could          see       as    soon         as     I reached           it     that          the       ground

      wa s    s t ill     f u ll        and    there      was        utter          chaos          on    the     pitch.            1    looked           for       a

      way     on    to    the       pitch        n ear    the        corner             f la g     but     could       not     see          any       g a p at,

      all     in the       high          fencing         so     I went             back       to    the       tunnel        entrance.

      Supporters           were          gradually             filtering                back       out     through          the        tunnel          and     I

      wanted        for    some          time       hoping          to    see       one       or    both       of    the      boys.

      debris        reminded             me    of    the a r e a          near          the      collapsed           w al l    in B r u s s e l s .                I

      found my watch                    artjd the        ripped          strap.             It w a s       about       now     that          I

      recognised                              wandering             around          the       terraces.              I went            up    to h i m a n d

      put     m y arms^/arc^uj>d^him.                     He        burst          into       tears        a n d we     hugged              each       other

      for     a while          1    asked        him      if    he       had       seen       the       others       and      he       said       he     had

      not.         He    told       me       briefly       what          he    had       been       doing        and    I f e lt            proud        of

      his     heroic       actions.




      10.      Having          failed          to    find my             spectacles                we    decided        to     head          for       the

\s?   far     corner       of       the       pitch      where                           told       me     the      police         had       set       up an

      Incident           Post,          to    record       names          of m i s s i n g          persons.            This           consisted              of
I
      two     officers             sitting          at a t a b l e            in a       corner          below       the      st an d,

      had a l r e a d y        put       our     three         names          on    the       list       so    he    informed               them       that

      he     had    f o u n d me         but     the     two        other          b oy s     were       s t ill     missing.                I w as       then

      persuaded           to       go    to    the      St.     Johns          Ambulance                r oo m w h e r e      the       graze          to my

      telephoned           home          and     had     been        told          to    go      bacftj/to the          car.            i was

      relieved           that       there        wa s    only        one       missing             now     but      concerned               for

Kester's          safety.




11.     We     decided            to    go     back      to       the      car       to    be    reunited             with                         and

hopefully            also        Kester,




                                             We    set       off     on      foot         for    the     car a n d m u s t                h av e

reached        it at         around          6.30       pm    ( 1 8 3 0 ).           The       traffic        on the            way       was

almost       stationary                so    the     only         way      to    ge t      there       was       by w a l k i n g .                As we

walked       up      the     hill       towards          the        car,                       shouted       out          to    us       from

behind.           He      had     gone       down       towards            the       telephone           box      to       try       the

emergency            number        he       ha d   been       given          by a         policeman.              I asked                if

Kester       was       with       him       and    he    said        he      was      not.        I went          back          to       the       car    to

put    on a       jumper          as    it w a s        getting            quite          chilly       and wrote                down          the

name    of     the        street        in w h i c h         we    were         parked.           I knew          I would                not       be

able    to     drive         without          my     spectacles                 and       wanted       to     be a b l e         to       direct

somebody          to      come     to       collect          the     car        from       its    location.                    I think             the

boys    ha d      something             to     eat      and       dr in k .          I would          like       to       stress          at       this

point       t ha t     n on e     of    us    had any             alcohol            throughout             the       day.




We    decided          that       the       only     thing         to      do    was       to    go    b a ck     to       the       stadium             to

see    if    the       police          had    traced          Kester.                We    managed          to    jump          on       to a       bus
                                                                                           /
which       t oo k     us    there.           We     were         told       by a/fioliceman at                       the       stadium             that

we    should         go     to    the       Hammerton             Road       Py^jre/Station                  where             all       available

transport            was     available.                 In the          event         we       managed       to       hitch          a    lift          from

a    private         driver        who       was     stunned            by w h a t         had    ha pp en ed and                obviously-

had    been       killed          and       I think          it w a s        74 at         this       s tag e .           He    was       extremely

considerate               and     took       us all          the w a y          to    the       Police       Station.                    I was

Every      so    often          an      official                 from    the       hospital            jumped          on       to a       table       to

give      a description                  of       some           of    the    dead      or     to      r e a d out          a    list       of

wife      again       and       she      told          me        that    my    friend                       was    on       his       way    from

there       was       considerable                 confusion                -- s om e          people          were     sitting          on a

the    pictures              were       pinned          to a b o a r d a n d                   he w a n t e d      me    to    go a n d          look        at

the    day.           This        took       about          ten minutes.                  The      Police        Officer           then asked

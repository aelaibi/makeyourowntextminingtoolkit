              searching           supporters             as    they      entered        the        g                 ^Ya r     the     next         h ou r

              there        was    a steady         flow        of    supporters             entering              the    ground.

              At     approximately             1.00pm          <1300)        I was      signalled                 by P S M A R P L E S        to     join

              up w i t h     other        Officers            who    were      forming        a        seperating             line     between

              opposing           supporters         on        the    S p i o n Hop.

              Just       after     the      kick    off        I noticed          a    number           of    people          on   the      outskirts

              of     the    pitch      in f r o n t       of    the      Leppings           Lane        stand.           At    this

              time        both myself         and        PC    2975      were     positioned                 at    the    front        of     the      area

              layed a si d e          for    Liverpool              fans,      preventing               fans

           climbing          into       that    area       from        the     passageway       b el o w .      The       number       of    fans

           infront          of    the    Leppings          Lane        stand       started    to

           increase          and    I could          see     people          climbing      over     the       fence       in    front       of

           the    stand.           Eventually             the    game        was    stopped,       this       caused       the

           Nottingham            Forest        to    start       shouting           threats     and      abuse       to    the L i v e r p o o l

           fan s .      At       this    point       I thought              that    some   sort     of    trouble          was    going          to

           start       on    the    Kop    end       but     this       wa s    diffused when            the    ambulance            came

           onto      the     pitch.Serial                8 took        no    part    in the     events         at    the       Leppings          Ln

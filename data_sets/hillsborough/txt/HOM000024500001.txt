Thank you very much for your kind hospitality yesterday.   I was
very glad of the chance to meet you, Mr McLean and Mr Gregory
over lunch. While I have not yet made up my mind finally on a
number of questions it was nevertheless very helpful for me to
seek your reactions on them.

Can I repeat my thanks to   all your match commanders who have
given me so generously of   their time on my visits to matches in
the London area, and also   to Chief Inspector Evans who has
accompanied me on several   of them and been of considerable help.

With kind regards.

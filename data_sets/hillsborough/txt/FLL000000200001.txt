     Smith, Esq., C.B.E., J.P., D.L.,




Dear Mr, Smith,

                             Hillsborough Inquiry

     Further to the discussion at yesterday's meeting of the Management
Committee I enclose herewith:-

a)     discussion paper from the office,
b)     recommendation from the Anti-Hooliganism Committee Meeting on
       Wednesday,
c)     copy of the memo from the President to Mr. Millichlp.

     I am still awaiting a formal response from the "â€™ootball Association
but indications this morning suggested that they are not going to accept
our proposals.


                               Yours sincerely,




                                   Secretary.
Enclosure.

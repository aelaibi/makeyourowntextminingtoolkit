Dear Sirs,
Hillsborough
We anticipate being able to agree to exchange expert engineering
evidence today.
Are you in the same position?
We have not heard from you with any suggested documentation for
inclusion in the core bundle. This ought to have been with us by
15th August and, in view of the brief time now avai-lable before the
core bundle has to be lodged with the Court, we shall be glad if
you will let us have actual copies of any documentation      you wishto
see included, rather than     merely a list.
If we have not heard from     you by the end of the current week, we
will assume that you have     no documentation for inclusion and will
prepare the core bundle accordingly.

Dear Sirs

We thank you for your cheque in the       sum of   £207.45   in
settlement of our photocopying invoice.
We also refer to your letter of the 29th August concerning the
HSE reports. It is our view that if you wish to rely on those
reports, it will be necessary for you to call witness evidence
to prove the contents.     Please treat this letter as our
counter notice to your letter of the 29th August.

Dear Sirs,
HiLlsborough - HSE Reports
Having considered this matter with Counsel,                                                 it seems to us that the
various independent reports prepared by the                                                 Health & Safety
Executive and issued to each of the parties                                                 under cover of the HSE
letter of 13th June under the generic title                                                 "IR/L/ME/MM/89/2", ought
to be before the Court.
Accordingly, please take this letter as a Civil Evidence Act Notice
to the effect that the Third Party Claimant intends to adduce the
content of that generic report in evidence at the trial.
We assume that this will not be a matter of controversy and we
would propose to lodge a paginated copy of the generic report with
the other documents to be placed before the Court. We would then
let you have details of the pagination to enable you to mark up
your own copy accordingly.

Yours faithfully,

       Dear Sirs
       Re:        HILLSBOROUGH
       We enclose herewith our Revised Draft Index to the Core Bundle.
       Items which did not appear on the previous Draft Index are marked
       with a pencil asterisk. You will note that wherever possible plans
       and diagrams have nowbeen identified by number and where possible
       have   now been stated as being enclosed to the relevant letters.
       This   has resulted in a number of items being "removed” from the
       Draft Index, although in reality these items have simply been
       included with the relevant letters. As an example we would refer
       to the letter from Eastwood and Partners to Sheffield Wednesday
       F.C.dated 26th April 1985,which now contains within the
       description the words "including plan 6705/4". The plan referred
       to was previously listed (without a number) as the item immediately
       below that and you will note therefore that reference has now been
       removed.   The clarification, plans and diagrams has been done at
       the request of the Engineer's solicitors.
       Yours faithfully

Dear Sirs
Hillsborough/Core Bundle
We thank you for your letter dated the 6th September* He did,
however, make reference to the request for documentation in
respect of Mr Mackrell and Mr Lock in our letter of the 16th
August*   We have now spoken to the Club and they have
confirmed that in respect of Mr Lock, there is no documentary
evidence of any contract of employment, and in respect of
Graham Mackrell, there exists a letter of engagement but no
proper service contract or agreement*
We remain of the view that these documents are not relevant*
We would ask that the fee notes referred to in the Engineer's
supplemental list of documents be inserted in the core bundle
as a separate section* Zt would also be sensible to include
the Club's accounting records as a separate section within the
core bundle*
Yours faithfully

        Re: HILLSBOROUGH
        We refer to your letter of 3rd September containing your request

        We did some time ago ask you to provide us with copies of all

        previously disclosed as "Inquiry Documents". You have sent us
        documentation in compliance with this request, but we are
        somewhat concerned to note that some of the items you now wish
        to include are not in either this Bundle or within your original
        Inquiry Bundle.      In line therefore with the penultimate
        paragraph of your letter of 3rd September, could you please
        supply by return the following items which all appear listed on
        page 1 of your letter of 3rd September under the heading "The
        Club's List of Documents"
        Section 3:                        Item 12.
        Section 5:                        Item 3. 10. 11 and 15 to 17 inclusive.
        We presume your reference to Section 4 is a typographical error,
        as Section 4 only has four items.         If we have incorrect
        interpreted your request, no doubt you will advise us. We would
        ask you to note in relation to Item 3 that you are requesting
        the whole booklet to be enclosed, whereas only an extract
                                                                                          Continued .....

Dear Sirs
Hillsborough
We thank you for your letter dated the 10th September.
We do not entirely agree with your comments contained in the
second paragraph of your letter. Zn response to your earlier
request, we indicated those documents from our list which were
submitted to the Public Inquiry by way of provision to the
West Midlands investigation team, or by way of direct
disclosure to the Public Inquiry. The former documents were
included in the safety documents referred to in Section 1 of
our List, save where we Indicated to the contrary. The latter
were contained in the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club bundle
of documents submitted to the Public Inquiry or were submitted
by way of separate documentation direct to Treasury Counsel
and the parties representatives.
However, we refer in detail to the following t*>
1.    Section 3, item 12 i our      recollection isthat this
      document was submitted to the Public Inquiry although it
      is not referred to in our list or the bundle we
      submitted to the Public Inquiry. Only the front page
      and page 26 need to be included.
2.    Section 5, item 3 t the relevant copies are enclosed.
      There is no need to repeat the entire booklet. We do
      possess a specimen booklet which we can make available
      to the Judge.
3.    Section 5, item 10 » this    is contained inour bundle
      submitted to the Public Inquiry (document 16a).


                                                     Contd../.
2/                                         17th September 1990

4.   Section 5, items 11 and 15 » these documents were    not
     submitted to the Public Inquiry.
5*   Section 5# Items 16 and     17 i these documents  are
     contained In the Public Inquiry bundle*      The only
     difference between those eontalned in that bundle and
     those referred to In the list, is that the latter
     contain the addresses of the stewards*
6*   Section 7, Items 5 and 6 t these were submitted to the
     Public Inquiry by way of separate documentation and
     therefore do not feature as part of the Public Inquiry
     bundle we prepared.    There is no reference to these
     documents in the Treasury Public Inquiry index.    The
     writer remembers that these documents were distributed
     to the parties involved and to Treasury Counsel.
7.   Section 8, item* 3, 6-8 inclusive, items 11 and 12 t
     these documents are new documents in that they were not
     submitted to the Public Inquiry. In this respect, we
     understand your concern and apologise for not drawing
     these documents to your attention when we corresponded
     earlier on this subject.
In relation to the documents listed by you, we now enclose
photocopies of those documents referred to in Section 7, we
require all documents to be included save for the annual
return (the accounts are to be Inserted and not simply the
Directors reports). We would also add that we seek Inclusion
of the following documents from the Public Inquiry index
prepared by the Treasury Solicitors t-
Iterns 71, 73, 74 (match briefing condensed notes only), 75,
(briefing notes only), 76 (briefing notes only), 96, 128, 129,
and 275.
We look forward to receiving two sets of the core bundle in
early course.
Yours faithfully

               notes/invoices which are further documents you now wish to be
               added to the Core Bundle.
               In relation to documents within Section 7 (Club Accounting
               Records) we will in line with your letter of the 17th September
               include all these (save for item 6 at your request). At this
               stage, however, we are unable to trace the accounts themselves
               for the years ended 31st May 85, 31st May 86, 31st May 87 and
               31st May 88.
               Could you please ensure that copies of all these accounts are
               also forwarded to us in tonight's post with the items mentioned
               in paragraph l of this letter.

            Together          with       other    Edlington            officers          I travelled            to D o n c a s t e r     DHQ

            hours       drunk       and a       good many         of    them       carrying          ca ns     of    b e er .     However

             this      was    not    just       Liverpool         supporters             but N o t t s       Forest       supporters              as

            Traffic          on    the    road     became       busy     especially with                  coaches         but      began

                                   down    after       E.30     pm.

A p p r o a c h i n g 3 o'cl o c k      it was    clearly evid e n t that           the m a j o r i t y of

N o t t s Fo r e s t   suppo r t e r s    had a r r i v e d at     the ground but the Liverpool

s u pporters w ere still                s t reaming down towards          the g r o u n d from the

o p p osite    side of the             roundabout.        H o w e v e r , we were    c o n s t a n t l y being

a s k e d by L i v e r p o o l    s u pporters      in cars w h e r e    they could        park    their

cars     right up till            the    last minute and the fans were d i r e c t e d up past

N i a g a r a on the m a i n        road.

As the time ne a r e d kick off,                  I was    stood near the S e r g e a n t         and heard

on the      radio about           problems       being e x p e r i e n c e d at the L e p p i n g s Lane

end and       repeated         requests        from somebody,        I believe S u p t . M a r s h a l 1 to

open the gates            or     people were        going to get killed.

I then h e a r d a request               that all a v a i l a b l e officers a t t e n d at the

L e p p i n g s Lane    end w h i c h      I did together wit h all my s e r i a l .

O n arrival        the f o r ecourt           into the g r o u n d was    cleared of fans and

there were a number                 of m o u n t e d o f f icers    present and numbers            of police

o f f icers m i l l i n g a b o u t .

A drun k e n L i v e r p o o l      supporter was         stood nearby and about              twenty      or

thirty Li v e r p o o l          suppo r t e r s were     in the near     vicinity the m a j o r i t y           of

them drinking.

We were       then     i n s t r u c t e d to form a cordon an d prevent a n y more

L i v erpool     supporters            into    the ground u n t i 1 further          notice.

The drun k e n s u p p o r t e r m e n t i o n e d e a r l i e r began arguing w i t h one of the

m o u n t e d o f f icers        insisting on his right to enter               the g r o u n d and

unfo rtunately he                was    knoe k e d over a n d    I believe    the horse        s tood     on h i m .

After a few m i n u t e s           stood o u t s i d e , I saw S u p t . M a r s h a l 1 hurry towards

us a n d told us to go                 into the gr o u n d as our help was               needed.      At that

point     I thought         that       there    had been crowd trouble and on entering                         the

terraces       saw that          there were a large            number of people on the               pitch       I

thought       the re had been a pitch invasion.

H o w e v e r , I seem to          remember      that the       pen I entered was           e m p t y and that
                                                                                                PAGE 3

                                                                                                R155

one of the barriers               inside the compound was twisted and collapsed on the

ground.

I believe       I    saw a number of             shoes    on the     terracing but cannot be            sure

whether it was then or minutes later when I was on the perimeter track.                                    I

walked onto the perimeter track through the gate which was open and then

saw a man being carried towards me and it was obvious that he was dead and

I then saw a further two who were                        in the same way which came as a great

shock.        I hurried          towards    the pen where         the    people were       coming out and

assisted with carrying two bodies out,                          they had been passed out and they

were both laid on the grass to the left of the goalposts (facing down the

ground) I cannot remember what any of these people looked like or what they

were waering.

However, whilst there               it was obvious that there was insufficient room to

lay the people down and I tried together with other officers, including an

Inspector,      to clear more ground to the left of the goals.                             However, there

were large numbers of Liverpool supporters wandering about, again many of

them drunk and continually                   getting     in the way,          some of them saying they

were looking for a friend or relative or acquaintance.

The     scene       was    one     of    total    confusion        and    I    was   not   aware   of    any

organisation,         but    due    to the       fact    that    it had happened so unexpectedly,

this is not surprising.

By this       time numbers of the Liverpool                     supporters,     including particularly

youths of 17-25 age group, many of them the worse for drink, began shouting

abuse    at    the Notts         Forest     supporters      who    they reckoned were laughing at

them.    A number of them began running up the field towards the Notts Forest

end, together with other officers I followed and turned them back.

Once    this    had       been    done     their rage was         turned on us,       we   formed a line

across the field and I was stood on the left hand side together with Police
                                                                                 PAGE 4

                                                                                  R155

Constable      Brookshaw   (Al),   Police   Constable   3131   Lewis   (FI?)   and whilst

there,   was    subject to quite an amount of abuse,           "You black bastards",      "I

hope you're fucking happy now you bastards", and others.

A lot of it was also aimed towards the F.A.

I remained at this point until about 4.35 p.m. when I returned to my serial

on Herries Road.

Whilst I had been in the ground I never saw any stewards, at the Leppings

Lane end especially on entering the ground.             Throughout the period I was in

the ground I had no idea what was going off as I had become separated from

my serial.

one of the barriers              inside the compound was twisted and                          col lapsed on

the ground.

I believe         I saw a number         of shoes on the terracing                 but     cannot     be sure

w het h e r    it was then or mi nuts            later w h e n     I was on the          perimeter t r a c k .

I w a l k e d onto the       perimeter         track    t h r o u g h the gate whi ch was open and

then saw a m a n being            carried        towards me and          it was obvious             that he

was    dead and      I then saw a further               two who were         in the same w a y whi ch

came as a great           shock.        I hurr i e d towards        the pen w here            the   people

were    coming      out an d a s s i s t e d w ith      carrying      two bodies         o u t , they had

been passed out and they were                    both laid on the grass               to the        left of

the goal posts         (facing down the ground)                 I cannot      remember what any of

these     people     looked      like or what          they were wearing.

However,        whilst    there       it was    obvious     that    there was        i n s u f ficient       room

to lay the         peo pie dow n and        I tried together w i t h other                 officers

including an          Inspector        to clear more ground to the                 left       of the g o a l f t

Howe v e r     there we re large numbers               of L i verpool      s upporters wanderi ng

some of them sa y i n g          they wer e      looking      for a friend or            relative       or

The    scene was one of total               c o n fusion an d t               as - « o o r g a n l s a fcA-txt

but due to the fact              that    it ha d h a p p e n e d so u n e x p e c t e d l y    this is not

surprising.

By this time         numbers      of the L i v erpool         supporters        including

p a r t i c u l a r l y youths   of   17-25 age group,           m a n y of them the w orse             for

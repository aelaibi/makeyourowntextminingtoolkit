             felt     that this man had been dead for                          some       time    but we kept                  trying         for

her    I thought           they were       both dead and she             felt            both men for a pulse

and said they both a pp e a r e d dead.

An Officer           came up and         I saw D C 2 8 2 D AVIS and                   I was     j.n s t r u c t e d to mo v e

of the      river area that              runs at the       back of the L e o pings Ln stand.                                The

area was        still       full    of -supporters        shouting and                   swearing and o b v iously

very    upset        and hysterical.             It was    d i fficult                to tell           if they were

under    the        influence       of   intoxicants       or just h ysterical                           with the

events      that      they had. w i tn es se d       prior     to our arrival                       at    the ground.

I requested other O f f icers                 to assist        in removing                  both men and            they

were    both        carried, in turn the 40 or 50 yards                               to an a re a o u t s i d e t h e

m ain gates          that    had been opened.             I took my anorak wit h W ILD and

placed      it a gain over           his    upper    body.     Both men were                        placed t o g ether

It was at this time                 that    I saw a press man with a g reen                                ’P r e s s ’ jacket

                 In that        statement          I said      I could         i d e ntify myself          on the V ideo         located

                 taken the first                 person,     He s t e r      B A L L B o d y No 74     from Pen 3 an d           out

                 I w o u l d now like to say that the first person                                 I       removed from P e n 3

all    males        and     they      were         drinking.

Most    of       these      people         were       Nottingham             Forest         supporters           and     were        quit-

At    about       3 . 1 5pm       (1515)       we     made       our      way     back      towards           Claywheels         Lane

for    m e a l . W h e n we          were      near        the       football         ground        and       instructed         to

stop    at       the     ground.         We    again           parked       in P e n i s t o n e        Street.

We w e n t       into     the      ground          and     waited         with       many     other       officers         at    the

North       End     near       the    Spion         Cop.        There      were       about        5 mounted           policemen

there       also.

We w e n t       o nto    the      pitch and             I was        placed         in            n g 1 i ne    o f P oi i c e

officers          facing          the W e s t       Stand        n e ar    the/centre              line       towards      the       Spio

lop.                                                       !

The    fans       in the          stand       in    f r o nVt-^fff us w e r e s h o u t i n g            abuse       and   p o i n t in

towards          the     Liverpool            end     of       the    ground.

Something           flashed          past m y         face.          I look       around          and    on    the   grass       near

I saw a          "i0 p p i e c e . S h o r 1 1 y af t e r w a r d s             the       b ack    of a s ea t       f e 11     on

the    floor        in f r o n t      of me         but        didn't       hit      me.     I c o u l d n ’t see       who      may

have    thrown           it.

Most    of       the     f a ns    were       just       wandering           aimlessly             a r o u n d the      pitch        and

others       were        carrying          makeshift             s t r e t c h e r s to       arid f r o m the         Liverpool

end    of    the       g r ourid .

I had       no    idea w h a t        h ad     happened.              I thought            there        had    been a      lar g e

fight       and     I wa s        wondering          how       they       would       get     all       these    people         on    the

Later      small        incidents             occurred             a n d we   moved         away    from     the t o u c h ! i n e

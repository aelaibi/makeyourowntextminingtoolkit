                       HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - JUSTICE CAMPAIGN


Rt Hon Michael Heseltine M.P


  am writing to ask for your support for the campaign mounted by
the Hillsborough Family Support Group for the justice and
accountability which we believe has so far been denied to us by
the complete failure of the judicial system in the aftermath of
the Hillsborough Disaster.

You should be aware that following the broadcast on Independent
Television on December 5th 1996 of the drama/documentary
"Hillsborough", the Home Secretary is presently considering
whether, on the basis of the new and unused evidence which
emerged from the programme, there are grounds for him to order a
fresh Inquiry into the Disaster. Mr Howard in fact spoke
personally in the House of Commons adjournment debate which was
held about Hillsborough on 17th December, 1996 and he later met
privately with the many family members who had travelled to
London to be present at the debate.

The Hillsborough Family Support Group is hopeful that the Home
secretary will order a fresh inquiry, particularly in the light
not only of the new evidence but also of overwhelming public
support we have received - people from all walks of life from
right across Britain have written to us and telephoned to express
their outrage and anger at the treatment of bereaved families.
However, regardless of the decision of Mr Howard, the families
have also separately instigated the following legal actions to
take forward our quest for justice

i) a complaint to the Director of Public Prosecutions seeking a
criminal investigation into possible misconduct in the way
evidence was or was not presented to the Inquest jury. This
action is based on the evidence which has now come to light of
video- technician, Roger Houldsworth, who was not called as a
witness to either the Taylor Inquiry or the Inquest and whose
existence was not known to the families until the TV programme
was made. The new evidence directly contradicts what some South
Yorkshire police officers told the jury and Taylor inquiry.

ii) an application to the Attorney General under section 13 of
the coroners act asking the High Court to consider quashing the
inquest verdict and ordering a fresh inquest.

Liverpool City Council, at an extraordinary meeting held on 19th December 1996, have
already pledged their unanimous support to the families in our campaign. With the
assistance of the City Council, the campaign is now being taken out across the country
where it is our intention to seek the support of local authorities in all areas of Britain in
response to the massive public disquiet which has emanated from the television
programme (the "Daily Mirror", for example, has received a huge response to the
petition it launched in december, on behalf of the families, supporting the call for a new
inquest into the Disaster.) The response to the programme clearly indicates this is a
matter of public intrest and should be dealt with accordingly.


The Bereaved families of Hillsborough will forever be in debt to writer Jimmy McGovern
and to Granada Television for bringing the tale of our fight for justice into homes and
^ is c ie n c e s of the British people. However, in some ways the story told on television
could not truly reflect the scale of what we have been made to endure by having the
absolute grief of losing our loved ones compounded by what can only be described as
the biggest farce and cover up in British legal history. As if this was not enough of a
burden, the families, despite the unequivocal findings of the Taylor Inquiry, have also
 had to fight to counter a concerted and seemingly intentional campaign by certain public
and media figures to scar the reputation and memories of our loved ones by blaming
them, and their fellow supporters, for causing the Disaster.


 The "Hillsborough" television programme seems at last to have washed away the
 cartload of lies about the Disaster which have stood as a barrier to the reaching of a fair
 and just conclusion about the needless deaths of 96 people. On behalf of the
 Hillsborough Family Support Group I would now urge you to help us go one step further
 and establish as a matter of public record for all time the truth of what did happen on
 that dreadful day of 15th April 1989. Only if that can be done may the bereaved families
 be able to put our loved ones finally to rest.

 Yoi

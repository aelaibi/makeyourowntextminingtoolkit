more     like       a n i m a l s\.         the       stench       of     beer      was       overpowering                 from         the       vast

numbers        that          had    obv'ious ly              been       drinking.                 There       were       Liverpool                fans

being        pushed          to    the          floor    and       their          fellow          supporters             stamping               a ll

over     them.           The       ones          I saw       get       up a g a i n      rejoined             the       push       totally

oblivious           to       the    pain          they       were       causing          to       their       own       supporters.

From     my    position             outside             the       gates       I could             see    directly             into          the          rear

middle        of    the       standing                area    of       the    West       Stand.              The    area          was       full          of

what     1 e^n          only       describe             as    ido\ts          pushing             with       nowhere          to       go     there

were     p e o p i e Tfc*eing           pushed          to    the       ground          and       walked       over,          fans          were

also     c 1i m b i n ^ o v e r             the       walls       into       what       by    now       was    obviously                a     very

dangerous           situation.

I attempted              to       haltN^he             flow       of    fans,       it       was    by       now    an     impossible

task.         As    1    looked             at    the    ones          who    had       not       yet    pushed          their          way       into

the    ground           I could             see       from    my       experience             that       they       were          not       only

drunk        but    wild          with          it,    not    listening             to       me    or    nor       to    reason.               The

fans    were        jeering,                pushing,          and       attacking             a    police          horse          with        fists            as

they    were        being          carried             along       with       the       flow.

S e e i ng    that       it       was       a    lost    cause          to    try       and       get    the       gates          closed             I

looked        towards             Leppings             Lane.\The              gates          that       are    opened             to    let       police

vehicles           gain       access             to    the    rear       oil t h e           South       Stand          w er e w id e open.                     I

then    placed           my       horse          across       this       gap                 stop       the    flow       of f a n s in a n

attempt        to       regulate                them.        By    now       we    looked          to    have       started             to      regain

control        of       the       situation,             another             horse           came       to    my    right hand side                       and

did    the     same          to    block          the    gates          next       to        the    ones       I was        at.             Iw a s

directed           towards          myself             and    two       other       mounted             o f f i c e r ’s      I    could          s ee.

Davies,        Mounted             department                appeared             and    instructed                me    to       check         tickets

another        seven       mountetsL of f i cer s                I       instructed                to    go     to       trteJ r e a r         of    the

N orth    Stand       as    we    were       informed                there       was          a    pitch        i n v a s i o n.

On    arrival        I saw       the       dog    section             with       their             dogs       out        of        their       vans

going     on    to    the       pitch,       along          with         many        foot          officers.                   A    short       while

later     the    dog       section          came       off       the       pitch          and       all       that           was        left    was       a

large     amount       of       foot       officers          facing             the       Kop.

A    message     came       over       the       radio       from          the       officer             next           to     me       saying       that

there     were       people       dead.           This       d i d n ’t         sink          in    until           I saw           a    youth       being

carried        out    on    a    stretcher             and       put       at    the          side       of     a       S t.       Johns

ambulance        out       of    the       view       of    the       public.

From     then    there          was    a    steady          stream          of       bodies             being           carried           out       some

on    stretchers           carried          by    foot       officers                and          many    more           being           carried          by-

football        fans.           They       were       by    this         time        using          the       advertising                     boards          as

make     do    forms       of    transport             for       the       bodied.

For    some     reason          I d o n ’t k n o w          why       but       I started                counting                  the    ones       that

were     obviously          dead,          the    ones       who         seemed           to       have       gone           blue        so    quick,

the    ones     with       vomit       at    the       sides          of    their             faces        on       the        stretchers,                the

woman     with       her    clothes          high          around          her       neck          as    though              someone           had

attempted        to    reviye          her.           The    most          sad       of       all       when        a    lad        who       looked          no

more     than    twelve          passed          by    us    the         police           mans          anorack              fell        from       the

body     showing       him       dead.

I    counted     to    sixty          five       or    so    and         even        then          it    just           didn't           sink       in

what     had    happened.

Ambulances           were       then       arriving          in       droves          all          sense        of       time           had    gone       and

then     the    feeling          of    horror          thinking             back          that          it w o u l d           not       have

happened        had    the       Liverpool             idiots            not     turned             up     so       late           and    in    the

drunken        stupor       they       had       got       themselves                into.

All    the     mounted          officers          at       the       back       of    the          North        Stand              were       then

deployed        to    assist          fans       on    their         way        home       after           the          game        had       been

               abandoned.

               I was    at   the    bottom      of    Hillsborough       Park,        main   gates    and   saw   a    crowd

«>jfr          of    perhaps      thirty      Fans    fighting     violently          amongst      themselves.         I

               galloped      towardsNthern           and   they   dispersed      unfortunately          I was     unable         tc

               get    hold   of    any   of    them.       They   just   h a d n ’t    had   enough.

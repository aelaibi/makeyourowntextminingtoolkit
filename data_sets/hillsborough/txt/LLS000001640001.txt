     Sent i ~ i.:ta]       of    i h e F, A.     C h a l l e n g e Cup Final between Liverpool and Nottingham

     F o r t ’i ;t .




     I a r t Lved a t           the ground about                1420      hours and       it was   absolute chaos.




     There where                rto S t e w a r d s a n d o n l y a couple of             Police   on horsebaok, who Inoticed

     w here from L iv e r p o o l.




     Some P o l i c e m a n f o l d i t s t o            s t o p crushing that the match was being put-back until

     ev ery b o d y had e n t e r e d           the ground.              We eventually got in through        the gate that
i.


     had     ;< n o p e n e d a n d w a l k e d through the tunnel.




     All     >    \t tel nt-.’ p e o p l e    v- er e s c r e a m i n g and I noticed that we could not move.           The

     lad     'v!tvat         stood next          t o me fell down and as I tried to pull him up I noticed

     tie war. u n c o n i o u s .       We h a d t o h o l d his scafe so as we kept his head up above the

     ground            l o a v o i d iiim b e i n g t r a m p l e d on.                                 ^




     There w a s bodies strewn a l l                        ar>und us and we could'nt help them because we were

     all    stuck.




     T h e r e was a            man i n f r o n t o f u s who was obviously dead and I tried                    to get to him

     to pick h i m u p but could'nt.




     We b o g i . e r i a n d s h o u t e d     at     t h e Police to kick in the fencing so that we could get

     people       '."it    fi r >; iedi cal      a'+erition,          but because the gate was totally inadequate we

 We 3 !.ed t h e                 Police              why i.hits h a d h a p p e n e d and why Notts Forrest had the larger

 end       1 the ground                            to which         t h e y g i v e n o reply.




 All     ; !ir3t g o i n g                t h r o u g h my m i n d w a s the Heysel tragedy and how those people must

 have- f e l t .




 I wa r     told             to go out                 o f the ground and as I did I passed by a lot of the dead

bodi'           w ith c o a ts                     over     th eir    heads and at one point noticed a Policeman giving

 the    i-riss o f J i f e                   to someone.




We r \     nlualy                  Jeft             t h e g r o u n d and I arrived back in Liverpool at around 9.30

a f t . ■■ t r y i n g          to        use        the     telephone       on the way home.




I was rrlin in shock until the Thursday when I went to see Dr.                                                           of

                                                                        He has put me on nerve tablets and I had to go

back      in a f o r t n i g h t s                    time a s my back, arms and legs were all-strained and my

c h e s t was h u r t i n g .                       T his      w a s explained to me as crush injuries.




I feel          as       though             I will n e v e r go to the match again, not even the Derby Match

w h e r e my friend                                                     has bought me tickets for the Stand.




I wish t o               a d d that on the Sunday I went to the Service for the bereaved but had

to l e a v e b e c a u s e                 the q u e a n d c r o w d was overwhelming.

           I am a married man with two children am also an ex-licensee, a fact I

           think is pertinent in this stat ement.

           On 15th A p r i l , 1989 <150489)   I attended Hillsborough Football Ground

           with my nine year old d a u g h t e r »               her first ever football match

           and her last.

           I was able to see the match as            I was/granted two        complementary tickets

           by one of the firms who I deal            with/.

           I drove to Hal lam Towers Hotel, Manchester Road,                  Sheffield, we had «

           meal there and then we went by            coach organised by the firm who had

           alloted us the tickets.        The coach was approximately a 5 0 seater and

           it was f u l l .
              Oi
           At approximately 2.00 pm <1400) we arrived at Leppings L ane end of

           Hillsborough F o o tbal 1 Ground.     £ saw several hundred Liverpool fans
                                                                                            PAGE
                                                                                            S47i

milling around sautside the ground and down the lane towards Peniitone

Road.     There i/ere quite a, few acting the goat in the road.                       Thttse
                             u c: ( CXiC c U j c y c t i y
fans were drttnk and I saw some d r i n k i n g .             X noticed some were drinking

Stella Artois a particularly strong drink.                      The coach driver stated

that he was not going to drop usvOff
                              U —J    at
                                      ■*W Leppings Lane because of the
                                   II *

demeanour of the crowd.            Inste        he dro ve into Penistone Road and

dropped us off there.

As I walked along Penistone Road towards Le/pings Lane with my
                                oU'^nrcJUL/ \i
daughter    I saw two fans urinating in a front garden my daughter also

saw it as she made a comment about                it.

I am a big bloke and because of the fans demeanour as I walked

towards the Lappings Lane end I have to say I was frightened and felt

threatene
     tened, more so towards my daughter behalf.                      This was because of a

menac i ng awtospf
      inq       ,phere I felt        rather than through anything directed

towards my daughter or me,

As I approached the Leppings Lane End                   1   was asked twice if I had

tickets for sale,      but   fl   said no                               / ->
                                                                               T"'-   CLA.
                                           it   P b U £2 h d
I saw quite a strong/contingent of police directly outside the

ground, they d i d n ’t^appear to be doing a n y t h i ng.            I entered the

ground and was approached by a policeman who enquired if I had any

alcohol    on me,   I /stated that     I hadn't he did not search me.                  I

approached a steward outside the North Stand and asked him where                               I

should go and/ne directed me to Stand L.                      I walked under the North

Stand until we saw signs to Row L and then we took our seats and waited

for the start of the match.            Row L is situated near to Spion Kop end

and in fact I had a very good view of the Nottingham goal mouth.

I c a n ’t really say anything about the goings on in the West Stand

because of the distance away I was seated.                      There was   clearly a

disturbance of some kind,           I thought there was a fight going on.

After a few minutes      into the start of the match the Liverpool                         side
                                                                                             PAGE

        kicked the ball which hit the crossbar of the Notting Forest side and

        it was at that time that             I became aware that the situation at U£st

        Stand had become worse and I thought thax this near goal was /he reason,
                                                             U H i ' O T
        I thought something wa^' more amiss wNysn I saw a senior policeman run

        onto the      ground and     jf    presume tell the referee to stop the match.              I

        then saw      people f m m    the West Stand beyfog brought onto the pitch in

        an injured condVtion.              I also saw people      covered with clothes over

        their heads so I presumed they had yflied.                 Even while all this was

        happening I saw Liverpool support/rs run up the pitch towards the Spion

        Kop and start to goad the N ott\ygham Forest supporters.                       The police

        restrained them.

        After sometime     it became apparent that the game was not going to

        continue,      so my daughter and I made our way back to Leppings Lane

        End,    the   way we had come.          We walked into Penistone Road where we got

        a bus into Sheffield City Centre where                  I got a taxi to the hotel

        where    I picked my car up.

        As I walked down Leppings Lane             I saw a number of Liverpool supporters

        and they were shouting abuse to a numbar of policemen who were

        positioned outside the ground the pol/ce took no action,                       they were

        very much on the receiving end.                 —I ^1/hought the fans   behaviour was

        appalling,    both going
                                                        •   /
                                          in and comirwf out,

        I have to say that in the last twenty years I have attended two

        football matches,      both at Hillsborough.              I do attend on every other

        Sunday I attend at Rugby League matches and I attend at Race Meetings

        throughout the country.              I have seen 1 outishness/and bad behaviour

        before ,

a p p a r e n t l y to    reinforce my warning.                            This was at about                   1245 pm.

1 took a meal             in the g y m na s i u m at about                        1,30       pm    (1330)      then at about

2    pm    (1400)     returned         to                        R-oadU-       There were             still     numbers       of

supp o r t e r s    sat about          drinking           on both sides of H a l i f a x Road.

At about 2 . 4 0          pm    (1440)       large        numbers            of N o t t i n g h a m Fo r e s t         supporters

were       converging          on the Hop end of the ground.                                      The m a j o r i t y a p p eared

to be a r r i v i n g       from H er r i e s Road.                   T h e y were           not we 11 b e h a v e d and

a p p e a r e d to have         been drinking                   heavily.            M any      crossed       the      road

without       regard for            the traffic, and agai n s t                           the d i r e c t i o n of a special

constable          d i r ec ti ng    traffic.             I had o c c a s i o n to speak to one youth

who       kicked at a passing                bus.         Two me n were a r r e s t e d                  near to the

t u rnstiles        by u n i f o r m e d officers.

In the main the                conduct       of these             supp o r t e r s a r r i v i n g         late was worse

than that          of the L i verpool            suppo r t e r s             I had seen.                Ha v i n g    said that,

on arrival          at    the ground,           they a p p e a r e d              to be passing t h r o u g h the

turn s t i l e s    in an orde r l y manner.

I went       into the          gr o u n d by the           large gates                   leading to the              g y m nasium at

about 2„55          pm.     (1455)          At, this            time N o t t i n g h a m Forest              supporters,           who

appeared mostly                the worse       for drink,                  were          still a r r i v i n g m a i n l y from

the d i r e c t i o n     of H er r i e s Road.

The Liv e r p o o l       s u p p o r t e r s who had been sitting                            drinking along Halifax

Roa d had gone.

I went       into     the      g y mn as iu m where a number                        of uni f o r m e d o f f icers were

taking       refreshment.              I had been there                     for a few minu t e s w h e n Chief

Inspector S u m ne r            came    in and         called all                 the uni f o r m e d officers out to

go onto the track.

At    this    stage       I do not          think a ny b o d y had any                       idea that        there were

casualties an d o f f i c e r s              thought             :it was a pitch                  invasion.

I went       to the       pitch and          stood        near        the Kop.               I saw a number             of
                                                                                                                            P AGE
                                                                                                                            RS69

          L i v erpool       s u p p o r te r s    running about        on the        pitch.       The      players         had

          already       left      the     field.          I saw one Liv e r p o o l         supporter        run the full

          l ength of the             f ield from L e p p i n g s Lane           to the Hop.            He    stood      in the

          g o a l m o ut h    in front        of the Hop g e s t i c u l a t i n g at the N o t t i n g h a m Forest

          s upporters w i t h both arms                     raised a n d ma k i n g     two finger           gestures.             On

          being a p p r o a c h e d by three               special      constables          the y o u t h    ran back

          towards       the L e p p i n g s Lane           end but was a r r e s t e d         in m i d - f i e l d    by    PC

          Brougham.            T here was a             cordon of u n i f o r m e d officers a c r o s s              the    field

          at    the L e p p i n g s L ane          end of the       ground.

          At this stage              I was        unaware     of c a sualties and            still     thought         it was a

           pitch     invasion.            1 anticipated            the m a t c h   continuing w h e n order                  had

           been    restored.

           I thought          there w ou ld be trouble                 between     rival       suppo r t e r s after          the'

           m a t c h and thought            I would         be very     late off duty.              I then went             to use

           a public          phone     to a lter a r r a n g e m e n t s      I had made        for    that     evening.

           On   returning          to the g y m n a s i u m at about 3 . SO pm                 <1520)       I was ho r r i f i e d

           to see bodies             being        taken     into   the gymnasium.              1 assisted         in keeping

           order     in the are a           outside         the g y m n a s i u m for a short          time and then

           a s s i s t e d w i t h the      handling         of bodies        in the gymnasium.

           At 6 .30      pm    <1630)       some        officers    were      being    stood down.             1 then spoke

           to Inspector Sewell                    and    informed him         I was    prepared to stay as                   long

           as   required.            At   this      stage      I was    not    enga g e d    in any      particular           role

           a n d as by this            time       every t h i n g was    under     control        1 was      no longer

           required          to as s i s t and          it was a g r e e d    1 should go off d u t y .

           Du r i n g the      time       1 was     patrolling         outside     the ground          I was appro a c h e d

           on numerous           occ a s i o n s    by Liverpool         supp o r t e r s asking         for tickets.

               r eg u l a r l y as     I can/since about              1980.     On Sat/urday 15th April             19ff9

               (150489)        I left h ome w it h my friends

               an d                          , at about            11.30am     (1130)       to see Liverpool        V Notts

               Fo re st   at H i l l s b o r o u g h    in Sheffield.

               We all      live      in the                 area an d      I was     in receipt         of a ticket

               o b t a i n e d from Liv er po ol           F.C.,   via my friend                                I paid 6

               pounds     cash to                    who    passed the m on ey on to a friend of his who                          is

               a L iverpool          season ticket           holder,

               We t r a v e l le d to the m a tc h           in               car,        a V a u x h a l 1 Cavalier.    W hen we

               left the Ml           j un ct io n    ( I ’m not sure w h i ch one              it was    but the    road we

               took     enab l ed us to travel               s t» 4ight      to the        ground),     we were    stop pe d   in

               a traffic         queue      for a bout 5TO-40 nuns.               It was       stop-start     nearly all       the
                                                                                                                  PAGE            2

          wa y to where we e v e n t u a l l y             parked.    I noti ce d as we         left the Ml       coaches

          had been       pulled       into       lay-bys and        1 saw Police        boarding them.         The

          coaches were          off the          road and     not    causing any        particular      traffic

          problem.       I assume          the    delay and slow m ov i ng            traffic was      due    to the

          large     volume      of vehicles           trying       to get    to the     ground.     We e ve nt u al l y

          a r r i v e d about       1 mile       from the     ground     on the A61         I think,

          and    parked      in a lay-by           near some        shops.    It was about          1 .15pm    (1315)       by

          now,    I seem to recall                the traffic w a s n ’t too bad as we w al k ed                 towards

          the    around.                              /

                                                          It was    packed w i t h supporters.          The     staff

                                                      was    for    locals an d we ente re d the              pub via a

          side    passage.          Everybody       inside was happy and singing.                    I didn't     see

          anybody       drunk       or b eh av in g       badly.    We were       in the    pub till about 2 .1 0p m

          (1410).       I had drunk a             pint of     lager shandy and one              pint of       lager,    w he n

          I left.

          We all      then w<                                               ance where at about 2. 3 0 p m

          (1430)      we met                                                ot v i si te d the      pub as he'd        left

          wanted      to get        into    the gr ou nd for         the start        of the match.       I did see

          two young        lads      being       lifted over        p e o p l e ’s heads   towards     the

          turnstiles,         t h e y ’d o b v i o u s l y been e x pe ri en ci ng         problems    in the     crowd.

          By    now my group had all                been separated.           There     didn't      seem to be any

          order     near     the     gates       or the turntiles.           People were shouting at the

          Police,      but they just c o u l d n ’t cope, and d i d n ’t s eem to know what                             to

P o liceman.          I heard him say s omething                     like,      ,!I was    being     crushed."       I

d o n ’t know what             h ap pe n ed to him after               that.       I w ou ld describe        the    crowd

S.45pm       (1445).        I didn't           see a ny gates          op en ed     leading    into the ground.

I met all my friends a g ai n                        just     inside    the     turnstile and because

We    reached our matj^'i viewing                        point     in Pen 2 at the           rear wall and          very

near     the; barrier w it h Pen 3 at about 2 . 5 0 p m                            (1450).    I noticed our Pen

2 was      reas o n ab ly empty.

This     did s ur prise me.                 I looked over           to Pens 3 and 4 to my               left and

noti c e d       i m m e di at el y    it was        packed.       At this      stage     it d i d n ’t look any

more     packed         than    I w o ul d        have     e xp ec te d for a big match,             I was

s u r p r i s e d th ou gh at the amount                    of space      in our Pen No 2.

The    teams        came    on at about 2 . 5 5 p m              (1435)    and the game started at about

3pm    (1500).          I d i d n ’t pay too m uch a t t e n t i o n to the                  crowd as       I was

w at c h i n g    the    players.           The   game      started and                 wrought my a t te nt io n

to    people        climbing          up the       perimeter        fence at       the front        of Pens 3 and

4.    I could see           people wa vi ng              their arms about at the Police                     near    the

fence.       I c a n ’t recall              if any gates were             open at the front             of the      pens.

More a n d more            people       began to           climb over      the     fence     onto    the    pitch.

The    crowd began to                 crowd towards            the L i ve rp oo l     goal mouth.          I saw a

Policeman           run on the          pitch towards              the R ef er ee and the           players     left

the    pitch.        By this     time       people were          reaching         down from the stands and

pulling        fans out of the              crowds       in Pens 3 and 4,               it was     very    confusing,

and    I saw more and more                  people       being    pulled up into the stands.

P e o p le    in the stands wer e                shouting,       "Get up here."               I sensed an urge nc y

in the way one man s.poke to me.                          A l t ho u gh    I was     in Pen 2,               go t

lifted up into             t s t a n d s         before me,       I hel p ed him up,             then someone

gave me a lifV^up.                I not even sure how.                    the    next thing        I knew a well-

built manVarged a bout 3 5 - 4 0 g r ab be d me and                         pulled me u p . He was            very

strong and           pulled me        right       over    the    barrier         in one go.        I stood up in

the    stands and          looked around,            the     pitch was           full    of    people,     some     lying

down,        others    o b v i o u sl y    injured.       I saw     people        giving others           the kiss        of

life.

I saw a white man a bo ut 50 yrs,                         wit h white           hair and with a stocky

build        lying    near    the S S ta n d/ W S ta nd           corner         post.    I seen a P o l i c e m a n

cover        the mans      face w it h a jacket              that was           white and dirty           looking.

Still        at this     point m an y        people were          being         pulled up from the terraces

into     the stands          by m a i n ly farts. People were                    still    being     pulled out

over     the     perimeter        fence.

I h eard one          fan a p p r o a c h a P o l i c e m a n     in the stands and state                   he was a

medical        student       or s o me th in g      similar and w a n t ed to help on the

pitch.        The P o l i c e m a n   said,       there was       nothing         he could do,         and he

c o u l d n ’t go on the          pitch.         He said,       "They know what               t h e y ’re doing,"     or

w ords       to that     effect.          A couple       of Li ve rp oo l        supp or te rs     became    very

irate and a ng ry a bout                  this and shouted at               the Policeman.

It was        still    very     confusing,          I d i d n ’t know           really what was           happening

and    c o u l d n ’t believe         what       I had seen.

I saw an a m bu la nc e a r r i ve and drive to be hi nd the Liverpool                                     goal.     It

events        had started         to happen.

             fence.       I was a bit           c on fu se d at first whe n               I saw them start             to do this.

             I didn't        see any actual              bodies       in the terraces               but must     have     seen at

             least     half a dozen             lying       on the        pitch.      I think       it must     have    been about

             4.30pm       (1630)        before     the      people        in pens 3 and 4 were                completely-

             cleared. I e v e nt u al l y          left      the ground at about                4.40pm        (1640)    wit h my

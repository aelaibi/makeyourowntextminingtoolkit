MEETING WITH MERVYN JONES, NICK POSTER, MALCOLM ROSS.
THE MEETING WAS FILMED BY THE B.B.D. FOR DOCUMENTARY
WHICH THEY INTEND TO SHOW AFTER THE INQUEST WHEN THE           «
INQUIRIES ARE COMPLETED.___________________________ _


We discussed the present state of play, in particular Nick
Foster pointed out that they were making reasonable progress
with the identification of individuals.     He produced
some plans showing that everything up to 75 had been identified
either alive or dead or both at various positions on the
terraces and in the ground.

It is clear from the plan that there was a certain amount
of clustering around the broken barrier.

Nick Foster pointed out that one case No.80 was clearly
identified as alive and apparently well at about 5 past 3
and yet subsequently, he was found to be dead.     This of
course is well outside the time when Gate C was opened.

Although it had not yet been established, it appeared that
there was a surge diagonally across Pen 3 from the opposite
corner to^the tunnel entrance.     They were still working
on this/was obviously a very interesting observation if
in fact it could be established but it might explain
the reason why somebody like Case 80 might have died
         from his position he might have been caught by
such a surge.

Nick Foster also reported that of the number dead, about 20%
had actually come in to the ground when Gate C was opened.
This again is very interesting because if the Pens were
packed solid prior to a surge, well even if they were not
packed completely solid, it's difficult to see how these
people who must by definition have come in from the back,
manage to get through.     It might be that this was due to
a sort of wedge effect.

The Health & Safety Executive had oompleted the report,
copy of which was handed'-1© me.   This was being dose for
the Inquiry.

We discussed the question of alcohol and the possible effect
                            ht>*>
V ’lOO supporters had been present prior to the match.      There
were? of course many other, pubs where supporters were not
in such large numbers.     In addition, off-licences had sold
alcohol.    Gateway I think or one of the Supermarkets nearby
had sold £1*.300 in less than an hour.

There was some reference made to the crush at the outer gates.
This needs some further illucidation.

Lord Justice Taylor1s inquiryeis now scheduled to end in
the first week or so of July.     Apparently Dr. Ashton has given
evidence at the inquiry.    He was the gentleman who rang up
and wanted to be heard without fail, either there or at the
Inquests.

Work was progressing on the individual cases.      Plow eharts were
being prepared.   The intention being that they should chase
the individual from leaving home to the point of death.       We
discussed- the^fffortaat'-'and in particular the central time core,
should it possibly be identical over the crucial period, so
that one could compare different charts directly.

 We discussed the video evidence.     I said that I thought we would
have to show the jury certainly the compilation of the video and
possibly some others.    Mervyn pointed out that some of the videos
showed very distressing scenes which might be upsetting for the
families.   He was very anxious that we should not cto this unless
it was absolutely necessary.    I agreed and said that we would
have to review the videos in due course.

Ve discussed the photographic evidence.     They had defined a system
whereby photographs could be photocopied.      They had a photocopying
process which was much cheaper.     It is not quite clear who would
be responsible for the costs of these.     Mervyn.mentioned that
it was my responsibility.    I did not take this up with him
at the time, althcmgUu&tuiM           ^ supplied with photographs
by the police on a Free of Charge basis.

We agreed that we would have to meet fairly soon,in order to establish
what photographs would be required for the Inquests.

We thought that we would still be in a position to be on target for us
to start in the middle of January.

The work on the individual files of the deceased was progressing and
they would let me have these.

They were making arrangements to let me have copy statements of all the
witnesses who had given evidence at the inquiry togetherwtaEthejmyiv
additional ones which they^ggi^lgnget hold of at the present time.          The
full report of the Insresi/ will of course be forwarded to me.        The
volume of statements was absolutely enormous at the present time already.
                 particular the case which I .had mentioned to Mervyn.   This
            being investigated by trying to establish what if anything had
    actually been drunk.

            POLICE CONSTABLE 2471 RICHARD TWIGG

            DOG SECTION BASED AT ECCLESFIELD



            On Saturday    15 April    1989 (150489),        I commenced duty at 8.00am (0800)

            together with my dog at Niagara Kennels,              in order to exercise him and

            prepare the patrol van before the briefing at 9.00am (0900).



            At, 9.00am   (0900) together with all other dog handlers,           I attended in

            the club at Niagara where we were briefed by Inspector PHENIX a s to

            our duties that day.        I was    informed that I would be working        in

            company with Police Constable 3709 BAKER of West Yorkshire Dog Section

            and we would be patrolling along Middlewood Rd from Catch Bar Ln out

            to Dee pear.      Our meal time was to be 3.45 pm (1545) and we were to
                                                                      PAGE         2
                                                                      S3292

resume   patrol of Catch Bar Ln area on completion of our meal,

10 minutes before the end of the game.



At 10.00am (1000) we took up our patrol area and continually cruised

up and down Middlewood Rd from Catch Bar Ln out as far as Deepcar

Police Station and back.        There was very little activity in Deepcar

and Oughtibridge so we        concentrated on the area from Middlewood Tavern

to the Park Hotel     public houses.



The first build up of Liverpool supporters        I saw was directly across

Middlewood Rd from Middlewood Tavern where there were a group of

approximately 20 men, all of whom were drinking pints of beer or lager

and all were well behaved.



At   11.55am (1155) we attended behind the Beeley Wood Public House

where a Special Constable had found a suspicious car.         On checking the

car out via FI Control we found that it was stolen.         We remained with

the vehicle until we were informed the owper could not be contacted.
                                        //
Resumed patrol at 12.05pm (1205).  At Mfiis time there was a marked

increase in cars and pedestrians on fniddlewood Rd.        There were a large

number of people seated on the waj/1 outside the Sheffield We dnesday

training ground, many of them having cans of beer and lager on the

wall   beside them,   some having/in excess of 8 large cans, although I

d i d n ’t see anyone being disifrderly in any way other than a bit of

singing.    The crowds   in       around Middlewood Rd continued to increase

steadily up to 2.10pm (A l O )     when a call was given that officers

wanted a little assistance        in clearing the Horse and Jockey public

house.     We followed Another transit to the pub where upon our arrival

I saw a very large Lrowd in the front car park of the premises.            There

was broken glass on The floor and in the road,        empty glasses were    left
                                                                            PAGE    3
                                                                            S3292

on top of cars parked in front of the pub and hundreds of empty beer

and lager cans were strewn about.         People were laying on a grass bank

opposite the pub with a full      pint glass in each hand.       Men were

laying,    standing and sitting   in the car park with a pint of beer         in

each hand and another full     pint on the floor at their feet.          I saw a

man approximately 6 ’ tall, white,     crew cut hair,      beer belly, wearing a

yellow shirt and jeans carry 4 pints of lager into the car park and

begin to drink them one by one.       Officers began to usher the fans off

towards the ground and this man offered me his half full fourth pint

saying,    "Here mate I c a n ’t manage this one".   I had watched him

consume three and a half pints in approximately 15 minutes.



As the pub and car park cleared at 2.25pm        <1425)    three women from the

premises   came out with black bin liners and began to clear up all the

empty cans and glasses.      One white youth wearing a white top was so

drunk he was being supported by two other men as they went down

Wads 1ey Ln, another    lad was staggering badly,    but the others did not

appear too bad.



As we had this crowd under escort, a call came over that there was

trouble at the Park Hotel     public house.    On our arrival there, which

took only one minute,     everything was in order.        Police Sergeant

JOHNSON'S transit was already at the scene and I was informed by that

officer that all was under     control.     I then went back up Wadsley Ln to

search for any stragglers from the Horse and Jockey.            Whilst   in the

area I made a check of the Beehive public house at the top of Far Ln

and there was a good number of fans making their way down Far Ln

towards the ground.      A short time later I heard Superintendent

M A R S H A L L ’S voice over the radio saying open the gates because there

was still a large crowd in Leppings Ln from Catch Bar Ln.            I could see
                                                                            PAGE       4

Leppings Ln e n d , I then^ffear d his voice come over the radi o to *open

the bloody g a t e ' ^ / f t was obvious from his voice that the situation at

the Leppings^fcfn turnstiles was very serious.         From where we were we

could see/that the crowd outside the gates was so large that it

spilleff across Leppings L n .      We got out of our vehicle and stopped any
       /
further supporters making their way towards the ground,             telling them

to take their time as the match was delayed.           As we were doing this a

call   came aver for all dog handlers to go immediately to Gate 0 and

onto the pitch.         Once back in the vehicle we made our wav to Gate 0

and parked the van in the central        reserve of Penistone Rd.



Together with other dog handlers,        I then made my way into the ground

where we were told to wait on the slip ramp leading down onto the

playing area.      There was obviously a      lot of noise and at        this time I

was under the impression that it was          some sort of public       order

situation.      I saw one lad walk up the ramp with an obvious broken arm

but at that time I saw no other casualties.           After being stood there

for a short time we were told to return to our vehicles by Police
      1^'i-
Sergeant HILL of the Dog Section and await further instructions.



Once back outside        information started to filter out     (not over the

radio) as to what had happened and ambulances and other Police

vehicles started to arrive.



I assisted in traffic duty outside Gate 0 for the ambulances.               After a

while,     I d o n ’t know how long, we were again told to take our dogs into

the ground.      This time we went onto      the pitch and formed        up in front

of the Nottingham Forest Fans on the          Hop.    Inside the ground Isaw       a

cordon of police across the centre of the pitch and some supporters
                                                                              PAGE            5
                                                                              S3292

walking about    in a d a z e .   From where I was      I couldn’t see anyone    lying

on the ground.     I saw two Liverpool          fans ejected from the South Stand

near the Hop end because they were seated with Nottingham fans and an

argument was taking place.           The fans on the Hop obviously realised

what had happened and the majority of them stood in silence.                On

several occasions     it was asked over the radio if the game was going to

be called off and the reply was,             that it was,   but we were not to

inform supporters at this time because if they left the stadium it

would impede emergency services.             We remained in the ground until        it

was announced that the match was cancelled then as fans started to

leave we went outside.        Myself and Police Constable               went on foot

to the roundabaout at Penistone Rd/Leppi ngs Ln,              but all fans passing

that way were subdued and orderly.



A call came over the radio of fighting in Hillsborough Park,               but we

did not attend.     Once the crowd at our location had started to thin

out we made our way back to the van.              A few of the crowd were abusive,

 but very upset,    one man saying,          "You d o n ’t need fucking dogs, you

need stretchers".



By the time we got back to the van, supporters were being loaded onto

buses to go back to Midland Station and so we made our way over

Shirecliffe and dropped down into the City Centre.                It took so long to

get into the City Centre that fans that had walked from the ground

were already walking up Snig Hill.              We escorted a group of them to the

Midland Station where we remained until the football P S V ’s arrived.                    A

call   came over the radio of fighting in Pond S t . so we made our way

onto Platform    ’B ’ where there were two rival groups of supporters.                   We

then used our dogs on short leads to disperse the groups which worked

and there was no further          incident    in Pond St.   We returned to Midland
                                                                               PAGE      <b

         Station where all was quiet.       The dog handlers   present were then told

         by Police Sergeant DENT of the Dog Section to return to Niagara,        this

         being approximately tb.OOpm (1800).



         On our return to Niagara we were told to go into the club and await

         further instructions.      At 6 .35pm <1835)   I was told by Inspector PHENIX

         to stand d o w n .   I went off duty at 7.00pm   (1900).



         Throughout the whole incident I did not see any dead bodies.



         The only Stewards      I recall seeing were the ones opening and shutting

         Gate 0.

               Further to my previous        report whilst waiting outside gate 0 on

               Penistone Rd I assisted ambulances arriving at the scene by directing

               them into the gate which leads to the gymnasium and as they came/6ut

               of gate 0 I waved them out as the road was clear.                Police Transit Vans

               which had attended at the ground were parked near to gate 0 but they

               did not block the entrance although they did reduce the 2 lane^t of the

               carriageway to 1.         I was not involved in this duty for long mit the re

               did not seem to be any trouble in the flow of ambulances directly

               outside gate 0 while I was there.            I could see an ambulance trapped in

               traffic approaching the ground from City prior to Herries Rd.

                Further to my previous report.        As a result of the instruction for all

                Dog Handlers to attend at Gate 0 I made my way to Penistone Rd and

                parked my van in the central     reserve along with another dog van driven

                by POL PC 1443 ELLIS,     2 other dog vans were parked against the kerb on

                Penistone Rd between Gate 0 and the gate that gives access to the

                gymnasium.    Police Transit vans that started to arrive at the scene as

                a result of Operation Support were also parked in front of the ground

                on Penistone Rd City Centre,     side of Gate 0 leaving one lane of the

                carriageway clear.

                Whilst standing on the centre reserve I saw an ambulance ti^t had

                driven into the ground via Gate 0 was having difficulty h a v i n g the

                ground because h.e was having to reverse out.          Once this ambulance/had
                                                                             PAGE   2
                                                                             S3292B

         the gate for the gymnasium so that they could go in one gate and then

         come out of Gate 0 all subsequent ambulances that arrived whilst      I

         was standing in Penistone Rd were directed to do the same.

         Once emergency vehicles came out of Gate 0 they turned left along

         Peni stone Rd towards the roundabout at Leppings Ln all this route was

         kept   clear by Police Officers doing traffic duty.

         A traffic mobile was doing duty on Penistone Rd opposite the bottom of

         Merries Rd directing vehicles from City up Herries Rd so as to keep

         the stretch of Penistone Rd in front of the ground clear.

         Unfortunately there were so many vehicles that ambulances approaching

         the ground from City were getting caught up in the traffic tail back.

         I do not know how long I was waiting      in Penistone Rd until all Dog

         Handlers were ordered into the ground but when I did go in, there was

         traffic motorcyclist showing ambulances where to enter the ground.

         I do not know details of other officers at the location where I was

         other than POL PC 1443 ELLIS who did not assist me because there was

         no need.     On the whole,   it appeared that once at the ground ambulances

         had a clear run into and out of the pick of the area.

             Dear Mr Green
             Pat HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER
             1.         You will of course be awars that on the 15 th. of April an
                        incident occurred at the Hillsborough Football Ground w*^ch
                        resulted in the loss of 9 5 lives as well as injury to other
                        spectators.

             2.         Lord Justice Taylor vas charged vith boldine a ^ubl^° ^ ? ™ t l n d
                        and that the first part of it has been completed. I understand
                        that Lord Justice Taylor’s interim report is being published
                        on h August 1989*
             3.          As Coroner for South Yorkshire West District, it falls to me
                         to deal vith the deaths by way of Inquest.

              k .        It is my present intention to resume the Inquests on the 15
                         January 1990*
              5.         Mr Hytner QC in his oral submission to Lord Justice Taylor
                         at the close of the oral evidence stated:-
                         "It is no secret, and I say this at once, that many of the
                         bereaved have specifically instructed us that ^             ,
                         consideration to be given to criminal ;roaeo^ ® “    is ntt
                         prosecutions in due course, but this they understand is not
                         the time nor the place for that to be said.
               6,         This point is also reported rather more specifically in the
                          Dailv Telegraph, Saturday 15 Otily where it is stated*-
                          ^ • S o lic it o r s 'r e p r e s e n t in g                th e b e re a v e d and
                           the Inquest is likely, to return ver di cts of
                           Thev sav that if the Crown Prosecutor fails to act they will

                           ^ o S P of Liverpool Solicitors said yesterday that her clients
                           were more interested in seeking prosecutions than f i n i n g
                           compensation payments.     A substantial num er were          were
                           to ensure those they felt were responsible for the death.

           Mr A Green QC



                   Ferry Disaster which claimed 193 lives was issued at Bow Street
                   last month. Mr Michael Humphries of the Liverpool Solicitors
                   Group said *My clients want the people responsible for this
                   disaster made to pay the proper price for what has happened*,"

           7*     You will of course be fully aware of the provisions of*
                  Section l6(l)(a) of the Coroners Act 1988 which in effect
                  provides that where the Clerk of the Magistrate1*s Court
                  informs the Coroner that certain serious offences have been
                  charged, the Coroner shall in the absence of reason to the
                  contrary adjourn the Inquest. Sub section l6(l)(b) is even
                  wider in scope and enables the Director of Public Prosecutions
                  to request the Coroner to adjourn an Inquest in certain
                  circumstances.
                  Section 16(2) provides savings which enable the Coroner not
                  to adjourn Inquests which fall within Section l6(l) or where
                  having adjourned an Inquest, he; may be permitted to proceed,
                  I believe in fact that where Inquests are adjourned by
                  Coroners under Section. 1 6 (1) it is in fact very rare for the
                  Coroner to resume these, and the matter is usually completed
                  under the provisions of Section 16(4) and (5 )#

           8*      Rule 27 of the Coroners Rules 1984 substantially covers the
                   point covered in Clause 16(1)(a) of the Coroners Act 1 9 8 8 ,

           9.      Rule 28 of the Coroners Rules provide that if during the
                   course of an Inquest evidence is given from which it appears
                   to the Coroner that the death of the deceased is likely to
                   be due to an offence within Rule 26.3 and that a person
                   might be charged with such an offence, then the Coroner,
                   unless he has previously been notified by the Director of
                   Public Prosecutions that adjournment is unnecessary, shall
                   adjourn the Inquest for 14 days or such longer period as he
                   may think necessary and send to the Director particulars of
                   that evidence.
                   At any time before the date fixed for the holding of the
                   adjourned Inquest the Director of Public Prosecutions may ask
                   the Coroner for further adjournment and the Coroner may
                   comply with his request.

Mr A Green QC



10. I appreciate that you have not yet had an opportunity to
    assess the evidence in the Hillsborough Disaster, and therefore
    are not presumably in a position to say whether any charges
    may be brought which fall within~the provisions of* Section
    l6 (l)(a) or Section l6 (l)(b),

1 1 # I also fully appreciate that it would not be right for you
     to take any decision purely upon what legal representatives
     of bereaved families might say or what is stated in newspaper
     articles,

12, However, these comments are very relevant to me because they
    indicate the line of thinking which at least a portion of
    the interested parties are likely to pursue*

13* You will of course be aware of Regina v St ,1 Pancras Coroner*s
    Court ex party Higgins, Divisional Court QBD, 23 May 1 9 8 8 ,
    where their Lordships appeared to indicate that a Coroner can
    withdraw the verdict of Unlawful Killing from the Jury where
    there was no evidence which could conceivably have amounted
    in law as sufficient to justify such a verdict,

14, You will appreciate that it is impossible for me to take a
    view until in fact the evidence has been given at the Inquests,
    and it will be at that stage no. doubt that I will have to
    decide whether there is evidence which can be left to the
    Jury to consider a verdict of Unlawful Killing or whether the
    evidence is of such a nature that 1 can properly withdraw
    that verdict from their consideration,

15* This position precisely encapsulates the problem which I
    am now faced with;-

    a, X anticipate that it will be necessary to call a considerable
       number of witnesses and that consequently the Inquests will
       take some considerable time* This apart from being
       expensive will of course generate a great deal of stress
       both for the bereaved but also for the witnesses, some of
       whom may well wish to shield under the provisions of Rule 22
       (Rule against Self Incrimination),

Director of Public Prosecutions

Dear Mr Green

R e : HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

1.     You will of course be aware that on the 15th of April an
        incident occurred at the Hillsborough Football Ground which
        resulted in the loss of 95 lives as well as injury to other
        spectators.

2.     Lord Justice Taylor was charged with holding a Public Inquiry
        and that the first part of it has been completed.   I understand
        that Lord Justice Taylorfs interim report is being published
       on h August 1989.
                                                                     I
3.     As Coroner for South Yorkshire West District, it falls to me
        to deal with the deaths by way of Inquest.

k .    It is my present intention to resume the Inquests                                    on the 15
        January 1990.

5*      Mr Hytner QC in his oral submission to Lord Justice Taylor
        at the close of the oral evidence stateds-
        "It is no secret, and I say this at once, that many of the
        bereaved have specifically instructed us that they wish
        consideration to be given to criminal prosecution or criminal
        prosecutions in due course, but this they understand is not
        the time nor the place for that to be said.n

6. This point is also reported rather more specifically in the
    Daily Telegraph, Saturday 15 July where it is stated*-
    ‘'Solicitors representing the bereaved and injured believe that
    the Inquest is likely, to return verdicts- of :,TTnlawful Killing*.
   They say that if the Crown Prosecutor fails to act they will
    seek leave to begin private criminal action against the people
    they hold responsible. Miss Elizabeth Steele, Chairman of a
    group of Liverpool Solicitors said yesterday that her clients
    were more interested in seeking prosecutions than gaining
    compensation payments.    A substantial number were determined
    to ensure those they felt were responsible for the deaths were
    "Brought to book” she said. A summons alleging corporate
    manslaughter by P & 0 European Ferries following the Zebrugge

Mr A Green QC



       Ferry Disaster which claimed 193 lives was issued at Bow Street
       last month* Mr Michael Humphries of the Liverpool Solicitors
       Group said ?*My clients want the people responsible for this
       disaster made to pay the proper price for what has happened*.**

7.     You will of course be fully aware of the. provisions of
       Section l6 (l)(a) of the Coroners Act 1988 which in effect
       provides that where the Clerk of the Magistrates* s Court
       informs the Coroner that certain serious offences have been
       charged, the Coroner shall in the absence of reason to the
       contrary adjourn the Inquest* Sub section l6 (l)(b) is even
       wider in scope and enables the Director of Public Prosecutions
       to request the Coroner to adjourn an Inquest in certain
       circumstances.
       Section 16 (2 ) provides savings which enable the Coroner Hot
       to adjourn Inquests which fall within Section 1 6 (1 ) or where
       having adjourned an Inquest, her may be permitted to proceed.
       I believe in fact that where Inquests are adjourned by
       Coroners under Section t6 (1 ) it is in fact very rare for the
       Coroner to resume these, and the matter is usually completed
       under the provisions of Section 16(4) and (5)*

8*     Rule 27 of the Coroners Rules 1984 substantially covers the
       point covered in Clause 16( 1) (a), of the Coroners Act 1988.

9*     Rule 28 of the Coroners Rules provide that if during the
       course of an Inquest evidence is given from which it appears
       to the Coroner that the death of the deceased is likely to
       be due to an offence within Rule 26.3 a*id that a person
       might be charged with such an offence, then the Coroner,
       unless he has previously been notified by the Director of
       Public Prosecutions that adjournment is unnecessary, shall
       adjourn the Inquest for 14 days or such longer period as he
       may think necessary and send to the Director particulars of
       that evidence.
       At any time before the date fixed for the holding of the
       adjourned Inquest the Director of Public Prosecutions may ask
       the Coroner for further adjournment and the Coroner may
       comply with his request.

Mr A Green QC



10* X appreciate that you have not yet had an opportunity to
    assess the evidence in the Hillsborough Disaster, and therefore
    are not presumably in a position to say whether any charges
    may be brought which fall within'the provisions of Section
    l6(l)(a) or Section l6(l)(b).

1 1 * 1 also fully appreciate that it would not be right for you
      to take any decision purely upon what legal representatives
      of bereaved families might say or what is stated in newspaper
      articles*

12, However, these comments are very relevant to me because they
    indicate the line of thinking which at least a portion of
    the interested parties are likely to pursue,

13* You will of course be aware of Regina, v St,' Pancras Coroner* s
    Court ex party Higgins, Divisional Court QBD, 23 May 1 9 8 8 ,
    where their Lordships appeared to indicate that a Coroner can
    withdraw the verdict of Unlawful Killing from the Jury where
    there was no evidence which could conceivably have amounted
    in law as stifficient to justify such a verdict,

14, You will appreciate that it is impossible for me to take a
    view until in fact the evidence has been given at the Inquests,
    and it will be at that stage no doubt that X will have to
    decide whether there is evidence which can be left to the
    Jury to consider a verdict of Unlawful Killing or whether the
    evidence is of such a nature that I can properly withdraw
    that verdict from their consideration,

15. This position precisely encapsulates the problem which I
    am now faced with*-

    a. I anticipate that it will be necessary to call a considerable
       number of witnesses and that consequently the Inquests will
       take some considerable time. This apart from being
       expensive will of course generate a great deal of stress
       both for the bereaved but also for the witnesses, some of
       whom may well wish to shield under the provisions of Rule 22
       (Rule against Self Incrimination).

16. I am particularly anxious not to get into a situation where
    having started the resumed Inquests I am forced to stop
    because I am requested to do so , or because I have to under
    the provisions of Rule 28. This would create considerable
    distress I am sure to relatives and witnesses and would
    leave us open to the criticism that we have not covered a
    situation which is foreseeable in view of the comments referred
    to in paragraphs 5 and 6 above*

17* You will of course know that if we were dealing with a serious
    Road Traffic Incident where Section 1 proceedings were
    contemplated, fm.i u.unniplL under the Road Traffic Act 1972,
    it would be the normal practice to adjourn the Inquest until
    such time as the CPS have indicated whether or not they intend
    to proceed under that Section.     If they indicated that they
    do not wish to proceed, then we would deal with the Inquest
    in the normal way. If they do decide to charge someone,
    then the provisions of Section 16 of the Coroners Act 1988
    would apply.

18. It seems to me in 1?is case that there are two possible
    courses open as far as my Inquests and your involvement
    are concerneds—

    a* You can notify me that you have no objection to me proceeding
       with the Inquests and that you do not require me to
       adjourn the Inquests notwithstanding that evidence may be
       given which might require me to leave the possible verdict
       of Unlawful Killing with the Jury. You will of course
       appreciate that it is their decision not mine as to what
       verdict they bring in*
       I imagine that this situation must have arisen in the
       Zebrugge Inquest undertaken by Mr Sturt at Dover*

   b* The alternative would of course be for you to request me
      to adjourn the Inquests before I resume until such time as
      you have completed your investigations, and then in the
      light of your decision, one would have to decide whether
      or not the Inquests should be resumed or dealt with under
      Section 16 Coroners Act 1988.

19. You will appreciate that there is a considerable amount of
    public interest in this disaster as well as a great deal of
    anxiety and personal grief.  I am very anxious that whatever
    is done by me should be done correctly, but with a view to
    minimising the upset and pain which the Hillsborough Disaster
    has, is and will cause*

20. I would be grateful if I could hear from you as soon as
    Possible. Irrespective of what the decision might be,
    several urgent matters have to be dealt with and I would like
    an indication of your thinking. If it would help to discuss
    this a mutually convenient time could I am sure be arranged.

             I forward herewith a letter that I have written to Captain Taylor following
             a telephone discussion I had with him yesterday.  The contents, which
             follow on our discussion of Friday of last week, are self-explanatory.

            I would be grateful if you could acknowledge this letter and enclosure as
            the agreed procedure which, so far as I am concerned, can be put into
            practice immediately. We will, of course, continue to liaise through Chief
            Superintendent Don Denton.

         SERVICE OF REGULATION 7 NOTICES

         On Friday of last week I spoke to Stuart Anderson in South Yorkshire who
         described to me that some officers were 'suffering' as a result of the
         after effects of the Hillsborough disaster.  In particular, the service of
         Regulation 7 Notices on some officers could exacerbate the situation.   In
         order to avoid aggravating the situation with those individuals I have
         agreed to continue the policy of making arrangements to see officers
         through South Yorkshire Police's liaison officer, Chief Superintendent Don
         Denton.  It is Mr Denton's responsibility to liaise with their own Force
         Welfare Officer to ensure that any individual problems are not worsened.

         Mr Anderson has said that in exceptional circumstances there may be some
         individuals where it would be thought appropriate that a South Yorkshire
         Police Officer could serve the Regulation 7 Notice on behalf of the
         Investigating Officer and without a West Midlands Police Officer being
         present.  I understand that you have had a discussion with Mr Anderson and
         you have agreed that this is acceptable.

         I also agree in principle that this could occur in those cases where South
         Yorkshire Police reasonably believe that this would prevent further
         complications.  However, I would not like this procedure to be routine for
         all officers regardless of their state of health. Mr Anderson agrees.
         I feel that it is appropriate that the South' Yorkshire Police Officer
         serving the Notice must not be an officer engaged on any duty on the day


                                                                                        Cont.
  PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE A T ................ Birmingham
in connection with Hillsborough.  Secondly, that should the officer being
served with the Notice make any reply then this should be duly noted in
accordance with the Police Discipline Regulations and the Police and
Criminal Evidence Act. Thirdly, that the officer who serves the Notice
should complete a short statement to that effect and forward it to me so
that I can take the appropriate action, which includes-, of course, sehding
you a copy of the Notice and details of its service.   Following our
telephone conversation of yesterday which agreed this procedure, I have
taken the liberty of forwarding a copy of this letter to Mr Anderson.
 NOTE FOR FILE

 13 October 1989

 I raised the question of the   service of Notices on officersand pointed
 out that the first constable   to receivesuch a Notice was so badly-
 affected that he was now off   duty sick.

 I agreed with Captain Taylor that we would serve Notices if it was felt
 that it was appropriate in certain cases. Mr Jones agreed with this
 action but said that basically he would prefer to do so in order to avoid
 any suggestion of malpractice.

  In the first instance he will contact Chief Superintendent Denton who will
  in turn consult with               who will be happy to advise in terms of
  who should serve a Notice, ourselves or West Midlands. Chief Supt Denton
- will also inform the officer's Divisional Commander who may have knowledge
  about the officer not known to

        H K CO S D N S R ’S INQUIRY - IDEfTTIFiCATIOK OP THE DECEASED

        I era replying to your letter of 21 June 1989 on behalf of Mr Wright as I am the
        officer responsible for welfare within the Force.

        I greatly appreciate the concern you show for the officers who will inevitably
        have to be interviewed for continuity purposes.

        You will appreciate that many officers have sought advice and counselling.    I
        personally am not aware of the names of those officers as I believe it is
        crucial to maintain confidentiality, however, if you would cere to communicate
        with the Principal YJelfare Officer,                    |with a list of officers
        you wish to interview she will make a judgment as to any action that m a y be
*   •   necessary where she is aware of possible difficulties.

        By this means I hope that we nay reduce trauma to individuals in a most
        sympathetic way.

                  HM CORONER’S INQUIRY - IDENTIFICATION OF THE DECEASED

                  As I know you are fully aware,- I am pursuing enquiries on behalf of
                  Dr S Popper, HM Coroner - South Yorkshire (West District), into the deaths
                  of the ninety five at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989-

                  Our investigation is proceeding with all speed, using the visual
                  evidence kindly supplied by yourselves and others to help in the
                  location of the deceased, both when they were alive and subsequently.
                  However, as I know you appreciate, continuity will have to be
                  established for each of the deceased and it will be necessary for me to
                  make contact with a number of your officers who were involved on the
                  day. It is likely that we will require my officers to interview some of
                  yours as well as show visual evidence in order to establish
                  identification and continuity.

                   To make progress I will continue to liaise with Chief Superintendent Don
                   Denton, but I am more than a little concerned about the traumatic effect
                   this line of enquiry may have on individual officers.  It seems
                   appropriate, therefore, that we should tread carefully and I would look
                   to you and your Force to help me in identifying those officers who may
                   be suffering and who, because of this line of enquiry, may need help.
                   Secondly, that appropriate professional help from your Force is
                   available, not only for those who we know are suffering, but for those
                   others who may find what we have to do very distressing.  At the end of
                   the day I am keen to ensure that we complete a thorough professional
                   investigation, but not at the expense of adversely effecting individual
                   members of your Force.




         PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE AT             Sheffield
With regard to timing, I would hope to start these enquiries some time
after Monday 26 June 1989. The location we would propose is Furnival
House which we will retain as long as we think it financially viable.
Thereafter, _if there is a need for continuing enquiries in South
Yorkshire, these will probably be completed by officers from Birmingham
staying locally as long as is necessary.

For information I intend my main enquiry team to vacate Sheffield by the
middle of July at the latest, leaving behind two liaison officers.
Dr Popper, has kindly given me some accommodation for them in his
Medico-Legal Centre in Sheffield.  If, in the future we need some office
accommodation more than that already secured I would hope that I could
look to you for some help.

I look forward to your advice in this matter.

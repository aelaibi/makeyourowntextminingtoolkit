           I am a Superintendent        in the South Yorkshire Police     presently the Sub-

           divisional       commander for Woodseats Sub Division (E2).

           I presently have twenty five years service having joined the then

           West Riding Constabulary in 1963.

           My experience of policing fo otbal1 crowds dates back to 1973 when I

           was an Inspector stationed at Rotherham.            My experience of policing

           Hillsborough ranges from 1980/81 and 1983/86 in the rank of Inspector

           and Chief Inspector respectively.           I have also policed the previous

           semi finals       in the rank of Superi nte nd ent .

           In connection with the FA Cup Semi Final to be held at Hillsborough

           on the 15th A p r i 1, I was allocated responsibility for the Football

           Stadium.

           Prior to the event I attended two planning meetings and a briefing
                                                                            PAGE


for Inspectors and above which was held at Hillsborough on Friday

14th A p r i 1 1989 (140489).       After this briefing I briefed Inspectors

under my command, detaiIs of which are contained in the briefing

notes which are attached.

On Saturday 15th A p r i 1 1989 (150489)       I arrived at the ground at about

9.45 am     (0945) and was present at the main briefing whi ch was held at

approximately 10.00 am (1000). After this I went with Chief Inspector

BEAL,    Inspectors BOOTH and CALVERT and their Serials concerned with

poli cing the Spion Hop to the Spion Hop, where with the Inspectors

concerned I examined the area whi ch had been taped off and set aside

for Liverpool s up po rt ers .      At last y e a r ’s Semi Final a few hundred

Liverpool supporters had obtained tickets for the Spion Hop, which

was allocated to Notts Forest supporters,           by whatsoever means and had

had to be segregated form the Nottingham supporters by a cordon of

Police O f f i c e r s .   There was friction between both sets of supporters

particularly when Liverpool scored and Police Officers had come under

threat to their personal s a f e t y .     Officers had had to draw their

truncheons to control the situation.            I anticipated that such a

situation was likely to occur at the 1989 Semi Final.              After

discussion I then briefed the Serials as is reflected in my briefing

notes.      I then went with Chief      Inspector BEAL, w h i 1st the Serials

were being further briefed by their Inspectors, to the rear of the

Spion Hop as there was a concern about loose stones being pr esent.

There was evidence of some stones on an undeveloped area but this

gave no major cause for concern.

I then made a tour of the ground particularly looking at the upper

level of the North Stand as I was apprehensive about the location of

a betting booth.           I spoke with some officers from my own Sub Division

who pointed the betting booth out and arrangements were agreed for

its supervision.           I then went from the North Stand via Leppings LN
                                                                           PAGE


past the Director's entrance and into the Sheffield Wednesday Control

Room, where I liaised with staff.           Present at that time was

Superintendent MARSH who I took around the ground.           I also liaised

with Inspector DARLING and Sergeant CHAPMAN           who were the

Supervisory Officers responsible for the Constables who sit on the

perimeter track*

I was present outside the players entrance to supervise and monitor

the arrival of the Liverpool and Notts Forest team coaches, after

that I again liaised with the staff in the Sheffield Wednesday

C o nt ro 1 Room.    I learned from the Sheffield Wednesday staff that

Brian CLOUGH,       the Notts Forest manager would be sitting immediately

behind the Notts Forest team bench as he was banned from the touch

line.    The seat was pointed out to me and I was told that so as to

evade the press he would come o u t , not with the teams as is normal

practice, but after the teams,          the officials and coaching staff.

I estimate that it would be about 2.35 pm (1435) when I went on a

tour of the perimeter track.        I walked from the central tunnel area

passing the South stand to the West end of the ground.           The perimeter

track Constables were in position and I spoke to most of them in

passing.     When I reached the area behind the goal of the Leppings LN

terraces I remember talking to PC HELLIWELL and together we stood and

faced the terracing and the West stand.           There was a carnival

atmosphere in the central       pens,    a light weight beachball was being

flipped about in the crowd.        I saw a young supporter in a green and

beige stiped rugby shirt being hoisted from the central          pens by

supporters in the West stand up into the West stand.           Once in the

West stand I saw him move first to the left and then to the right and

I thought to myself,       because I ’d seen this happen many times before

at half-time, when was he going to go to the back and disappear             into

the crowd but he d i d n ’t and I believe that he realised he had been
                                                                         PAGE


seen by us.      I had attempted to attract the attention of some

Officers in the stand to what was going on but suddenly the supporter

came back to the front of the West stand and without no more ado

dropped back into the t e rr ac in g.    After a few moments I then walked

along the perimeter track in front of the North stand to the front of

the Spion Hop.      I recal1 looking up to the area at the back which

contained Liverpool su ppo rte rs .      I contemplated going into the Spion

Hop to talk to the Offi cers that were segregating approximately 800/

1000 Liverpool supporters but I looked at my watch and saw that            it

was about 2.SO pm (1450) and that as the teams would be coming out

onto the pitch before very long,         it was time for me to take up a

position in the central t u n n e l .    I therefore made my way to that

locat ion.

I do recal1 a youth being arrested/ejected from the Spion Hop

although I think that it was during the earlier tour of the ground.

It was on that occasion that I actually went into the Spion Hop

because I thought that the arresting/ejecting officers had fallen as

a result of the youth s tr ug gli ng .     I remember some minutes after this

I saw what I believe to be the same youth reappear on the Spion

Hop.    I believe he was spotted by Offi cers and was again removed.            A

Police Officer, at some stage told me that the youth admitted giving

a turnstile operator      SO.00 to get back into the g r o u n d .

On returning to the central tunnel I was confronted by a large number

of press photographers awaiting the arrival of the t e a m s .       After a

short time the teams ran onto the pitch followed by the referee and 2

1 inesmen and trainers/coaches.         Mr CLOUGH did not appear at this

stage and the press photographers re mained.         I recal1 asking one of

them what they were awaiting for and he said "You know damn well -

CLO U GH ."   I heard, with my back to the pitch at this t i m e , the

whistle go for the ki ck -o ff .   The press photographers remained and
                                                                                 PAGE   5


some of them were on the playing area.            It was necessary they move

and they were told to do so by the Police Officers            present.      Mr

CLOUGH came out and took up his seat but still some of the press

photographers had remained to photograph him.             In front of the Notts

Forest dug-out was some television camera equi pment and the Notts

staff complained that          it was obstructing their view.    This was moved

by T.V. P er s o n n e l .   The match hav i ng ki eked off and the press

photographers gone from the front of the tunnel            I then surveyed the

scene in the ground.           I looked to my left and saw one or two

spectators climbing over the perimeter fence at the Leppings LN end

behind the g o a l .     Two or three Police Officers were with them.             I

immediately realised that there must be a crowd problem,            not fighting

or a pitch invasion because that would not happen so early in a

match, and so I immediately went to the Leppings LN terracing where I

saw two or three Police Offi cers by the track gate whi ch I believe was

open.    From ground level I looked at the crowd in the pen (Pen 3)

behind the goal and saw quite clearly that supporters were being

squashed against the fencing.           The area behind the gate was heavily

congested preventing persons from exiting.             I should mention that the

perimeter fence is not wide enough to allow a mass exit of persons

being in the order of a normal doors width.            The actual terracing is

at a lower level than the perimeter track and one has to mount one or

more steps so as to exit from the terracing through the gate onto the

pitch.     Police Officers were trying to get supporters o u t .         I then

mounted the advertising hoarding and from above fence level surveyed

the whole of the crowd in the pen.            I could see that there were also

people behind the front row who were squeezed and being pushed

towards the fencing.           As one looked further back,   the crowd probably

more than two thi rds were watching the match quite unaware of what

was happening at the fr o nt .        One or two supporters were clambering
                                                                         PAGE        6


along the top of the crowd and were trying to get out over the

perimeter fencing.      There were a few supporters on the pitch at that

stage.     My immediate assessment was that there was a chance the

problem could be alleviated if the crowd at the middle and back of

the terracing moved back so as to ease the pressure at the front -

There was room to do so and the central tunnel was clea r.         I

therefore gestured to the crowd in the middle and towards the back

with both hands in a pushing motion shouting at them to move back and

also with both index fingers pointing down to the front of the crowd

so as to indi cate to them there was a problem at the fr o nt .        I gai ned

no reaction to this and more people started to climb towards the

fencing.     It   was apparent at that   stage that the match could not

cont inue.    I   therefore determined that the match should stop and after

broadcasting by personal      radio to the effect that there was potential

casualties and that the game be stopped,       from the top of the fencing

waved both my arms towards the Control Box in a signalling motion to

the effect that the game must be stopped.        I then ran onto the pitch

past the Liverpool goalkeeper who I recal1 was st i11 facing down the

field of play, seemingly unaware of what was going on around him*               It

took me a 1ittle while to attract the referee’s attention by shouting

but I recal1 play then come to a halt as he had awarded a free

kick.    I told him that we had a serious incident and that he must          stop

the game and      take the players off   the pitch.   He agreed to do so

without argument.

I then returned to the fencing and could see no improvement in the

situation: more supporters were clambering along the top of the crowd

and attempting to get over the fence where they were being helped over

by Police Officers standing on the hoarding.          The crowd towards the

back was still not responding by moving back.          I moved towards the

South pen nearer the Police Control Box to attract the attention of the
                                                                         PAGE


staff so as to apprise them to the extent of the problems.          I believe

it was at this stage that I saw Assistant Chief Constable Mr JACKSON

who came to the pitch and told him that we had casualties.

I then immediately returned to the fencing behind the g o a l .      I

believe it was at this stage that an Officer told me of a fatality.

I recal1 looking at the people on the front row immediately behind

the fencing and as my eyes skirted to my right along the 1ine I saw a

female who in my view was clearly d e a d .    The colour had drained from

her face and her pa11or was grey.        I then broadcasted that there was

a potential fat ality.      By this time more supporters had come over the

fence.    Officers were attempting to get into the crowd down the side

fenci n g .

I was concerned as to medical support and ambulances and I recal1

discussing with some officers the presence of an ambulance.

Ambulances had been requested and I believe a further broadcast was

made at that specific time;      communications were extremely diffi cult

because of the no i s e .   However   it was within my knowledge that there

was an ambulance located at the end of the tunnel        in between the

North stand and the Spion Hop.        An Officer was dispatched to get that

ambulance to the scene.       I recall that the presence of press

photographers was many and that they were hindering the operation of

getting people out of the pen.        I had to depute an Officer to keep

them at bay.    I had previously deputed an officer to bring St John

Ambulance staff to the fence.

I believe it was at this time that I saw Chief Superintendent NESBIT

arrive.

Because of the crush of people adjacent to the fencing it was

impossible to get people through the gate and I specifically recal1 a

large well b ui1t man who was trapped by other people on the steps

inside the terracing.       Together with other officers   I struggled to
                                                                         PAGE    8


pull this man free.      Other persons   including a young boy were quickly

pulled o u t .   Offi cers by this time had managed to go down the side

railings   into the crowd.    I acquired a loudhailer.      I then

broadcasted to the crowd to ease off at the back to allow the

casualties to be evacuated.      It was at one stage w h i 1st doing this

that the advertising hoarding that I was standing on broke and I f e l 1

to the ground-     By this time officers were in the terracing and were

attempting to take casualties through the gate and there was clearly

insufficient room for two officers with a casualty to get through the

gate.   It was therefore arranged that a channel of Offi cers

comprising two lines be formed outside the gates and that Offi cers

would pass casualties through the gates to the Offi cers on the

outside where they could be further attended to.        I think it was at

this stage that I heard a roar from supporters who were on the pitch

and my immediate impression was that they were making their way

towards the Notts Forest supporters in the Spion Hop,         however,   I was

not in a position to do anything about this.        It was sometime prior

to this that I recall an am bu l an ce , I believe St Johns,    had arrived

from the Spion Hop and it was necessary to clear some of the

advertising hoardings in order it could gain ac c e s s .     In order that

casualties be removed as soon as possible from the terracing I

instructed the Offi cers by loudhailer to bring the casualties to the

gate not to go through it but to pass the casualty through the gate

releasing it to Officers on the outside; then instructing those

Offi cers to go and get another casualty and then instructed other

Officers to come forward with a casualty and pass it through the

gates and so on.      I had also directed other Officers who had entered

from the rear of the terracing to evacuate casualties through the

central tunnel at the rear.      By this means the casualties were very

qui ckly cleared from the area.     Once this was achieved and the area
                                                                          PAGE


cleared I saw a crowd barrier that was crumpled and twisted.            (I re­

visited the Stadium on Sunday 16th April and surveyed the terraced

area on Pen 3.        I again saw the crumpled and twisted crowd barrier

and noted rust on a stanchion which was st i11 fixed in the ground and

as I recal1 on one of the poles.         I don* t know whether this was

surface rust or otherw is e.       I also saw a deflated beachbal1 in the

well of the terracing >.       I arranged that officers remain to protect

the scene.         I then reflected as to the question of crowd safety of

a l 1 those supporters in the ground.       I had been conscious at one

stage during the rescue operation of a broadcast from the public

tannoy system I believe requesting supporters not to push in the

central    pen but it then struck me that panic or supporters      leaving

the ground may result in further        problems.   I think it was at this

stage and round about 3.30 pm that I instructed PC GOODWILL of *F 1 *

who was present in the area of the goal to accompany me so as to

ensure better communi cat ion with other Senior Off i cers and Police

Ground Control and that he must never leave me unless it was on my

direct    instruct ion.    F i rstly I requested that he try and get those

offi cers back into Serials that were not engaged because throughout

the res cue operation and part i cularly at this stage I and other

Police Offi cers were subjected to vehement abuse in the strongest

terms from the Liverpool       supporters on the pitch who accused the

Police as murderers who had killed Liverpool sup por te rs.       I recal1

one supporter with a Merseys ide accent saying to me "You* ve fucking

killed them" and another saying "The fucking police have murdered

them."     Others were saying,     'The fucking Police and Kelly have

done t h i s * .   Having made their points they would not go away and were

obstruct ing me from continuing with my du ti es .     Many smelled of dr ink.

I recal1 at one stage having to push two or three supporters aside so

could cont inue supervising the res cue operat ion.      Similarly,   I had to
                                                                        PAGE        10


. push press photographers away who were taking photographs of people

 trapped against the f en c in g.   They were obstructing the rescue

 operation.    The loudhailer at this point became faulty and PC GOODWILL

 obtained a replacement.I had been requesting by personal        radio that I

 meet with Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD as I wanted to discuss the

 situation as far as the rest of the crowd was concerned.          I was told he

 was in the club*s boardroom and so I set off to meet him there.                I

 turned towards the central tunnel and saw that both managers,         DALGLESH

 and CLOUGH had walked onto the pitch and were making their way

 towards the g o a l .   I immediately feared as to what would be the

 react ion of supporters towards Mr CLOUGH and that it to be likely that

 Mr DALGLESH be totally surrounded by Liverpool sup por te rs.      Therefore

 I spoke to Messrs DALGLESH and CLOUGH and told them that it would be

 more appropriate if they left the pitch and could assist by

 broadcast ing over the tannoy system and asking for calm.        The two

 managers agreed and I escorted them down the central tunnel on my way

 to the boardroom.       Messrs CLOUGH and DALGLESH were then escorted to

 Police Control by other offi cers and I went into the boardroom where

 I was met by several directors of Sheffield Wednesday F oo tba l1 Club.

 They asked me if there were fatalities and I said potentially that

 may be so , and they said that      if there were fatal it ias the match

 should be abandoned with their full support but recognising that it

 would be a Poli ce decision.       I then went to the Police Control Box

 and gave an update of the situation.        After a short time I returned

 to the pitch at the West end where I saw a Police Scenes of Crime

 photographer in civi1ian clothes being attacked by supporters.             I

 instructed that he be told to put his camera down.

 On looking down the pitch I saw that there was some disruption in the

 crowd in the uncovered South stand seats at the Spion Kop e n d , either

 people were arguing or fig h ti ng .    I was on my way there when as I
                                                                           PAGE   1 -1


passed the central tunnel    I heard abuse being directed into the

tunnel by supporters.     I saw Mr Kelly (FA Secretary) was in the

course of doing a television interview with Desmond L Y N A M .   It seemed

1 ikely he may come under physi cal attack from the supporters who were

blaming him for what had transpi red.       I immediately shouted from the

entrance to the tunnel that they must stop the interview and get out

of the way around the b a c k .   I then went to the uncovered seats where

I directed that two or three Officers should go into the crowd and

sort the problem o u t ; it was evident that there were some Liverpool

supporters in there amongst Notts Forest su pporters.       To supplement

this I broadcasted by loudhailer to the crowd and asked for calm and

their co-operation so that matters be resolved.        The broadcast had

the immediate effect of quietening things down and so I determined

that I would broadcast to the Spion Kop and spectators in the rest of

the ground because I believe at this stage nothing had been said

about the match being abandoned and I had a fear of panic and

potential   problems resulting from people leaving the ground.         I

therefore broadcasted to spectators along the Spion Kop and North

stand at roughly 15 yard intervals to the effect that there had

clearly been casualties and that we were working under extremely

difficult   ci rcumstances and requesting the co-operat ion of spectators

to remain where they w e r e .    I also advised that there would be

spectators who would not be able to hear this message clearly

because of the 1 imitations of the loudhailer and requested that

supporters who had heard it relay the message to those behind who

would not have heard it.     Every broadcast was followed by applause

both from Notts Forest supporters       in the Spion Kop and Liverpool

supporters in the North stand.        I recall that in the course of

pass ing this message a group of supporters on the Spion Kop were

chanting and singing and the rest of the crowd turned on them and
                                                                        PAGE   12


silenced them*       I believe that when I reached the West end of the

North stand the formal announcement was made that the game had been

abandoned.      I believe that persons at that stage were advised to

1eave the ground slowly and not h u r r y .

I then started to receive enquiries about the casual ties from

Liverpool     supporters on the pitch and they were directed to an area

by the central tunnel where I arranged that Officers       could attend to

their n e e d s .   It was at this stage that I obtained the telephone

number for the Casualty Enqui ry Bureau and inf ormed the Pol ice Ground

Control.     After that I went to the Leppings LN end of the ground

where I saw outside the River Gate       (Gate C ) a number of bodies

covered in green sheets and liaised with Inspector SYKES.         I

ascertained these bodies had been removed from the terracing and

taken by offi cers to the rear of the West stand.

I then went to Poli ce Ground Control where I 1 iaised with officers as

to the updated position.       F o 1lowing this I went to the North stand

where Officers had been gathered for de-briefing instructions.

I then went to the gymnasium which was being used as a temporary

mortuary and after surveying the scene cheeked as to the condition of

the Offi cers who were with bodies.       Some were parti cularly distraught

and I attempted to reassure them.        I then returned to the North stand

where further liaison took place about de— briefing and then to

Claywheels LN to check on the welfare of Offi cers and to the Sports

and Social Club at Niagara for the same purpose, where I remained in

anticipation of de-briefing.       Prior to visiting the gymnasium I had

been informed that there was a Poli ce Off icer who had been worki ng in

           I am a Police Constable in the South Yorkshire Police,                 presently

           attached to the plain clothes dept at Woodseats Police Station,

           Sheffield.

           At 8.30 am on Saturday 15 April          1989,   I commenced duty in full Police

           uniform at Woodseats Police Station, Sheffield,              in relation to a

           football    ’S p e c i a l 5 duty at Hillsborough football    ground for the semi

           final cup match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest Football                   clubs,

           I was,    together with other officers transported to Hillsborough and

           attended a briefing, which took place in the North Stand of the

           ground.     I later had a packed lunch prior to commencing duties with

           serial    12.

           At approximately 11.15 am that date,             I commenced duties in company

           with Police Constable 69 Pearson,          patrolling the car park gate
                                                                          PAGE     2


situated at the rear of the gymnasium in Penistone Road, Sheffield,

At intervals whilst    patrolling the entrance and together with PC

Pearson,   I walked out and along Penistone Road on numerous occasions

and it was during these walkabouts,      that   1   noticed that there were a

large number of football supporters carrying and drinking from beer

cans and bottles.     A large group of fans of approximately 20 male

supporters were sat for the majority of the time,          opposite the

entrance to the car park in Penistone Road.          All the youths were

drinking very heavily.     I later approached and spoke to these

supporters, who were all in good humour and advised them regarding

entering the ground under the influence of alcohol.

At 2.20 pm that date,    I walked onto the playing area at the ground to

view the build up of the crowd inside the ground.           I was surprised to

see that although the Kop end of the ground          (Penistone Road) was

almost full or seemed to be, the opposite end (Leppings Lane) was only

slightly filled,    the majority of the supporters standing in the

central section behind the goal area.       I then returned to the entrance

to the car park.

Prior to the kick off time of 3.00 pm, there appeared to be an unusual

amount of supporters attempting to enter the ground at the last

minute.    A large number of supporters both alone and in large groups

attempted to enter the ground via the car park gates at my location.

These were all directed to the Leppings Lane end of the ground.             A

large number of these supporters were under the influence of

intoxicants,   but were not drunk.    Due to this large amount of

supporters attempting to enter at the car park,          the large metal gates

were closed and locked in order that we were protected and guarded

against any attempting    late rush inside the ground.

At approximately 3.01    pm,   I walked from the entrance and along the

walkway which is situated between the Kop and the North Stand.              As I
                                                                         PAGE      3


reached the perimeter track around the playing surface,         I noticed that

the match was in progress.        I then assisted an officer who had

detained a youth and was walking along the track to the police room.

I accompanied the officer to the Police room? and the youth was

detai n e d .

Whilst assisting the officer,       I heard from within the ground a loud

yell by the crowd and as it was only short lived,         I knew from previous

experience at such matches that,       it was a near miss a goal by one of

the teams playing.

At about 3=08 pm I returned to the walkway at the side of the North

Stand and noticed that the players were off the pitch.          There was a

large crowd of supporters standing around the goal mouth of the

Leppings Lane end of the pitch and 1 presumed that there had been a

pitch invasion by the crowd.        I then went to the Leppings Lane end of

the ground and as I did so I noticed that there were a number of

officers,       standing on the fence and shouting and pointing at the

supporters inside the Leppings Lane end of the ground.          Even at this

stage,    being without a personal    radio,   I still believed that   it was a

pitch invasion by the supporters.        As I reached the perimeter fencing

to the Leppings Lane end of the ground,         I noticed the fans within the

area behind the ground appeared to be a b l u r r , and there didn't appear

to be any movement within it.        The only movement could detect were the

officers along the fencing and the supporters around the goal mouth

area.

As I reached a small gate, which allows access to the terrace,           I was

passed by and officer       (identity unknown) a white male, who at this

time appeared to be dead.        His face was a blue colour and his eyes

were staring widly.        I then pulled this youth onto the grassed area of

the ground, and checked for any vital signs.          There were none.    I then

attempted heart massage and mouth to mouth on the youth in an attempt
                                                                           PAGE         4


to revive him.    Whilst attempting these acts,        I sensed that there was

a great deal of activity around me,       but   I d i d n ’t notice anything   in

particular.   I believed at that point that the youth I was attempting

to revive was the only sudden death within the ground.              Whilst knelt

over the deceased body,    using mouth to mouth,       I suddenly

felt a pain at the base of my back, and I was pushed onto the body

itself by what    I believe was a kick.     As I fell over the body,       I heard

someone scream,    "You Bastard."     I d i d n ’t react to the kick in the

normal manner,    for some reason,    I just continued to attempt to revive

the youth lying on the floor.        After a short time it was obvious that

life was extinct and with the assistance of either officers or fans,                I

cannot remember which,    the youth was taken to the rear of the North

Stand near to the gymnasium area.

After covering the body with my coat,       I then returned onto the pitch

area in order to assist other officers.

Upon returning to the pitch area,       it was then and only then that I

realised that other bodies had been taken from the Leppings Lane

terrace and placed onto the pitch area.

I assisted other officers    in the goal mouth area attempting to revive

youths lying on the pitch area, and checking that the conscious

supporters had the assistance they needed.          I then assisted an officer

to carry a body from the pitch area to the rear of the North stand.

Again I returned to the pitch area, and there saw Police Constable1529

Friend, who was standing over the body of a young male supporter.

With the assistance of supporters who were passing with a large

board in g , the body was then taken to the rear of the North S t a n d .

I then checked that the original       body I had removed from the pitch

area had remained untouched and as I did so an order was given out

that all the bodies should be taken into the gymnasium area.              With the

assistance of other officers 1 placed my body with the area of the
                                                                       PAGE


gymnasium.

I    then examined the body and I would describe the youth as follows?

male, white, SO - 22 years,       dark brown short hair which was slightly

curly,     ginger coloured moustache, 5'10" tall and of normal build.         He

was wearing blue jeans,      blue jean shirt, white   'T ' shirt and white

socks.      I then checked for any identification and there was none.         The

property on the body was as followss-

1.    Quartz watch with a two face dial.

2.      4.31   in cash.

3.    A packet of cigarettes and matches.

4.    Ticket for the semi final Leppings Lane terrace.

At 4.05 pm, Dr Redgrave attended at the gymnasium and after examining

the body he certified that life was extinct.

A form Gen/18 was the part completed with all the details known at the

time.      The deceased was subsequently photographed and the photo was

marked with the number allocated to the body, that number being number

71.

-I remained with the body at the gymnasium until 5.30 am the following

day, Sunday 16 April      1989.   At that time the body had not been

identified by any person it was taken by ambulance to the Medico

Legal Centre, Watery Street, Sheffield.        At that location the body was

stripped and was handed over to officers already in attendance.          The

property was also handed to those officers.

I later returned to Woodseats Police Station and went off duty at 6.45

am.     I later found out from enquiries made that the deceased name was

COPOC and that he was      later formally identified at the Medico Legal

Centre'.

I will state that prior to the match beginning,        there appeared to be a

large amount of supporters just walking around and around the ground

drinking from cans and bottles.        Although there was no obvious trouble

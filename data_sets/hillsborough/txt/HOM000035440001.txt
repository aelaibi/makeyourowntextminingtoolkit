                                                           26th August 1997

          Dear Lord Justice Stuart-Smith,


         My wife and I would like to thank you for your letter of
         16th July and for the sympathy expessed therein over the
         death of our son Kester at Hillsborough Stadium on 15th
         April 1989.

         Most of the letters you will receive from families affected
         by this tragedy will be written by relatives who were not in
         the fatal pens. I would like to make it clear that I was
         standing next to ray son when he was crushed to death.
         Indeed, I lost consciousness myself, and am lucky to be
         alive today.

         I was not invited to give evidence to the Taylor Inquiry,
         but did give evidence at the resumed Inquests, after asking
         Mr. Popper to do so. I still believe that ray unique
         experience of the events on 15th April 1989 has not been
         properly recorded, despite several statements to Police and
         my evidence to the Inquests. My wife and I also feel
         particularly aggrieved about a number of matters which we
         consider unresolved or unsatisfactory. I think some of them
         may constitute possible new evidence and may therefore be
         relevant to your Scrutiny.

         Our main concerns are:

         1. We have never been satisfied about the Police version of
         continuity in respect of our son's removal from pen 3 to the
         gymnasium. We have a letter from West Midlands Police
         admitting that there is a conflict of evidence between a
         Police Officer and a Liverpool supporter.

         2. I do not believe that the Inquests established the
         precise conditions within pen 3. I am quite sure, after
         attending hundreds of football matches on crowded terraces,
         that the conditions in pen 3 were not conducive to all
         victims being dead by 15.15h.

         3. We were obliged to submit questions in writing to
         K e s t e r 's mini-inquest, and were therefore denied the right
         to question witnesses in the Court.

         4. Mr John M o t 3o n , the BBC commentator, was not allowed to
         give evidence to the Inquests about his view of the pens
    ’ .l-5sS3   FROM:SOLICITORS BUS UNIT   01512252356   TO:Q1712732007




     from the TV gantry. I have spoken to him about this, and he
     maintains that from his position more than twice as far away
     as the Police control box, the overcrowding was "obvious".

     5. In a statement to West Midlands Police dated 26.02.90,
     (copy attached) I made:
     * nine specific criticisms of South Y o r k s h i r e Police
     * two specific criticisms of the Football Association
     * four specific criticisms of Sheffield Wednesday Football
     Club.

     I have received no response to any of these criticisms.


     in writing this letter, it has been difficult to know what
i    to include, as there are so many aspects of this sorry
     business about which we feel aggrieved. The above points are
     those which we consider most relevant to your Scrutiny. I
     shall of course be pleased to provide further information,
     either in writing o s o n a i f     you so wish.

     Yours sincerely,

            Further to nty previous statement I would make the following specific

            points of criticism.

            The first being a number of points concerning the South Yorkshire

            Police.

            1) Traffic arrangements for supporters arriving from the South and

            this includes a significant number of Liverpool supporters were

            totally inadequate for the volume of vehicles.

            Specifically cars leaving the Ml at Junction 34 were directed

            towards the City Centre, which was already congested.

            2) When we arrived at the Loppings Lane turnstiles at 2.30 pin (1430)

            the situation was already out of control of the Police.    Groups of

            Officers were standing around doing nothing.     There was no filtering

            or queuing system.     Several mounted police near the turnstiles sewed

            to have lost control of their horses with a threat of injury to those

            trying to gain admission.

            3) When we passed through Gate C nobody examined our tickets or gave

            us directions onto the terraces.

            4) Just before I lost consciousness probably around 1503 hours (1503)
18-09-97 15v=3   FPOM:SOLICITORS BUS UNIT   01512255356          TO:01712732007            PAGE:05
         BrtjX                  ROGER   CHARLES                                        2


         I saw a Police Officer walk slowly along the other side of the fence

         in front of ire towards the main stand.       He was completely oblivious to

         the groans, screams and cries for help frcm the crowd.

         5) At about 1530 (1530) hours having regained consciousness outside

         Gate C I was several times refused entry back into Pen 3 by a cordon

         of Police blocking the tunnel entrance.        I was then denied the

         opportunity to seek out niy son and if he had still been alive assist

         with his resuscitation.     I was also anxious about the other two boys

         and about the loss of niy spectacles.

         6) At about 1730 (1730) tours when I was being treated in the St

    j    Johns Ambulance Room                     went off to try and find a phone,

          He wandered by mistake into the gymnasium where he saw at least fifty

          of the victims.   There was obviously no control over access to the

          corpses at this time.

          7) At about 1845 tours (1845) having returned to the stadium I asked

          a Police Officer if there had been any fatalities and he replied, "one

          or two." He would certainly have known that he was lying.        Also at

          this tirre we were advised by a Police Officer to go to Hammerton

          Road, but we were told no transport was available and eventually

          hitched a lift there.

          8) Immediately after identifying Kesters body I was taken by a Police

          officer to a table in the gymnasium and asked to recount the events of

           the day.   Tfriis took about ten minutes.    The Police Officer then asked

          ne to go through it again so he could write it down.        As a result of

           this procedure it was at least an hour before I was given an

           opportunity to telephone my wife with the bad news.

           The officer who took the statement omitted all critical references to

           the Police.   At one point Kesters belongings were brought and I was

           asked to check than and sign a receipt, this was very distressing.

   <*     vBNi                             ROGER   CHARLES                                         3


            9) Within the past few weeks the Chief Constable Peter WRIGHf has

            stated that there is additional evidence which has not been made

            public.
            He denies kncwing what this evidence is, but has implied o

            number of occasions that the behaviour of Liverpool Supporters was a

            major contributory factor.                His r^narks have been widely reported by

            the Press in Sheffield where the inquests will be held.                 I believe he

            has abused his position and prejudiced the outccme of the inquests.

            My criticsm of the football association 1st

             1.    The Association insistence that both semi finals should be played

             simultaneously and that neither should be shown live on television
    *
             created an extraordinary demand for tickets-

             2.    Allocation of the smaller Leppings Lane end to Liverpool

             Ilighlighted the demand mentioned in (1) above.              The four of us who

             travelled to Sheffield were all season ticket holders at Anfield, but

             only two of us automatically qualified for a semi final ticket.                   (The

             other two obtained tickets quite legitimately on the morning of the

             match).

             My criticism of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club is:

             1.    The fatal design of the two central pens was obviously crucial

             once through the tunnel, there was no means of escape to the left or
                                             j
             right while the front gate was totally inadequate.

              2.   There was no indicatation anywhere near the tunnel entrance that

              there were other points of access to the terraces.               Neither did we see

              any stewards directing supporters onto the terraces.

              3.   The tickets advised spectators to take up their positions                  15

              minutes before kick off".               Those of us who arrived at the turnstiles

              by 1430 hours (1430) would have expected to be able to comply with the

              request.

          4.     The nop on the ticket was inaccurate and dangerously misleading.

 I refer to your letter dated 16th July 1997, and I thank you for your sincere condolences.

 As I lost my young son Steven (17) at Hillsborough and believe strongly that Justice has never
 been achieved for all those who needlessly died there, I very much welcome your invitation to
 me to provide you with a list o f fresh evidence that I feel is important for you to consider as part
 o f your new scrutiny.

 The enclosed list o f points I believe are pertinent to your defined terms o f reference and I would
 urge you to fully investigate each one:

  1. The "new" video evidence that was discovered by the Hillsborough Family Support Group
 (HFSG) This tape provides cry stal clear video footage o f the main pens in the Leppings Lane
 end o f the ground where the majority o f the crushing and subsequent fatalities took place. The
 tootage starts early on in the morning before the fans arrive and runs through until well after the
match was abandoned The cameras that captured this footage fed directly into the main police
control box and therefore the senior police officers in charge o f crowd safety on the day were
fully aware o f the state o f the pens throughout the course o f the day and would have been easily
able to identify and put nght the large build up o f fans entering the terraces During the inquests
  senior officers o f the South Yorkshire Police stated categorically that the camera that captured
this footage was defective and therefore the video evidence from the camera was extremely poor
quality On this basis the coroner ruled that this evidence was not shown to the jury during the
inquests Clearly this was not the case as proven by the discovery o f this tape and thus raises the
following issues:

(i) Key evidence was deliberately withheld from the Jury that should invalidate the findings o f
the inquest.

(ii) The senior officers who lied under oath during the inquests should face disciplinary hearings
as they clearly and deliberately set out to pervert the course o f justice.

(ii*) ^ 1<? Coroner should be questioned re his failure to examine the alleged poor quality video
evidence that was held by the police. W hy did he just take their word for it ?

            2 Witness Statement Mr Holdsworth (Video Technician responsible for setting up the camera
            that covered the Leppings Lane end o f the Ground). M r Holdworth always maintained that the
            camera in question was fully operational and not defective on the day - thus invalidating the
            claims o f the South Yorkshire Police. His written statement was not called upon during the
            inquests even though throughout the inquests the Coroner stated on more than one occasion that
            the video footage the police saw in the control room was pivotal evidence.

            3. Selection o f evidence. The overall decision on who was called to give testimony during the
            inquests rested solely with the coroner. I was very concerned that throughout the proceedings the
           majority o f the witnesses he called appeared to be very pro-police (centring very much on the
           allegations o f drunken ticketless Liverpool fans) and yet important witnesses for the fans were
           not called upon. For example the Coroner chose to hear the witness testimony o f a so called
    ■* )   Land Lord who claimed that the Liverpool fans were all drunk and had consumed 10/20 pints of
           beer each in his pub. Under cross examination he was found to have lied about these "facts" and
           the jury was told to disregard his evidence. At the same time the coroner failed to consider an
           extremely important witness statement from Mr Holdsworth (see above) and in my opinion
           appeared to bow to the pressure from the police with regard to the witnesses who were called
           generally. Obviously I cannot list all o f the witnesses who gave accounts throughout the inquiry
           (although obviously you will be able to gather this together) - the important point is that I feel it
           is very important to establish from the Coroner what criteria he used to select witnesses in order
           to establish whether he was indeed under pressure from the police in relation to who he called.

           4. 3.15 cut-off time. Evidence was only admissible to the inquests up until this time as the
           coroner deemed that every one o f the 95 victims had died (or where brain-dead) by this time.
           Facts have subsequently come out that proves that some o f the victims who died as a result o f
           their injuries were being treated by the emergency services well after this time. The witness
           statement submitted by Dr Ed Walker bears this out as does other witness statements that have
           been sent in. In my opinion this fact alone (the inappropriate cut-off time) should in itself
           invalidate the findings o f the inquests as important evidence after 3.15 was never considered
           which would have had some bearing on the outcome.

           5. Scrutiny o f evidence - West Yorkshire Police

           The West Midlands Police were given the task of compiling, selecting and scrutinising all o f the
           evidence associated with the disaster (including the evidence provided by the South Yorkshire
           Police) that was used throughout the legal proceedings. At the same time, South Yorkshire Police
           were carrying out an investigation o f the West Midlands Police for fraud allegations. Clearly this
           simation demonstrates that there was a conflict o f interests ! How can it be believed that the
           scrutiny o f evidence by the West Midlands force was totally without prejudice ?

           6 The disaster plan

           One o f the findings o f the Taylor Report was that Sheffield City Council did have a disaster plan
           but it was not put into action following the tragedy. This reason that this plan was not
implemented I believe warrants additional investigation as I believe it had a strong bearing on
why so many people needlessly died on the day.

The effect o f this tragedy compounded by the injustice has had a devastating effect on my
family. My husband suffered a heart attack following the inquest resulting in major heart
surgery, followed by another heart attack and further major heart surgery 18 months later.
Having been employed for 30 years as an electrical Engineer, he was forced to give up work with
his medical condition. His doctor said stress played a major part in these events.

I m yself was also employed in our local special care baby unit however 1 was forced to retire on
ill health grounds through the stress caused by not only losing my son, and almost losing my
husband, but having to go on fighting for justice which should have been mine by right, I had
five lovely children, Steven being the middle child. None o f my children have ever been in any
trouble and were all employed or at school when the disaster incurred. Steven was not a criminal
and neither was I yet my husband and I were interrogated within five minutes o f identifying
Steven's body - with the majority o f the questions focusing on establishing how much alcohol he
had consumed and querying whether or not he had a ticket (Steven was neither drunk, arrived at
the ground early and had a fully intact ticket) Why did the police take this approach ? They
appeared to have a very clear agenda focused on pointing the blame o f the disaster on the fans
and were noi at all interested in establishing the facts (which came out later in the Taylor Report
which exonerated the fans from blame, concluded that alcohol did not play any part in the
disaster and established that the main cause o f the disaster was the failings o f the South
Yorkshire Police - a fact that has never been accepted by them)

If possible^ p w l 4 ^ 1 ^ ^ r ^ mQch welcome the onnorturriw^o-meet w ith yotff to discuss the
points that I have raised here (a c c o m p M fe ^ y tn y ^ o n Paul Tf agreeable) in more detail. Could
you please let me know whether this is possible.

I hope that the issues I have raised in this letter are acted upon with integrity and 1 look forward
to hearing from you.




Yours sincerely

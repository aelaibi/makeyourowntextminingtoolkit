away     ill     or       on    holiday.

On Saturday               the       15th,       my    shifj/was             0600    to       1400 a n d         I finished

work     at    about           1415.

At     about         1555 or 1600,                  w h i l s t out     shopping,              I n o t i c e d two           West

Yorkshire           ambulancestogether                           with what          I believed                 to be a        red

cro ss       ambulance              and a SYMAS             ambulance,             all       with      ligh t s       and        h o r ns

heading        towards              Hallamshire             Hospital.              I realised              that       because             the

West     Yorkshire              vehicles             were    in the a r e a ,               SYM AS were          obviously                in

need     of    help.            I decided             to    go    straight          to       tha S t a t i o n        about          thre&

miles        away.         Th e      traffic          was    very       heavy       in b o t h        directions.

recall,         I told          them          that                 had       checked          a    vehicle and                  t h a t we

We     set    off     in S i e r r a           105    with       myself       driving.               The       ambulance             is

an     out-patient              vehicle             that    has    a    dual       purpose           ro l e .        We    were

on     Channel        4    the       o u t — patient         Channel.              We       booked        out    of       Station             and

Control        told        us       to    stay       with    him       on   Channel           4.      As       far    as     I    can




We     made    our        way       to    the       scene    but       could       not       get     via       Leppings           in.

We     spoke     to       Police          and       could    see       that    Leppings              Ln    was       Dlocked           witn

crowds        arid e m e r g e n c y           services.           We       then    drove          around        to       P e n i s tone

roundabout            the       rd w a s        blocked          with       traffic.
I therefore                turned         up     Herries               Rd    South,            left       along       Herries          R d,         and

up    to    the       roundabout.                   There          were        Police           on    duty        there.           I drove

on    to    Leppings              L n,    using          my     horn         and       lights         to    part       the    crowd.

Supporters             were        pouring              out     away         from         the       ground.

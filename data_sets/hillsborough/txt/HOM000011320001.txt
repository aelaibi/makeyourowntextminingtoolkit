HILLSBOROUGH AND THE SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS
I understand that the _Home Secretary has seen the letters in
The Times of. Saturday August 19 and has asked that we should
consider whether the duty Minister should seek to respond- An
extract from The Times is annexed.
2.   There are two letters: the first from Mr R Edey accuses the
Home Secretary of dereliction of duty by failing to issue
regulations or to give guidance to local authorities as to the
terms and conditions to put into safety certificates.  The other
letter, from Mr Edward Grayson, appears to be criticising the
Government for failing to provide a regulatory system for sports
grounds. Mr Grayson appears not to have heard of the the present
regulatory system and it seems doubtful whether a reply 'to his
letter is necessary.
3.   It would be possible to provide a reply to Mr Edey's letter
though I am doubtful whether it is necessary or indeed would be
prudent, to do so. Mr Edey's main point is that the Home Office
has failed to give guidance to local authorities or to regulate
the terms and conditions to put into safety certificates.      It
would be possible to refute this, at least to some extent. Since
1975 local authorities have been advised (by circular) that in
imposing conditions they should follow the principles set out in
the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (the 'Green Guide) even
though this document has no statutory force. We have also issued
guidance on the nature of the inspections which should be carried
out in connection with the safety certificates.      But the main
thrust has been to emphasise that the local authority has
discretion as to what should be contained in the safety
certificate which should be drawn up after consultation between
the local authority and the club as well as with the police and
where appropriate either the building authority or the fire
authority.
/   4.   Mr Edey also questions how many clubs have been operating
    without a safety certificate and suggests that it is the Home
    Secretary's duty to find out and remedy the situation.
    5.   A draft letter is annexed which deals     with the first of
    Mr Edey's allegations.   It also points out     that Lord Justice
    Taylor will consider the question of central   supervision of the
    safety responsibilities of local authorities   in the second part
    of his inquiry.
    6.   I have misgivings about writing in these terms, for two
    reasons. The first is that although Lord Justice Taylor has made
    no reference to it in his interim report, it is at least possible
    that in his final report he may suggest that the situation at
    Hillsborough would have been improved had there been firmer
    guidance from the Home Office. There is at present no reason to
    believe that he will. |’>/The second point is perhaps even less
    satisfactory. Although 'the Government proposes that the Football
    Spectators' Bill should permit the Football Licensing Authority,
    if it is so desired, to supervise the safety responsibilities of
    local authorities in respect of designated football matches, the
    fact is that-we have no effective current mechanism for ensuring
    that   local authorities     carry out these responsibilities
    effectively.   By drawing attention to the proposals which the
    Government has in hand, we may only draw unnecessary criticism to
    the fact that we have never thought it necessary to check that
    the legislation was being properly enforced.
    7.   On balance therefore my advice would be not to respond.

                     LETTER DRAFTED FOR SIGNATURE BY ...DUTY MINISTER..........
                                                        (NAME OF SIGNATORY)


                     May I take this opportunity to refute the accusation made in
                     his letter which you published on 19. August by Mr R Edey
                     that the Home Office has been guilty of dereliction of duty
                     by failing to issue regulations or give guidance as to the
                     terms and conditions to put into safety certificates for
                     sports grounds

                     Can I say that since 1975, Home Office guidance to local
                     authorities has been that in imposing conditions they should
                     follow the principles set out in the Guide to Safety         in
                     Sports Grounds (the Green Guide).


                     Until last year ■when it was extended to apply to sports
                     grounds generally, the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975
                     specified particular matters which should be included in
                     safety certificates for stadia and we have also issued
                     statutory guidance on what to look for          in safety
                     inspections.  But the general principle of the legislation
                     is that the conditions are at the discretion of the local
                     authority, who are required to consult the police and, as
appropriate, either the fire authority or the building
authority before issuing or amending a certificate.


To prescribe the detailed conditions of safety certificates
by regulation will only fetter this discretion. There is no
such thing as a standard safety certificate:      they are
unique documents each relating to the    conditions   in the
sports grounds to which they apply.      '


Lord Justice Taylor has indicated that he will consider
whether there should be some national oversight or
inspection of locajL; authority procedures in stage 2 of his
inquiry.   You will probably have seen that the Government
has already amended its Football Spectators' Bill so that,
if it is considered appropriate, this supervisory role could
be given to the proposed Football Licensing Authority.

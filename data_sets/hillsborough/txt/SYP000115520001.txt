It w a s     then       that       I was       informed        by PC        Wilson          t h at     we      had    been asked

to    go    to   the     Leppings          Lane        turnstile           area.           It was       about        S .50'pm         (1450)

The    turnstiles             at    this       location        are      divided            into N o r t h        stand

into       the    ground       and were           becoming           more       i11-tempered, unco-operative

and    aggressive             as    they       realised        that        it w a s        almost        tirne for          the       game

to    commence          and    that       they were           not     yet       in    the       g ro u n d .

At    the    front       of    the       crush     people; w e r e           being         forced        against           the

to    escape       the       extreme        pressure.            A     la r g e      number        of    people        were       a lso

climbing          up    the    walls        and    gaining           access          to    the     ground        over       the       top

of    the    walls       despite          them     being       about         I S ’ high.

I could          see    that       two    of     the    Merseyside              Mounted          Officers            had    gon e       to

I together            with       PC    Wilson           tried       to    get     through         the     crowd        in o r d e r         to

We     formed        the     cordon         but       were     s t il l    under          great     pressure           from        the

South Yorkshire Mounted Department at the Niagara Police Sports Club*       I -was
deployed, along with Police Sergeant 1?10 Watson and P C s 790, 4 5 9 , 1226 of
the Nottinghamshire Constabulary and Polioe Sergeant 399, P C s 74b, 2 j16 ,
24.72 and 1498 of the South Yorkshire Police to Penis Tone Road.


At 11 JO am all horses moved off to go to the ground*      Once at the grounu we
weresplit into pairs each Nottinghamshire officer with a South Yorkshire
officer.   I teamed up ■with Pc 231 6 Scott*   Due to an insufficient number of
radios allocated to Nottinghamshire Mounted Officers* there "being oily one
radio "between eight officers, I had given my radio to Sgt Watson and was there­
fore ■without a radio and reliant on Pc Scott for any radio message.      After
pairing up Pc Scott and I then patrolled once around the ground to familiarise
me with the area before talcing up point duty on the central reservation on
Penistone Road, opposite the North Stand entrance gates r0 **


At this location we were to supervise the Nottingham Forest supporters who
were arriving at the ground on Penistone Road and who were all required to
enter the ground through the Penistone Road turnstiles*      As we stood at this
point Nottingham Forest supporters were arriving in large numbers hut we were
well "behaved and entered the ground as soon as they arrived presenting no unusual
policing problems*


At about 1 35 PH Pc Scott and I were then detailed to attend 'vads ley Bridge
railway station to assist in the arrival and escort of Liverpool supporters
from the teain to the Leppings lane turnstiles.


About 1 55 pm approx 400 supporters arrived on the train and myself and about
seven other Mounted Officers began to escort them to the ground, down Penistone
Road, onto leppings Lane, towards the turnstiles*     However, at this time there
were also several hundred Liverpool fans who had not come on the train mal-cin^f
their way towards the ground in the same direction as the escort*       These people

 all joined on to the escort until by tits tine we had entered Leppings Tane
 at Its junction with .Penistone Road it was impossible to tell who had in fact
 come on the train.                 There were hundreds of people walking up Leppings Lane
 talcing up half of the oarriage-way, as they mads their way to the ground.                                                     Because
 of these large numbers of Liverpool fans it was impossible to keep them on the
 pavement*


 On arrival at Leppings lane turnstiles, which was about 2 15 pm,I could see
 that there were also hundreds of fans pouring down the road from Middlewood
 Road area and onto the bridge area o f lappings Lane.                                                At this point the fans
 coming from both directions converged on the bridge area which became blocked
 from Catchbar Lane.                    A buildup was now beginning in front of the turnstiles
 but at this time it was orderly, people were gradually moving forward as they
 gained entrance to the ground.


 I coaid also see that the vast majority of the Liverpool supporters arriving
      "vliiS tin e were young mall rr ifhn hpjs w lt.h thp.r: mns n f oppt, gpnRra'Hy in

At this point I had become separated from Pc Scott and so I joined up with
Pc 3186 Wilson of the South Yorkshire MountedDept*                                               Together we began to attempt
to clear Leppings Lane, to try and keep the traffic flowing and to try and
encourage fans to enter the ground,                                       We continually went back and forth along
Leppings lane asking people to make their way into the ground.


Whilst doing this we became aware of a fight taking place between Liverpool
supporters outside a gas shoTOoon at the junction of Leppings Lane and
Catchbax Lane.        Pc 'Wilson and I went to that tlocation and assisted in the
dispersal of a small group of about 10 fans whilst                                              foot officers detained
some of the group*


We then continued to attempt to clear the bridge area which was still inaccessible
to vehicles.       Whilst doing this we were joined by two Merseyside Mounted
Offioers.


By now the atmosphere was beginning to become less friendly.                                                       Hie bridge area
was still blocked t?y young males, many seated, who were still drinking heavily.
Foot officers were attemtping to confiscate scoe of the beer but because of the
large numbers with beer this was almost an impossible task*
A further fight -then "broke out on the bridge on Leppings Lane between about
20 Live^ocl .^porters vnich again I attended with Pc "Wilson and assisted
whilst foot officers detained peopled


By this time even greater numbers of supporters were flocking down the road
with a sudden increase in front of the turnstiles and on tie bridge area.                              There
were by now about 3000 people in the area in front of the turnstiles and spilling
out onto the roadi


It was then that I was informed by Pc "Wilson that we had been asked to go to

immediately in front of the turnstiles and the entranoe off Leppings lane.
The turnstiles into West Stand are bordered or. one side by the wall and on
the other side by a steel barrier.                This area in particular was packed solid
with people who were being pushed forwards towards the turnstiles by the -vast
numbers of people behind them.               The majority of thesepeople pushing at the
rear of the crush bad only arrived within the last few minutes and were badly
affected by drink.         They were pushing in an attempt to get into the ground
and were becoming more ill-tempered, unco-operative and aggressive as they
realised that it was almost time for the gaae to commence and that they were
not yet in the groundi


At the front of the orush people were being forced against the turnstilesf
some of the younger children were being passed overhead to escape the extreme
pressure.     A large number of people were also climbing up the walls and gaining
access to the ground ovsr the top of the walls despite them being about 12 *
high,


I could see that two of the Merseyside Mounted Officers had gone to the front
near the turnstiles and were attempting to relieve pressure at the front,
whilst other Mounted Offioers were near the blue steel gates attempting to
create some form of barrier between those pushing at the resr and those in
thn tnimriti'lpi rvrfiru    Hfiwrnrpr, hrr.punp- nf thf- imflti nnmiifvrfi nr rnnn’lft * l w "h'ftm
still pushing through into the turnstile area.




                                                                                 A MAIN      WPC 156
 I together with Pc Wilson tried to get through the crowd, in order to get
 towards the front to assist in holding them back,   Ilowevsr, again because
 Oi. the number of people pushing at the rear? who ■were unco-operative and hostile
 .towards the police, this proved difficult as they were determined to get to
 the front.


 A landrover with, loudnailers then arrived but could not get through the crowd
 of people and its message requesting thai the crowd stop pushing for fear of
 injuring people at the front, was lost beneath the noise of the crowd*


 I then saw that the blue outer steel gates had been closed.    At this point
 I was beckoned by Inspector Hand—Davis of South Yorkshire Mounted Section
 to form a nose to tail cordon with the horses across the entrance from
 Leppings Lane which I did with a number of other Mounted Officers#     This we
 were able to achieve oecaus© of the temporary relief given by the closure
 of the outer gates^


We formed the cordon but were still under great pressure from the crowd who
were pushing at the horses, hitting them and pulling at the reins*      The pushing
was so great that the horses were put under eztreme pressure, people were
 in fact pushing the horses out of the line and breaking through thesi,    They
were abusive and agigressive.


It was whilst I was in this cordon that I was approached by a man who was irr&te
and abusive.   He m s shouting at me 'What do you lot think you're doing, look
at that lot at the front by the turnstiles, if you don’t open those big gates
and let us all in, someone will get killed out here1.    This man was in his
thirties and it was apparent to me that he had been drinking.


We continued to hold the crowd with the cordon for a few minutes;      I then
notioed that the crowd had broken through the line of horses behind me and
that people were rushing down, towards the turnstile area.   I looked down towards
the turnstiles and could see that the area was clearing rapidly as everyone
entered the ground through a set of gates which had been opened.      The area
cleared very quickly*


I was then sent round onto Penistone Road to standby opposite the North Stand
gates 'O' which I did with a number of other Mounted Officers.    We were sent
to this point as it was opjssite the access onto the pitch, should it have
become necessnry for us to enter the ground.   I-Iowever, it very quickly became

apparent that some t.ciing seriously- wrong was happening inside the ground*


We remained at this point on Psnistone Hoad -until about 4 30 pm.      I then began
a general patrol with Po Wilsonj supervising the departure of Nottingham Forest
supporters £rorr. the ground in the Penistone Road and Harries Road area.


We were at the junction of Parkside Road and Pshetone Road when we received
a radio message regarding a fight in Hillsborough Park.     Pc Wilson and I
attended together with Pc's 149« and 2472 of South Yorkshire.     There were
about 20 youths righting, throwing bottles and pisoes of wood at each other,
whioh we dispersed enabling foot officers to detain some of them.      We then
continued thncugh the park onto Middlewood Road,   A further radio message
■was then received regarding a fight on I&ddlewood Road, however we did not
find a disturbance so we continued to patrol down into the Hillsborough
shopping area.   This we found all quiet so we returned to Penistone Road
via Middlewood Road and Leppings Lane and then remained on standby on Penistone
Road with Sergeant Soar sty of the South Yorkshire Mounted Section,


At about 6 30 pn we were informed that we could sxand down and return to Niagara
stables.

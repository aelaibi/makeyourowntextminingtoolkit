The    fans        that     I    came     in     contact                with          during             the       course       of

and    looking        forward            to     the       game.

The    majority           of     the     fans        appeared                to       have       arrived                and

entered        the    ground           before         the       kick          off          time.and                there       had

been     no    problems,              although            it    was          obvious             that          a    large

number        of    fans        heading         towards             the       ground             had          been       drinking.

By    3 . 0 5 om    ( 1 5 0 5 ) I had           gathered                my    Serial             together                and    we

started        to    make        our     way     towards                Claywheels                   Ln       for       meal.        At

this     time       I could           hear      on    the       radio             a    lot       of       transmissions

coming        from    the        Leppings            Ln    end          of    the          ground             with       regards

to    the     crush       of     fans     outside              the       turnstiles                      and       I heard          the

message        go    out        for    the      gates          to       be    opened.                    It    was       then       that

we    were     stopped           on    Penistone               Rd       at    the          junction                of    Herries
          ^{|ia
Rd    by Supt CHA PMAN,                  w ho    ordered                us    to       enter             the       ground

because        the    Liverpool               fans        were          on    the          playing             area.           I took

my    Serial        into        the    ground         from          j^/nistone               Rd          e nd a n d       we

entered        the    playing            area        beWeen              the          North          Stand          and       the    Hop.




On    entering        the        p l a y i n g area,            I       could          see       a       large          number       of

fans     on    the    pitch           a y the        Leppings                Ln       end    of          the       ground       and

at    this     time       I thought             that       there             had       been          a    pitch          invasion
                                                                                                                       PAGE           3
                                                                                                                       S2577

and    that          we    had          been       sent       into    the       ground          to    clear          the

pitch.           I,       along          with       my    Serial,          ran       across          the    pitch          to

offer       assistance                   to       the    few    Officers             who       were    already

there.           At       first          I tried          to    talk       to       the    fans       to    get       them       to

move       off       the       pitch,             but    I was       met       by    hostile          reactions             and

phrases          like,             "Get       fucked"          and    "There's             people          getting

killed       in       there."

These       are       phrases                that       you    hear       regularly             when       you       get    a

large       crowd          who          are       all    pushing          and       shoving,          so    I was          not

unduly       worried                and       was       still       treating             the    situation             as    a

pitch       invasion.                    It       was    not    until          I got       nearer          to    the       fence

at    the    Leppings                   Ln    end       that    I    realised             that       they       were

telling          the       truth             and    people          were       being       crushed          to       death.




On    seeing          what          was       happening             and    realising             that       there          was

already          a    large             crowd       of    Police          and       fans       trying       to       get

people       out          of       the       terraces,          I tried             to    give       what       a s s i s t a n ce

I could          to       the       injured             fans    who       were       being       passed          out       onto

the    pitch.              I was             trying       to    give       reassurance                to    the       walking

wounded,             but       most          of    the    time       I was          being       pushed          and    jostled

by    other          fans          who       did    not       appear       to       be    injured,          but       all       who

seemed       intent                on    blaming          the       Police          for    what       was       happening

and    a    large          number             of    them       appeared             to    have       been       drinking.

It    was    shortly                after          this       that    I saw          a    number       of       Liverpool

fans       rush       towards                the    Spion       Hop       as    if       they    were       going          to

cause       trouble                with       the       Forrest       fans.              I assisted             in    ushering

these       fans          back          towards          the    Leppings             Ln    end       and    then       carried

on    giving          assistance                   to    the    injured             fans.

A young          fan       who          I think          was    a young             girl,       about       11-12 years

old,       wearing             a    light          coloured          *T*       shirt       and       jeans,          was    being
                                                                                                                      PAGE            4
                                                                                                                      S2577
     tended       to       by    a St       John's          Ambulance             woman.           I then       gave

     assistance             to    carry          the    fan       across          the    pitch       to    the       corner

     of    the    field          between          the       North       Stand          and    the    H o p , where          an

     ambulance             was    waiting.              I       put    the    girl       down       and    at    this       time

     she    already             appeared          to    be       dead.        I left          her    being       tended          to

     by    other       people          and       went       towards          another          youth       who    was       lying

     on    the    grass          gasping          for       breath,          but       who    was    not       being

     tended       to.           The    ambulance                had    left       the    field       by    this       time       so

     I,    along       with       another          person             who    I don't          know,       carried          the

     youth       off       the    pitch          and    into          the    gymnasium.              By    this       time

     there       was       bodies          lying       all       over       the    place       inside          and    outside

     the    gymnasium.                 I    left       the       youth       with       people       at    the

     g y m n a s ium       and    returned             to       the    playing          area.




     The    only       body       I handled             was       the       aforementioned                that       I know

     for    definate.                 All    the       rest       I dealt          with       were       the    walking

     wounded.




7.   During       the       whole          incident             there       was    a    lot    of    help       coming

     from       the    fans       on       the    pitch,          but       all    the       time    there       was       that

     nucleus          of    trouble          makers,             who    seemd          intent       on    going       round

     stirring          up       hatred       and       blame          towards          the    Police.           I had       to

     break       up    many       minor          scuffles,             some       between          the    fans

     themselves             and       some       between          Police          and    fans.

     My    feelings             were       that    as       a    whole       we    were       not    given       enough

     information                about       what       was       happening             and    it    seemed       a    long

     time       before          most       people       realised             that       it    was    not       just    a

     pitch       invasion.

     A    lot    of    the       fans       I had       dealings             with       in    the    playing          area

     appeared          to       have       been    drinking             heavily.

                           Once    all       the       bodies       had    been       moved       the     game       had    been

                           abandoned.              I gathered             my    Serial        together          again       and    we       went

                           back    onto          Herries       Rd    to    carry          out t r a f f i c     control          and    to    try

                           and    keep       a    path       open    along          the    road     for      the     emergency

                           services.              We    remained          there       until       all     the       traffic       had       gone.

                           Whilst       carrying             out    Traffic          Control        I had       to    break       up    a

                           skirmish          between          Liverpool             fans,     who      all     got    out    of    a mini

                           van and       tried          to    attack       Forrest           fans      in a m i n i        bus

                           travelling             in    the    opposite             direction.            The       Liverpool          fans

                           all    appeared             to    have    been       drinking          heavily.




                           I have       worked          several       big       games        at   Sheffield           Wednesday

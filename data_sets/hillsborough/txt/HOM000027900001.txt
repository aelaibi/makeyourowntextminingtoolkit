                          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR’S FINAL REPORT
                                   OF HIS INQUIRY INTO THE
                              HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER


        With     permission,          Mr Speaker,            I    should       like     to       make    a
        statement about the f inal r e p or t of Lord J u s t i c e Ta yl o r' s
        Inquiry i n to the tragedy a t the Hillsborough stadium on
        15 April 1989, which i s published today.                              Some months have
        passed since t h a t           terrible        event but not                long enough I
        know to dull the pain                 suffered by the bereaved and I wish
        to place on record                  my sympathy for them and f o r those who
    I   sustained i n j u r y .


            am most g r a t e f u l         to Lord J u s t i c e Taylor f o r the Report,
? c*\   whi chQs a careful                 and thorough
        had so many major t r a g e di e s a t foot bal l                      grounds over the
        years and why we have had d i s o r d e r and hooliganism.                                      As
        the    House     familiarises           itself       with        the    Report       it    will
        become      clear     it      is    addressed        as        much    to    the     f oot bal l
        i ndustry as i t i s to the Government.                           Lord J u s t i c e Taylor
        explains       how in         his    interim     report           he concentrated               on
        overcrowding          because           that     was           the     cause         of     the
        Hillsborough d i s a s t e r ,         but now he goes on to t a l k of a
        game, the image of which has been much t a r n i s h e d ,                               and of
        a     blight     over      the        game     due        to     old        grounds,       poor
        facilities,         hooliganism,             excessive           drinking          and     poor
        l eadershi p.
             Lord    Justice                Taylor        does         not         spare        those        who run        the
             industry.                 He says indeed t h a t the provision they make for
             their    customers                is        often not merely basic                              but squal id,
             and he says t h a t squal i d conditions can have an impact on

             Lord J u s t i c e Taylor says t h a t the Football Association and

            genuinely                  interested              in     the          welfare              of        t h e i r own

                 acknowledges            the       cr uci al      role         of       the     po li ce      in        crowd

    The Report recognises the advances made in the l a s t couple
    of years in the e f f e c t i v e n e s s of the p ol i ci ng of f o o t b a l l ,
    particularly          i ns i de grounds,                 and to the major impact of
    closed        circuit      television            on the         hooligan    problem.          It
    also mentions ot her measures taken by the Government such
    as the r e s t r i c t i o n on the s a l e of alcohol                      and the power
r’A' given   to     the Courts            to make            orders    excluding convicted
 I hooligans from grounds.


    Lord J u s t i c e Taylor also recognises                          the g r e a t p o t en t ia l
    value of the pol ice National Football I n t e l l i g e n c e Unit in
    dealing        with     f o o t b a l 1- r e l a t e d   crime     and     with    hooligans
    t r a v e l l i n g to matches abroad.


    As I have s ai d ,           Lord J u s t i c e          Taylor takes the view t h a t
    b e t t e r f a c i l i t i e s and b e t t e r t reatment of fans will bring
    b e t t e r behaviour.           Beyond t h a t , the Report recommends the
    cr eat i on     of    t h r ee      new s p e c i f i c      offences        to    apply     at
    designated s port s grounds:                       throwing a m i s s i l e ;       chanting
    obscene or           racialist         abuse;            and going       onto the        pitch
    without        reasonable            excuse:              and     it     al so    asks      for
    consideration to be given to extending the c o u r t s ’ powers
    to impose attendance ce ntr e orders and f o r the use of
    e l e c t r o n i c tagging in the case of offenders convicted of
    f o o t b a l 1- r e l a t e d offences.           The s p e c i f i c new offences

       employed by the                  fo ot bal l   authorities.            He came to           the
       conclusion t h a t he could not support a scheme of t h a t kind
       because he did not b el ieve the technology would work well
       enough to avoid the danger of congestion and d i s o r d e r .                               He

       Act will remain on the s t a t u t e book and/ i or k will continue
       to   see how the shortcomings                        identified       by Lord J u s t i c e
       Taylor could be overcome in case we have to r e t ur n to the
       matter      again       should          the    problem of        hooliganism not             be
       defeated        by     the        alternative        strategy        proposed         in    the
       report


               The r i g h t course now i s to implement Part II of the

in the way I have i nd ic at ed.                        Mr Speaker, we are giving
the     indust ry        and the         clubs        a f in al    opportunity to              put
themselves in order.                    The public will not forgi ve them i f
they do not now a c t .




A l t e r na t iv e Peroration


In the l i g h t of t h i s advice, the Government have decided
not     to       proceed       with      the     est abl ishment          of    a      Football
Membership Authority but Part 1 of the Act will remain on
the     Statute         Book      and     the     concerns         expressed           by     Lord
J u s t i c e Taylor about the type of scheme he looked i nt o
                 explored       lest      we have to r e t ur n            to   the matter
              Let no-one imagine t h a t t h i s means t h er e will be
any l e t up in the f i g h t aga in st hooliganism.                             Those who,
unlike Government,                 have f o r so          long shrugged o f f t h e i r
r e s p o n s i b i l i t i e s will    now have to face up to them.                           The
Government intends                to proceed as quickly as possi bl e
                                                                                                 &   (
the establishment of a Football                            Licensing Authority and 1 c</v,KyCi«^>"v
Section 11 of the Football Spect at ors Act will be used to
direct       the      Licensing          Authority         to     r e qu ir e   al l        seater
stadia       -     with      standing          being       reduced       by     stages         and
e n t i r e l y eliminated             in 1st and 2nd Division grounds and
the S co tt i sh Premier Division by August 1994 >sfand in a ll
designated^grounds by 19991s.                 The necessary st ep s will be
taken to ensure             improved arrangements         f o r crowd control
and b e t t e r t r a i n i n g f o r pol ice and stewards.           There will
be urgent cons ider at ion of the case fo r new offences and
fo r new powers to deal with those excluded from grounds by
the Courts.             The Clubs      will     be compelled to get r i d of
the t e r r a c e s .     But Lord J u s t i c e Taylor i n d i c a t e s how much
more      they      can     do    to   create     a   better   atmosphere      by
improving the now often squal id conditions to which they
s ub ject t h e i r       supporters    - s qual id condi ti ons      which can
encourage squalid behaviour.                    Those clubs which have not
faced       up     to     their    responsibility       now
                                                      a f inal have
                                                  cve'tr
opportunity to do so: and i f they d o n ' t now LortW w siicje
T H y t o r - and the public will         not forgive them.

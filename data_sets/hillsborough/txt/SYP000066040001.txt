                  I was       on     duty      on   the    date     of    the    disaster          at    the H i l l s b o r o u g h    ground

                  (0800)        to 7      pm.       (1900)

                  I reported             at 8 a m      (0800)       to    the    caretakers             office     at    the    ground.             I

                  had a       cup of        tea     first     of all.

                  I met       up w i t h                                  groundsman,             and                                    la Y T S

Rd a n d        then      to       the     training           ground.

There       were         no    football             supporters            around         at       this       time.           I didn't          see

any     police           about        either.

We    s t a y e d at          t he    training             g r o u n d al l     morning               u n ti l    roughly          1.30    pm.

(1330)

During          t hi s    time        I did         not     se e a n y     football               supporters             or    police.

At    roughly            1 .30       pm    (1330)          the    three       of    us       had       finished          our w o r k       at    the

                                                                                    ~        “    llsborough             ground.

                                           .alked t o g e t h e r         down M i d d l e w o o d               Rd.

There       were         about        SO Liverpool                supporters             sat          on    the w a l l       of   the

training           ground            car     park       inNfliddl4wood R d

Most       of    these         were        drinking           can                                     lager       and    s om e    had     pack

of    four       cans         of     beer       with       them.

There       is a P a k i s t a n i              shop       in M i d d l e w o o d       Rd       opposite          the       car   park.

This       was     full        of L i v e r p o o l         supporters.                 I went             in for       cigarettes             and    I

saw    supporters                  walking          o ut    of    the     shop with               cans       of    beer a n d        lager.

I also          saw a white                woman        in the       shop       re-stacking                  the       shelves       with       cans

of    beer       and      lager.

The    o n es      sitting            on     the     wall        were     singing            football             chants       s u c h as

’L i v e r p o o l ,      Liverpool,                we're        going     to w i n          th e      cup.*

There       were         a few        of     th e    supporters            just         walking             up a n d     down Middlewood

Rd    as    if     they        didn't           know what           to    do.

There       was     no        violence           here       and     no    fighting.

The    three        of        us     walked         left      onto       Leppings            Ln       a n d as     we    turned       into

Leppings          Ln,         this        being      about        1.40     pm      (1340)             I s aw      crowds       of L i v e r p o o l

supporters               outside           the      main      entrance.

The    main        entrance               gates      were        open and          there          were       f ou r     or    five

policemen           standing               at    th e      main     gates       and      tw o         mounted          policemen          on    the

           The    football         supporters             just       seemed          to    be    gathering          outside           j us t

           waiting       but^not        many       going        through          the       turnstiles            into     the       ground.

           There    were        about\£Jor           3    hundred          supporters             at    t h is    time        in L e p p i n g s          Ln.

           There     certainly was                not^housands                  of    t h e m at       this      time an d          they were

           gathering         round the            en t r a n c e ,

           There    were        a few      shouted          chants         of    ’L i v e r p o o l ,    Liverpool.’

           There    was      no    trouble         and      I d i d n ’t see a n y               drinking         happening.

           At    this    t im e    1 .40    pm      (1340)       I would             have       expected         more     supporters                 to

           be a t L e p p i n g s     Ln    entrance            and       I would          have    expected             more     to    be       going

           through       th e     turnstiles             into    the       ground.

           The    three      of    us w e n t      to     the    main       gates          and    went     to a         policeman,              he wa s

           wearing       a helmet.

           We    told    h i m we w e r e         ground        staff       but       he    said       he w as      not       allowed           to    let

           anyone       through       so we        walked        into       what          I think       is V e r e       Rd,     the       next

           road    on the         right.

           This    was      barriered        off         but a       police          officer       let     us     through           when        we

           told    h i m we w e r e        ground         st a f f .

           We w a l k e d    onto    Penistone             Rd and          turned          right       onto      Penistone            Rd    and

           walked       towards       the    sports          hall         entrance          gates       on P e n i s t o n e        Rd.

           T h e r e ’s no      turnstiles           before          we    got       to    the    sports         hall     entrance              gates.

           There    wa s     a steady        file         of N o t t i n g h a m F o r e s t           supporters             walking           up    to

           and    going      through        the      Penistone             Rd    turnstiles.               I could            not     see       if a n y

           were    just      hanging        about,         they were             just       making       their          way    towards           th e

           t u r n s tiles.

           There    was      no    chanting          or    singing          from          these    supporters             and       there        wa s

           no    trouble.

           The    three      of    us w e n t      into      the       sports         hall       entrance         of     the     ground          and

           we w a l k e d    down     the    ramp         between          th e S p i o n        Kop and         t he    North Stand

           along    the      track      in f r o n t       of    the H o p a n d            up    the P l a y e r s       tunnel           at    the

South Stand              and    into           t he    caretakers            room.

As     I walked          round          th e    track        towards         the P l a y e r s        tunnel,         I noticed            that

there     were       quite          a    lot      of F o r e s t         supporters           in t h e i r      end,      the       Spion

Hop.       It w a s       between              half     and      three       quarters          full.

The     N o r t h Stand,            which         was       for L i v e r p o o l      supporters,              was    less         than

half     full.

The     West     Stand and               terrace            area,        this   being         for     the L i v e r p o o l

supporters,              was    less           than a third               f u ll.      I only         had a quick              glance         and

the     whole       of    the       West        Stand and            Terrace        was       less     than a         third         f u ll.      1

could     not       see m or e           because            I was        some   distance            a w ay .

This     would       now       be       between         1.50        pm    (1350)       and 2        pm.        (1400)

From     this       time       until           just     before           kick   off      we    just       stayed       in the

caretakers           office             or     nearby        and     I did      not      go    back       towards         the       pitch.

So     I didn't          see w ha t            was     happening           in the        ground        during         these         times.

The     players          and    officials               went        out at      about         five     minutes         to      three

(1455)        and    I went             into      the       dressing         rooms       to    collect          and    t ak e       the    tea

pots     to    the       kitchens.

After     I took          the       te a       pots     to     the       kitchen       I went        to    the      top     of      the

tunnel        inside       the          building            to a w a i t     th e   practice           balls        being        returned.

The     balls       are     returned              just       before        kick     of f      and     I took        them       to    the

home     players          dressing              room.

Then     I made          my w a y        down         the    players         turYftel a n d         into       my   seat       just

behind        the L i v e r p o o l            du g    out     in t h e      front       cH\the        South Stand.

By     this    time       the       game        had     only        just     kicked        off.\\

By     this    time       most          if     not    all      of    the    Forest         fans      were       in t h e i r        place      in

th e    Spion K o p .

The     North Stand also                       looked        pretty        full     as     did      th e W e s t      Stand         and

terraces         looked         pretty            full       but     I d i d n ’t t a k e        much      notice         as     I w as

watching         the      match.

About     five m i n u t e s             after         the     start       of   th e     match        I saw a few Liverpool

supporters            about       5    or    10 of          tm^D          climbing            over       the    blue        fencing          at    the

front     of      the L e p p i n g s        Ln     terraces

I thought          they were            j us t     trying             to       get       onto     the     pitch.

As    I watched,            more       and    more          Liverpool                   supporters         began          trying        to    get

over     th e    same       fencing          and       were         dropping               over     to    the       back     of    the       goal

along     the      touchline.

There     w er e a few            police          in f r o n t            of    th e       fencing        facing          the     fencing          and

they     seemed        to    be       telling          fans         trying            to    climb        the    fencing           to    get       back.

They     were      also      trying          to    get          the       supporters              off     the       grass       onto     the

track.

Some     of     these       supporters             were          standing,                 some     were       sitting          down and

more     and more           supporters             just          kept          coming         over       the    fencing           onto       the

pitch.          The    next       thing       i s a w was                 a    policeman,            I think          he w a s         wearing         a

flat     hat,      run      onto       the    pitch and                   up    to      the      referee        waving          his     arm       as

if    to a s k     for      the       match       to       be    stopped.

I thought          the L i v e r p o o l          f an s        were          just      trying       to    get       onto       the     pitch

and    I stood         up    to       try    to    see w h a t                was     happening           and       I just        watched          for

five     or     ten min utes.

I just        saw more        and       more       Liverpool                   supporters            coming          over       the     fence

and    onto      the      pitch,        and       I saw          police             officers         trying          to     help       them       over

the    fence.

I saw     som e ,      may    be 3 or 4 of                      the       supporters              laid     down       on     the       pitch

near     the     net.

I could         not    describe             any    of       them          in a n y         way    because           I w as      too     far       awa y .

I also        s a w St      John's          ambulance               people           who      are    always          at     the m a t c h         also

helping         people       off       the    fencing.

I could         not    see    anyone,             police            or St           J o h n ’s t r e a t i n g       anyone.            I was

too    far      a w ay.

I d id    not      see      any a m b ulance                or      fire        officers            at    this       time.

I then        moved       from my           seat       and       stood          at      the      bottom        of    th e    players

                                                                                                                                         S1Q3Q

tunnel        trying        to w o r k           out    what       had       happened.               I d i d n ’t r e a l i s e          anyone

was     h u rt.

I then wa lked              back          up     the     tunnel         and     stood         round         the       t o p of     the    tunnel

outside        the       office.

I just        stood        there          for     some        t im e    but     I do         not     know        for      h ow   long     and

then     I walked           back          down       t he     tunnel         and    I could              s ee    Liverpool

supporters           on the              pitch       nearly        up to        the      halfway            line.

There      was      quite           a    lot    now     on     the      pitch,          may    be        two     thousand.

They     were       just        standing             around       and        a f ew w e r e          crying.

There      was      also        a       line    of     police          spread across                 the        pitch       in a    line

roughly        by    the        halfway           line        facing         West       Stand.

At     this    t im e      a man and woman                     came         walking          towards            me    off   the     pitch.

The     w o m a n was       holding             her     right          arm with          her       left         hand and         c r yi n g .

The     man    had       his        arm       round     he r     comforting              her.

Somebody,           I d o n ’t k n o w w h o ,                took      them       up    the       players            tunnel.

Th e   woman        w as    a white             woman         about         25-30       yrs.         I c a n ’t r e m e m b e r          any

more     about       her.               The    man     w as    a white         man       probably               in his       e a r l y 30s.

T h a t ’s al l      I remember                 about         him.

I saw      her      some                                                op e n d        of    th e       players          tunnel      with      her

arm     in a s l i n g

The     next      thing                                                        - 4"                1 ~ -/ere          carrying        a youth

They     j us t     came        out       of    the     crowd          on    the    pitch          towards            the    tunnel.

I d o n ’t k n o w         the          people       who      were      carrying             him and            I c a n ’t d e s c r i b e

them     because           by       this       time     I was          in a s t a t e         of     shock           myself.        I just

di d    not    know        what          was    happening              and    there          was     a    lot        of   confusion.

T he   youth        that        was       being        carried was             a white             youth         about       15 or       16 yrs

old.

I c a n ’t r e m e m b e r              anything        else      about        him.           I d o n ’t k n o w            if he     was

conscious           or     not.

went     to     the        physiotherapy                   room    just     to    the      left      of    the    top      of    the

tunnel        and      they       took        th e    youth        inside.

A s we        took     him       inside         somebody           in the        room      shouted         we    need      some       ice.

I went        to     the        kitchens,            grabbed        a bag        and     filled        it w i t h      ice      and    g av e

There     were         a    lot       of     people         in the        p h y s i o ' s room.

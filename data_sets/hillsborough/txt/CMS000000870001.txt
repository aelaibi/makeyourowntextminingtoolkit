                   Dear Mr. Mould,



                        Following up my telephone conversation with you I would
                   like to put on record an official "cry for help" in relation to
                   conditions being set by the Sheffield City Council.

                        Probably as a result of being the home of the Hillsbrough
                   Disaster we are being asked to comply with demands for Stewards
                   and First Aid facilities which seem surely to be intended for
                   large crowds at Football Stadia.

                        As we currently only have Greyhound Meetings with an
                   average "crowd" of only 800 we feel that these demands are
                   unreasonable and unintended by the Lord Justice Taylor
                   Interim Report.

                        We hope you will be able to offer some hope of rational
                   thinking on this matter.


                                                                              Yours faithfully,




                                                                              A. LITTLEWOOD.
                                                                            Managine Director

Dear

HILLSBOROUGH TRAGEDY

Last Sunday morning, 16th April 1989, I was requested by
F8 Department of the Home Office to provide them with a
report concerning the British Transport Police involvement
in the above tragedy.

The report has been prepared and supplied as requested with
an additional copy being made available to the
Department of Transport with whom we have a constitutional
link.

I forward herewith a copy of the document for your
information as you may consider it to be pertinent to the
enquiries you are carrying out.  I am instructing my
Divisional Commanders responsible for policing at both
Sheffield and Liverpool to make officers available for
interview together with documentation should you wish to
conduct interviews.  They have been asked to give you
every possible assistance in your enquiries.

I appreciate the enormity of your task having recently
been involved in the investigation and public inquiries at
Kings Cross, Clapham and Purley.  If I, or the Force, can
be of further assistance please do not hesitate to contact
us.

Yours




W.I. McGREGOR
Assistant Chief Constable (Operations)

            I am a police constable         in the South Yorkshire P o li ce at present

            stationed at West Bar Police-Station,               Sheffield.
                                                  ,/

           At 12 noon <1200)          on Satt^day 15th April         1989 <150489)   I was on duty

            in uniform working a mobile            patrol    in company of other members of the

           Crime and Vandal              Unit.     Our duties being a patrol of the city

            centre of Sheffield re supervising fans attending the Hillsborough

            football ground for a match between Nottingham Forest FC and Liverpool

            FC that afternoon.

            At 1.45 pm (1345)         the same day the unit was needed to travel           the route

            to the ground via Shalesmoor and Penistone Road.                   From a number of

            public houses on that route fans were escorted to                  ’laid o n ’ buses to

            take them to the ground.             I can say that the majority of these fans

            had been drinking         intoxicants.      Police Officers then accompanied these
                                                                                 PAGE      2
                                                                                 S592A

buses to the ground.     At 3.1Q pm (1510 > the same day,            still    in company

of the unit,    I attended the Hillsborough F o otball ground.               On entering

near the North Stand I changed rny personal            radio to the Hillsborough

match channel.

After 2-3 minutes    I/heard a message      being passed via the radio from

Police Se           .EMENTS,   who repeatedly jjsked for bolt          croppers

stating that/fans
              ans were dying      in f r o n ^ o f   him.

Shortly after this I was d e p i o y e y in company of my unit and other

officers to form a cordon in-rfont of the N orth Stand.               This we did and

as we walked onto the pitch I saw numerous             people on the pitch by the

goals at the Leppings Lane end.        Both Police Officers and fans were on

the pitch and at this point 1 could not make out what was happening at

that end of the pitch.

The cordon was formed in front of the North Stand.                 I was facing the

crowd,   the crowd in this stand reacted to our presence.               A large

number of them screaming and shouting at us,                I became aware that a

number of coins were being thrown at the             line from the stand.       For the

next few minutes we were sworn and shouted at,               the noise of the crowd

making our personal    radios difficult to understand.

Although a number of the fans were         pointing to the Leppings Lane end

as they shouted,    it was difficult to make out what they were saying.

I did not fully uderstand what had happened at the Leppings Lane end

until    I saw a man being carried on a makeshift stretcher across the

pitch.


A short time after we were all withdrawn to the r e y               of the North

Stand.

On the arrival   of bodies being    carried by a mixture of Police

Officers,   Special Constables and fans I began he 1 pijs-gf^to carry bodies

into the Gym at the rear of the North Stand.                     itinued to help to

convey bodies from the    pitch by the North Stand and Spion Hop.                 I was
                                                                                                 PAGE     3
                                                                                                 S592A

                 aware of coins still being thrown from the Spion Hop and urine

                 falling on me from above        in the corner of the Spion Hop.           Bodies

                 were being taken to outside the gym where attempts were made to revive

                 them.     After which they were taken into the gym were the first               1/3 of

                 the building was being used.as a mortuary.

             ^ 1 assisted      in the mo vi r y if of a Roy PEMBERTON,      whose body 1 later

                 labelled as number          to the g y m .       I then took res pons ibili'ty for the

                 body,   recording his clothing and other belongings,               certification of

                 death etc.

                 I remained with the body until        12 m i dnight      (1200) when relatives

M f     ~        attended and formally identified the /Jfiody.

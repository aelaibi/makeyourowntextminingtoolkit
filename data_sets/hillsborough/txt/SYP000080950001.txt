             I am a married man, and I live at the above address with my wife.                              1

             am a Liverp*         S Uipporter
                                     ppOi       and have been for most of my life.                I was

             born in Birkenhead and my father used to take me to matches.                          I am a

             season ticket holder and have been for seven or eight years.                          I go to

             most home and away games and am a member of the                    ’Heart of E n g l a n d ’

             Liverpool      supporters club.           I have been a member of the supporters

             club for 10 seasons.

             On Saturday 15th April           1989 I went to the FA Cup semifinal              between

             Liverpool and Nottingham forest at Hi 11sboiy)ugh in Sheffield.                        I

             caught the supporters           club c/ach in Hinck/ey,          opposite /Che Library,
                                            n i   /       N/QOQS9T            n/cv~c?\o<     AvIP) I

             and a guy named                from Lutterworth.

             There were about 30—35 people already on the coach, which was a Lloyds
                                                                                                      PAGE
                                                                                                      S2521

        of Nuneaton coach when we got on,

        It then left for Leicester,                where/^e made another        pick up ./""About 6

        people got on including the W o                     boys who we re k i11ed-/that    I know now

        to be Car”           N 1c h o l ^ a h l y f T T .    I think that they were both wearing

        denim shirty,       as far as I can r emernbe r .            I did not know them well

        enough to talk to them.

        The coach then went straight to Sheffield and there was a slight delay

        at the motorway junction where Forest fans had to come off.                              We

        avoided %'rfis and went straight on to the turn off for Liverpool                              fans.
        ___ i. — — /                                                 /

                      the supporters            club secretary handed          out the patch tickets
               /
        on the/coach.        Mine was a twelve poun^r seating ticket f y r                 the

        West Stand.

        When we arrived in Sheffield we parked about                      10 minutes walk from the

        ground,    this was at about 2pm./                  I got off the coach with

                      and                        and we walked towards the a ro un d.             We knew

        where to go as we had been                to the ground before.         #s we left       the coach

        it was    the last time I saw            the two Hewitt brothers.

        On the    way, I saw many Police              in the streets near to       the ground.           I

        also saw fans drinking from cans in the street.                        The pubs I saw were

        shut.     I didnot,     however,        see anyone causing trouble.
                                                                    /                                A
        We arrived at the entrance to the ground at about 2.10pm. / W e                           kn/w

5.0 £   where the entrance was as we had been there before.                            were       tie to

        walk straight in through the turnstile without queuing so m y s e l f 7 and

        the other two                  went in.                  »ent into the South S t a n d .        When

        we got inside the turnstiles,                  there were Stewards at the bottom of the

        steps into the seats,       showing the way and ripping the co/ner from
                                                orr~    k /^5»t
        the tickets.        The 3 of us went straight to our seats a/id arrived there

        at approximately 2 . 2 0 p m .          I thought that at this stage,          there were not

        many Liverpool fans in the ground.                      There was a good atmosphere.

        I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary until just after the kick
                                                                            PAGE

off when I saw people begin to climb over t h / fence, onto the pitch,

We were seated to the right hand side of w e          stand a few rows back,

and could not really see the crowd below properly.

When I saw a guy on the pitch receiving mouth to moutiV, then I knew

something was wrong.        At this time there were quite a lot of people on

the pitch,   so they eventually stopped the match.

I did not witness anyone actually dying.           I did not assist anyone who

was dead or injured.         I did not see a barrier break.     I was not

subjected to any crush,       nor was I injured in anyway.I    think that a

combination of people getting in without tickets,

people arriving     late and then not being directed where to go is a

contributory factor in the incident that happened.

I did witness a supporter attacking a photographer and being dragged

away by a Policeman.

The announcement not to leave the ground came and then, about            15

minutes   later,   I left the ground with the two _______ .     We headed

back to the coach.

We realised at the coach,        sometime   later at about 5,30pm,   that two

lads were missing.         It was then that the Police told us to carry on.

I did not find out that they had died until Sunday 16th.

In my opinion,     there    is nothing that could have been done, after the

match was stopped,     that w a s n ’t already being done.    I would like to

add that there was a traffic delay from leaving the motorway and

getting to where we parked of approxiamtely 45 minutes.

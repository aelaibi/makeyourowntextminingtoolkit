        I         am writing with regard to the attached correspondence from Joe Benton. Given the             «         t
protracted history of the case, it might be helpful to let you have a potted version.       2Aj\\
        Officials here concluded that there was nothing for us in Mr Benton’s letter of 30 July,
and we faxed the papers to the Department of National Heritage asking if they would accept a
transfer. They declined and advised that, as DNH did not exist when the matter was under
consideration, the Home Office should answer. We faxed the papers that day to your
ministerial correspondence unit who refused to accept the correspondence on 9 August, saying
it was for DNH.

       We went back to DNH, who were unmoved, and thought that the Home Office still
held the relevant papers. One of our correspondence clerks, David Ruyoka, then contacted
your correspondence unit and asked them to reconsider the matter. I believe the
correspondence was then referred to your Disasters and Inquest Inquiry Group and then to
your Operational Policing Policy Unit for consideration.

        Mr Benton wrote to the Lord Chancellor on 20 September seeking an update. I replied
on 25 September explaining the position, and after several calls to your Operational Policing
Policy Unit, David was informed that Mr Benton had written directly to your Ministerial
Correspondence Unit on 21 October, requesting the same information. I understand that it
was at that stage that your officials decided to liaise directly with DNH to resolve the matter.

       On 31 October, your correspondence unit told David that DNH believed we were best
placed to answer, as we had general policy responsibility for steering groups. We have no


                                                                                                ■S '3 2 /» 2 -/5 jre >
                              FROM THE PRIVATE SECRETARY

such responsibility (Cabinet Office do, but they do not hold the sort of information requested
here). DNH therefore concluded that your department should respond, and your Operational
Policing Policy Unit agreed to investigate the matter further. On 5 November OPPU
contacted David reiterating the claim that the issue was for DNH.

         Mr Benton has now requested (in his letter of 11 November) a meeting with the Lord
Chancellor, but, as LCD had no involvement in the Hillsborough Steering Group, I fear their
is little more we can do, and a meeting with the Lord Chancellor or the Parliamentary
Secretary would be inappropriate. I am sorry to have to trouble you with this, but the
Parliamentary Secretary is now concerned about the length of time it is taking to resolve the
disagreement, and as we have done as much as we can here without any success, I wonder if I
can pass this over to you to take forward? If that is acceptable, I will let Mr Benton know.

       I am copying this letter and enclosures to David ]

Dear Lord MacKay

Mr          &                  Mrs                                          C h u r c h


I write to you further to my letter of 20 September
and your reply via your Private Secretary Alastair
Clegg of 25 September.

The position regarding my constituents after four
years of representation following the death of their
son in the Hillsborough Disaster is now intolerable.
I still await the list of names of the Steering Group
Members without which my constituents are unable to
proceed with their legal action.

Furthermore/ having                                                                      been granted Legal Aid/ they are
unable   to obtain                                                                       the  legal  representation  they
require.

I am disturbed by so many aspects                                                                             of this case I feel
obliged to request a meeting with                                                                              you/ myself and Mr
& Mrs Church.   If you are unable                                                                             to accommodate such
a meeting, would you arrange for                                                                              one of your senior
Ministers to attend?

I trust    you                                            will                             give       this   matter           your                 urgent

                      M r and M rs Church,

       I write with reference to your letters of 30 July and 20 September 1996. I have also
spoken to your secretary about this matter.

        As I mentioned to your secretary, we have had considerable problems in discovering
where responsibility lies for taking forward the matters raised in your letters. I can confirm
that the Lord Chancellor’s Department has no responsibility for matters relating to the
security of football stadia, and was not to my knowledge represented on the Hillsborough
Disaster Steering Group. Our difficulty in locating those responsible for the matter has been
exacerbated by the transfer of responsibility for the issue from the Home Office to the
Department of National Heritage in 1992. We are in touch with colleagues in each
department, however, and are attempting to track down the information for you.

        I am very sorry not to be able to be more helpful at this stage, and that it is taking such
a long time to provide the information. I am copying this letter to the correspondence sections
at the Home Office and the Department of National Heritage.

I wrote to you on 30 July requesting your assistance
in gaining the names on then list of people who
formed the Hillsborough Disaster Steering Group.

One of your officers did phone my office several
weeks ago stating that the details I request were not
held by your department but that he would try his
best to locate the list.

Time is getting on and myself and                                                       my       constituents
desperately need the list of names.

I am surprised that your department doesn't hold
information  relating  to the  Steering  Group  in
question who have receive a large amount of public
funds.

However, I await anxiously your reply with                                                                the   list

My above constituents and I have written to you
previously regarding      the provision of information
following their s o n ’s tragic death at Hillsborough.

Since  our last correspondence things                                                   have changed
radically in that my constituents have                                                  secured Legal
Aid.

Essential to our case is to obtain a list of the
names  of the people who formed the Hillsborough
Steering Group, but frankly/ we have hit obstacle
after obstacle in trying to obtain this; the latest
of  this   is  the  copy  letter  attached  which  my
constituents have received from the Court Service.

Therefore/ I hope you will not mind me writing to you
personally and stressing the nature of my personal
request for your assistance in obtaining this list.
It is absolutely essential for me and my constituents
to obtain this list in pursuance of what we consider
to be right and just aims.

I hope you can see your way clear to facilitate this.

Motors sincerely,                   1

      Dear Mr and Mrs Church

             Thank you for your letter of 22 March concerning the Hillborough Disaster
     Fund. It would seem from your letter that you have corresponded with ocher offices
     within the Court Service or Lord Chancellor’s Department as the letters on our file do
     not follow. I cannot see from this current letter how I can be of any help to you. This
     office can only respond to complaints about the administration of the courts or for
     requests for advice on procedural. If I can be of further assistance, please do not
     hesitate to contact me.



                                        Yours sincerely

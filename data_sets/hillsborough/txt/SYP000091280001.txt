The    supporters           coming       through these        gates a pp eared        very happy and              in

high spirits             looking      -forward to seeing            their    team    play.     There were              no

problems         e n c o u nt er ed with the fans?            there was       no f i g h t i ng /p us hi ng       to

get    in.       There was         in fact a steady           flow of       people    through these           gats

up until         3.(30 pm        (1500).

At 3.0 0       pm (1500)          together with PC 3341 Hi t c l y f l j f y f ii e n t to the

b ookmakers            stall    w h ic h was       in the bar area of the South Stand.                      As

soon as the             game     kicked    off we e sc orted the            bookmaker with his          takings

down to the directors                    entrance.

1 then returned                 to the S outh Stand and on arrival                   there    I could see

the    game had been stopped and there were alre ad y                               people    on the    pitch

and others             climbing     over the         fencing at      the Leppings Lane End.

At    first      it w asn't        clear what was          happening,        I saw many       other    police

officers         coming         on to the      pitch from the North S t a n d/ Co p            corner       of the

g rou nd .

After a short while                 I saw that         there were      people       being    brought    out

onto     the     pitch and were            being given heart massage and m outh                         mouun.

By this        time more          police were a rr iving            on the    pitch together with                 the

fire     brigade and ambulance.

We were        then d i rected           to go down to the           pitch.      On arrival         there     I

could see bodies                 being    carried over        the    cop end of the          ground    on

a dv e r t i s i n g    boards.

              There were Li var pool            fans     on the      pi tch who were            ei. ther e h a u s t e d ,               in

              shock     or wanting        to fight and several                 groups       of them were              trying          to

              charge        towards    the    coo.

              At the aeginning            of the      incident       it was         unclear     exactly what was

              happening?          that was     parti y    due    to being           so    far a wa y anti not             having a

              and helping          each      other. It       was a sickening               sight   to see and I felt

              very saddened and angry about                  the         whole affair.             I feel         that if

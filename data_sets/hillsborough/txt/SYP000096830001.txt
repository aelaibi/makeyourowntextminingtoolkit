AUTHORISED: CHIEF CONSTABLE

 FROM THE CHIEF CONSTABLE
 TO ALL MEMBERS OF SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE

 THE FOLLOWING IS THE TEXT OF MY REPORT TO THE POLICE AUTHORITY THIS MORNING,
 FRIDAY 21 APRIL 1989, REGARDING THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER.

 MEMBERS WILL BE AWARE OF THE MAJOR TRAGEDY WHICH OCCURRED AT HILLSBOROUGH
 FOOTBALL GROUND ON SATURDAY 15 APRIL 1989, AS A RESULT OF WHICH 95 PEOPLE
 DIED, 140 WERE TREATED AT LOCAL HOSPITALS AND FIVE ARE STILL IN INTENSIVE
 CARE.
 BECAUSE THIS FORCE HAS A RESPONSIBILITY FOR LAW AND ORDER IN THE AREA AND
 ASSISTED THE SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB WITH THE CONTROL OF THE EVENT
 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WRONG FOR THE SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE TO HAVE GATHERED
 THE EVIDENCE AND COME TO CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THE CAUSE.  THEREFORE I ASKED
 MR. GEOFFREY DEAR, CHIEF CONSTABLE OF WEST MIDLANDS, TO CARRY OUT THIS TASK
 AND HE AGREED.
 THE HOME SECRETARY HAS ANNOUNCED THAT THERE WILL BE AN INQUIRY LED BY LORD

                                                                      *    PAGE
JUSTICE TAYLOR.   THE TERMS OF REFERENCE ARE:-
           "TO INQUIRE INTO THE EVENTS AT SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY
            FOOTBALL GROUND ON 15 APRIL 1989 AND TO MAKE
            RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT THE NEEDS OF CROWD CONTROL AND
            SAFETY AT SPORTS EVENTS".                                       ^
MR GEOFFREY DEAR WILL BE SUBMITTING THE EVIDENCE HE GATHERS TO THE HEARINGS
TO BE HELD BY LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR.    THE SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE WILL GIVE ALL
INFORMATION IN THEIR POSSESSION TO THOSE CONDUCTING THE INQUIRY.
I CAN INFORM MEMBERS THAT THE PLANNING PREPARATORY TO THE EVENT WAS ON THE
BASIS OF THAT APPLIED TO PREVIOUS SIMILAR MATCHES.    THE NUMBER OF POLICE
OFFICERS ON DUTY IN CONNECTION WITH THE EVENT BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE
GROUND WAS 1,111 OF WHOM 257 WERE AT THE GROUND.
IT IS UNDERSTANDABLE THAT THIS EVENT HAS ATTRACTED IMMENSE MEDIA ATTENTION
AND I MUST INFORM MEMBERS THAT MUCH OF WHAT HAS BEEN SAID BY THE MEDIA IS
INCORRECT.
ATTENTION HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON THE ACTIONS AND DECISIONS OF INDIVIDUAL
OFFICERS.   THOSE INVOLVED AT THE MATCH FOUND THEMSELVES FACING THE POSSIBILF
OF A DISASTER OUTSIDE THE GROUND AND TOOK ACTION WHICH THEY CONSIDERED
APPROPRIATE TO RESOLVE THAT SITUATION.
I MUST SAY THAT THOSE OFFICERS WERE APPOINTED BY ME TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS
AND IT FOLLOWS THAT I ACCEPT FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE POLICE ACTION
4




CONNECTED WITH THE EVENT.                                            *   PAGE
I WELCOME THE INQUIRY WHICH IS ABOUT TO TAKE PLACE AND WHICH WILL
UNDOUBTEDLY REVEAL THE TRUE NATURE AND CAUSE OF THIS TERRIBLE TRAGEDY.
I BELIEVE THAT WHEN IT IS COMPLETED THE ACTIONS OF THE SOUTH YORKSHIRE
POLICE WILL BE SEEN IN A VERY DIFFERENT LIGHT.
I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PAY TRIBUTE TO THE TREMENDOUS
SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE PROVIDED DURING AND AFTER THIS TERRIBLE TRAGEDY
BY CHURCHMEN, THE STATUTORY AND VOLUNTARY AGENCIES AND MEMBERS OF THE
PUBLIC TO THE VICTIMS, THE FAMILIES OF THE VICTIMS AND TO THE POLICE

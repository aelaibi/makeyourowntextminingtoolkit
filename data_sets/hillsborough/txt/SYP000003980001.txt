              GRAHAM has always          lived with us in the Liverpool area.                      He received his

              education at local schools and left sc h oo 1 at the age of 16 years when

              he went    into full time employment.                In 19S0 GRAHAM joined the GAS

the Liverpool Football Club as a Season Ticket H o l d e ,r and I know on

that day he travelled with a ticket.               His travelling arangements we re

that he and six friends travelled from this area to SHEFFIELD in two

motor cars.  I know that GRAHAM travel led with PAUL DUNNERDALE and
r-^
    in one car, they didn't use G R A H A M ’S car. The other car contained
                 /Q M-^bS                                      <+1 ol

(1045)        to travel     direct.      I know he took a packed lunch with him.

had a quantity of cash and a front door k e y .

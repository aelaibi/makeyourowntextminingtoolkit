            SERIAL 17, LEPPINGS I AMF! TURNSTILES 1-8, ENTRANCE           ’A ’ WEST STAND

            SEATING.      SERIAL SSERGEANT P.S. W H I T L A M f '



            9.50 a.m.

            Attend briefing in North Stand.

            11.00 a.m.

            Took up pos it ion at turnstile 4, Le ppi ngs Lane entrance to West Stand

            seating.     At this time the turnstiles were not open and the blue

            steel gates     leading onto Le ppi ngs Lane were s h u t .   As small numbers

            of spectators began to arrive the turnstiles opened and we opened the

            gates to the turnstiles.          We we re issued with black plast i c dustbins

            for confiscated property.          Spectators began arriving but during the

            first hour to 12 o ’clock,        very few actually entered the ground.         From

            where     I was standing   I could see onto Leppings Lane where several

            people were standing a r o u n d .    The number of people arriving steadily

            increased until 2 o ’clock, at which time fans were           regularly entering
the turnstiles.    At around 2.30 p.m. queues for the turnstiles had

formed.    The queue®    in the area in which I was standing reached about

half way back to the gates onto Leppings Lane.           I had confiscated

many cans erf soft drinks but no alcoholic drinks.

However*   I had seen people throwing unopened cans of beer into the

black bins at the turnstiles.       I can remember a man walking up le the

turnstile and throwing away two unopened cans of Newcastle Brown

Ale,   He then walked back towards Leppings Lane and did not seem to

foe in any hurry to enter the ground.        At the same time another man

therw away a one and a half litre bottle of beer,           he too walked away

from the ground afterwards.       I can remember seeing two crates of

Heineken beer     stood on the ground at the corner of Leppings Lane.

Up until this time,     approximately    2.30 p.m.    the amount of people

queueing to get into the ground was still sufficiently few for people

to be able to walk up to me and ask directions to entrances etc.

I cannot recall anybody approaching me who did not have a ticket.

Fans seemed to be congregating outside the gates on Leppings Lane.

After 2.30 p.m. within the space of a few minutes,           I can remember

suddenly getting busier searching        people,   the queue at my turnstile

began pushing     and as   I looked up I saw that the area within the gates

was solid with people.       It seemed   as if a large number of people had

materialised from nowhere.

The pushing at the turnstiles      increased and I      can recall   people,

particularly older      people or people with children,      c^rnp^^jrung about

the pushing.

Within a few more minutes all signs of queueing had disappeared.                I

was stood with my back to the wall at the side of the turnstile and I

had stopped searching      people because there was no room to do so.

Because of the pressure of the crowd,        people began jamming      in the

entrance to the turnstile and as a result,           this slowed down the rate
                                                                                PAGE
                                                                                R 142

at which people could enter the ground.

More and more people began to complain about the crush and I noticed

that the situation was getting more serious than was normal for a

football match.

I   was not able to do anything          in the   position that I was    in and the

crowd pressure was         increasing all the time.        I decided to go to the

point on Leppings Lane where            I had last seen our serial Sergeant and

advise him of the situation at the turnstiles.               Our serial had not

been issued with r ad io s.       I    realised that    if I were to stay where I

was for any longer this would become              impossible so I for ced my way

through the    cr ow d .    This was very diffi cult even though people were

trying to make way for me as they realised               what I was trying to do.

As I got to the gates a          woman grabbed hold of my a r m , she had       injured

her foot and she was panicking and in tears.               I could not get her

through the crowd so I left her in a triangular               clearing made by the

opened gates.      I then made my way onto Leppings Lane.             I was    in a

crowd of people who were steadily pushing               in the direction of the

turnstiles.     I can remember         looking back towards the turnstiles where

I   had been and seeing what appeared to be just a crowd of people.                     I

was worried because from this distance the people approaching the

ground would not see,         or be aware of,      the crushing at the front.         All

the time    people were      pushing past me, adding to the crowd.            I wanted

to tell    them that they should hold back for a while and although some

did,   the majority didn't.           I then looked along Leppings      lane and as

far as I    could see it was full of people            coming towards us.      It looked

like a battering      ram.

As the crushing around the turnstiles             became more obvious,      mounted

officers    came to the point on Leppings Lane where            I was standing and

began to form a cordon,          presumably to hold back the crowd and         so

relieve the pressure on          the turnstiles.        I was stood in a gap   between

           back and I was being pushed off my feet.                        I moved to the stadium side

           of one of the horses.                   I could see fans scaling the wall at the

           turnstiles en mass.                I cannot say how many youths got in this way,

           but in the short time that I was watching,                       possibly 20 or 30 managed

           to gain entry this way.                     Many people were becoming abusive towards

           the mounted officers and I saw several struggles as people fought to

           get   past the horses to the ground.                     I noticed that the majority of

           fans trying to get into the ground at this time were youths. When I

           had been at the turnstiles earlier,                      the majority of people entering

           had been older and better behaved.

           After a few minutes            1       saw that the crowd at the turnstiles,         both for

           the West Stand seating and for the terracing,                       had thinned out.       I did

           not   realise at the time,                  but this was   probably coincident with the

           gates being opened.

           I then saw our serial                  Sergeant,     P.S. Whitlam and almost straight away

       ,   he told us of a radio call requesting officers to enter the ground.

           I followed other officers through the turnstiles and down the side of

           the Le ppings Lane terracing                     into the South Stand.   At the entrance to

           the terracing at the corner of the South Stand I saw an injured girl

           being treated by officers.  Although this area was full, I cannot say

           that it looked tightly packed.  I heard fans in this area chanting

           *shi tty tj/ound ’ .       I then stood in a queue of officers waiting to enter

           the piVch from a walkway in the South Stnd.                        I saw a crowd of

           officers around the            centre pen fencing           behind the Leppings Lane goal

           and I saw fans      climbing over the fence onto the pitch.                    I   can

           remember thinking that we were dealing with a pitch invasion,                            but

           then I saw fans on the pitch with the Police Of f i ce r s .                   These fans

                  were not being shepherded away as                 I would have expected with a pitch

                   invasion.       I then looked at the centre           pen and saw that   it was very

                  full.      The    people    inside were swaying forwards and I realised that

                  the officers were           in fact helping       people to get out of the pen.

                   I have been a season ticket holder at Hillsborough for many years and

                   I can remember        1ooking around the ground and thinking that            it looked

                  unrecognisable.            I had never before seen the ground anywhere near as

                  full.

                  As we got onto the pitch the match had already stopped and the players

                  had left.        I saw ty#o young boys being carried away towards the South

                  Stand,      they w e u n c o n s c i o u s   and their faces were ominously blue.          At

                  this poinl^/T realised that there was a danger to life within the

                  grounjJ*r      I thought to myself that those boys could easily have been

                  kjjfled,     I realise now that they were            probably already dead.

A*
         CM       terracing was opened and I followed Police Sergeant Whitlam into the

                   pen.

                   I made my way to the dividing fence with the centre                  pen where   I saw

                   people     climbing over to our side.             I helped two or three people over

                  and then I climbed onto a safety barrier and shouted to the fans in

                  the centre       pen to move back up the terracing.             Somebody who climbed

                  over the fence at the side of me shouted,                 "There's   people died in

                  there."       X took this to mean that there were some injured people at,
                    ' /
                  the/front of the           centre pen and I was shocked.

                     climbed over the fence and landed in the centre pen.                   I saw that

                  many      people were laid on the ground at the front of the pen.                 They

                  were motionless and their faces and limbs were blue.                    I can remember

              O fr* being   puzzled at first because young             looking people d o n ’t die in

            ()p/v large quantities all at once.

                legs were trapped in the pile and he wasn't-moving.                            I wondered why

                the people on the terracing w e r e n ’t doing anything to help him and as

                I got to him I realised that this was because he was dead.                            I

                straightened hi s head out and I felt for his pulse at his th r o a t .                             I

                opened his left eye and I saw that his pupi1 was dilated.                            He was

                about 30 years old and he had a m o u s t a c h e .           I was kneeling and I

                looked around,       there were dozens more          like him and I didn't know

                where to start.        The    crowd On the terracing behind me seemed to be

                just standi ng the r e .       I heard chants of       ’M U R D E R E R S ’.    I ignored

                them.    IjAheard someobOdy shouting,          "GET ME OUT",          I looked and saw a

                man witjf his left leg trapped in the pile of people.                          He was half way

                between me and the gate onto the            pitch.      I could reach his hand and I

                f/r fear of hurting          them.   He couldn ’t get free.             I looked down and

     AC*        saw that the ground between me and him was covered with tangled up

                bodies and I walked on them towards the man.                     I can remember thinking

                that my Doc Martens were soft and that I w o u l d n ’t cause any serious

                damage to the       limbs    I was treading    on.     I dug at the            pile around his

                leg with my hands and with his pulling we got it free.                           He too walked
            ^
                across the bodies towards me and back onto the terracing.

                I was then stood about four or five feet from the gate onto the

                pitch.     I saw     two officeres    leaning into the gateway trying                 to pull a

                body free.          Ican remember assessing my situation and thinking                       of

                Macbeth,   "Steeped in blood so far that to retrace my steps would be

                as far as to go o ’er."          I stayed where      I was and helped the two

                officers to free the body.            This we did and I remained there and helped

                to get several more out also.            One of the officers on the gate

                shouted that one of the people was still alive.                       He' w a s n ’t as blue as

                the others    and so we pulled and got him free.                  All the time I was

                frightened         of the crowd behind me     causing another           crush and     at this
                                                                                  PAGE

          point I carried the live person through the gates and out onto the

          pitch.    As I laid him down he started to choke and breathe.       I stuck

          my fingers   into his mouth and cleared his tongue away.      A WPG helped

          me   roll him onto his side.   He was    in his mid-twenties and had black

          short hair and wore a red jumper.       As we tended to him a plain

          clothes officer    came up to us and asked if the man was still alive.

          He told us to get him to the ambulances at the other end of the pitch.

          Other people nearby were carrying wooden boards and together,          we

          lifted the unconscious man onto a board and carried him to the other

          end of the pitch.    I shouted that we had a live casualty and he was

          immediately taken by the people around the ambulance.        I noticed that

          a lot of the other casualties who had been carried here were being

          le f t ,/presumably because they were dead.

          I Jmen made my way back towards the Leppings Lane end.        I assisted in

          tarrying more casualties to the Kop end.        I then joined the cordon of

          officers mid-way across the pitch.        I can remember being approached

          by several   groups of Liverpool   fans on the pitch who were asking        if

|?(TC ^   the game was to be abandoned.      They also asked me how they could

          obtain refunds on their tickets.        I couldn't think of a reply.

          After the announcement was made to abandon the game       I made my way

          towards the Leppings Lane end to try and find my serial Sergeant.                I

          saw a pile of property near to the centre gate of the pen.         I saw a

          youth picking   coins up from the ground.      I did not see him putting

          the money with the other   property.     I cannot say if he was   looting as

          I did not challenge him.

          Our serial   then moved out of the ground where we were stationed at

          the side of the temporary mortuary near to the river at the side of

          the South Stand.

          I then attended the de-briefing    in the North Stand and at 7.00 p.m.

        Serial 17, Leppings lane turnstiles 1 - 8 , Entrance 'A*             stand seating

        Serial sergeant: P.S. Whitlam



9:50 am:    attend briefing in North stand.

11:00 am:   Took up position at turstile 4, Leppings lane entrance to West       stand
            seating. At this time the turstiles were not open and the blue steel
            gates leading onto Leppings Astne were shut. As small numbers of spectators
            began to arrive the turnstiles opened and we opened the gates to the
            turnstiles. We were issued with black plastic dustbins for confiscated
            property. Spectators began arriving but during the first hour to 12 o'clock
            very few actually entered the ground, ^rom where I was standing I could
            see onto Leppings lane where several people were standing around. The
            number of people arriving st^ily increased until 2 o'c&ock at which time
            fans were regularly entering the turnstiles. At around 2:30 pm queues for
            the turnstiles had formed. The queues in the area in which I was standing
            reached about half-way back to the gates onto Leppings lane. I had
            confiscated many cans of soft drinks but no alcoholic drinks.
            However I had seen people throwing unopened cans of beer into the black
            bins at the turnstiles. I can remember a man walking up to the turnstile
            and throwing away two unopened cans of Newcastle Brown ale, He then walked
            back towards Leppings lane, and did not seem to be in any hurry to enter
            the ground. At the same time another man threw away a 1-J litre bottle of
            beer, he too walked away from the ground afterwards. I can remember seeing
            2 crates of Meineken beer stood on the ground at the comer of Lep ings
            lane.
            Up until this time, approximately 2:30 pm, the amount of people queuing to
            get into the ground was still sufficiently few for people to be able to walk
            up to me and ask directions to entrances etc.
            I cannot recall anybody approaching me who did not have a ticket. Fans
            s emed to be congregating outside the gates on Leppings lane.
            After 2:30 pm, within the space of a few minutes, I can remember suddenly
            getting busier searching people, the queue at my turnstile began' pushing
            and as I looked up I saw that the area within the gates was solid with people.
            It seemed as if a large number of people had materialised from nowhere.
The pushing at the turnstiles increased and I can recall people, particularly older
people or people with children complaining about the pushing.
Within a few more minutes all signs of queuing had disappeared. I was stood with my
back to the wall at the side of the turnstile and I had stopped searching people
because there was no room to do so.
Because of the pressure of the crowd people began jamming in the entrance to the
turnstile and as a result this slowed down the rate at which people could enter the
ground.
More and mor6 people began to complain about the crush and I noticed that the situation
was getting more serious than was normal for a football match.
I was not able to do anything in the position that I was in and the cfowd pressure was
increasing all the time. I decided to go to the point on Leppings lane where I had last
seen our serial sergeant and advise him of the situation at the turnstiles. Our serial
had not been issued with radios. I realised that if I were to stay where I was for any
longer this would become impossible so I forced my way through the cfowd. This was
very difficult even though people were trying to make way for me as they realised arhat
I was trying to do.
As I got to the gates a woman grabbed hold of my arm, she had injured her foot and she
was panicking and in tears, I could not get her through the crowd so I left her in a
triagular clearing made by the opened gates. I then made my way onto Lepnings lane.
I was in a crowd of people who were steadily pushing in the direction of 'he turnstiles.
I can remember looking back towards the turnstiles where I had been and seeing what aqiyayt
appeared to be just a crowd of people. I was worried because from this distance the
people approaching the ground would not see, or be aware of, the crushing at the front.
All the time people were pushing past me, adding to the crowd. I wanted to tell them
that they should hold back for a while and although some did, the majority did'Vt.
I then looked along Lepings lane and as far as I could see it was full of people
coming towards us.It looked like a battering ram.
As the crushing around the turstiles became more obvious, mounted officers came to the
point on Leppings lane where I was standing and began to form a cordon, presumably
to hold back thee crowd and so relieve the pressure on the turnstiles. I was stood
in a gap between two horses trying to prevent people from coming through.
I realised that 3 o'c^Jjbk was approaching because I was being asked if the kick-off
was going to be dlayed. I could not hold people back and I was being pushed off my feet.
I moved to the stadium side of one of the horses. I could see fans scaling the wall
at the turnstiles en masse. I cannot say how many youths got in this way, but in the
short time that I was watching possibly 20 or 30 managed to gain entry this way.
Many people were becoming abusive towards the mounted officers and I saw several
struggles as people fought to get past the horses to the ground. I noticed that the
majority of fans trying to get into fthe ground at this time were youths. When I had been
at the turnstiles earlier the majority of people entering had been older and batter
behaved.
After a few minutes I saw that the crowd at the turnstiles, both for the west stand
seating and for the terracing, had thinned out. I did not realise at the time, but this
was probably coincident with the gates being opened.
I then saw our serial sergeant, P.S. Whitlam, and almost straight away he told us of
a radio call requesting officers to enter the ground. I followed other officers
through the turnstiles and down the side of the Leppings terracing into the south
stand. At the entrance to the terracing at the corner with the south stand I saw an
injured girl being traated by officers. Although this afea '.as fuihl I cannot say
that it looked tightly packed. I heard fans in this area chanting "shitty gfcound"..
I then stood in a queue of officers waiting to enter the pitch from a walkway in
the south stand. I saw a crowd of officers arond the centre pen fencing behind the
Leppings lane goal and I saw fans climbing over the fence onto the pitch. I can
remember thinking that we were dealing with a pitch invasion, but then I saw fans
on the pitch with the police officers. These fans were not being shepherded away as I
would have expected with a pitch invasion. I then looked at the centre pen and saw
that it was very full. The people inside were swaying forwards and I realised that
the officers were in fact helping people to get out of the pen.
I have been a season ticket holder a& Hiilsboro for many years and I can remember
looking around the ground and thinking that it looked unrecognisable. I had never
before seen the ground anywhere near as full.
As we got onto the pitch the match had already stopped and the players had left.
I saw two young boys being carried away towards the south stand, they were unconscious
and thir faces wer«§ ominously blue. At this point I realised that there was a danger
to life within the ground. I thought to myself that those boys could easily have toeen
killed, I realise now that they were probably already dead.
The gate through the fencing into the south end of the Leppings terracing was opened
and I followed P.S. Whitlam into the pen.
I made my way to the dividing fence with the centre pen where I saw people climbing
over to our   side. I helped 2 or 3 people over   and then I climbed onto a safety
barrier and   shouted to the fans in the centre   pen to meve back up the terracing.
Somebody who climbed over the fence at the side of me shouted, "There's people died
in there”, I took this to mean that there werei some injured people at the front of
the centre pen and I wae shocked.
I climbed over the fence and landed in the centee pen. I saw that many people were
laid on the   ground at the front of the pen. They were motionless and their faces and
limbs were blue. I can remember being puzzled     at first because young-looking people
don't die in large quantities all at once.
                                                                            £    SU|X



I went to a man who was laid at the top of the pile.   His waist and legs were trapped
in the pile and he wasn't motoing. Iwondered why the   people on the terracing werent
doing anything to help him and as Igot to him I realised that this was because he
was dead. I straightened his head out and I felt for   his pulse at his throat. I
opened his left eye andI saw th t his pupil was dilated.    He was about 30 yrs old
and he had a moustache. I was kneeling and I looked around, there were dozens more
like him and I didnt know where to start. The crowd on the terracing behind me
seemed to be just standing there. I heard chants of "Murderers1', I ignored them.
I heard somebody shouting, "Get me out", I looked and saw a man with his left leg
trapped in the pile of people. He was halfway between me and the gate onto the pitch.
I could reach his hand and I pulled and pulled. I wouldnt normally pull somebodys
arm that hard for fear of hurting them. He couldnt get free. I looked doen and saw
that the ground between me and him was covered with tangled up Bodies and I walked
on them towards the man. I can remember thinking that my Doc Martens were soft and
that I wouldt cause any serious damage to the limbs I was   tEeading on. I dug at the
pile around his leg with my hands and with his pulling we got it free. He too walked
across the bodies towards me and back onto the terracing.
I wa= then stood about k or 5 feet from the gate onto the pitch. I saw 2 officers
leaning into the gateway trying to pull a body free. I can remember assessing my
situation and thinking of Macbeth,   "steeped in blood so far that to retrace my steps
would be as far as to go o'er". I stayed where I was and helped the 2 officers to
free the body. This we did and I remained there and helped to get several more out
also. One of the officers on ths gate shouted that one of the people was still alive.
He wasn't as blue as the others and so we pulled and got him free. All the time I
was frightened of the crowd behind me causing another crush and at this ^oint I
carried the live person through the gates and out onto the pitch. As I laid him
down he started to choke and breathe. I stuck my fingers into his mouth and cleared
his tongue away. A wpc helped me roll him onto his side. He was in his mid-twenties
and had black short hair and wore a red jumper. As we tended to him a plain-clothes
officer came up to us and asked if the man was still alive. tie told us to get him to
the ambulances at th   other end of the pitch.
Other people nearby were carrying wooden boardssand together we lifted the unconscious
man onto a board and carried him to the other aid of the pitch. I shouted that we had
a live casualty and he was immediately taken b£ the people around the ambulance. I
noticed that a lot of the other casualties who had been carried here were being left,
presumably because they were dead.
 I then made my way back towards the Leppings lane and. I assisted in carrying more
casualties to the kop aid. I then joined the cordon of officers mid-way across the
pitch. I can remember being approached by several groups of Liverpool fans on the
pitch who were asking if th:gaine was to be abandoned. They also asked me how they
could obtain refunds on their tickets. I couldnt think of a reply.
After the announcemait was made to abandon the game I made my way towards the lep
to try and find my serial sergeant. I saw a pile of property near to the centre gate
of the pai. I saw a youth picking coins up from the ground. I did not see him putting
the money with the other property. I cannot say if he was looting as I did not challenge h
Kim.
Our serial thai moved out of the ground where we were stationed at the side of the
temporary mortuary near to the river at the side of the south stand.
I thai attaided the de-briefing in the north stand and at £ 7*00 pm wait off duty.

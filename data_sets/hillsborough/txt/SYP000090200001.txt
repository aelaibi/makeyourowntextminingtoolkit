his    condition.            I do not     consider that this            patients          condition at that

time was       likely to result            in death occurring.                   Again    I cannot      recall

an y d escriptive            details     of this      patient.

The    only d escriptive            details     I can provide of these                   two    casualties        is

to say they were              both white males,          I cannot estimate                their ages.

same    day.         Bot h   patients were taken from us by the A c ^ i 4 ® n t and

On a r r i v i n g    back at t h ^ g r o u n d     the Police      d i r ected us to the end of

the gr oun d where            the gym n a s i u m   is situated.            We    reversed our vehicle

back    into a line of other a m b u l a n c e s             parked near to the entrance                    to

the gymnasium.               Ha v i n g done   this we were        t old to stan d b y for further

o rde r s .

We were       not given a n y formal            briefing      however by this time we were

aware     that we were           involved      in a major       incident and both myself and

               were aware from t e l e v i s i o n         coverage that we had seen earlier

that day at W o r k s o p Amb u l a n c e S t a t i o n of the nature of the                       incident.

The vehicle we were using was e q u i p p e d w i t h all                         s t a ndard equi pment          for

Ac c i d e n t and E m e r g e n c y    purposes,     this    equipment           includes a rescue           case

contai nin g         bolt    croppers a nd other         tools.        The only e q uipment we were

re qu es te d to provide was b ody bags.

We we re      not s u b jected to a n y forms            of threats or violence,                   we were        not

obstructed           in a n y way.

Ha v i n g a r r i v e d at the stad i u m for the sec o n d time at                      16.31    hours

<1631)     an d having been on stan d b y               in the a r e a of the entrance                 to the

re qu es te d our assis t a n c e w i t h           removing some       casualties.              I n i ti ally I
                                                                                                         PAGE
                                                                                                         S3 446

  th oug ht we were                required to t r a nsport either             dead or injured        persons

  to Hospital.

  At a time          I can only estimate                  to be about       16.50 hours     (1650)   this

  police man             I think he was an officer as oppo s e d to a constable                          took

  my self a        n      d   p    v    e    r   to a police vehicle w h i c h was            parked inside

  the ground about                  100 yards          awa y from the entrance       to the gymnasium.

  I think the Police                    vehicle        in q u e s t i o n ma y have been ^ / ^ s n d Rover   I

  can't        remember what                colour     it was.

  In the        rear of this Police                    vehicle    there were thj^ bodies of three

j d e c ea se d    persons.

  The    p o li ce mman a s k e d for our a s s i s t a n c e               taking    these    three bodies

  into the g y m n a s i u m w h i c h was being ussn as a tem p o r a r y mortuary.
                                             rYM    ArT
  We    carried one of these bodies on / s t retcher wryto the gymnasium,                                    at

  this time there were a number                           a y bodies    laid on the floor        in the

  gymnasium,             we   laid the body ojn the floor                in the nearest av a i l a b l e

  space to the entrance                       doors.

  I cannot         remember m u c h about               this     body all   I can say is that        it was a

  male,        I can't be sure what                  colour or age.,          I cannot    recall what

  clothing         the body had on.

  Ha v i n g    laid the body down in the g y m n a s i u m we saw a S o u t h Y o rkshire

  A m b u l a n c e Of ficer who told us to return to our vehicle and await

  further         instructions.

  I cannot         say who          removed the other two bodies                from the      rear of the

  police vehicle                  I cannot describe            eithar of the other two bodies.

  We had no further                    dealings wit h D e c e a s e d or Injured persons.

  We were         cleared from the footballr stad i u m at                     17.19 hours      <1719)    by a

  S o u t h Y o r kshire A m b u l a n c e Offi c e r an d           returned to W o r k s o p Amb u l a n c e

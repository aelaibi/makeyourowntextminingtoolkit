                  On Saturday 15th April                   1989 (150489),        I travelled with a number of my

                  friends to Hillsborough in Sheffield to watch the cup semi final

                  between Liverpool and Nottingham ForesS\                           When we arrived in Sheffield,

                  we went to Penistone for a drink,                       s p y i n g about 1 h o u r .   We all

                  travel led to near the ground to find another                          p u b , but they were all

                  shut.       This must have been about                 1.30 (1330).        We went to the chip

                  shop had something to eat, about 2 oclock                          (1400) we split up to get

                  into the gro un d.         Some were standing                 I went and sat in 'tiv a Nor th Stand

                  near the Leppings Ln end 2 rows back and the second seat                                 in.

                  Upto the point when the players                     came out to start the match everything

                  seemed okay at the ground but, when they came out I remember a lad I

                  know                           he came walking around the track, and sat next to

                  me, he told me he had climbed out the pens because they were full.                                         As
                                                                                                     PAGE
                                                                                                     S3436

                     the match started playing more fans came over the fencing standing

                     behind the Liverpool g o a l .

                     Then fans and the copper came onto the pitch, and the match stopped

                     shortly after this-          I could see that there was injured people on the

                     pitch.    So I got onto the pitch with                   to see if I could help.

                     In the goal area I remember a lad on the pitch his mates were trying

                     to help him,     so I fetched a half caste copper to come and help him,

                     and he started to give this         lad the kiss of life.

                     I then helped carry two lads across to the halfway line,                not on a

                     stretcher,   both appeared seriously injured but were still              breathing.

                     I returned to the goal area, and there were some Liverpool                fans with

                     an advertising hoarding,         they were   putting this fan onto the hoarding,

                     so I gave them a hand to carry him across the pitch.                 I think,   this

                     was after the goal net had been taken down, and the fans had run up

                     the pitch.

                     As well as I can remember a          white male, mid 20 ’s , S ’S medium to      stocky

                     build,   he d i d n ’t have a moustache or          beard, no glasses no hat on, he

          S66N       was fully clothed.       I think     he had a bomber type jacket on, his         face
V7#^0                wasn't   covered.    I think he      was dead,      as we carried him he went
'J tN ftfcS 'J fc-
fo      «I>          through a line of coppers on the half way line.

                     There were fans only carrying the hoarding at this point.                 When we

                     reached the other end, we went into a bit of a queue to leave the

                     pitch, we went up the ramp but the area was full of ambulances so we

                     went   round to a side door, which was big enough to pass the hoarding

                     through so we 1 ifted it up. J l remember that the re was a copper at the

                     front of the hoarding n o w , we took the man into the main part of gym,

                     and left him there,      returning to the pitch.           I had a drink on the

                     pitch and trie-a to contact h o m e .

                     Then when they asked on the tannoy I left the ground.                 I had met my

                     brother and mates on the pitch, and eventually we got back to the car

         and travelled home.

          I think this w ou l d n ’t have happened if we had tha big stand.                                                             Also    I

         stood in the middle of the pitch and infront of the Liverpool                                                                  fans,

           HILLSBOROUGH - CRUSH BARRIERS

           I am receiving a number of requests from parties to the civil proceedings
           for samples of the barrier in order to carry out their own tests over and
           above what has been undertaken by the Health and Safety Executive in
           Sheffield.

           As you know the barrier ultimately is the property of Sheffield Wednesday
           Football Club and whatever happens to it after we have finished with its
           use must be in consultation and agreement with them. The Club's
           solicitors, Davies Arnold Cooper, have already written to me declaring
           their ownership and requesting access to it.

            At the present time I am declining such requests until

                         1.      The Forensic Science Service has had the opportunity to look at
                                 the barrier and examine the Health and Safety Executive's
                                 findings in their two reports, the second one at present being in
                                 final draft form.

                         2.      I have a undertaking in writing from Dr Nicholson of the Health
                                 and Safety Executive that he has no further tests to undertake to
                                 the barrier.

                         3.       I have obtained the Director of Public Prosecutions' approval to
                                  release the barrier.

                         A.       I have similar approval from Lord Justice Taylor.

                         5.       Approval from H.M. Coroner.




    PLEASE REPLY T O T H E O FFICE A T                                 Birmingham
                                     2




Once I have that undertaking from the Forensic Science   Service and Dr
Nicholson then I will write to the parties at 3, A and   5, seeking their
respective formal approval to release. The purpose of    this letter,
therefore, is to give preliminary warning of what I am   doing.

Once release has been approved by all the parties concerned then I will
write to Davies Arnold Cooper and other solicitors representing the parties
to the civil proceedings advising them that the barrier is now available so
they can workout amongst themselves and with the owners how they would like to
proceed with any tests. This will be important because the tests may lead
to the destruction of the material and therefore could cause complications
later where perhaps like has not been compared with like.

          Dear Dr Nicholson

          HILLSROROUGH INQUIRY

          I refer to your .letter’ of’ P .i O c t o b e r ’ and our recent telephone
          conversations.  The purpose of this letter is to confirm the agreement we
          made over the telephone.    We discussed the following points:-

                    1.       I have noted the report,s etc, you prepared for Lord .Justice
                             Taylor.  No doubt Mr Whalley will find that information most
                             helpful.

                    2.       1 also note that, you are about; to prepare a second report which
                             is at present in final draft.     1 would like a copy and I. would
                             seek your approval, subject to Lord .Justice Taylor' agreeing, to
                             be able to submit that report to the Director of Public
                             Prosecutions for his information.     1 would also seek approval
                              from Lord .Justice Taylor for’ the Forensic Science Service to
                             examine the barrier, to read your initial report and second report,
                              presently in draft.

                    3.       1 have noted the view from Health and Safety Executive Management
                              so far as your further involvement is concerned.   As we discussed
                              on the telephone today, the Director of Public Prosecutions is
                              attempting to involve the Forensic Science Service which may mean
                              there will be no need for any further U.S.Is. involvement, other
                              than perhaps the giving of evidence on findings you Jiave already
                              made.

                                                                                                              Cont...

     h   .   1 noted the copy of’ the Chief’ Constables' Working Party on
             Hooliganism at Sporting Events and their invitation to you to
             contribute.  I have no objection in principle to you discussing
             the process you adopted, hut. T would like you to tread warily
             where you could supply information which could be material to
             any criminal proceedings.   Having said that you may well be able
             to get round that difficulty by concentrating on the processes
             rather than the findings.

     5.      A prime purpose of this letter is to address the issue of the
             barrier 12Aa and whether you have any further use for it.      As you
             know we have received a number of requests for samples of the
             barrier from solicitors representing civil litigants.     What I
             need to establish from you, in writing, is whether’ in fact you
             have completed your’ tests on the barrier, that you are satisfied
             wit.ii the results and that yon have no further use for the
             barrier’. At this time f am not interested in any other’ barrier’s
             you possess or any tests that you may undertake upon them.      Once
             I have a letter from you indicating that you have no further
             interest in the barrier’ 1 will write formally to Lord Justice
             Taylor’, 11.M. Coroner and the LU rector of Public Prosecutions
             advising them accordingly.    T wilt seek .from them .letters
             indicating that they have no further .interest in the barrier.
             Once I am in possession of all those letters then I will advise
             the Director of Public Prosecutions who will progress the matter’
             with solicitor’s represent! ng the owners, Sheffield Wednesday
             Football Club and the other civil litigants.

     6.      As you know the pre-trial hearing took place this morning before
             Lord Justice Rose.    It may well be that as a result of what the
             Judge has said and in the light of a let,ter’ written by the
             Director of Public Prosecutions that attempts will be made to
             secure samples of the barrier in the very near future. (A copy of
             the Director of Public Prosecutions' letter which they may quote
             is attached for your’ informat.ion) I have since discussed this
             letter with the Director of Public Prosecutions' representative,
             Mr' Kennedy, and tie agrees that we must complete the procedures
             identified at (5) above before anything is released.    If you
             should have any undue pressure from any of the parties requesting
             samples, please decline their requests and refer them to me.

I look forward to hearing from you in due course.

Yours sincerely
J M ERVYN JONES M Sc                                             F U R N IV A L HOUSE

           Dear Sirs

           HILLSBOROUGH - CRUSH BARRIERS

           T roPer t,o your 1eh Lor of PO October and my repl y of ? 3 in respect of
           Mil tsborough and your request for samples of the barrier1 124a.

           Since my writing to you there have been further developments and 1 have now
           received an undertaking from the Director of Public Prosecutions that he
           has no objection to the release of the barrier and for1 samples to be made
           available to interested parties Cor further tests subject to three
           conditions which he lays down.  I understand that lie has written a letter
           to you stating what these conditions are.

           However, you will appreciate that the Director of Public Prosecutions is
           not the only one who has an interest in the barrier.    Lord Justice Taylor,
           on whose behaLf I originally seized the barrier, has an interest, as does
           II.M. Coroner'1 at Sheffield. 1 have also received a Letter from Davies
           Arnold Cooper, who as you know represent Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
           and who also want; access to the barrier and who make it quite clear in
           their letter that their clients are ultimately the owners of the property.
           Because of these various interest,s the purpose of this letter’ is to inform
           you how I intend to proceed.

           The situation at present is that the Director of Public Prosecutions does
           not see any further need to retain the barrier subject to receiving
           assurances from the Health and Safety Executive, in writing, that they
           have no further use for the barrier and that the Director of Public
           Prosecutions has the opportunity of having a representat. ive present at the
           time of future tests, that the opportunity will exist to take photographs
           and all reports and data are made available to the Director1 of Public
            Prosecutions/Crown Prosecution Service.


                                                 Bi rrni ngham                        Co nt ,.
     PLEASE REPLY T O T H E O FFICE A T
However, an you know the interest in the barrier is not restricted to the
Director of Public Prosecutions, or myself on his behalf.   I.ord Justice
Taylor' has an interest and once I have received the letter from Dr
Nicholson at the Health and Safety Executive declaring they no longer
have interest then I wilL write to him to seek his approval.    Furthermore,
II.M. Coroner at Sheffield will also want to give similar approval once Dr
Nicholson has issued his letter1.

All this might, seem a little bit bureaucratic but given that the barrier
could be an important part of any subsequent proceedings then 1 wish to be
assured that all parties 1 relate to have had every opportunity to examine
and carry out tests.    Having said that,, 1 do hope that it will not be long
before 1 can re .lease the barrier and certainly in plenty of time for you
to carry out what work you wish in good time for the commencement of the
civil case.

I have received a letter from Hammond Suddards, who as you know represent
South Yorkshire Police, who have also requested access to the barrier for
the purposes of securing samples.    They have also written to the Director
of Public Prosecutions seeking his permission for such samples.     It occurs
to me that Hammond Suddards may not be the only parties who wish to take
samples of this barrier’ and carry out, further tests.   Consequently, I have
agreed with the representative of the Director of Public Prosecutions'
office that once I have all the assurances that we no longer’ need the
barrier’ then he, Mr’ Kennedy, will undertake to contact, you and the other
representatives of the parties involved in order to discuss the best way
forward.   Sheffield Wednesday Football Club who are ultimately the
'owner’s' of the barrier, no doubt, will wish to have their say in respect:,
of the way forward.

I trust, this letter is of assistance to you.  Please rest assured that I
will not delay the release of the barrier wit,bout good cause.

            Dear Mr Doyle

            HILLSBOROUGH - CRUSH BARRIERS

            I refer to your letter of 18 October 1989 on this subject directed to me at
            Furnival House, Sheffield.   Unfortunately, we vacated Furnival House in July
            and, whilst, we did have a mail re-direction from that address, I do not,
            seem to have received your Letter.    [ncidenta IJ y , to further comp] i.cate the
            position, given we are now responsible for the criminal investigation,
            Furnival House will re-open on Friday, 27 October.       Fortunately, a copy of
            your letter catne to me via Mr WhalJey who had copied it to me, together
            with a copy of your Letter concerninp; the drawings prepared by Brade &
            Partners.   Regrettably, the letter did not arrive in time for me to respond
            to you before the commencement of today's preliminary pre-tria] hearing,
            although I had tried to telephone first thing this morning.

            I have noted the contents of your let,ter and in particular your concern
            about barrier 124a and access to it.   The situation at present is that the
            Director of Public Prosecutions floes not see any further need to retain the
            barrier subject to receiving assurances from the Health and Safety
            Executive, in writing, that they have no further use for the barrier
            and that the Director of’ Public Prosecutions has the opportunity of
            having a representative present, at the Lime of future tests, that the
            opportunity will exist to take photographs and all reports and data are
            made available, to the Director of Public Prosecutions/Crown Prosecution
            Service.

            However, as you know the interest in the barrier is not restricted to the
            Director of Public Prosecutions, or myself on his behalf.   Lord Justice
            Taylor has an interest and once I have received the letter from Dr
            Nicholson at the Ilealth and Safety Executive declaring they no longer




                                                                                          Cont. ...
     P L E A S E R E PL Y T O T H E O F F IC E A T        B i rtn i righarn
have interest then 1 will write to him to seek his approval.  Furthermore,
H.M. Coroner at Sheffield will also want to give similar approval once Dr
Nicholson ha S iS o ued his letter1.

All this might, seem a little b it, bureaucrat ic but given that the barrier
could be an important part of any subsequent proceedings then 1 wish to be
assured that all parties 1 relate to have had every opportunity to examine
and carry out tests,   (laving said that, 1 do hope that it will not be long
before I can release the barrier and certainly in plenty of time for you
to carry out what work you wish in good time for the commencement of the
civil case.

1 have received a let,ter from Hammond Suddards, who as you know represent
South Yorkshire Police, who have also requested access to ttie barrier’ for
the purposes of securing samples.    They have also written to the Director
of Public Prosecutions seeking his permission for such samples.     It occurs
to me I,hot Hammond Suddards may not, he the only parties who wish to take
samples of this barrier and carry out further tests.    Consequently, I have
agreed with the representative of the Director1 of Public Prosecutions'
office that, once I have all the assurances that we no longer need the
barrier then he, Mr’ Kennedy, will undertake to contact you and the other
representatives of the parties involved in order’ to discuss the best way
forward.   Sheffield Wednesday Football Club who are ultimately the
'owners' of the harrier, no doubt, will wist) to have their say in respect,
of the way forward.

I trust this letter is of assistance to you.  Please rest assured that 1
will not delay the release of the barrier without good cause.

           I I I LLSBOROUGH DISASTER

           The purpose of this letter is to follow up a call made by my Detective
           Chief Superintendent Foster to you today to seek some involvement of the
           Forensic Science Service in our’ Investigation into the tragic events at
           Hillsborough in April of this year.   1 understand from Mr Foster you are
           willing to assist and that you will be inviting a member of your staff,
           Mr P. B. Wilson, to undertake the work.

           As I see it at present, we would like Mr Wilson to view the broken barrier,
           identified as '124a', and to review the tests and results made by Dr
           Nicholson and his Health and Safety Executive staff.  We would be seeking
           an early indication from Mr Wilson whether he was satisfied with the
           tests/results and whether in his professional opinion more research needs
           to be done on the barrier.  If more work needs to be undertaken then we
           would negotiate that with you.

           I am also aware that parties involved in civil proceedings arising out of
           Hillsborough have an Interest in testing the barrier.  The Director of
           Public Prosecutions has agreed in principle to releasing the barrier for
           tests subject to three conditions.  These are:-

                                (1)    samples/tests are in the presence of a representative
                                       nominated by the Crown Prosecution Service.




    P L E A S E R E P L Y T O T H E O F F IC E A T        Binningham
        (ii)   photographs are to bn taken whenever samples are
               obtained and copies provided to the Crown Prosecution
               Servi c e .

       (iii)   all reports/data are provided promptly to the
               Crown Prosecution Service.


Whether the Director of Public Prosecutions will ask the Forensic Science
Service to undertake the representative role I am unsure but there could be
that possibility.  Tf‘ so I would hope that the role does not become too
onerous for any of us.

To assist Mr' Wilson's deliberations 1 enclose a copy of Dr’ Nicholson's
initial report, to Lord Justice Taylor.  It was presented at the hear!ngs
and therefore is in the public domain.

1 would hope to meet with Mr Wilson in the near future and introduce him to
Dr Nicholson.  I would also make myself available to show Mr Wilson the
football ground if he wishes and to answer’ any questions about our
investigation and findings to date.  I understand that you have permitted
us to make our arrangements direct with Mr Wilson.

In closing may I take this opportunity to thank you for affording us the
assistance of the Forensic Science Service in this sensitive enquiry.

serial       36.         On arr iv al             of     the      tra in,      which          consisted          only       of    the      ONE

train and which                   I understood                 was     to     have       on    board 530          supporters,

came    as a s u r p r i s e            as       only       one     train arrived               and       in total          I would

estimate          about        200      supporters                in all       were       on board.

These       supporters             appeared              to    be    in g o o d       humour         and    very       friendly,

none    appeared             to    have          been       drinking          and     they      consisted             of    '’f a m i l y 1'

type    supporters.

Prior       to    the a r r i v a l          of       the     train       several         hundreds          of    supporters,                all

of w h o m       1 believe             to    be L i v e r p o o l         supporters,             were      making          t h eir     way

along       Halifax          R o ad,        past       the     railway         station and                down    towards           the

football          ground.              Many       of     these       supporters               were    seen       to    be    carrying

not    only       six-packs             of       b eer      and     lager,         but    12 p a c k s      EACH.           T h e y were

also    seen       drinking             beer/lager                from       large       two    litre       plastic          bottles

and    they a p p e a r e d            to    be       in a j o v i a l ,       happy          mood,       some    being          r ath e r

boisterous.               My at te nt io n               was      drawn       to a g r o u p         of    six    to       eight      male

supporters           across            the       opposite           s i de    from       the W a d s l e y       railway

station.           One       of    t h es e       youths          aged       about       16 to       17 y e a r s ,        was    totally

drunk       and     I,    in      company             with Police             Constable           1 429 B a s h f o r t h ,         crossed

the    road a n d         spoke         to       the     unknown youth.                   He w a s        very    uns teady and

worse       the w e a r        for      drink.              He w as       sitting         on a sm all            w a ll     and

appeared          unable          to    stand          unaided.              Police       Constable             Bashforth           spoke

to    the    older        member            of    the       group and          told       him     that      the       younger         man

would       not    be     let      in the             ground        in t hat        sta t e .        The    older          m a n was

reasonable           and       understanding                   and     s aid       he w o u l d      arrange          someone         to

stay wih          the     younger            man.           They     then      continued             on    their       way,

assisting           the      young          m a n alo n g .          He      was    not       arrested,          firstly          because

his    friends           were      helping             hi m a l o n g        and    secondly,             due    to    the a m o u n t

of    passing        supporters                  in    comparison             to P o l i c e      presence,            to    do     so m a y

have    resulted             in P o l i c e           i n j uries.

The    day       its e l f     was      very          hot a n d      1 was         approached             many    times          whilst        in
                                                                                                                                  PAGE
                                                                                                                                  R361

the    location       of       the W a d s 1ey          railway          bridge/station,                  asking            which

public    houses          were       open.           Although          public       houses           were      in that

immediate       area,          many       had    their        doors         and    windows           boarded         up.          I was

unable    to a s s i s t        in t h e s e         e n q u i r i e s / firstly           because           X do       not       know

the    area and       secondly,             it a p p e a r e d         t hat      they     had       drunk      enough alcohol

without       going       in s e a r c h        of a n y m o r e .

I would       estimate          t hat      we    had     b e e n at         the    railway           station           for    three

hours    when       the     train arrived.                    As    previously             sta t e d ,       these          supporters

were    good    natured           a n d w ell           behaved          and made          t h eir w a y u n d e r P o l i c e

escort    to    the       ground.           For         some       unknown          reason          to m y s e l f ,      the seri al

I formed       part       of a l s o       escorted           the      supporters              from     the     train         down          to

the    football       ground,             arriving          on     the      front     of L e p p i n g s        Lane.

I would       estimate          that       the       time     was      j us t     g one    2.00        p.m.     that         da y a n d

Leppings       Lane       was     very      busy w i t h           supporters             on    foot.          I was         under          the

impression          t hat      very       few supporters                 made      any     positive            attempt            to

enter    the    ground and                several        unknown            (to ms)        senior         officers            (i.e.

Inspector       level)          came       to me a n d           other       officers           shouting            for      us    to       get

the    supporters           into      the       ground.            In our         small        group      of    officers               it

was    almost       impossible             to    get     the       crowd        to m o v e      to     the     turnstiles.

The    crowd w o u l d         not    form any           orderly            queues        and       pushed      constantly

against       each    oth e r .           Several        supporters               went     up o n t o        the       grass

banking       owned       by    the       tyre       fitting        company          directly            opposite            to    the

Leppings       Lane       entrance.              Officers           were        unable         to    get, t h e s e         supporters

back    onto    the       roadway.              This     group         of    p r o b a b l y 40        to 5 0       supporters

were    drinking          heavily,          supping           from       large       plastic            two l i tre

cannisters          and     tin      cans       of    b eer      and     lager       etc.

I,    along    with what             appeared           only a few P olice                     O f f i c ers,       made      hopeless

attempts       to    get       the    supporters              into       the      gro u n d .        It was,           as    I at       the

time    described,             ’L I K E    STIRRING           PORRIDGE’.              Everyone            went         wherever

into      a    certain          area       within          the       ground          but     unfortunately,                I know

nowhere         either          inside          or      outside           the    ground.              I personally            felt        that

local         knowledge          officers               should        have       been        situated           where      I was         in

more      strength          to a n s w e r           these       questions.                  F u r t h e r m o r e , the      coloured

tickets         did    not       help         as     I w a s unable              to     see      the     col o u r    coded         boards

on the         turnstile             entranceways.                    I feel          that       they     should        h ave       been

s i t u a t e d w ell       above          head         hei g h t ,       so    t hat      supporters            to   the     rear        of

to    get      into.        What        was        in fact           happening,              was      t hat     supporters           were

choosing         what       they        thought            was       a queue,           although          it was        basically

poorly        organised.                1 f elt           that       officers           should         h a ve    b e e n at       the

turnstile            entrancsways                  in m o r e        strength and                caused         the   crowd         to    f orm

queues        PRIOR        to    getting             near       to    the       turnstiles.               No     senior       officers

at    this      stage       appeared               to     be    in    command           of      the    situation           and what            was

happening            was    several             officers             of    Inspector             level        pushed       amongst            the

crowd         shouting          at    officers             to m o v e          the    supporters              first     this way              then

t h at    way.        I feel          t hat        no     one    knew          what     was      actually         taking          place.

At    a r o u n d S . 45        p.m.       the       crowding             b e came      intense          and     shouMerlo

shoulder         pushing             and      heaving           was       taking        place.           Still,       no     one

appeared         to    know where                  they were              heading          for     and    little,          if a n y

instructions               were       coming            from     senior          officers.               I saw at          t hi s    stage

supporters            with       young          children             a g e d appro;<imate 1 y                 10 y e a r s    old,        now

walking         away       from       the       cr owds         and       one    man       commented            to me      that      it was

'BLOODY D I S G U S T I N G ’ and                    he    said       that       the       organisation'was                  pathetic.

The      crowding          was       very       tight          and    it was          becoming           difficult           to     raise       my

arms      from my          sid e s .          To     be    closely             compact          was    becoming         c 1ostr oph ob ic

and      because       we       were       so      close,        the       smell        of      stale     ’ale*       on     the     breath

of    the      supporters             was       s trong.         I had w i t h             me    my    personal         r a dio      but

very      little       i n s t r u c t i o n was               coming          from     the      con t r o l     room wit hin             the

to    have       'the     gate'         opened.            By    now       supporters               were        climbing          over       the

entrance          w all      and      I saw an            officer          trying          to       prevent        this       happening.

The    Mounted          Officers              at    this    location were                      so    tightly          packed         that

they were          virtually               useless,         not       being          able       to move .             (Inspector

Ellis       on    car     spoke         to     crowd       on t a n n o y ) .             A short          while        l a ter      I heard

a    call    o v er     the        r a di o    for    all       available             officers             to     enter       the     gr ound,

but    nothing          followed              to    say    or    clarify             for w h a t          rea son.         I assumed

that    a    pitch          invasion           had    occurred             and       I,    with       other        officers            f ro m

serials          36 a n d     37,       attempted           to       enter       the       ground          by the        left        entrance

concertina             gates.           I was        the    last          Police          Officer          to     enter       the      ground

in    company with Police                          Constable          1 H66 A d s h e a d .               1 began        to f o l l o w         the

other       officers          when         I heard a            call       from       b e h i n d me.             It w a s      the

g a t e m a n at       the    location              and    he w a s        unable          to       clos e      the     g ate     after         us

due    to    the       crowd         pushing         the    gates          open.           I returned with                    Police

Constable             Adshead         and      forcibly          pushed          outside             the     ground        the       invading

supporters             and     by     brute         strength,             pulled          the       concertina           gates

together.              In fact,            the      g a t em a n was           unable          to    efficiently              carry        out

his    duties          and     did      not        appear       to    be       physically             strong          enough,          without

regard       to m e n t a l l y         strong         eno u g h ,        to    say       "NO"       to    the     supporters              who

were     trying          to    enter          by force.              1,    with Police                Constable            Adshead,

then made             an a t t e m p t        to    catch       up w i t h       se r i a l         36/37       but     due     to     the

crowd       in si d e       the      ground,         got     o n l y as         far       as    the       rear     of     the     side

ter r a c e s / s e a t i n g        area      (left       side).              One    man with             his     young        boy

shouted          to    us     to     get      in the       ground          and       help       out.         He    was     very annoy ed

as well          as    emotional,              but     I did         not       reply.           We     cou l d     not     get       any

further          into       the      ground and            eventually,                Police          Constable            Adshead           and

myself       returned              outside          the    ground          to    the       front,          right        side      of

Leppings           Lane.             (Our      b a cks     were       n e ar     to       the       bridge        and     ri ver).           1

was     still         not     aware        of w h a t      h ad a c t u a l l y           taken        place       and many            peop le
were    emerging            from         the    gro u n d ,      being      male       and    female         alike.            They

were    crying         and      annoyed           as    well        as    bitter       towards        the      Police,

Fr us tr at io n was            shown          by the         supporters          and a bitterness                   towards          the

Police.          Several            of    these         supporters          were       coughing          and    choking             and

very    upset.            Some       came       out w i t h o u t         shoes    on t h e i r       feet      and       s ome      had

no    shirts       on.         I heard a            radi o       request         for    several amb ula nces                    to

a t t e n d at     the L e p p i n g s          Lane      en d      of    the    ground and           for      the a t t e n d a n c e

of    the    Fire      Service            with      cutting          equipment.              My    impression             when       the

Fire    Bervi.ce w e r e             called        u p o n was           that    due    to    the     compactness               of    the

crowd       people        had       started        to     dehydrate?             although          I was       unable          to

understand           as     to w h y       cutting            equipment, was            re q u i r e d .

Many    supporters              who       got     out     of     the      ground       said       it w a s     terrifying

ins i d e    and     that       several           had     been       injured.           The       fleet      of a m b u l a n c e s

arrived       almost           at    the       s am e    time       as    did    the    f ir e     tenders.           A senior

fire    officer           approached              me     to    establish          what       was    happening             and where

did    the    Police           require          them      to a t t e n d .        I was       unable         to a s s i s t         and

directed         him      to an          Inspector            standing          nearby.           This     confusion went

on    for    s ome     time         u n t il    I made         my w a y     down       the    right        s ide     of    the       ground

to    the    gates        where          the    injured were               taken       from.        I was       then       shocked

to    see a n d      count          10 b o d i e s       lying       on    the    gro u n d ,      some      tendered           to    by

Police       Officers           and       others         overseen          by St.       John's        first        aiders.            No

screens       were        at    t hi s     time         around       the    bo d i e s ,     and     it w a s      obvious           that

they were          in fact           dead.          I re call            speaking       to P o l i c e       Constable              Lipski

and    saying        that       I had          counted         10 d e a d at       the       top     side      and    he       said

that    it was         rumoured            that         about       60 w e r e    feared          d e a d at    this       time.           I

^itayed      near      to      the       10 d e a d      bod i e s ,      forming       a human          chain       to    protect

the    bodies        from       the       supporters             leaving         the    groun d.           Several         male

Other       comments          were,       'YOUR'VE KILL ED                        'EM Y O U B A S T A R D S . '            I was          kicked

on the         right      knee      with       one       y o u t h who            was     fighting          man a and another

as    to w h a t       had    occurred             or    gone       wrong.              In a n a t t e m p t         to    c l ear        the

pushing         cro w d s     who       insisted           in      leaving           by      the    only       g ate      available             for

use      by the        emergency          services,                I, w i t h        another            group       of    officers,

none      f r o m my      serial,         went          just       inside          the       o u ter     gate       led    by a n o t h e r

middle         aged     sergeant,             whom       I do       not       know.           We    tried       to       form a       line        to

get      the    c r owd      to    cl ear      the       area       to       leave        r oom     for     the      emergency

services,            but we        were       met       by a b u s e         and     offers         of    violence             whenever           we

tried       to m o v e       them       on.        We    tried          to    be     diplomatic             and      caring         when

moving         the     crowd       on    but       they       had       become          hostile          towards          us.       However,

TWO      supporters           were       excellent,                one       was     aged about             55 y e a r s        and       he

appealed          to    the       crowd       to    leave          quickly           to a l l o w        the    emergency

services          access,,          Another             young       man aged              about, 25 y e a r s ,            was      also

excellent            and appeale d             to       the     crowd         in a s i m i l a r          manner.              This       young

m a n was       attacked           by a n o t h e r        man and            I intervened                to    stop       the

attacker.              In fact,          the       crowd were                now     taking         more       notice          of    the       two

supporters             than       the    Police          and       as    such,          we    left       it to t h e m          to a p p e a l

to the         crowd.         I later          s p oke        to    the       younger             man and       thanked             him    tor

his      assistance           although             he    had       received abuse                   and     violence            towards

him.        I di d      not       obtain       his       personal             details             but    b e l i e v e .h e - a s s i s t e d

well      in m o v i n g      on    the       crowd.            It was            in fact,          on s p e a k i n g         to    this

young       man      that     I was       for       the       first,         time       made       aware       of    what, h ad           gone

wrong.          <He     had       been    in the           ground            and     had m a n a g e d         to    escape).

As    the      crowd      dispersed            more        thinly            we     returned            outside          the    gate       u sed

by the         emergency           services             and     I saw Police                   Transit         v ans      being       used        to

convey         the     dead       bodies       from        outside            the       g round.

from    the       ground.           Many    of     the    supporters          were       dishevelled and                clearly-

STATEMENT OF POLICE CONSTABLE 2929 KEVIN LAURENCE BENNETT. Rotherham C.1.        MS* group.


I am a Police Constable in the South Yorkshire Police presently stationed at ^otherham.
At 9*OOam onSaturday 15th April 1989 I was on weekly leave duty but due to the
football match duties with LIVERPOOL V       NOTTINGHAM FOREST semi«-final game at
HILLSBOROUGH, I attended at MAIN STREET POLICE STATION. On arrival at Main Street, I
along with-several other officers was conveyed by coach to the HILLSBOROUGH football gasu
ground, arriving there for a briefing in the Hillsborough ground for around 10.00am.
The briefing took place and I was directly under the command of Inspector ELLIS on
SECTOR 1*f. I was on serial 37 under the serial Sergeant, Sergeant KENNEDY from C.2.
The duties for that day were to attend at the 4i?A^SLfiY Railway Station and td await the a
arrival of the train that was carrying LIVERPOOL Supporters.
My duties* along with other officers was to search the supporters at random as they left
the railway station prior to them being escorted to the ground by Sergeant 1829 FRANCE,
and his officers who were also present with us and whose duties were to escort the
 supporters to the Hillsborough ground. PS FRANCE Was officer-in-eharge of Serial 36.
On arrival of the train, which consisted only of the ONE train and which I understood
was to have had on board 550 supporters, came as a surprise as only one train arrived
and in total I would estimate about 200 supporters in all were on-board.
These supporters appearified to be in good   humour   and very friendly, none appeared to
have been drinking and they consisted of 'family' type supporters.
Prior to the arrival of the train several hundreds of supporters all whom I believe
 to be LIVERPOOL supportees were making their way along HALIFAX Road , past the railway
 station and down towards the football ground, ^ahy of these supporters were seen to
 be carrying not only six-packs of beer and lager but 12 packs EACH. ‘They were also
 seen drinking beer/Lager from large 2 litre plastic bottles and they appeared to be
 in a jovial , happy mood, some being rather boisterous. My attention was drawn to
 a group of 6 to 8 malie supporters across the opposite side from the WA^pSLEY Railway
 Station. One of these youths aged about l6to 17 years was totally drunk and I in
 company with PC 1^29 BASHFORTH, crossed the road and spoke to the unknown youth.
Bewas very unsteady and worse the   xsimz    wear for drink.    He was sitting on a small
 wall and appeijired unable to stand unaided.                   PC Bashforth spoke to the
 older member of the group and told him that the younger man would not be let in the
 ground in that state. The older man was reasonable and understanding and said he
* would arrange someone to stay with the younger man* They then continued on their way,
 assisting the young man along. He was not arrested, firstly becamse his friends were
 helping him alomg and secondly, due to the amount of passing supporters in comparison
 to Police presence to do so may have resulted in Police injuries.        _
 The day itself .was very hot and I was approached, many times whilst in the location
 of the WARDSLEY Railway bridge/station, asking which public houses were open.
 Although public houses were in that immediate area , many had their doors and windows
 boarded up. I was unable to assist in these enquiries, firstly because I do not know
 the area and secondly it appended that they had drunk enough alcohol without going in
 I would estimate that we had been at the railway station for 3 hours when the train*
 arrived. As previously stated, these supporters were good natured and well behaved and
 they made their way under Police escort to the ground. For some unknown reason to
.myself, the serial I formed part of also escorted the supporters from the train
 down to the football ground arriving on the front of LEPPINGS LANE.
 I would estimate that the time was just gone 2.Q0pm that day and LEPPINGS LANE was
 very busy with supporters on foot. I was under the impression that very few supporters
made any positive attempt to enter the ground and several unknown (to me) senior
 officers, (ie Inspector level) came to me. and other officers shouting for us to get
the supporters into the ground. In our small.group of officers it was atisax almost
impossible to get the crowd to move to the turnstiles. The crowd would not form any
orderly queues and pushed constantly against each other. Several supporters went up
onto the grass banking owned by the tyre fitting company directly opposite to the
Leppings Lane entrance. Officers were unable to get these supporters back onto the
roadway. This group of probably to to 50 supporters were drinking heavily, supping
from large plastic 2 litre cannisters and tin cans of beer and lager etc.
I, along with what appen*ed only a few Police officers made hopeless attempts to get t
the supporeters into the ground. It was as I at the time described, ‘LIKE STIRRING
PORREDGE'. Everyone went wherever they pleased. Many supporters would approach and
ask me how to get into a certain area within the ground but unfortunately, I know
no-where either inside or outside the ground. I personally felt that local knowledge
officers should have been situtated where I was in more strenth to answer these
questions. Furthermore, the coloured tickets did not Jielp as I was unable to see the
colour coded boards on the turn stile entrance ways. I feel that they should have been
situated well above head height, so that supporters to the rear of the crowds could
have seen the correct queue that they were required to get into. What was infact
happening was that supporters were choosing what they thought was a queue, although
it was.basically flBHHHWBSX poorly organised. I felt that officers should have been
at the turn stile entrance ways in more .strength and caused the crowd to form.queues
PRIOR to getting near to the turnstiles.   No senior officers at this stage appeared to
be in command of the situation and what was happening was several officers of Inspector
level pushed amongst the crowd shouting at officers to move the supporeters first
this way then that way. I feel that no-one, knew what was actually taking place.

At around 2.*+5pm the crowding became intense and shoulder to shoulder pushing and
heaving was taking place. Still, no-one appeared to know where they were heading for
and little, rf any , instructions were coming from senior officers. I saw at this
stage supporters with young children aged approximately 10 years old, now walking
away from the crowds and one man commented to me that it was ’bloody disgusting' and
he said that the organisation was pathetic. The crowding was very tight and it was
becoming difficult to raise my arms from my sides. To be closely compact was becoming
clostrophobic and because we were so close the smell of stale 'ale' on the breath
of the supporeters was strong. I had with me my personnal radio but very little             O
                                                                                            v J
instruction was coming from the control room within the ground. At around 2.5.0pm ^
heard a voice almost pleading with the contrpl to iiave 1the ^te' openett,            "—- .
By now supporters were climbing over the. entrance.^wall_ .and I saw. a officer       r     -
trying to prevent this happening. The mounted officers at this location were so^ tightly
packed that they were virtually useless, not being able to mov|j^gs£ect£rwgllistannoyf ^
A short while later I heard a call over the radio for all, available officers to enter
the ground but nothing followed to «ay or clarify for what-reason. I assttmed-thafe
a pitch invasion had occurred and .I with other .officersfrom ser*jfel 36 aod 37 .attempted_
to enter the ground by the left entrance concertina gates. I was J H K           the last ^olice
officer to enter the ground in company with PC 1266 Adshead. I began to .follow the
other officers when I heard a call"from behind me. It was the gateman at that^Tocation m
and he was unable to close the gate after us due to the crowd pushing tha gates open.---
I return^with PC Adshead and forcibly pushed outside the ground the invading supporeters
and by brute strength pulled the concertina gates together. Infact, the gat.eman was
unable to efficiently ip carry out his duties and did not appear to be physically strong
enough without regard to mentally strong enough to say NO to the supporters who were
trying -to enter by force *   I, with PC Adshead then made anattempt to catch lap with-- —
serial 36/37 but due to the crowd inside the ground got only as far asg the rear o f ____
the side terraces/seating area, (left side).            OnSrnan with his young boy shouted to us
to get in the ground and help out. He was very annoyed as well as emotional but ^
did not reply. We could not get any further into the ground and eventually, PC Adshead'
  ..   ^   ...                  ^   ^   ,   . . .   .


and. myself returnrfoutsi.de the ground to the front , right side of Leppings. Lane. .. _         ---
(Our backs were near to the bridge, and river) I was still not aware of what had actually
taken place and many people were emerging from the ground, bein,g male and female alike.
They were crying and annoyed as well as bitter towards the Police. Frustration was
shown by the supporters and a bitterness towards the Police. Several of these             —~ -
supporeters were coughing and choking and very upset. Some came out without shoes on__
their feet and some had no shirts on. I heard a radio request for several ambulances
to attend at the Lepping Lane end of the ground and for the attendance of the f^.re
Service wi(
          th cutting equipment. My impression when the Fire Service were called upon
was that due to the compactness of the crowd people-had started to ^c^ydrate-rap^K
although I was unable to understand as to why cutting equipment was required.               ......
Many supporters who got out of the ground said it was teryffying inside and that
several had been injured. The fleet of ambulances arrived almost at the same time as
did the Fire tenders. A senior fire officer# approached me to establish what was
happening.and where did thejt Police require them;to attendk I was unable to assist
and directed him to a inspector standing pearby. This confusion went on for some
time until I made my, way down the right side of the, ground to the gates where the
injured were taken from. I was then shocked to see and count 10 bodies laying on the
ground, some tended to by Police Officers and others overseen b y St John ‘First Aiders*
No screens were at this time around the bodies, and it was obvious that they were                  -
infact dead. I recall speaking to PC Lipski and saying that I had counted 10 dead
                                                                        (/      .                1
                                                                         ^          „        • " i
at the top side and he said that it was rumoured that about 60 were feared dead at           -   ■
this* time. I stayed near to the ten dead bodies forming a human chain to protect            -   !
 the botfies from the supporters leaving the ground. Several male supporters were
distraught and began visibly, fighting with their friends on seeing the bodies and they
totally lost control of themselves. Their colleagues held onto them and infact received
punches and kicks from their own mates. I heard the coment from one man who said to
me, ’you got it wrong this time did'nt you m a t e O t h e r comments were ’Your've killed
em' you bastards.1 . I was kicked on tj^e right knee with one youth who was fighting mad
and another spat at me on the side of. the head. Even at this time I was unclear as to H
what ha,d occurred or gone wrong. In an attempt to clear the pushing crowds , who insisted
in leaving by the only gate availably for use by the emergency services , I with another
group of officers , none from my serial went just inside the outer gate lead by another
middle aged sergeant whom I do not know. We tried       to form a. line to get the crowd to cl
the area to leave room for the emergency services but we were met by abuse and offers
of violence kfeKXKXX   whenever we tried to move them on. We tried to be diplomatic and
caring when moving the crowd on but they had become hostile towaads us. However, TWO             ^
supporeters were excellent, one was aged about 55       yeflfls and he appealled to the crowdto
leave quickly to allow the emergency services access. Another young man aged about 25            *
years also was excellent and appealjLed to the crowd in a similar manner. This young man
was attacked by another man and I intervened to stop the attacker. Infact, the crowd
were now taking more notice of the tlrt* supporters than that of the Police and. as such
we left it to them to appeal to the crowd. I later spoke to the younger man and thanked
him for his assistance although he had received abuse and violence towards him.
I did not obtain his persoj&al details but believe he assisted well in moving on the
crowd. It was infact, on speaking to this young man that I was for the first time        made
aware of what had gone wrong.         ,     .                                      .
                       ; ,    Aiie had been in the ground and had managed to escape)             J

As the crowd dispersed more- thinly we returned outside the gate used by the emergency
services and I saw Police transit vans being used to convey the dead bodies from
outside the ground.
Whilst at this location, after some unknown amount of time had passed, PS Kennedy
came to me and I with other officers made our way to the WARBSLEY Railway station on
foot. (As per plan)    The moving of traffic on Halifax road had almost come to a
standstill and supporters on fobt made their way up the road away from the ground.
Many of the supporters were dishevelled and clearly shaken as were majfjPolice Officers.

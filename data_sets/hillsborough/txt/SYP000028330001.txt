                   STATEMENT OF




THE SOUTH YORKSHIRE FIRE AND CIVIL DEFENCE AUTHORITY




                (-THE FIRE SERVICE")
                                THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY



STATEMENT OF:    ALAN KEITH SEAMAN



OCCUPATION:      ASSISTANT CHIEF FIRE OFFICER




My name is Alan Keith Seaman.         I am employed by the South Yorkshire             County

Fire   Service   in     the   rank   of   Assistant   Chief    Fire Officer.      My major

reference is that of Fire Prevention/Safety, which amongst a great deal                    of

other matters, encompasses Safety at Sports Grounds.



I   have   been employed within the Fire Service for 23 years and I have been

involved with fire safety matters since April, 1973.



I have held my present post since February, 1987.             Prior   to   that    I    held

several    specialist    Fire    Safety posts at both Divisional and Headquarters

levels within the Fire Service.



I am a member of the Institution of Fire Engineers.
                               SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975



1*    The involvement of the Fire Service in the implementation of the Safety

      of Sports Ground Act, 1975



1.1   The Safety of Sports Ground Act (SSGA) was passed in 1975 following the

      publication         in    1972 of the Report of the Inquiry into Crowd Safety at

      Sports Grounds which                was   prepared            by   Lord   Wheatley        following       the

      serious     accident           at     Ibrox          Park    Football     Ground     in     1971, when 66

      spectators were killed on a stairway.



      The Home Office issued Guidance to Local Authorities under cover of

      Home Officer Circular 150/1975.                                                                                    Ex 1




1.2   The Safety of Sports Ground Act gave the Secretary of                                   State     power    to

      require    through         designation orders that safety certificates be issued

      to sports stadia with accommodation for more                              than     10,000       spectators.

      The     intention        was        for the Act to come into force gradually through a

      phased programme of designation orders so as not to place an                                      immediate

      financial burden on the smaller and less well off clubs.



1.3   The     first   order was made in August 1976 and applied to first division

      football clubs and              certain          international          grounds,     ‘.(.'he Home    Office

      isuucd     guidance        to        local       authorities        under       cover     of    Iloinn Office

      Circulac 130/76. Phaffiold Wednesday's ground was desi^u:rct:d in                                    .ft.ugur.it   Ex 2

      1978,     although        the club was not in the first division, be.cauRo of i.-ht;

      quasi international use.                  .Sacond           division    clubs     were     deuigr.uitRd     in

      August     3.979.        Third        and fourth division clubs and rugby league clubr.

      were designated in August 1905, following the                               Bradford       City     Football

      Club fire.



                                                   1   -
1.4   In 1976, the Home Office produced a voluntary code called the "Guide to

      Safety at Sports Grounds                (Football)",          commonly      known      as    the        Green       Ex 5

      Guide.      This       gave     guidance        on    measures for improving the safety of

      spectators at sports grounds and extended the                          recommendations             of     the

      Wheatley       Report.         The    County Council later contacted the Home Office

      regarding the application of the Green Guide and had been informed that

      basically       any     new    work     or construction had to be of a                      standard not

      lower than that set out in the Green Guide but that maximum flexibility

      had to be maintained in the case of existing structures.



1.5   The    former South Yorkshire County Council, as the enforcing authority,

      delegated its powers and duties under the Safety of Sports                                  Ground        Act

      to    the   Fire       Service       Committee.          On 8th January, 1976, the Committee

      decided that       their        functions          should     be   exercised       through         Officer

      Working     Parties       for    the        four     borough       council areas, consisting of

      representatives of the               police,       the      Fire    Service      and   the        building

      inspectors of the borough councils, with co-ordination being undertaken

      by David Vaughan who was the responsible officer of the                                Department          of

      Administration.           He     also    took the chair and produced the minutes for

      all working party meetings.



1.6   In order to avoid duplication and                     division       of    resources,         a    primary

      authority        was     chosen       for     the      carrying      out    of    inspections,            :ce-

      ixispections, and         making        final        technical      recomraemlafcions         usiing      tlifs

      headings       given     in     the     contents summary of the Green Guida with fsonio

      fidditioru;.     r
                       x'ho primary authority responsible wan required                             to    c:o:anuI'r.

      the    other authorities concerned befora finalising any recommendation*!.

      It: will be seen from the schedule that the Fixe Service ware dorsignited                                         Ex i|

      the    primary        authority       for     means of escape and fire precautions.                        By

      virtue of their general experience as a                        fire       and    emergency        service,

      they     were    able     to     give       advice       on this subject.          However, the Fire

                                            - 2 -
Service did not attend and have not                       attended       football          matches        as     a

matter of course.




It was the practice for all disciplines to report to the Administration

Department and thereafter for a joint meeting of                               the     Officer       Working

Party       to    be     held     after    which     the        agreed    recommendations             of all

disciplines were               amalgamated       into     a     report    by     the      Administration

Department         and        sent to the club(s).            Copies of all correspondence and

the minutes of meetings were sent to each member and                                 all     arrangements

for meetings were made by the Administration Department.




It    was    the       practice for the Officer Working Parties to carry out two

inspections of the ground each year, commonly                            known       as     "summer"           and

"winter"         inspections.           It was Fire Service practice to be represented

by officers            from    both     Divisional        and    Headquarters             levels     at        all

meetings         and     inspections         whenever         possible.     This enabled a common

standard to be applied.



With the abolition of the South Yorkshire County Council                                    on 1st April,

1986 enforcement in South Yorkshire was to pass                            to the four

Metropolitan           District       Councils,      Rotherham,          Barnsley,         Doncaster and

Sheffield.         r
                   i?he Local Government Act, 1985 amanded Section 3 (3) of t.h ;

Safety      of Sports Ground Act so that in future in metropolitan count!;’',

the local authority,               in    thin    cnse      Sheffield       Metropolitan            i)ist.trick

Council,     was        required      to   Bend a copy of any application for a r.nfov.y

certificate for a stadium to the chief officer of police and                                       tho     £v<. ;

authority         and     to     consult     them       about the terms and eondit ionr. 'Lo h-t

included in the certificate.                    The Officer Working Party was replaced by

the      Safety          of      Sports      Ground        Advisory        Group           comprising           of

representatives from               police,       Fire     Service,       the     building          surveyors
     division       and   the    Health   & Consumer Services Department of the local

     authority.       The Home Office issued guidance           on        the    new   arrangements

    under cover of Home Office Circular 7/1986.                                                               Ex 5



1.10 On   18th      February,      1986, a memorandum from        theChief Fire Officer was                   Ex 6

    circulated to all five Fire Service               divisions      detailing         the   changes

     that were to take place under the Local Government Act 1985 and the way

    the administrative arrangements of the Safety                    of     Sports     Grounds       Act

     1975, would be affected.



     It stressed the importance of establishing and maintaining good liaison

    between divisions and District Councils who would                       be    responsible         for

     administering the Act.



1.11 A letter dated 24th February, 1986, was received from Sheffield City                                     Ex 7

     Council indicating that as the Council were to take over responsibility

     as the Licensing Authority under the              Safety        of Sports         Grounds       Act,

     1975,     it    would      be of assistance to the Council and other Authorities

     for an informal meeting to be held to discuss both existing and                             future

     arrangements for administering the Act.



1.12 On the 5th March, 1986 Mr D Vaughan              arranged a joint meeting, for the

     24th    March,       1986 with the officers of the District Councils who would                           Ex 8

     be taking over responsibility for Safety of Sports Ground';                             w-v'.-.tnr,i

     which    was      attended by officers from the police; r.nd Fir« Secviosi.

     purpose of the meeting was to hand over the County Council ' a f . i l n n

     have    a      gsneral     discussion    on Safety of Spores Oroimdrj                       .    Vh'.t

     Fire Service said that they hoped the South                Yorkshire          County    Council

     General        Safety    Certificate     would   be   adopted         by     all the districts

     because this would help           them    standardise      on    one        rather   than       four

     different sets of conditions.

                                       - 4 -
1.13 In Sheffield the Administration and Legal Department became the

     responsible         department and Mr David Bownes was the responsible officer

     within the department.               In a letter dated 5th June, 1986, they attached                   Ex 9

     a     copy    of    a report which had been placed before the General Purposes

     panel on 6th May, 1986 together with a copy of the                      panel's      resolution

     in relation to that report.



     With    reference        to the Safety Certificate Conditions, the report noted

     that these were standardised throughout south Yorkshire and both police

     and    Fire    Service        had indicated that they wished this to continue for

     reasons of administrative simplicity.                     It then went on    to     state     that

     the    conditions        gave       some   cause    for    concern as they appeared to be

     inadequate or inappropriate in some areas.



     It was proposed to re-draft the Certificate Conditions after which                             the

     Sheffield      Wednesday        certificate        would    be   replaced.        The Sheffield

     United certificate could then be issued with the new conditions                             before

     the    start       of   the     1986/87     season. In the covering letter, Mr              Bownes   Ex 9

     indicated that the re-drafting                of    the     certificate conditions          would

     shortly be completed and the comments of the Fire Service would then be

     sought.



     T h a Panel was fiaked for authority for the present adminicfcrativo syrA-.mv,

     to be continued for the time being.



1.14 'A meeting took placo on 10th March, 1987 to deal with the future

     administration          of    the    Council'8 certification function.              The gdrri/.F.O. Ex 10

     feeling of the meeting was that the roles of                     each   authority      involved

     should be defined perhaps along the lines of the South Yorkshire County

     Council system.          This was described in a letter dated,               14th May, 1987,

                                           - 5 -
     from    Mr D Bownes, which enclosed a draft division of responsibilities.

     The letter asked for comments on the proposals                        that,     inter      alia   the    Ex 11

     following      should     be    Fire     Service responsibilities fire precautions,

     fire alarms, means of escape, emergency lighting, stadium capacity.                                It

     was    also    proposed     there      should       in   future       be     only one inspection

     annually.



1.15 In a letter dated 7th July, 1987 the Fire Service:-                                                      gx \ 2



     (a)    expressed the      view    that      division      of       responsibilities         between

            authorities      should      remain      along        the     lines    of    the    schedule
                                                                                                              Ex 4
            previously adopted and referred to in Para 1.6



     (b)    accepted the proposal of one inspection annually.



1.16 At a meeting of the Advisory Group on 16th July, 1987,                          the      definition

    °f     roles   was    discussed.        DO    Grimshaw        said     that     when determining

    capacity figures each discipline would have                      to    put     forward      figures.

    Those     of    the   Fire      Service      would    only be based on means of escape.

    Following those remarks, it was agreed that:



     (1)    Roles should be broadly defined and responsibilities taken                            on   by

            the    appropriate of the threa "lead authorities" i.e. Police, Fire

            and Building Surveyors subject to agreement where overlap occurs.



            All contact with the         grounds         should     be    throngh       the    JJ.fjoiVjiny

            authori.ty.




            Environmental Health would take a "general safety role" and not be

            a "lead" authority.




                                      - 6 -
(2) The annual inspection was to be a                joint   full    inspection      to   be

      carried out near the end of each season.



      D.P.   ("during         performance")     inspections     were       to be done on an

      individual basis.          Prior arrangements were to           be     made with    the

      Police,     but     not    the    Club.    The Licensing Authority were to be

      informed when an inspection had taken place.



(3)   The meeting was informed that legally the group                  was    an    advisory

      authority.        Only the council would be the ultimate decision making

      authority.



(4)   Individual authorities were to correspond with the sports                      grounds

      through     the     licensing authority who would subsequently circulate

      copies of all letters to each "lead" authority.



      Meetings of       the     group   would   be    held at       irregular      intervals

      depending     on need and would be called by any member of the group.

      Individual authorities did not need to attendspecific meetings if

      they had no "interest".



      Agendas were to be issued prior to each meeting.




                                  - 7 -
1.17 On    3rd   August,       1987,    a     draft   report    which    had been prepared for

     submission to the general purposes panel of the City Council                       was      sent   Ex 14

    to     the     Fire   Service.       In    that report, under the heading of "future

     administration of council certification function', it                   was       recommended

    that     the     "Safety     of    Sports Grounds Advisory Group" would serve as a

     forum for discussion between officers                and    would    form   the     basis     of

    written        detailed     advice to the council.          It was also recommended that

     the roles of the various officers should be                  defined    along      the   lines

     discussed       at the meeting of the 16th July, 1987 and the point was made

     that there were extensive areas of potential overlap.

2.    History: 1978-1986

2.1   The South Yorkshire                County     Council        received           an    application              for    a

      General     Safety       Certificate           in    September,            1978.          The    club engaged

      Eastwood and Partners, a Sheffield based firm of                                  consulting           engineers

      as their consultants.



2.2   In    November      1978, the draft General Safety Certificate which had been

      prepared by the County Council following consultation with the                                            Officer

      Working     Parties      was        submitted        to      the     Fire        Service         Committee for

      approval to be used throughout the county.



2.3   On 2nd January, 1979, the Chief Fire Officer sent a memorandum                                            to      the

      Chief     Executive      of        South     Yorkshire            County        Council suggesting that                    Ex 15

      officers of        the working party                undertake        a     comprehensive               survey of

      Sheffield       Wednesday          Football       Club       in unison rather than separately.

      The Chief Fire Officer suggested that a copy                               of    the      report          of     each

      department         be   provided to              each     otherdepartment involved to enable

      problems to        be discussedso            that       an       acceptable          approach         might          be

      determined       and    consolidated             into        a    single        report     which should be

      forwarded to the club.               The memorandum made several other                           observations

      regarding the standards necessary.



2.4   (i)     On 17th January, 1979               t.ho South Yorkshire County Council roceivocl
                                                                                                                                 I :.x 16
              a report prepared by Eastwood and Partners on ground                                      capacity           of

              Sheffield       Wednesday           Football         Club,    in        connection            vith      theiv

              application          for     a   General        Safety       Certificate.                 'i'ho        repo::!;

              indicated       that       the     Green     Guide         had been ur.ee! as t.ho basis for

              their    calculations,              although         as    with     probably            all       existing

              grounds,        it     would          not       be        possible           to   satisfy         all        the



                                               - 9 -
        recommendations in the guide and reasonable                 compromise        would     be

        needed.



(ii) Paragraph (b) of the report dealt with the west terrace (including

        the lower level at the north west corner but excluding                    the       north

        west     corner     reinforced concrete terrace).           The report considered

        that despite the fact that the full area of the west terrace could

        accommodate about 8,000 spectators, due to the lack of gangways an

        allowance should be made for circulation space in order that                          good

        packing could be achieved.            It further suggested that an allowance

        of 10% be made for this purpose, resulting in a suggested capacity

        for the west terrace of 7,200.



        Crush     barriers were to be designed to match the capacity of 7,200

        spectators and additional barriers and                 appropriate      strengthening

        of existing barriers would be provided for where necessary.



        Reference     is    also   made      to   the    evacuation     time     for the west

        terrace, this being about six minutes based on the                     exits    already

        available     and     also to the fact that some spectators would be 25m

        from an exit although movement along the terrace would be easy and

        quick.      The     existing   exits      were    through      the tunnel and round

        either side of the west stand.




(iii)          A meeting of the Officer           Working      Party    was    held    on     12th

                February,     1979,    the    purpose     of    which    was to discuss the

                report prepared by Eastwood and Partners and to consider                       the

                views which should be put to the club.
          With     regard      to the west terrace, it was considered that due

          to the lack of depth of the terrace, the offer to reduce                                   the

          spectator       limit      to     7,200       and with a discharge time of 6.6

          minutes it would have been                 unreasonable         to    insist        on     the

          provision       of     gangways or additional exits.                  There was total

          movement laterally             throughout       the    terrace        and     the        three

          entrance/exits          from      the terrace were well situated.                    At the

          time, the worst disaster/emergency contemplated                          was     one       of

          fire.      As    the     west      stand      provided a minimum of fire risk

          (because it was constructed in concrete) it was accepted that

          these routes would be available and adequate in an emergency.

          The existing gates in the perimeter fence were discounted for

          means     of    escape      purposes.          At   that time the gates in the

          perimeter       fence      were       considered      to   be    there         for        the

          convenience       of     the    police        for   crowd control purposes and

          suitable as a means of egress for a relatively                          small        number

          of spectators in the event of a localised incident.



          It was noted that, subject to existing crush barriers passing

          the tests, they would require special attention                          in     view       of

          the apparent sharp edges and corrosion.




(iv) On 2nd April, 1979, a meeting was held between the Officer Working                                    Ex I t

    Party and the club to discuss the views                     of   the       Officer     Working

    Party in respect of the report submitted by Eastwood and Partners.



    As   far     as the west terrace was concerned, it was agreed that the

    club's proposal for additional barriers and reductions in capacity

    to   7,200    without      the       need     for    additional        gangways should be

                               - 11 -
      implemented.           The     question    of     the    condition     of   some       of    the

      existing        barriers        and the stepping arrangement on the north west

      corner exit would be the subject of detailed                        discussions        between

      Dr Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.



(v)   A meeting of the Officer Working Party and the Sheffield Wednesday

      Football Club was held on 18th April, 1979 during which                           the       club   Ex 19

      accepted        that     the    stepping arrangement on the north west corner

      exit should be rebuilt.                The matters concerning the crush barriers

      were     to     be     reconsidered       after    it     was seen which of the crush

      barriers failed on testing.



(vi) On 1st May, 1979, the City of Sheffield Building                          Surveyors      wrote

      to     South    Yorkshire          County Council and summarised in the letter,

      their own requirements in relation to matters discussed at                              recent     Ex 20

      meetings.        The     Building       Surveyor indicated that, subject to the

      downward slope of exit steps at the north west corner                           exit    being

      corrected and the capacity being restricted to that agreed between

      the police and the             club,    that    department         considered     the       west

      terrace to be acceptable.



(vii)On 16th May, 1979, the South Yorkshire County Fire Service wrote

      to South Yorkshire City Council, enclosing plans numbered 1610/12,                                 Ex 21

      1610/11, 1610/9A, 1610/8A, 1610/7A,                     1610/6A,     1610/4A,      1610/2XA,       Ex 22

      1610/1XA and a recommendation of work schedule to be undertaken.



      With    regard to exit routes from the west and north west terraces,

      these were considered to be satisfactory.



      The provision of exit signs was required in the work schedule, the

      siting     of    which       was     indicated     on     the   plans.      There       was no

                                     - 12 -
            requirement for such signs on the west terrace                     exits.       This    was

            because     they were the ones used for normal entrance and exit from

            what was an open terrace.            Further, none        were     required      for    the

            perimeter       fence    gates.      These were not        normal exit routes.              To

            have    exit     signs     for    these   gates    could        cause    problems       and

            confusion.



            The    schedule also detailed that adequate roads should be provided

            to ensure that speedy and            direct    access     couldbe       obtained       by

            emergency       vehicles    to all exterior parts of the stadium and that

            it had to be ensured         that     parked    vehicles        would     not    obstruct

            emergency vehicles on these access roads.



      (viii)On the 8th June, 1979, South Yorkshire County Council sent a
                                                                                                             Ex 23
            memorandum to the Chief Fire officer, enclosing the work schedule

            forwarded to Sheffield Wednesday               Football     Club        which had      been

            collated     from    the    detailed      comments of the various disciplines

            represented on the Working Party.



      (ix) A meeting of the Officer Working Party and the Sheffield Wednesday

            Football     Club    was    held     on 12th November 1979when it               was noted        Ex 24

            that work detailed in the            schedule dated 8th June             1979 had      been

            carried out as far as the west terrace was concerned.



2.5   The   General     Safety       Certificate      in   respect     of     Sheffield Wednesday

      Football Club with plans attached was issued with                      conditions      on    21st
                                                                                                             Ex 25
      December,     1979.     The club's attention was drawn, in particular, to the

      following conditions:



      8(1) acceptance of existing first aid facilities on an interim

            basis only

                                        - 13 -
      12(1) arrangements for emergency lighting in the south stand being

             only acceptable for the duration of the existing battery life.



      14     acceptance of police facilities on an interim basis only.



      30     no spectators being allowed to use the stadium                       in    conditions     of

             extreme wind and/or snow loadings.



             The     Fire     Services'     plans   were     sent    to South Yorkshire County

             Council for duplication and for               attachment       to    the    certificate.
                                                                                                            Ex 26
             Copies were returned to the Fire Service on the 4th February 1980.                             Ex 27



2.6    (i)   On    the      14th   March,    1980, South Yorkshire County Council sent a                    Ex 28

             memorandum to the Chief Fire Officer               stating          that     despite     the

             fact     that     the   certificate     had    been issued as recently as 21st

             December, it was felt that the Sheffield District Officer                           Working

             Party would have to review the situation due to the pending FA Cup

             semi-final between Arsenal and           Liverpool        on        12th   April,      1980.

             Comments       were     requested on any outstanding matters for which the

             Fire Service had primary responsibility.



       (ii) On the 20th March, 1980, Stn.O. Davies sent a                        memorandum      to   the
                                                                                                            Ex 2S

             during an inspection of the ground on                  12th    March,       1980.      These

             included



             (a)     training of stewards

             (b)     exit     signs not being of the required standard as detailed in

                     schedule II of the certificate.



                                          - 14 -
          (c)     non provision of fire alarm systems as required                          by     Schedule

                  II of the certificate



    (iii)On the 26th March, 1980, the Chief Fire officer sent a memorandum

          to     South      Yorkshire    County Council detailing what was set out in                          Ex 30

          the memorandum referred to at                2 .6   (ii) above.



    (iv) On the 31st March, 1980, South Yorkshire County Council wrote                                    to
                                                                                                               Ex 31
          Sheffield         Wednesday    Football        Club detailing what was set out in

          the memorandum to South Yorkshire County Council                           referred      to     at

          2.6(iii)       above.       Additional        observations         made     by the Building

          Surveyor were also included in this letter.



    (v)   On    the    3rd    April,     1980     Sheffield        Wednesday          Football          Club
                                                                                                               Ex 32
          acknowledged         receipt    of     the     letter from South Yorkshire County

          Council referred to at 2.6{iv) above.                    An explanation          as     to    the

          lack    of training of stewards was given stating that this would be

          undertaken on completion of the fire alarm                        system    which       was     in

          hand.       All    other     matters     in     the letter of the 31st March were



•
          passed to Dr Eastwood for his professional advice.



    (vi) On the 4th and        8 th   April, 1980, Eastwood & Partners wrote to South
                                                                                                               Ex 33
          Yorkshire         County Council explaining the reasons for non provision

          of exit signs and fire warning system and dealing with all matters

          referred to by the Building Surveyor.



    (vii)A meeting of the Officer Working Party and Sheffield Wednesday

          Football Club was held on 10th April, 1980 to discuss the areas of                                   Ex 34

          concern recently communicated to the club and in view                            of     the    FA

          Cup Semi-final to be held on 12th April, 1980.                       The points covered

          by the letters from Eastwood and Partners on 4th                           and   8 th    April,

                                       - 15 -
              were   discussed     and as far as training of the safety stewards was

              concerned it was agreed that there was little point until the fire

              warning    system    had        been    completely       installed.        It    was noted

              however that the         Fire     Service    had       given    instruction        to        some

              stewards.



2.7   On   the 3rd September, 1980 South Yorkshire County Council wrote to the

      Chief Constable outlining the concern of the                     Chief     Executive       of        the
                                                                                                                  Ex 35
      police policy of locking away supporters inside grounds until such time

      as home supporters had cleared the area and suggesting that instead                                   of

      being      allowed to approach locked gates at the end of a match, the away

      supporters should be held back in a relatively safe place, such                                 as    on

      the terrace.



      Concern     was    also    expressed       at modifications being made at Sheffield

      Wednesday Football Club at the                 request    of    the     police,     without          the

      knowledge of the Officer Working Party.



2.8   On   the    16th    January,      1981,        Eastwood    and    Partners        wrote to South

      Yorkshire      County     Fire    Service        confirming      that      the      fire         alarm      Ex 36

      installation       and    modifications          to the public address system had been

      completed during July 1980.

                                                                                                                  Ex 37
      Club was held on 7th April, 1981 the purpose of which was to review the

      ground due to the pending FA cup semi-final to be held on                           11th    April,

      1981. Consultations between South Yorkshire County Fire Service and the

      police had resulted in           the     production       of    an     "Emergency       Evacuation

      Procedure".       The club undertook to circulate copies of the procedure to
                                                                                                                  Ex 38
      all stewards who would be on duty for the FA Cup Semi-Final.



                                        - 16 -
       A copy of     the     procedure            is     produced        dated 12th              Hay, 1981.      The

       procedure     detailed          the       signal       to    be adopted to inform stewards and

       police that an emergency had arisen and the actions to be                                     followed     on

       hearing further announcements over the public address system.



2.10   A meeting of the Officer Working Party and Sheffield Wednesday Football

       Club   was    held        on    8 th      June,     1981.         It    was       noted    that following
                                                                                                                       Ex 39
       experiences     at        the    FA       Cup     Semi-Final           in     April,      the club       were

       considering     revised arrangements on the terracing in front of the west

       stand and that the Officer Working Party would be consultedwhenthese

       had substance.



2.11   (i)      On     2nd September, 1981, Eastwood and Partners wrote to South
                                                                                                                       Ex 40
                    Yorkshire County Council detailing                             the    club's     proposal     to

                    instal two radial fences on the west terrace in such a manner

                    that the terrace would be divided                          into       approximately        three

                    equal areas, each served by its own entrance.                                  The aim was to

                    achieve more control over supporters, a                               visiting     team     with

                    only     a    few supporters being allocated one section, with the

                    other two sections retained by the home supporters.



                    Larger       contingents             of        visiting          supporters        could      be

                    accommodated            in    two     or       all    three       areas as their numbers

                    dictated.          A 1.15 metre gate was proposed at the rear of each

                    fence.



       (ii)     A     meeting          of     the      Officer       Working         Party was held on 11th

                    September, 1981, to consider the proposed erection of                                     radial   Ex ill

                    barriers on the west terrace for crowd control purposes.




                                              - 17 -
        Whilst       there were reservations due to problems with opposing

        fans mixing at the rear of the west stand,                  the   police    felt

        that     they could cope with any problems of this nature and as

        they felt that increased control on the terrace should result

        from        the     proposals,    theOfficer      Working   Party     saw    no

        objections to their implementation.



        The adequacy and positioning of the gates to be installed                    at

        the rear of the radial barriers was discussed, as was the use

        of     the existing gates in thepitch perimeter fence.                It    was

        agreed       that    Messrs Eastwood and Partners be notified of the

        Officer Working Party's decision which was subject to:-



        a)     further       calculations requiredby the Building           Authority

               being satisfactory



        b)     the adequacy of headroom in the vicinity of the proposed

               gates at the rear of the terrace             and



        c)     the new       gates at the rear       of   the   terrace     also being

               under police control.



               It    was     clearly understood by the representatives of the

               Fire Service that these gates would be constantly manned

               and    they     would     not     have approved the proposal if the

               situation was to be otherwise. Again, at this time,                  the

               perimeter       fence     gates     were never contemplated for use

               for mass evacuation on to the pitch.



(iii)   On 14th September, 1981, South Yorkshire County Council wrote

        to Eastwood & Partners welcoming the increased control on the                      Ex it
                              - 18 -
terrace that should result from the proposal                         to    instal    two

radial        barriers     but      pointing       out    the reservations of the

Officer Working Party               and     the     conditions      referred    to     in

2 .1 1 (ii)      above     that     the approval of the scheme was subject

to.




On 14th December, 1981, Eastwood and Partners wrote to                              south

Yorkshire         County      council       declaring that vork on the radial

fences was substantially complete,                    whilst this had not            been

previously          brought    to     the attention of the Officer Working

Party,      there had been three first team                         game a ainee     tbs

fences had been erected and the police had inspected the work

and were satisfied with the new arrangements.




on the 23rd         December,        1961,     the       Chief     Executive     (South

Yorkshire County Council) sent a memorandum to the Chief Fire

Officer       requesting our confirmation that the                    radial     fences

were satisfactory.




On    the     Sth    January,        1982     the     Chief       Fire Officer sent a

memorandum to the chief               Executive          (south    Yorkshire     county

Council;         dated    Sth January, 1992 confirming that the radial

fences were considered to be satisfactory*




On the 20th January, 1982, south Yorkshire county Council

wrote to Eastwood and Partners                    commenting on ths fact that

the matches played at the stadium since the                         installation       of

the   barriers confirmed that they appeared to be working well

and   satisfactorily           effected        the    segregation         of   opposing

groups      of    fans.       it    was      noted    however,       that the entire
             section of the terrace had yet to be given to                                  one    group     of

             fans.



             There    was        also    comment from the police that existing crush

             barriers       extended          up   to    and          completely      through           radial

             barriers       at     a    height        of 4'6 " or so, thus enabling fans to

             easily climb over the radial barrier into adjacent pens.



    (viii)   On 26th January, 1982 Eastwood                       &    Partners       wrote        to   South
                                                                                                                  Ex 47
             Yorkshire      County Council replying to the police observations

             with regard to crush barriers being up                            to     and    through        the

             radial barriers.



             Mr   Eastwood        observed         that if the crush barriers were to be

             removed up to a distance of                 1 .2 m       from    the     radial       barriers,

             there   would        be     a    consequent              loss of calculated spectator

             capacity which is undesirable from the club's point of                                     view.

             However,       from       the    point of view of safety, a strip of that

             width without a single crush barrier would be a major hazard.

             Wednesday       Football          Club     was       held on 4th February, 1982 in

             order to       discuss          the   apparent           difference        of        opinion    on

             certain     aspects         of the radial barriers on the west terrace,

             these being the observations of the                             police    in     relation       to

             crush barriers passing adjacent to the new radial barriers.



             It    was   agreed         that,      on    balance, it was preferable from a

             safety point of view to prevent crowd surge by                                  the     existing

             barriers       being       extended up to and/or through the new radial

              barriers than to completely prevent                    persons      being       able    to

              climb from one pen to another.



2.12   (i)    A      meeting       of   the      Officer      Working    Party      and    Sheffield

              Wednesday Football Club was held on 23rd                     January,        1985,      in   Ex 49

              order to carry out the winter inspection of the stadium.



              The     club recalled the practice followed in consultation with

              the police of separating home and visiting supporters at                               the

              rear     of    the    west        stand    at    certain matches (such as with

              Liverpool) by          erecting      of     temporary      barriers.         This      had

              worked     well       but    in     all other normal occasions it was the

              policy of the police to aim for                  exclusive       use by        visiting

              supporters          of the west stand and terrace. On those occasions

              when the number of visiting                 supporters     was      small      and     the

              weather       was     inclement, it was considered desirable to allow

              home supporters access to a sheltered area.



              It was agreed that the club would                  consider      at     some     future

              date,     a    scheme       for    permanent      barriers at the rear of the

              stand.



       (ii)   On the 9th April, 1985, Eastwood and Partners wrote to                            South

              Yorkshire       County      Council,       enclosing       sketch     plan      6705/2,
                                                                                                           Ex 5(
              stating that the club was anxious to segregate                        the      visiting

              team's     supporters         as    they     entered      the ground and also to

              enable the police to control their exit at the end of a game.

              The     scheme       involved      the     construction      of two new banks of

              turnstiles and various runs of fencing                     and    new    gates.         It

              provided       for     separate      turnstiles for the three sections of

              the west terrace that then existed.

(iii)   A meeting of the Officer                    Working    Party       was   held    on       18th
                                                                                                         Ex 51
        April,       1985    to discuss the proposals for segregation at the

        Leppings Lane end.



        The police were            already          familiar    with       the   proposals         and

        indicated       that       they       had    instigated          them because of their

        desire to allow greater flexibility in the use of the terrace

        and    stand by both home and away supporters, allowing them to

        vary the neutral area between opposing fans as                            circumstances

        dictated       and    to       achieve such arrangements for ingress that

        would allow turnstiles to be dedicated to specific areas.



        At the meeting, the police suggested                        the    provision        of     two

        further radial fences, one dividing the existing central area

        in half and running from the tunnel                         entrance     to   the     pitch

        side     security        fence        with    gates     to permit entry to either

        section as appropriate, the other dividing the existing north

        end    of the terrace in half and running from the front to the

        back of the terrace.



        In addition, the two new pens created by the provision of the

        radial       fences were to be provided with additional exit gates

        through the pitch perimeter fence, the new                          radial      fence       at

        the    north    end       of        the   terrace      to    have two gates and the

        existing radial fence to the north side of the tunnel to have

        a second gate.



        The    provision         of    the second gate in each of the two radial

        fences to the north of the tunnel was to allow police                                access

        to     all     parts           of     the     terrace       to    control     any        crowd

                             -    22    -
 disturbances.        It was felt by the Fire Service however,                      that

 only    one       gate in each fence would be necessary for means of

 escape.




 If the above features were implemented, the                        proposed      radial

 barrier      running     parallel      and    2     metres         from the existing

barrier at the north end of               the terracecould be                  dispensed

with     as    the    police     felt        that    theywould have more than

adequate control for segregation purposes with the                             creation

of     the    smaller pens.       The     creation ofsmaller pens was also

seen by the police to be a bonus in that                       by    having     smaller

sections       of    crowd,     their job in maintaining order would be

made easier.



At the meeting, the revised             proposals         outlined        above    were

sketched       on    to   the    drawing      by     Mr   Grimshaw, of the Fire

Service and the main concern he expressed was                                              Ex 50



(a) whether the external gates and exit routes created at the

rear    of     the    stand     would   be     adequate        for the numbers of

spectators in each section of the west stand and terrace,



(b) whether the numbers of spectators being allowed into each

section       of    the   terrace    could      be     controlled         to    prevent

overcrowding, and



(c) what arrangements were to be                made      to    ensure      that    the

gates in the radial fences would be readily available for use

should lateral movement           along       the    terrace         to   alternative

exits become necessary.



                     - 23 -
Items        (b)        and (c) above were specifically put to the police

as they, along with the club, were responsible                                 for    ensuring

that         emergency          evacuation         procedures         were     adequate         and

controlled and had                experience        with        the    club     of    ensuring

correct        crowd       density       packing.         The assurance was given by

the police that all the gates included in the                                proposals          for

the terrace part of the scheme would be manned by them at all

times during games in order that evacuation procedures                                        could

be initiated should this become necessary.                              As far as correct

density       packing        was     concerned,           the    police        stated          that

arrangements             that    they     had with the club were satisfactory

and they felt that the provision of smaller sections                                      on    the

terraces would make overall control of the terrace easier.




In     the     light       of    these assurances, the Fire Service saw no

objections in principle to the proposals subject                                 to       a    more

detailed investigation of the means of escape aspects.



It      was         agreed       that    R    Grimshaw          (Fire     Service)            should

investigate as a                matter       of    urgency       the    means        of       escape

aspects            of     the     proposals         and    subject        to     satisfactory

clearance of these matters, the outline                               proposals       submitted

would        be     agreed       as now amended by the suggestions of South

Yorkshire Police and, to                     the    submission          of     the    necessary

detailed           plans     and    calculations           under        both the Safety of

Sports Grounds Act and Building Regulations.
(iv)   (a) On examination of the plan                by    the    Fire Service,        the
                                                                                             Ex 50
             width     of    the     exit    gates    to   allow for the number of

             spectators that it was anticipated would                 use       them   was

             calculated         and it was decided that the gates would have

             to be supervised by either the police or club officials.

             With    regard       to the terracing arrangements, it was felt

             that the proposal for the new radial fence at the tunnel

             position       had    little     effect on the existing situation.

             The capacities, travel distances and                 exit    arrangements

             from the two new central pens did not change.                      In fact a

             new gate through the pitch perimeter                 fence   was     to   be

             provided.          The new radial fenceat the north end of the

             terrace      did     actually     slightly     increase      the     travel

             distance to the normal route of exit i.e. the way across

             the terrace otherwise there was no change.



       (b)   It was not thought necessary to               sign    any exit       routes

             because:



             (i)    the     principle       ingress/egress       route would be that

                    already familiar to users, and

             (ii) radial fence gates would be manned by police or

                    stewards on the spot.



       (c)   The gates through the perimeter fence were considered to

             be    necessary,      this     being reflected by the request for

             two additional gates in the newly created pens.                     The use

             of    the gates was under the direct control of the police

             and was to allow their access into              the    terrace       should

             any    disturbance arise and to relieve any local build up

             of pressure at the front of the pens or allow any person

                            - 25 -
              becoming        ill     or    overcome to be removed by that route.

              The police, had always been happy that                           the        gates       were

              adequate for these purposes.



      (d)     It    was never considered that the gates in the perimeter

              fence would be used for the                   evacuation of each                   section

              because        (i)    the    risk       of    fire    in the west stand and

              terrace was low and (ii)                 it   was     considered                 that       the

              height        and     strength     of    walls       and     gates outside the

              Leppings Lane end. were such that the                        risk           of     a     door

              being     forced        or   the     walls      scaled       and        fans thereby

              entering in large numbers was remote.                       At         no        time       was

              there any suggestion to the contrary.



              If      any         situation       arose      that     necessitated                    total

              evacuation of the central pens this would in                                 the        first

              instance be by way of the normal route on to the terrace

              i.e. the tunnel.             Should the tunnel          be        obstructed                for

              any     reason,        the   gates       in the radial fences                     would be

              used as directed by the police with                        the     assistance                of

              the public address system.

      satisfactory providing                that      certain      gates        had        widths          a.a

      indicated        on     the     plan     attached to the letter and that the

      gates would be supervised by either police or club officials.

(Vi)     On the 2nd May, 1985, South Yorkshire County Council wrote to

         Eastwood and Partners                  indicating that the proposals outlined
                                                                                                       Ex 53
         for crowd        control         arrangements          were     generally      acceptable

         subject to          points a - d set out in the Officer Working Party

         minutes dated 18th April, 1985, and (v) above.



(vii)    On the    8 th   may, 1985,            Eastwood and Partners wrote to South

         Yorkshire County Council                  acknowledging the comments of the

         Officer       Working            Party      but        requesting       that       further
                                                                                                       Ex 54
         consideration be given to the requirement for the second gate

         in the two radial fences since if they were meant for use                                in

         an     emergency it would mean having a steward in attendance on

         each    occasion,          the        expense     of    which    would        hardly    be

         justified.



(viii)   On     10th   May, 1985,              South Yorkshire County Council wrote to

         Eastwood and Partners                  indicating       that    the    two      additional    Ex 55

         gates     were       included         primarily at the request of the police

         who had indicated that they                 were       prepared        to    concede    the

         request       for    the        two     additional gates subject to all other

         points raised by the Officer Working Party being incorporated

         into the proposals.

         Yorkshire        County         Council)        had    been     made    aware     of    the

         application          for    Building        Regulation/planning              approval    in

         respect of the re-organisation of fences at the Leppings Lane

        On     the     19th July, 1985, Stn.O Ryder noted                    that plans which

        had been submitted to Sheffield                     City    Council      for       Building        Ex 57

        Regulation approval were different to those discussed between

        the club and the Fire Service.



(xi)    On the 25th July, 1985, Eastwood and Partners wrote to                                  South      Ex 5£

        Yorkshire        County       Council     enclosing         copies      of drawings in

        respect of segregation of               visiting           spectators       at    Leppings

        Lane     end,        these being further to the preliminary submission

        in April, 1985.             Amongst these drawings            is     Plan       No.6705/8A         Ex 5S

        which     showed       a revised layout and which abandoned the means

        whereby separate turnstiles would be used for each sector                                    of

        the     terrace.       The proposed new wall between turnstile 17 and

        the rear of the west stand was shown as                       having        a    door        for

        personnel        access       described       on Plan No. 6705/14A as being a                      Ex 6 1

        timber door being 838 x 841 x 44mm.                    Plan No. 6705/17                showed

        the proposed new pen arrangements for the west terrace. Under

        this arrangement, spectators would gain access to pens 1 -                                     4

        inclusive        from turnstiles 1 7 - 2 3 now A - G and to pens 5,                            6


        & 7 from turnstiles 9 - 1 3 .



(xii)   A meeting of the Officer Working Party was held on 29th July,

        1985    to      discuss      the   detailed plans submitted to the South

        Yorkshire County Council on                  25th    July,      1985.           Subject      to

        certain      points       detailed      in    the minutes the proposals were

        considered to be acceptable.                  Item (i) made reference to                     the

        need     for     a    new    perimeter        fence gate now marked No.3                     for

        security access and emergency egress purposes.                           Item          (j)    of

        the     points        required     that       all    the      new    gates        be     fully

        supervised by stewards who must be                     fit,     able     and       properly

        trained.

                               - 28 -
         Also       at    this     meeting,        at item (h), reference is made to a

         proposal to have either               a    pitch    perimeter      fence        gate    or

         radial       barrier(s)         at   the front corner of the Spion Kop "to

         overcome possible lateral crushing hazard when                         large      crowds

         are present” "in view of experiences last year"



(xiii)   On     1st      August,     1985,    Eastwood and Partners wrote to South                    Ex 6;

         Yorkshire County Council acknowledging the                       comments        of    the

         Officer         Working Party meeting of 29th July, 1985 Dr Eastwood                         Ex 62

         asked for further clarification of the location of a proposed

         extra security gate, claiming that an existing gate in the                              2m


         wide gap could be used by police and would still be available

         for     use for spectators in emergency as there were gates into

         the   2m    gap from the terrace which would be under the                        control

         of    the       police.     With respect to the provision of stewarding

         for all the new gates, (item                 (j)/   of    the     minutes        of    the

         29th July,         1985).       Dr Eastwood commented that this would no

         doubt be taken care of by the club.



(xiv)    A    meeting       of     the   Officer      Working     Party     and         Sheffield     Ex 6;

         Wednesday         Football Club was held on 7th August 1985 to carry

         out the "summer" inspection and in                  particular         to      view    the

         Leppings Lane end improvements.                  The matter for clarification

         dealt with in the letter at (xiii) above was investigated and

         it    was       noted     that there was an existing gate in the new                    2m


         wide gap for use by the police.                  Again    it    was      stated       that

         these        gates      would    still      be   available       for     the    use     of

         spectators in an emergency as the gates at                       the     top    of     the

         terrace         under     the control of police would enable spectators



                                 - 29 -
to be directed down the       2m   wide gap, although it       was        agreed

that steps or a longer gate would be required.



Also     at this meeting, the club agreed to provide a new pitch

perimeter fence gate at the Spion Kop end             (as    discussed        at

the meeting of the 29th       July, 1985 - see 2.12(xii) above).

There    were already four existing pitch perimeter fence gates

at the Spion Kop end.       Unlike the gates in the fence             at    the

Leppings     Lane end, it was contemplated that these gates (and

other exits) would be used in the event of the whole                 terrace

having     to be evacuated, and these gates were included in the

calculation of evacuation time from the Spion Kop.



A meeting of the Officer       Working     Party     was    held     on     22nd

January,     1986,    to   discuss     further   development       proposals

involving the Kop and to carry out the "winter" inspection of

the stadium.



The      police      representatives     confirmed    that    the     revised

segregation arrangements to the rear of the west stand worked

well on the majority of occasions.
3.    History: After local government re-organisation



3.1   At     a    meeting          at     the    Hillsborough ground in the summer of 1986 (not

      minuted) attended by the police, the local authority (Mr                                    Bownes),      the

      Building          Surveyor, the Fire Service (Mr Grimshaw) and Dr Eastwood, the

      police asked that consideration be given to the removal of the southern

      half       of     the       crush     barrier immediately in front of the tunnel by the

      Officer Working Party.                    The matter was discussed and approval given                      to

      the removal of all but the northern third of that barrier.



3.2   A    Home       Office Circular (75/1986) was sent to the Fire Service on 29th                                   Ex 66

      October, 1986 enclosing a copy of the re—issued Green Guide.




3.3   A letter dated 3rd November, 1986, was received from Sheffield City
                                                                                                                       Ex 67
      Council asking for Fire Service Comments in writing as to the condition

      of   the         stadium      under       the       1975    Act.         It asked for any outstanding

      matters requiring attention to be detailed.



3.4   An inspection of the                  Hillsborough          ground       was   carried      out     on    17th

      November, 1986.




3.5   On     18fch      February,           1987,     a    letter       was     sent by the Fire Service to
                                                                                                                       Ex 68
      Sheffield City Council in response to their                                letter     of   3rd    November,

      1986.           This    was       a    comprehensive          letter       covering matters that were

      considered             as    requiring        attention           throughout        the    rstadium.        In

      particular             it   was       recommended          that     a    satisfactory security device

      easily openable from                   the    pitch        side     be    found     and    fitted    to    all

      perimeter fence gates.



                                                   - 31 -
3.6   A     meeting   of     the Advisory Group was held on the 10th March, 1987, in

      order to discuss the contents of the Fire                     Service    letter     dated     18th    Ex 10
                                                                                                            Ex 68
      February, 1987 (and Sheffield City Council's proposals for divisions of

      responsibility between the various bodies on the Officer Working                            Group

      (see 1.14 above).



      With regard to the letter of 18th February 1987, it was agreed that the

      contents should be taken up with the club. Stewarding and the                          securing

      of all gates was discussed and the Fire Service indicated that existing

      arrangements were only acceptable subject to exits being stewarded                             and

      unlocked      for     the whole of any period that the ground was in use for a

      designated purpose.



      The Fire Service also pointed out that the new                    guide    now     included      a

      section      which     defines        in    detail, management responsibility.              It was

      recommended by the Fire Service that the club certificate specify as                             a

      condition that this section be complied with.



3.7   On    28th   March,      1987,        a    copy    of a draft letter from Sheffield City
                                                                                                            Ex 69
      Council to Sheffield Wednesday Football Club dated 19th March, 1987 was
                                                                                                            Ex 70
      received by the Fire Service for their comments.



      The    letter       referred     to       the     fact   that the police, Fire Service and

      Building Surveyor had been asked to comment on                     the    condition     of     the*

      stadium having regard to the provisions of the 1975 Act.                          At that time,

      no comments had been received from the Building Surveyor and the police

      had    indicated       that    they        were     quite   satisfied with the stadium and

      indicated that the degree of co-operation that they received                          was     vary

      satisfactory.




                                            - 32 -
      The     letter          then       pointed     out     that    the Fire Service had a number of

      comments to make and these were to be                          attached        in    the     form        of    the

      letter        of       18th     February.        It did not however include further points

      that had been discussed at the Officer Working Party                                  meeting           held    on

      10th March.




      Following          a     telephone        conversation with Mr David Bownes to point out

      this omission, a copy of the                     letter,       annotated       with        the     additional

                                                                                                                 Ex 77

     Sports     Grounds         -    1986   edition     and   the Club Secretary, Mr Mackrell

     indicated that his duties encompassed those of the Safety                           Officer           and

     that he was responsible for all matters of safety within the ground.

     letter from Sheffield City Council of 22nd April, 1987, which                                enclosed

                                            - 35 -
3.17 A     letter from      Sheffield City            Council dated       8 th      February, 1988, was

     received.        The letter enclosed copies of a letter dated                          3rd    February,

     1988,       received      from Eastwood and Partners that had been sent in reply                             Ex 79
                                                                                                                  Ex 80
     to the Fire Service           letter     of     18th     February,        1987.        David        Bownes

     expressed        concern     at   the    apparent        criticism        of     the    Fire Service

     contained in the letter from Eastwood and Partners and                                suggested       that

     the Fire Service respond directly to them.



     The     letter     from     Eastwood     and    Partners      dealt with the Fire Service

     letter item by item and in general most of the matters had already been

     dealt    with     or were agreed upon although there were still some matters

     that required attention, some of them to be dealt with when                                  the     south

     stand    was refurbished in 1991.              The concluding paragraph of the letter

     indicated that the club was concerned that with each new member of                                    the

     Fire        Service    to     the      Officer    Working      Party,          new     or     different

     recommendations were being put                 forward    which      in        some    cases       openly

     contradicted the recommendations offered by                    predecessors.



3.18 On     29th    March, 1988,       a     letter was sent to Eastwood and Partners in

     reply to their         criticism of the Pire Service.                                                        Ex 8j



3.19 By    letterdated 29th March, 1988,             the police informed the Fire                       Service

     of    the     parking and     travelling         arrangements made for the FA Cup semi

     final on 9th April, 1988.                                                                                    Ex 8;



3.20 At the 1988 semi final, two fire officers carried out an inspection                                     of

    the      ground    and made a note of their findings.                 They toured the ground
                                                                                                                  Ex 8;
     and checked all final exits, finding stewards and police                                in    position.

    Emergency           lighting       and      firefighting        equipment               all     appeared

     satisfactory.         The PA system was also audible              throughout            the        ground.



                                           - 36 -
        However,         it   was    noted     that   a   number of        stewards    were without

        identification and no log book                    was kept.



3.21 On 19th May, 1988, a further inspection was carried out at                          the    ground

     by     the    Fire       Service and theobservations ofthe officer who                   attended      Ex 84

     were set out in a letter dated 25th May, 1988 which                       was     sent to       the

        local authority.



3.22 On     9th August, 1988, ADO Rowlands attended the meeting (referred to at

     Tab.15 of Volume 1 of the South Yorkshire Police documents)                            which    was

     called        by     the    police      to   discuss   the     operational       attendance      at

     Hillsborough Football Ground during the                     coming    season.    ADO     Rowlands

        stressed    that        it   was   essential      that    the    Fire Service received an

        accurate indication of the exact location of an incident                       and    what    it

    was.



3.23 By     letter dated 30th March, 1989, the police informed the Fire Service

     of the parking and travelling arrangements made for                       the     FA     Cup    semi   Ex 85

        final on 15th April, 1989.



3.24 On     3rd April, 1989, a letter dated 30th march, 1989, was received from

        Sheffield City Council enclosing a draft                  copy    of   the    final     revised     Ex 86

        Safety Certificate Conditions which as far as possible incorporated the

        comments made in the Fire Service's letter to                     Sheffield    City     Covincil

        dated     13th    August,      1987.      The letter listed four points for further

        consideration.

 SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUHDS ACT 1975



 NOT3 3Y THE HOME OFFICE




BACKGROUND

1.      The purpose of the Act is to implement the main recommendations
contained in tha Report of the Inquiry into Crowd Safety at Sports Grounds
(Cinnd 4952: 1972). This report was prepared by Lord Viheatley who undertook
nis inquiry, at the then Government's reauest, following the tragedy at
Porox Park xootball ground in January 1971 when 6 6 people died and over
140 were injured.

WHSATLET REPORT
2.   Lord Wheatley had no doubt that present controls over safety at
football grounds were inadequate.   He found that the existing voluntary
system of certification of grounds introduced by the Football Association
some years ago laid down no requirements as to the competence of persons
who carry out the annual inspections of grounds and there were no guidelines
to assist those persons in their assessment of safety standards. Moreover,
a review of the statutory provisions relevant to the safety of spectators
at football grounds convinced Lord Wheatley that the law also fell short of
providing proper and effective control over football grounds as a whole.
The building regulations, for example, provide for the basic structural
safety of new buildings within p- football ground but they do not a'cply to
existing buildings, except where alterations are to be carried out, nor
do they apply to a ground as a whole.   In any case, most football grounds
were built before national building regulations were introduced.

3.   Lord Uheatlsy concluded that only a specially devised statutory scheme
could ensure comprehensive controls at football grounds in the interests
of safety. He recommended a statutory licensing control administered by
the "top tier" of local authorities.   He proposed that these controls should
be introduced by stages, the larger or more important grounds, broadly
speaking, being dealt with first. Lord wheatley also recommended that there
should be a riarht of appeal for the clubs concerned against any decision
of the licensing authority. 7/hat is quite clear throughout the report is
Lord V/heatlsy's awareness of the need to reconcile the paramount aim of
ensuring the safety of spectators with what would be reasonable and
practicable for the clubs.

4 . Lord Ivlaeatley also provided, as a technical appendix to his report,
guidelines to safety standards at football grounds designed to assist the
local authorities in their task of enforcement.

CONSULTATIONS Oi; TH3 R3P0RT

5.   When the Report was published, those bodies mainly concerned, including
the local authority associations and the football authorities, were
consulted about Lord l/heatley's proposals. The football authorities made
it clear that they were apprehensive at the financial implications for the
 clubs, but there was general agreement with the proposals themselves.
 Detailed consultations were held on the guidelines contained in the
 technical appendix to the Report and these, duly amended, were finally
 published by the Home Departments in November 1973 as a special booklet,
 "Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds".

 GUIDE TO kjAF3TY AT SPORTS GROUNDS

6.   The Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds has no statutory force.   Its
primary purpose is to set out principles or guidelines which the local
authorities will no doubt wish to keep in mind in enforcing the Act.
The Guide therefore deals with matters such as the provision of adequate
entrances and exits, means of escape, the slope of terracing, the
strength and siting of crush barriers, the construction of staircases,
and measures to ensure the safe movement of spectators both under normal
and emergency conditions. The Guide is not a set of requirements to
be rigidly applied, regardless of individual circumstances. As
Lord Wheatley recognised, it is important to maintain the maximum
flexibility in any system of control so as to take account of the
differing circumstances at individual grounds: factors such as age,
size and mode of construction differ widely from ground to ground.

7.   Vfiaile the basic principles set out in the Guide are relevant to
all sports stadia, modifications may well be necessary where sports
other than football are involved. The3 e will be discussed with the
appropriate authorities at the time. A copy of the Guide is attached.

THE GENERAL APPROACH TO THE ACT

8 .  Lo rd n'hoatlsy records0 *>d       0 ■?r » f ^            c,y3 'fccni c£
control should be phased so that the more important grounds, regularly
attracting the larger attendances, should be dealt with first. It is
intended, accordingly, that only those grounds consistent with
Lord '.Vhaatley's category 1 should be dealt with first, that is to say,
the international grounds, the English First and Second Division and
the Scottish Premier Division Clubs, about 60 in all. But the full
system of control under the Act will not apply to Lord Wheatley's
category 4, namely, grounds with accommodation for fewer than 10,000
spectators. The intention is that safety at these grounds should be
secured largely by voluntary action on the part of the club concerned in
consultation with the local authority.

9.   The main instrument of control under the Act is the safety
certificate issued by the local authority. A safety certificate will
be needed in respect of every stadium which is the subject of a
designation order made by the Secretary of State. Tho certificate will
enable the local authority to impose such terms and conditions as are
necessary to ensure a reasonable standard of safety at the ground in
question having regard to the circumstances.

10. Tho Act has been designed with football stadia chiefly in view.
But other stadia, if necessary, can be brought within the system of
local authority control as well as places such as racecourses where
large numbers cf spectators may be crowded together in stands. Nothing
will be dons, however, without full and prior consultation with those
concerned.
JU3STA2IC3 OF T 3 2 ACT

11.   Ths first 5 sections establish the main system of control under
the Act, that is to say, the safety certificate, issued by the local
authority, which will be required for every sports stadium designated
for that purpose by order of the Secretary of State.

12. Section 1 empowers the Secretary of State by order to designate
any sports stadium having accommodation for more than 10,COO spectators
as requiring a safety certificate. A safety certificate is issued by
the local authority for the area in which the stadium is situated, that
is to say, the county council in England and n'ales and the appropriate
regional authority in Scotland.   Safety certificates are to be of two
kinds, general and special.    A general safety certificate will be the
main continuing form of control and will be issued for an indefinite
period in respect of a specified activity or activities regularly
taking place at the stadium. A special safety certificate may be issued
at the discretion of the local authority for a special event or other
circumstances not covered by the general safety certificate. Such an
event might be an evangelistic rally which might call for special
arrangements if, for example, seating were provided for the congregation
on the playing area. A special safety certificate can be issued only in
rcsgect cf a sports stadium for which a general safety certificate is alrea<
in 10 IMS •                                     .
13.    The contents of safety certificates are dealt with in section 2.
The local authority is empowered to include in the certificate 3uch
terms and conditions as are necessary to secure, at the stadium in
question, a reasonable degree of safety. Without prejudice to this
general power, the section requires certificates to contain terns and
conditions relating to major matters such as entrances and exits, means
of escape in an emergency, the number, strength and situation of crush
Garners, and tno maximum number of spectators who may be admi-tsd. tc
the stadium or any part of it. To remove any possibility of doubt,
sub-section (3 ) makes it clear that a certificate may include a
condition relating to the keeping of records relating to attendance and
the maintenance of safety.

14.   In imposing conditions, local authorities will dcuotlcss follow
the urineiples set out in the Guide to Safety at dports Grounds, although
as already explained, this document has no statutory force. It is
envisaged that there will be a good deal of consultation between the
local authority and the club, as well as the building authority, the
police and tr.e fire service, in the process of drawing up the certificate
conditions. F o r example, if a ground is rarely filled to capacity,
the local authority is free in such a c&se to base its requirements on
actual levels of attendance over a given period rather tnan maximum
capacity.  On the rare occasions a capacity crowd was expected, the
procedure of th« special safety certificate could be invoked so that
more than the normal permitted number cf spectators might be admitted
subject to          additional safeguards such as more attendants,
admission by -.icket only and so on. Again, if a stand were found to be
structurally     k, the local authority might restrict admission to it
until it had be-n strengthened. But the club wculd nave tne cnoico
whether to have the necessary remedial works carried out, so that the
restriction could be removed, or to accept the restriction indefinitely.

15.   The earlier Bill, which was introduced in 1973, limited the terms
and conditions imposed under a safety certificate to what was necessary
to secure a reasonajlg degree of safety for memoers of die public.



                                 3
There '.'as some difficulty over this tera because it might have excluded,
for example, members of supporters' clubs. This particular problem
has been met by the definition of "spectator" in section 17, that is
to say, any person occupying accommodation provided for spectators.
On the other hand, it seems right that all the people present on the
occasion of a match or other activity for which a ground has a
certificate should be taken into account for the purposes of the
safety certificate, for example, people using a squash court or other
facilities at the ground. Accordingly, the general power of the
local authority under section 2 ( 1 ) to include in a safety certificate
such terms or conditions as are necessary omits any reference to
people and speaks only of securing "reasonable safety at the stadium",
(although the term "safety", as defined in section 1 7 , does not include
danger arising from participation in a sport). Certain provisions
must, however, be specifically linked with spectators (who are, after
all, the people the Act is mainly designed to protect and who will be
greatly in the majority). Thus section 2(2) requires the certificate
to state the maximum number of spectators who may be admitted, and it
is a serious offence, under section 1 2 (l) (a) or (c) for spectators to
be admitted to a designated stadium where no safety certificate is in
operation.

16.   Section 3 sets out the broad procedure to befollowed when a
local authority receives an application for a safety certificate. It
requires then tc determine whether an applicant is, in their opinion,
a qualified person, that is to say, a person likely to be in a
position to prevent contravention cf the terms and conditions imposed
in the certificate. If so, they are then under a duty to issue a
general safety certificate to him. In this respect, the general safety
certificate is different from the fire certificate issued ur.de- the
Fire Precautions Act 1971* The latter is issued only after necessary
safety works have been completed. The safety certificate under this
Act will be issued almost from the cutset and will be an instrument
of continuing control. The issue of a special safety certificate,
however, is left to the discretion of the local authority, as already
explained, because cnly they can judge whether it is appropriate to
issue it for the special occasion in question.

17.   The local authority are required to send a copy of any
application for a certificate to the police and to the building
authority, and must consult them about the terms and conditions to be
included ir. the certificate. The need for such consultation is self-
evident:    there must be close cc-ordination of the interests of the
different authorities directly concerned with different aspects of
safety at football grounds*

18.    Section 4 provides for the amendment, replacement, transfer,
'surrender and cancellation of safety certificates.  It is of primary
importance that a local authority should have power to amend a safety
certificate where it appears appropriate for them tc do so, for example,
if they find in the course of a routine inspection that a part of a
ground has become so dangerous as to demand an immediate restriction on
 its use or some other necessary safeguard. Again, they must have
power to relax a requirement where, for example, certain improvements
have been carried out to make this possible.

19.   Section 5 provides for appeals by ir.terestea parties against
decisions cr requirements of the local authority in connection with
safety certificates* Appeals will lie to the Secretary of State®     In
this respect, there is a departure from Lord V/heatley's proposal that


                                  4
appeals should be heard by a specially constituted tribunal. But apart
from the need to avoid creating more special tribunals than necessary,
most appeals are likely to be on technical matters and it therefore
seems appropriate for appeals in this case to be made to a Minister.
But the Secretary of State will have power to set up a formal inquiry
along the lines recommended by Lord Wheatley, should the need arise.

20.   Section 6 (2 ) empowers the Secretaiy of State to make regulations
relating tc the safety of spectators at sports grounds. This is in
the nature of a reserve power which could be used, for example, to
give backing to requirements of the local authorities which in the
light of experience had been shown always to be essential. This
section also empowers the Secretary of State to make regulations for
various other purposes connected with the Act.

21.   Section 7 provides for seme supplementary matters on determination:
and appeals, Sub-sections (1 ) and (2; provide for the deemed with­
drawal cf an application for, or the surrender of, a safety certificate
when a local authority determines that a person is not, or has ceased
to be, qualified to hold it. The section also provides for the
suspension of a condition in a certificate pending determination of an
appeal against the inclusion of that condition, although a court, on
the application of the local authority, may order that such a condition
remain in force pending the determination of the appeal.

22.    The holder of a general safety certificate is required by
section 8 to notify the local authority of any proposed alteration or
extension of a stadium.   The purpose of the clause is to guard agair.st
any alterations being made, without the local authority's knowledge,
which, might affect the safety of spectators;

2J.   Section 9 provides for the harmonisation of the Act with other
legislation which may affect sports stadia.

24.    Secticn 1C is an important emergency power. Should a magistrates'
court, on the application of a local authority, consider that the risk
to spectators at any sports ground is so great that their admission
should be prohibited or restricted until remedial action has been
taken,   the court may make an order accordingly. This power applies
to any sports ground whether or not it is required to have a safety
certificate.    In practice, it is not expected that the power will
often need to be exercised.    In the case of a small football stadium,
for exaEpl';, not subject to the designation order procedure,
consultation:; between the local authority and the club concerned are
oxpscted tc S 3 cure the prevision of a reasonable standard of safety on
a voluntary basis.

25• Section 11 confers rights of entry and inspection on persons
appointed by the local authority and others involved in the task cf
ensuring crowd safety at sports grounds. Section 12 deals with offenccs
and penalties.

26.   Section 13 deals mainly with civil liability.  Its purpose is to
make clear that while nothing in the Act itself confers a right of
action in respect cf a contravention of regulations or of conditions
in a safety certificate, the existing rights of a spectator injured
at a football stadium to bring an action for negligence against the
occupiers is entirely unaffected by anything in the Act.




                             5
27.    The Secretary of State is empowered by secticn 1 5 to extend to
clashes cf sports grounds other than sports stadia such provisions of the
Act as are not already expressed to apply to them. For example, it
enables the Secretary of State by order to extend the safety certificate
procedure to such places as race-courses. Cnly a class of sports ground
may be the subject of an extension order tinder this clause: an individual
sports ground (other than a stadium) cannot be designated until secticn 1
of the Act has been applied by an order under section 15 to the class of
sports ground to which it belongs.

28„   Section 16 applies the Act, subject to necessary modifications,
to the Crown. Secticn 17 deals with interpretation.

29.   Section 18 provides that orders and regulations except commencement
orders, made under the Act are subject to the negative resolution
procedure.  It also imposes a duty on the Secretary of State, before making
any orders or regulations, except commencement orders or orders relating
to the Isles of Scilly, to consult with such persons as appear to him
requisite.

 1, The intention was expressed, in Horns Office Circular No„ 150/1975 of issuing, in

 under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 &s requiring a safety certificate.' As

 and rugby union, football grounds and those of the clubs in the firct division, of tno

 in dealing with applications for general siifety certificates is set out in the a;_u
 to this circular*

 ho  It is not proposed at this stage to issue guidance as to the procedure to be
 followed in connection with the grant of special es.iety certijicatos, since, uud^r

 certificates are in operation,. Further guidance for this purpose \/ill accordingly be

     1.   The Regulat5.oii3 provide that any application for a safety certificate shall be
     nado in tha form contained in the Schedule to tha Xegulationo or a xorra to the liics
     effect. CopicG of the form are being cadc available to potentxal appliconfca- ana tney
     are being edvissd of ths need to provide sash information in suppoi-r of thej..r applica­
     tion acs will onabla tho local authority to discharge ita fmictions under the Ac'c.^ In
     particular, the application should bo accor.panicd by detailed information aa to the
     structure, capacity, etc of the stadina, including plans of the ssada.ua, ccrtifxcnves
     relating to the testing of crush barriers and evidence of tho applicant*s status.     lc
     is however, open to a local authority, under section % k ) of the Act, to require,, by
     notice in writing. ouch further information of this kind as it may conoidor necessary
     to enable it to determine the terms and conditions to be included in the certificate.

       2 .   On receipt of aa application for a general safety certificate, the local autnoj.*j.t^
       must firct determine whether the applicant is a qualified person, ie a person liho .15
 (' 'to bo in a position to prevent contravention of the teres and ccndicxcns to be xr.moouu
' ~ \ i n the certificate * If it considers him to be (such a person the autlionvy is then _
  #      nder a duty to issue a general safety certificate to him. in the case ox a g ^ r a l
       safety certificate, where considerations of time arc not paramount, the regulaciens
       impose no specific tiiso liait for such a determination. In any event, xt
       fr.cic unlikely that an application for a general safety certificate v.-ou-d^ e      by
       en*"urqualified person. Shore is, however, a right of appeal against a
       by a local authority that an applicant is not. a qualified person (see porsgrapn      .

      5.      The local authority is required, by section 3(3) of the Act, to send a copy of
      anv application for a safety certificate (general or special) to ^ne apjnopi

   9.   After a certificate has been, granted, an application rr.uy be made for the tran;-;for
   of tho cortificate to another person. ' Similarly, while a local authority is considering
   an application fcr a ccrtif.icy.to find boiore the certificate hao boon granted, it in:;y bo
   asked to substitute coae person ether than the original applicant as the person to v-hou
   ths certificate should be granted. Those arc, however, likely to bo rare occurrences
   in tho c s .r u of general safety certificates, where an application will normally bo mado
   on behalf of a club or a stadium organisation by an authorised official of tho club
   or ret>recentat ivo c.f tho orga nisaticn.  flowaver, if it does happen, the local authority
   will be required in both canos to determine whether the substituted nominee iG a
   qualified parcon. Thereafter, in the first case, the procedure laid dow n i n tho
   regulations relating to giving noti.es 0 1 , and the reasons .cor, the determination \»ill
   apply together with any necessary appeals procedure.       In tho second case, there is no
   reason why tha local authority should not treat the application in all respects as a
   new application in the tersns of the original one and process it from the point it had
   already reached.

    10.   In addition to the right of appeal by an applicant for a general safety certificate
    against ths determination that he is not a qualified person (see paragraph 2 abov3 ),
  ( »hich, of course, applies also in the case of a proposed transfer of a certificate, the
/Ti'Act provides a further right cf appeal to any "interested party" (which t*-am includes
 '--■fce holder of ths safety certificate) against the inclusion of anything in or the
    ouiission of anything from a safety certificate cr against a refusal to amend or rcplacc
    a safety certificate. The regulations provide that, in the caso of a general safety
    certificate, notice of any such appeal shall be g?.ven within 2 d days following receipt,
    of a notice of the local authority's decision, or, in the c a s e of persons who are no<,
    notified, the publication by the local authority of its decision in a newspaper
   circulating in the locality.

    11. In this connection, Regulation 7 requires a local authority, on issuing or amending
    a safety certificate or refusing to do so, to give, notice to certain specified
     "intcraatcd parties" and elgo to advertise their action in ths press. _ It is regretted
     that it has been necessary to incur the trouble and expense of advertising, but, since
     Section 5(5) of tho Act is not specific in the definition which it provides of ^
     "interested nai-ty". no other means could be found of ensuring tnat ail parsons wno k iga
     validly claiu t o 'be "interested parties" within the meaning of the Act should^be able
     to acquaint themselves with the local authority’s decision, and failure t o u r i n g tho
     decision to their notice could result in a denial of their rights ox appeal or o. a
     h^arinc- by the Secretary of State.    Fcr the same reason a similar ooligation has b ^ e u ^

      THE GUIDE TO SAE2TY AT SPORTS GROUNDS

      AMENEffiNTS TO HUS GUIDE

      The Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds was published in 1973 and is "based on the •

      technical Appendix to Lord Wheatley's Report of'the Inquiry into Ground Safety

      at Sports Grounds.         Since its publication, its use on a voluntai’y basis has

      brought to notice the need for some amendments to be made to the guidelines

      when applied to football grounds.


      2.    During consideration of the Safety of Sports Grounds Bill, Ministers mentioned

      that if the provisions of the Act were applied to sports grounds other than

^ ^   football grounds, separate guides would be compiled for the different classes o±

      sports grounds.        The existing Guide will accordingly be revised and re-printed

      as the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (Football).                      The amendments which will

      be made for this purpose are, in the meantime, attached as an appendix to this


      note.


      3.    These amendments include a new chapter covering the r e c o g n i t i o n s of the

      Minister for Sport’s Working Party on Crowd Behaviour which was established in

      1974 to look.into means of combating hooliganism at football grounds.                      Matters

      of crowd control inevitably have a bearing on safety at sports grounds and it

      has accordingly been thought right to incorporate the Working Pa rty’s

       recommendations for the general convenience of clubs and other stadium authorities,



       4.   The main amendments in the attached list are as follows:

             a .   Exits-from each area of     s p e c t a t o r   ’accommodation should enable the

                   spectators to leave that area in-8 minutes or less.


             b.    Every spectator on the terrace should be within 12 metres o A a


                   gangway or exit*

              c.   Railings and fences dividing sections of the ground should be of

                   the same strength as handrails.


              d.   Depending on the condition of the individual stand, the time

                   specified for the evacuation may lie between the prescribed

                   ir.axin’.vr, and minimum.

                   "Recent research has indicated that when it takes more
                   than 7 minutes to vacate an area of spectator accommo­
                   dation the crowd flow tends to become turbulent. In
                   these conditions individuals can lose control over their
                   own movement and the rate of flow may be reduced.     It is
                   therefore suggested that the exits from each area of
                   spectator accommodation should be designed so that if

18.1   ■    Crowd movement on terraces should "be severely limited in
            order to give the Police the fullest opportunity for crowd
            control. Less problems occur whore the terraces are
            divided as f>r as possible into sections by the use o f ‘
            railings or barriers, both radial and lateraJ. Ideally,
            each section should be self-contained and should be
            sei-viccd by its own entrance/exits, refreshment facilities
           'and toilets, (see para. 7«7*)

18.2       "Horae" and visiting supporters should be segregated. It
            should not be possible for spectators to transfer from one
            end of the ground to the other.

18.3       Access to playing pitches must be made as difficult as
           possible in normal circumstances while,' at the same time,
           providing1 the Police with proper access to the terraces for
            the purposes of crov/d control and enabling the pitch to be
           used in the event of serious emergency* One alternative
           to fencing is the construction around the pitch of a wall
           v/ith a smooth surface which should be not less than 4 feet
           in height on the terrace side. This boundary wall should
           have gate 3 or access points to the pitch which could be
           manned by the Police or stewards. A walkway between the
           boundary wall and the terraces, which would be solely
           occupied by Police, First Aid and official club personnel,
           has beon found to be effective as regards gaiety and
            security. In order to achieve this, it wight be necessary
            to remove one or two rows of terracing and to protect the
           walkway from the terrace by a continuous line of barriers,
            go designed as to discourage access to the walkway excop'c
            at authorised points.   The access points from terrace to
           walkway should be reasonably near the access points Iron
           walkway to the pitch,    (see para 7• 10). Where a walkway
            system is in use, sliding gates may be installed at the
            access points from the walkway to the pitch, ie where there
            con be no crowd pressure against them, (see para 6.14 -2
            regarding use of sliding gates elsewhere). A barrier to
            the pitch is unnecessary where seating extends to the level
            of the- playing area.

18.4       Clubs should carefully consider their arrangements for the
            sale of alcohol. In any case all refreshments should be
            served in plastic containers.

1 8 .5 '    Home clubs should consider, in conjunction with the Police,
            each of the matches and determine which should be all-ticket,
            and the allocation of tickets to the visiting club.   So far
            jo the terrace's are concerned, any allocation should have
            regard to the manner in which the terraces are divided co
            that policing arrangements can be effective.

18.6       The home club should, as a general rule, make it their
             policy not to issue tickets for announced all-ticket matches
             to away supporters on the day of the game. However, the
             local Police will be best able to assess the situation c-r.d
           ' their advice should be followed, but it is important where-
             cver possible to discourage 'supporters from travelling to
             all-ticket matches without tickets.

 HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR NO 7/1986

 SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975: LOCAL GOVERNMENT ACT 1985

 Introduction

 1.  HOC 54/85 and 5/1986 were copied to Chief Executives
 Metropolitan District Councils and London Boroughs in view of the
 forthcoming transfer to them of responsibility in the Metropolitan
 counties and Greater London for the administration of the Safety of
 Sports Grounds Act 1975 (SSGA).  The purpose of this circular is to
 advise successor authorities of the changes to the SSGA brought
 about by the Local Government Act 1985 (LGA) and to give guidance
 on discharging these responsibilities.  It is not intended to affe
 any internal or locally agreed arrangements which may be in train to
 ensure that all those who have an interest in securing safety at
 sports grounds are fully consulted.

  SSGA 1975
  2   The SSGA gave effect to the main recommendations contained in
  the Report of the Inquiry into Crowd Safety at Sports Grounds whic
  was prepared by Lord Wheatley following the serious accident at
  Ibrox Park Football Ground in 1971..

   3.       The main provisions of the Act are:

            a.  A power, exercisable by the Secretary of State, to
            designate sports stadia with a capacity for more than
            10,000 spectators. Once designated, a stadium will require
            a safety certificate from the local authority.

             b.  An obligation on the local authority to issue such
             certificates .
       c.  A discretion for the local authority to set terms
       and conditions under the certificate with the object
       of securing a reasonable degree of safety for spectators.
       Safety certificates are of 2 kinds - firstly, the general
       safety certificate (the main form of control) and,
       secondly, the special safety certificate (for occasions
       or activities not covered by the general certificate).

       d.  A right of appeal to the Secretary of State, in
       relation to the issue of safety certificates and their
       contents, the procedure for which is set out in
       regulations made under s.6(1) of the Act.

       e.  Rights of various interested bodies (police, building
       authorities or, in the Metropolitan county areas after
       "abolition", fire authorities) to consultation, access to
       grounds and information and to the appeals procedure.

       f.    An emergency procedure for                 restricting the admission           (
       of spectators to a wider range                   of sports grounds than
       those to which the designation                   provisions apply, if the
       risk to spectators is seen (by                   the courts) as justifying
       this.

       g.  Powers of entry and inspection to sports grounds;
       and prescribed penalties for offences under the Act.

A sports ground is, broadly speaking, any place where sports or
other competitive activities take place in the open air and where
accommodation has been provided for spectators.   A sports stadium is
a sports ground where   accommodation for   spectators wholly or-
substantially surrounds the area used for the activities taking
place therein.

LGA 1985

4. The combined effect' of s.16 and Schedule 8 paragraph 7 of the
LGA is totransfer to Metropolitan District Councils and London        '
Boroughs the functions, duties and powers as the local authority
responsible for administering the SSGA in place of the Metropolitan
County Councils and Greater London Council.   A summary check list of
these responsibilities is contained at Annex A for ease of reference.

5.  Paragraph 7(3) of            Schedule 8 of the               LGA redefines "local
authority" in England            and Wales for the               purposes of the SSGA as
meaning:

       a . , i n G r e a t e r L o n d o n , t h e London B o r o u g h C o u n c i l o r
       t h e Common C o u n c i l o f t h e C i t y o f London;

       b.     in England, in         the M etropolitan          counties,       the
       d is t r ic t council;

       c.    i n E n g l a n d o u t s i d e G r e a t e r London and t h e
       M e tr o p o lita n c o u n t i e s , or in Wales, the county c o u n c i l

6.  In order to avoid any anomaly or duplication arising out of the
Metropolitan District Councils' and London Boroughs' responsibilities
E.R
*     as "Building Authority", paragraph 7(2) of Schedule 8 of the LGA
      redefines, for the purposes of the SSGA, "building authority" in
      England and Wales as meaning:

                a.   i n E n g l a n d , o u t s i d e G r e a t e r London, and t h e
                M etro p o lita n c o u n t i e s , or in Wales, the d i s t r i c t
                council.

      The effect of this, together with amendments to Sections 3(3) > 4(7)
      and (8), 5(5), 10(4) and 11 of the SSGA resulting from paragraph 7(1)
      of Schedule 8 of the LGA, is that in Metropolitan counties and
      Greater London, where the "building authority" and "local authority
       are synonymous, the local authority is not required to refer safety
       certificate applications to the building authority or consult it
       about the terms and conditions of a certificate.  Similarly the
       building authority in these areas does not have the status of
       "interested party" and has no need of the right to authorise entry
-     and inspection ofa sports   ground because these powers are vested in
       it as the local authority.

       T ransitional       Arrangements
       8.  Under article 2 of the Local Government Reorganisation (Transitional
^     Provisions) Order      1985 (SI 1985 No 1781), London Borough Councils and
       Metropolitan District Councils will acquire certain anticipatory powers,
 %     including powers in respect of safety certificates for sports grounds.
       The provisions of SI 1985/1781 were explained in DOE circular LGA(L)
       (DOE) 13/LGA(M C )(D O E )16 of 26 November 1985. The Secretary of State
       takes the view that Metropolitan County Councils and the GLC are not
       empowered to issue new safety certificates or amend existing safety
       certificates to take effect on or after 1 April 1986: SI 1985/1781
       therefore allows successor authorities to consider, before 1 April,
       applications for certificates to come into effect on or after 1 April.
       Successor authorities will therefore wish to ensure that they are kept
       informed of the progress of safety certificate applications or amend­
       ments to existing certificates now under consideration by the Metro­
       politan County Councils or GLC. Much of this information will auto­
       matically have come to successor authorities in their present role as
       building authorities but they may nonetheless wish to establish
       early contact with the current 'certificating' authority to ensure a
       smooth transfer of responsibility from 1 April 1986 without impairing
       the safety cover afforded by the certification process. In this
       context successor authorities will no doubt wish to bear in mind
       that applications for special safety certificates for events on or
       after 1 April 1986 may require advance consideration if a certificate
       is to be issued in time. Similarly, successor authorities will doubtless
       wish to .be acquainted with any other action or initiatives currently
       in hand by the present certificating authority in respect of sports
       grounds in their area.
Guidance to the SSGA procedures

 9.  A copy of the SSGA and the Regulations (Statutory Instrument
-1263 1976) are enclosed with this circular.   A detailed description
 of the Act and its provisions is contained at Annex B.  The Regu­
 lations set out the procedures and time limits associated with
 safety certificate applications and appeals.   These same regulations
 also empower local authorities to determine fees in respect of
 applications for the issue or amendment of safety certificates. A
 guide to the procedure for the issue of a general safety certificate
 is at Annex C.  Similarly, the procedure for the issue of a special
 safety certificate is at Annex D.

10.  The following points are highlighted as being of particular
potential interest to local authorities:

       a.   Procedure under s . 10. Paragraph 21 of Annex B refers.
       Authorities may wish to note that this procedure can be
       applied to all sports grounds within the meaning of the Act,
       not just to stadia.    It is hoped that authorities will not
       feel inhibited from invoking the procedure, as necessary,
A      where they perceive the risks to be such that urgent action
       is required to provide reasonable safety for spectators.

        b.  The Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (Football) (The
        Green Guide).  Attention is drawn to paragraphs 5 and 6 of
        Annex B and paragraph 3 of Annex C.  Authorities will no
        doubt bear in mind the contents of paragraph 4 of HOC 54/1985
        dealing with action on the Interim Report of the Inquiry
        contains additional recommendations on the content and
        structuring of the Green Guide which will be revised as soon
        as possible.  In the meantime the existing guide, a copy of
        which is enclosed, may be used until such time as the revised
        version is available.

 Inquiry into Crowd Safety and Control at Sports Grounds

  11.     The Final Report of Mr Justice Popplewell's Committee of Inquiry
 into Crowd Safety and Control at Sports Grounds was published on
  16 January 1986 (Command 9710).     A separate Home Office circular,
^ U m b e r 5/1986, was sent to local authorities - including Metropolitan
 District Councils and London Borough Councils - on 20 January 1986,
 giving details of the Government’s response to the safety recommend­
 ations contained in the Report, and next steps.

    Other

 12.  A list of designated stadia for England and Wales is attached at
 Annex E. Management of those stadia in Metropolitan counties and
 Greater London have been informed of the change in responsibility for
 administration of the SSGA and have been advised to copy applications
 for special safety certificates or amendments to existing general
 certificates to successor authorities (see Annex F).

    13* This circular is copied to Chief Executives of County Councils,
     Secretaries of the successor authority coordinating committees, and
     to Chief Fire Officers for information.  Paragraph 10 is of
     particular relevance.

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

Background

Wheatley Report

1.   The terms of the Inquiry extended to sports grounds generally but because the
immediate concern at the time related to soccer grounds, its Report concentrated
on crowd safety in such grounds, and included Rugby Union and Rugby League grounds.
Lord Wheatley had no doubt, that the then existing controls over safety at
football grounds were inadequate.    He found that the voluntary system of certifi­
cation of grounds introduced by the Football Association some years previously laid
down no requirements as to the competence of persons who carried out the annual
inspections of grounds and there were no guidelines to assist those persons in
their assessment of safety standards.    Moreover, a review of the statutory provisions
relevant to the safety of spectators at football grounds convinced Lord Wheatley
that the law also fell short of providing proper and effective control over
football grounds as a whole.     The building regulations, for example, provide for
the basic structural safety of new buildings within a football ground but they do
                                                                not apply to existing

buildings, except where alterations are to be carried out, nor do they apply to a
ground as a whole.   In any case, most football grounds were built before national

building regulations were introduced.


2.   Lord Wheatley concluded that only a specially devised statutory scheme could
ensure comprehensive controls at football grounds in the interests of safety and he
recommended a statutory licensing system.     He proposed that these controls should
be introduced by stages, the larger or more important grounds, broadly speaking,
being dealt with first.   Lord Wheatley also recommended that there should be a
right of appeal for the clubs concerned against any decision of the licensing
authority.   The Report showed Lord Wheatley's awareness of the need to reconcile
the paramount aim of ensuring the safety of spectators with what would be reasonable

and practicable for the clubs.


3.   Lord Wheatley also provided, as a technical appendix to his report, guidelines
to safety standards at football grounds designed to assist the local authorities

in their task of enforcement.
Consultations on the Report

4.   When the Report was published, those bodies mainly concerned, including the
"local authority associations and the football authorities, were consulted about
Lord Wheatley's proposals.     The football authorities made it clear that they were
apprehensive at the financial implications for the clubs, but there was general
agreement with the proposals themselves.     Detailed consultations were held on the
guidelines contained in the technical appendix to the Report and these, duly
amended, were finally published by the Home Departments in November 1973 as a
special booklet, "Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds".     It was revised in 1975
in the light of practical experience of its application and specifically targeted

on football grounds-


Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (Football)

5.^^ The Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds has no statutory force.     Its primary
purpose is to set out principles or guidelines which the local authorities will
no doubt wish to keep in mind in enforcing the Act.     The Guide therefore deals
with matters such as the provision of adequate entrances and exits, means of
escape, the slope of terracing, the strength and siting of crush barriers, the
construction of staircases, and measures to ensure the safe movement of spectators
both under normal and emergency conditions.     The Guide is not a set of requirements
 to be rigidly applied, regardless of individual circumstances.    As Lord Wheatley
recognised, it is important to maintain the maximum flexibility in any system of
 control so as to take account of the differing circumstances at individual grounds:

 factors such as age, size and mode of construction differ widely from ground to

ground.


 6 J 0 While the basic principles set out in the Guide are relevant to all sports

 stadia, modifications may well be necessary where sports other than football are

 involved.


 General Approach to the Act

      The main instrument of control under the Act is the safety certificate issued by
 the local authority.   A safety certificate is needed in respect of every stadium
 which is the subject of a designation order, made by the Secretary of State.       The
 certificate enables the local authority to impose such terms and conditions as
 are necessary to ensure a reasonable standard of safety at the stadium in question.




                                       ii
8.    The approach to designation was based on a phased programme so that the more
important grounds regularly attracting the largest attendances were dealt with
first.     The international stadia at which soccer and Rugby Union were played plus
stadia used by soccer clubs in Division 1 of the Football League were designated

in 1976.     This was followed in 1979 by designation of stadia of clubs in
Division 2 of the League and thereafter on promotion of a club to Division 2.
Following the     fire   at Bradford City FC in May 1985 all the remaining stadia
liable to designation used by clubs in Divisions 3 and 4 of the Football League,
and qualifying stadia of clubs in Division 1 and 2 of the Rugby League were

designated.


Substance of the Act

9.    The first 5 sections establish the main system of control under the Act, that
is to say, the safety certificate, issued by the local authority for the area in
which the stadium is situated, which is required for every sports stadium desig­

nated for that purpose by order of the Secretary of State.


10.   Section 1 empowers the Secretary of State by order to designate any sports
stadium having accommodation for more than 10,000 spectators as requiring a
safety certificate.      Safety certificates are of two kinds, general and special.
A general safety certificate is the main continuing form of control and is issued

for an indefinite period in respect of a specified activity or activities
regularly taking place at the stadium.      A special safety certificate may be issued
at the discretion of the local authority for a special event or other circumstances
not covered by the general safety certificate.      Such an event might be an evangel­
istic rally which might call for special arrangements if, for example, seating were
provided for the congregation on the playing area.      A special safety certificate
can be issued only in respect of a sports stadium for which a general safety

certificate is already in force.


11.      The contents of safety certificates are dealt with in section 2 .   The local
authority is empowered to include in the certificate such terms and conditions as
are necessary to secure, at the stadium in question, a reasonable degree of safety.
Without prejudice to this general power, the section requires certificates to contain
 terms and conditions relating to major matters such as entrances and exits, means of

 escape in emergency, the number, strength and situation of crush barriers, and the
maximum number of spectators who may be admitted to the stadium or any part of it.
 To remove any possibility of doubt, sub-section (3) makes it clear that a certificate
 may include a condition relating to the keeping of records relating to attendance and

 the maintenance of safety.
12.   An earlier Bill, introduced in 1973, limited the terms and conditions
imposed under a safety certificate to what was necessary to secure a reasonable

efegree for'Members of the public."   There was some difficulty over this term
because it might have excluded, for example, members of supporters' clubs.        This
particular problem was by the definition of "spectator" in section 17, that is,
any person occupying accommodation provided for spectators.     On the other hand,
it seemed     right that all the peole present on the occasion of a match or other
activity for which a ground has a certificate should be taken into account for the
purpose of the safety certificate, for example, people using a squash court or
other facilities at the ground.     Accordingly, the general power of the local
authority under section 2(1) to include in a safety certificate such terms or
conditions as are necessary omits any reference to people and speaks only of
securing "reasonable safety at the stadium",    (although the terms "safety", as
defined in section 17, does not include danger arising from participation in a
spo^J^.     Certain provisions must, however, be specifically linked with spectators
(who are, after all, the people the Act is mainly designed to protect and who will
be greatly in the majority).     Thus section 2(2 ) requires the certificate to state

the maximum number of spectators who may be admitted.




13.   Section 3 sets out the broad procedure to be followed when a local authority
receives an application for a safety certificate.     It requires them to determine
whether an applicant is, in their opinion, a qualified person, ie a person likely
to be in a position to prevent contravention of the terms and conditions imposed
in the certificate.     If so, they are then under a duty to issue a general safety
certificate to him.     In this respect, the general safety certificate is different
fro^fthe fire certificate issued under the Fire Precautions Act 1971:      the latter
is issued only after necessary safety works have been completed, whilst the
safety certificate under this Act can be issued almost from the outset, and is an
instrument of continuing control.     The issue of a special safety certificate,
however, is left to the discretion of the local authority, as already explained,
because only they can judge whether it is appropriate to issue it for the special

occasion in question.


14.   In Metropolitan Counties and Greater London (from 1 April 1986) the local
authority is required to send a copy of any application for a certificate to the
police and the Fire Authority, and must consult them about the terms and conditions




                                      iv
to be included in the certificate.     Elsewhere a copy must be sent to, and
consultation take place with, the police and the Building Authority.       The need
for such consultation is self-evident:       there must be close co-ordination of the
interests of the different authorities directly concerned with different aspects
of safety at football grounds.


15.   Section 4 provides for the amendment, replacement, transfer, surrender and
cancellation of safety certificates.       It is of primary importance that a local
authority should have power to amend a safety certificate where it appears
appropriate for them to do so, for example, if they find in the course of a
routine inspection that a part of a ground has become so dangerous as to demand an
immediate restriction on its use or some other necessary safeguard.       Again, they
must have power to relax a requirement where, for example, certain improvements
have been carried out to make this possible.


16.   Section 5 provides for appeals by interested parties against decisions or
requirements of the local authority in connection with safety certificates.       Appeals
lie to the Secretary of State, who has power to set up a formal inquiry.


17.   Section 6(2) empowers the Secretary of State to make regulations relating to
the safety of spectators at sports grounds.       This is in the nature of a reserve
power which could be used, for example, to give backing to requirements of the
local authorities which in the light of experience had been shown to be essential.
This section also empowers the Secretary of State to make regulations for various
other purposes connected with the Act.' To date no regulations have been made

under this sub-section.


18.   Section 7 provides for some supplementary matters on determinations and
appeals. Sub-sections (1) and (2) provide for the deemed withdrawal of an applica­

tion for, or the surrender of, a safety certificate when a local authority
determines that a person is not, or has ceased to be, qualified to hold it.       The
section also provides for the suspension of a condition in a certificate pending
determination of an appeal against the inclusion of that condition, although a
court, on the application of the local authority, may order that such a condition

remain in force pending the determination of the appeal.




                                       v
 19.   The holder of a general safety certificate is required by section 8 to
 notify the local authority of any proposed alteration or extension of a stadium.
'’’
  Jjbee.. purpose of the clause is to guard against any alterations being made, without
 the local authority's knowledge', which might affect the safety of spectators.


 20.   Section 9 provides for the harmonisation of the Act with other legislation

 which may affect sports stadia.


 21.   Section 10 is an important power which authorities should not feel inhibited
 from using where the danger to spectators are such that use of the ground, or part
 of it, should be prohibited or restricted.     Should a magistrates' court, on the
 application of a local authority, consider that the risk to spectators at any
 sports ground is so great that their admission should be prohibited or restricted

 until remedial action has been taken, the court may make an order accordingly.
       power applies to any sports stadium or ground, whether or not it is designated
 as requiring a safety certificate.    Where a general or special safety certificate

 is in force, local authorities may prefer to remedy an unsatisfactory situation
 by amending the certificate, in cases where there is sufficient time to do so.
 In respect of sports grounds and the smaller stadia, consultations between the
 local authority and the club would usually be expected to secure, on a voluntary
 basis, a reasonable standard of safety; however, where management appears to be
 unwilling to undertake the necessary measures or is slow to act on advice, this

 additional power can be used.


 22.   Section 11 confers rights of entry and inspection on persons appointed by the
 local authority and others involved in the task of ensuring crowd safety at sports



  •
 grounds.   Section 12 deals with offences and penalties.

            ~
 23.   Section 13 deals mainly with civil liability.    Its purpose is to make clear

 that while nothing in the Act itself confers a right of action in respect of a
 contravention of regulations or of conditions in a safety certificate, the existing
 rights of a spectator injured at a football stadium to bring an action for negli­
 gence against the occupiers is entirely unaffected by anything in the Act.


 24.   The Secretary of State is empowered by section 15 to extend to classes of
 sports grounds other than sports stadia such provisions of the Act as are not
 already expressed to apply to them.     For example, it enables the Secretary of
 State by order to extend the safety certificate procedure to such places as
race-courses.   Only a class of sports ground may be the subject of an extension
order under this clause:   an individual sports ground (other than a stadium)
cannot be designated until section 1 of the Act has been applied by an order

under section 15 to the class of sports ground to which itbelongs. To date,

the powers under this section have not been used.


25.   Section 16 applies the Act, subject to necessary modifications, to the

Crown.   Section 17 deals with interpretation.


26.   Section 18 provides that orders and regulations,exceptcommencement orders,
made under the Act are subject to the negative resolution procedure.    It also
imposes a duty on the Secretary of State, before making any orders or regulations,
except commencement orders or orders relating to the Isles of Scilly, to consult

with such persons as appear to him requisite.
                                                                 ANNEX C


SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

PROCEDURE REGARDING APPLICATIONS FOR GENERAL SAFETY CERTIFICATES


1.   The Safety of Sports Grounds Regulations 1976 provide that any application
for a safety certificate shall be made in the form contained in the Schedule to
the Regulations or a form to the like effect.     An application should be accompanied
by detailed information as to the structure, capacity, etc of the stadium, includ­
ing plans of the stadium, certificates relating to the testing of crush barriers
and evidence of the applicant's status.     It is, however, open to a local authority,
under section 3(4) of the Act, to require, by notice in writing, such further
information of this kind as it may consider necessary to enable it to determine

the terms and conditions to be included in the certificate.


2.   On receipt of an application for a general safety certificate, the local
authority must first determine whether the applicant is a qualified person, ie a
person likely to be in a position to prevent contravention of the terms and con­
ditions to be imposed in the certificate.     If it considers him to be such a person
the authority is then under a duty to issue a general safety certificate to him.
In the case of a general safety certificate, where considerations of time are not
paramount, the regulations impose no specific time limit for such a determination.

In any event, it seem s prima fscie unlikely that an application for a general
safety certificate would be made by an unqualified person.     There is, however, a
right of appeal against a determination by a local authority that an applicant is

not a qualified person (see paragraph 10).


3.   In Metropolitan counties and Greater London (from 1 April 1986) the local
authority is required, by section 3(3) o f ,the Act, to send a copy of any appli­
cation for a safety certificate (general or special) to the appropriate Chief
Officer of Police and the fire authority, and must consult them about the terms
and conditions to be included in the certificate.     Elsewhere in England and Wales
the local authority must send a copy to and consult with the Chief Officer of
Police and the building authority.   In framing such conditions, local authorities
will no doubt wish to keep in mind the principles or guide lines set out in tne
Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds.   In this connection local authorities are
reminded that, this non-statutory document is not a set of requirements to be
rigidly applied regardless of individual circumstances.     The maximum flexibility
should be maintained to take account of the different circumstances of individual

grounds deriving from differences in such matters as age, size and mode of con­
struction.   In this regard, it should also be noted that the Act provides that the
terms and conditions should be such as "necessary or expedient to secure reason­

able safety" and it would be unreasonable, even if it were practicable, to seek

the absolute safety of everyone attending the sports stadium.


4.    It is envisaged that there will be a good deal of consultation between the
local authority and the stadium representatives in the process of drawing up the

certificate conditions.    In this way, if evidence is advanced that a ground is
rarely filled to capacity, the local authority may consider it proper to base its
requirements on actual levels of attendance over a given period rather than on
maximum capacity.    On the rare occasions on which a capacity crowd could be
expected, separate provision might be made for this contingency on the lines
indicated in paragraph 7 below.    Again, if a stand were found to be structurally
weak, the local authority might, in consultation with the stadium representatives,
offer the choice of having any necessary remedial works carried out or of restrict-

^     admission to the stand until it had been strengthened.


5.     As will be apparent from the foregoing paragraphs, the form and content of a

safety certificate is likely to vary according to the circumstances of the indivi­
dual case.    Accordingly, a standard form of certificate would not be appropriate.
It must however contain full details of the terms and conditions imposed including,

in particular, the matters referred to in section 2(2) of the Act arid have annexed
to it a plan of the stadium by reference to which the terms and conditions will be
framed.    The certificate when first issued may contain restrictive conditions which

can then be relaxed or deleted by amendment of the certificate.      The local
authority may find it convenient to list, in a covering letter to the certificate,

such modifications as will be subsequently permitted, eg in the form of a state-
^it    of the increased spectator capacities   to be allowed for the separate sections

of the ground when the various stages of any future .works programme

agreed with the stadium authorities are'completed.      This arrangement, by

excluding'from "the certificate itself proposed conditions which would
apply only to future works, should serve to obviate confusion.      At the same time,
however, care must be taken not to exclude from the certificate any restriction

germane to current conditions, since section 5(3) of the Act provides for an
interested party to appeal to the Secretary of State against the inclusion of
anything     in, or the omission of anything from, a safety certificate, and these

rights must not be prejudiced in any way in consequence of the form of the

certificate.




                                   ii
6.   As regards the scope of a general safety certificate, section 2(5) of the
Act provides that different terms and conditions may be included for different
activities.    Although, therefore, a stadium may be in regular use only as a foot­
ball ground, in cases where it is also used from time to time to stage other
events it would be desirable, and in many cases obviate the need for special
safety certificates, if the terms and conditions appropriate to those events were
to be included in the general certificate.    It is suggested that any such events
for which it is considered desirable to provide might conveniently be divided into

2 classes:-


     1.   those sufficiently similar in character to the main purpose of the
     stadium for the normal terms and conditions to be equally applicable;


     2.   those of a fundamentally different character, eg boxing matches, pop
     concerts, etc which may involve all or part of the playing area being given
     over to    spectator accommodation and for which separate terms and conditions
     will have to be devised.    It is not, of course, necessary to provide for
     these contingencies in cases where no clear need is foreseen by the stadium

     authorities.


7.   There may also be circumstances in which the terms and conditions applicable
to the normal activity of the stadium may be found to be inappropriate, eg when a
special event, such as a cup tie or a "local Derby", is expected vo attract signi­
ficantly more than the usual attendance.     In the case especially of cup replays
these special events may arise with only a few days' notice, within which it would
not be possible to accommodate the whole of the statutory procedure appropriate to
the grant of a special safety certificate.     In order to overcome this difficulty,
it would seem desirable for the local authorities and stadium authorities to seek
to work out in advance the modifications to the normal terms and conditions which

might be appropriate to such occasions, eg the admission of increased numbers to
certain areas on the condition that extra stewards and police are employed, that

notice is given to the local authority, and so on, and to provide for their

incorporation in the general safety certificate.


8.   Once a general safety certificate has been issued, subject to the determina­
tion of any appeal, the terms and conditions can be varied only by formal amend­
ment of the certificate, which may be at the initiative either of the holder of
the certificate or of the local authority (see section 4(2) of the Act) and will
presumably reflect changes in circumstances occurring since the grant of the
 original certificate.    It will thus be to the mutual benefit of local authorities
 and clubs/stadium authorities for a close liaison to be maintained after the
 issue of the certificate and certainly while any further works of safety measures

 are being carried out.   It is likely to be in the stadium operators' financial
 interest to get the safety certificate amended as soon as possible after work
 has been completed, and they should accordingly ensure that the local authority
 is kept informed of progress.   For    its part the local authority will no doubt
wish to co-operate by arranging matters so that, following completion of the

work, the certificate can be amended without delay.


 9.    After a certificate has been granted, an application may be made for the
 transfer of the certificate to another person.      Similarly, while a local
 authority is considering an application for a certificate and before the certifi­
 cate has been granted, it may be asked to substitute some person other than the
^ i g i n a l applicant as the person to whom the certificate should be granted.   These

 are, however, likely to be rare occurrences in the case of general safety certifi­
 cates, where an application will normally be made on behalf of a club or a stadium
 organisation by an authorised official of the club or representative of the
 organisation.   However, if it does happen, the local authority will be required in
 both cases to determine whether the substituted nominee is a qualified person.
 Thereafter, in the first case, the procedure laid down in the regulations to
 giving notice of, and the reasons for, the determination will apply together with
 any necessary appeals procedure.      In the second case, there is no reason why the
 local authority should not treat the application in all respects as a new applica­
 tion in the terms of the original one and process it from the point it had already

 reached.


 10.   In addition to the right of appeal by an applicant for a general safety
 certificate against the determination that he is not a qualified person (see
 paragraph 2 above), which, of course, applies also in the case of a proposed
 transfer of a certificate, the Act provides a further right of- appeal to any
 "interested party" (which term includes the holder of the safety certificate)
 against the inclusion of anything in or the omission of anything from a safety
 certificate or against a refusal to amend or replace a safety certificate.        The
 regulations provide that, in the case of a general safety certificate, notice of

 any such appeal shall be given within 28 days following receipt of a notice of
 the local authority's decision, or, in the case of persons who are not notified,
 the publication by the local authority of its decision in a newspaper circulating

 in the locality.
11.    In this connection, Regulation 7 requires a local authority, on issuing or
amending a safety certificate or refusing to do so, to give notice to certain
specified "interested parties" and also to advertise their action in the press.
It is regretted that it has been necessary to incur the trouble and expense of
advertising, but, since Section 5(5) of the Act is not specific in the definition
which it provides of "interested party", no other means could be found of ensuring
that all persons who might validly claim to be "interested parties" within the
meaning of the Act should be able to acquaint themselves with the local authority's
decision, and failure to bring the decision to their notice could result in a
denial of their rights of appeal or of a hearing by the Secretary of State.     For
the same reason a similar obligation has been imposed on an appellant (by
Regulation 8(7)) to advertise his intention to appeal, and a person wishing to
appear before a person appointed by the Secretary of State under Section 5(4) of
the Act is required to give notice within 28 days of such advertisement.


12.    Any appellant is required (by Regulation 8(5)) to give the local authority
notice of appeal, accompanied by the relevant documents appertaining to the
appeal.    It will then be for the local authority, in accordance with Regulation

8(9), to inform the Secretary of State in writing within 28 days whether it
wishes to oppose the appeal.    With any such notice, the local authority is
required to submit its reasons and any relevant supporting documents and to suaue
whether it wishes a hearing under Section 5     of the Act.   (The procedure govern­

ing the conduct of all such hearings is set out in Regulation 10.)


13.    It is also open to the Secretary of State, if he considers it necessary, to
order a public inquiry under Section 5(6) of the Act in relation to any appeal.
In such a case, the procedure to be followed is laid down in Regulation 12.

 14.   It would be helpful if local authorities could continue the existing
 practice of copying to the Home Office newly issued or amended safety certificates.
                                                                          ANNEX D




SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

PROCEDURE REGARDING APPLICATIONS FOR SPECIAL SAFETY CERTIFICATES


1.    The regulations provide that any application for a safety certificate shall
be made in the form contained in the Schedule to the Regulations or a form to the
like effect.     Part II of the form and its frontispiece should be completed in the
case of applications for special safety certificates.     In any case where an
application for a special safety certificate is not made by the holder of the
general safety certificate, it should be accompanied by evidence of the appli­
cant's status.     Details of any planned changes to the normal standing and seating
arrangements for spectators should be provided, together with such further
information in support of the application as is considered necessary to enable
the local authority to discharge its functions under the Act.     However, it is
open to a local authority, under section 3(4) of the Act, to require, by notice
in writing, any further information of this kind which they may think it
necessary to have to enable them to determine the terms and conditions to be

included in the special safety certificate.


2.    A major difference in the grant of general and special safety certificates
is that, once the local authority has determined that an applicant is a quali­
fied person, the issue of a general safety certificate becomes mandatory,
whereas the issue of a special safety certificate remains at its discretion.
But an applicant has a right of appeal to the Secretary of State against a

refusal (see following paragraphs for details).


 3.   An application for a special safety certificate should normally be made at
 least 3 months before the date of the proposed event, but a local authority has
 discretion to permit an application within a lesser period if it is satisfied
 that the procedures (including appeals procedures) required under the Act and
 Regulations can, in the particular case, be carried out within that lesser period,
 eg when the applicant is known to be a qualified person.     On receipt of an
 application for a special safety certificate, the local authority must first
 determine whether the applicant is a qualified person, ie a person likely to be
 in a position to prevent contravention of the terms and conditions to be imposed
 in the certificate.     The local authority is required by regulation 5 to make
 this determination within 14 days of receiving the application.     There is a
 right of appeal against a determination by a local authority that an applicant
 is not a qualified person (see paragraph 9), and, under regulation 5, the
 applicant must be furnished with the reasons for such a determination.




                                       i
  4.      It next requires to be considered whether the application should be refused

-"'on grounds other than that the applicant is not a qualified person.    This
  decision must, in accordance with regulation 6, be made within 28 days of the
  receipt of the application, not only in cases where the local authority has
  determined that the applicant is a qualified person but also in those where
  it has determined that he is not and an appeal has been lodged and remains to
  be considered.    There is also a right of appeal against a refusal on grounds
  other than a determination that the applicant is not a qualified person (see
  paragraph 9).    In the event of such a refusal, therefore, the local authority is
  again required, under regulation 6, to give the applicant the reasons for its

  decision.


  5.     When the first 2 stages have been completed, should it have been decided
 j^^t a special safety certificate should be issued, the local authority in
  metropolitan counties and Greater London (from 1 April 1986) is required, by
  section 3(3) of the Act, to send a copy of the application to the Chief Officer
  of Police and to the fire authority and to consult them about the terms and
  conditions to be included in the certificate.     Elsewhere in England and Wales
  the local authority must send a copy to, and consult with, the Chief Officer of

  Police and the building authority.     The special safety certificate must, in
  accordance with regulation 6(2), then be issued not less than 28 days before

  the    proposed event is due to take place.


  6.     The form and content of a special safety certificate is likely   to vary
  according to the circumstances of each individual case and a standard form of
       rtificate would not be appropriate.   (In suitable cases, however, regard may
  f     had to the guide lines set out in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds
  (Football) on the basis indicated in paragraph 3 of the paper relating to the
  "Procedure Regarding Applications for General Safety Certificates".)       Any
  special safety certificate must, however, contain full details of the terms
  and conditions imposed, including in particular the matters referred to in
  section 2(2) of the Act, and as required by section 2(4) should be framed where
  appropriate by reference to the plan attached to the general safety cartificate.


  7.     Once a special safety certificate has been issued, subject to the    deter­
  mination of any appeal, the terms and conditions can be varied only     by formal
  amendment of the certificate.     This may be on the application of the holder of
  the certificate or at the discretion of the local authority (see section 4(2)
  of the Act).     This seems an unlikely eventuality in the case of a special safety
certificate, otherwise than in the exceptional case where the certificate has
been issued well in advance of the event to which it relates.     Any such amend­
ment must, however, be publicised as in paragraph 10 below.


8.    Considerations of time render the transfer of a special safety certificate
to another person an equally unlikely contingency.    Any possible difficulties
in this connection are likely to be obviated, however, if the holder of the
general safety certificate applies for the special certificate.     Nevertheless,
should an application for transfer be made, the local authority must decide
within 14 days if the proposed transferee is a qualified person and, if it
decides to the contrary, the procedure laid down in the regulations relating
to giving notice of, and the reasons for, the determination will apply, as will
the appropriate appeals procedure, should the need arise.     In the case of an
application for transfer before a special safety certificate has actually been
issued, there is no reason why the local authority should not treat the applica­
tion in all respects as a new application in the terms of the original and pro­

cess it from the point already reached.


9.    Reference has already been made to the rights of appeal against a deter­
mination that the applicant is not a qualified person (paragraph 3) and against
the refusal of an application on other grounds (paragraph 4).     In addition the

Act provides (in section 5(3))a right of appeal to any "interested party
against the inclusion of anything in or the omission of anything from a safety
certificate or against a refusal to amend or replace a safety certificate.
The regulations provide that, in the case of a special safety certificate, notice

of any such appeal shall be given within 7 days following receipt of a notice
of the local authority's decision, or, in the case of persons who are not
notified, the publication by the local authority of the decision in a newspaper

circulating in the locality.


10.   As in the case of a general safety certificate, regulation 7 requires a
local authority, on issuing or amending a safety certificate or refusing so
to amend it, to give notice to certain specified "interested parties" and also
to advertise its action in the press.     A similar obligation falls on an appellant
(under regulation 8(7)) to advertise his intention to appeal, and a person wish­
ing to appear before a person appointed by the Secretary of State under section
5(4) of the Act is required to give notice within 7 days of such advertisement.
 (The reasons underlying these requirements are set out in paragraph 11 of the
paper relating to tne 'Procedure Regarding Applications for General Safety

Certificates'.)
11.    Any appellant is required (by regulation 8(5)) to give the local authority
-notice of a p p e a l , accompanied by the relevant documents appertaining to the
appeal.    It will then be for the local authority, in accordance with regulation

8(9), to inform the Secretary of State in writing within 7 days whether it
wishes to oppose the appeal.    With any such notice, the local authority is
required to submit its reasons and any relevant supporting documents and to
state whether it wishes a hearing under section 5(4) of the Act.       (The pro­
cedure governing the conduct of all such hearings is set out in regulation 10.)


12.    It is also open to the Secretary of State, if he considers it necessary,
to order a public inquiry under section 5(6) of the Act in relation to any
appeal.    In such a case, the procedure to be followed is laid down in

regulation 12.


 13.   It would be helpful if local authorities could continue the existing
practice of copying to the Home Office any special safety certificates issued.

 7ho abolition sf              .'^tropolitan r.nd Greater London Councils on
 31st March, 1936, has necessitated some changes to the Safety of Sports
 Grounds Act 1975 (S:3GA); these have been achieved by noans of the Local
 Go r e m n e n t Act 1935 (LGA).

 t’ron 1st April, i-Kib the role and status of the Fire Authority in South
 Yorkshire under t^o !?SGA will be charmed, as the Fire Authority will no
 lonjor be the Local Authority.    It is therefore necessary to jive the Fire
 Authority the status of an "interested party", and thus require the Local
 Authorities (District Councils) to .consult on Batters involving the Act.
 The Fire Authority v!.ll also be able tc authorise entry and inspection of
 a sports ground in its own right.

 It will be important to establish and maintain good liaison between Divisions
 and whichever department is raade responsible for the Act in each of the
 Local Authorities (District Councils).

    going to be required to raise the standard of the Stadium to appropriate levels.

    The Panel is probably aware that the Stadium is Council owned but is currently

    leased to the O v e r t o n Sports Stadium Limited.     This Lease will expire on 1st


    November, 1987.

    Safety Certificate Standard Conditions^

    At the moment the Safety Conditions attached to Safety Certificates are

    standardised throughout South Yorkshire and both the Police and the Fire Service

    have -indicated that they would wish this situation to continue for reasons of

    ..administrative simplicity.      The Conditions do, however, give some cause for

"'"concern, as they appear to be inadequate or inappropriate in some areas.               The

g r a f t i n g of these Conditions is of particular importance as it is a serious

     criminal offence to contravene any of them punishable by the Statutory H u l —

     Fine (Currently £2,000) or 2 years imprisonment or both.


     It is proposed to re-draft the Certificate conditions, where appropriate, and to

     submit the-- to the Panel for approval.        The Sheffield Vednesdav Certificate

'    vould then be replaced in accordance with Section 4 .(1) (b) of the Act.             Tne

         Sheffield United Certificate could then be issued with the new conditions before

         the start of the 1986/87 season.     The re-drafted conditions would, of course, be

•; submitted to the P ire Service, the Police and BuildinS Surveyor for comment;

    M o t h e r authoritiesin South Yorkshire could also be involved in this process.


         Evicting Administrative Arrangements
                                   £                         the Act is based on 2 main
         Tne County Council system for a d m i n i s t e r s

         components - (a) bi-annual inspections of the Stadium; and (b) meetings

         officer working party.     The bi-annual inspections consist of representatives

          from all the interested authorities and involve thorough inspections of the           ^

          Stadia and the identifying of any defects.      These defects are at the tim. o^ tne

          visit brought to the attention of the certificate holder and its technical

          representative if one is present.     Depending on the nature of the faults found

          (if any) steps are then agreed between the Authority and the Certificate Holder
to rectify them or so arrange o t t e r s that no risk to the public occurs.       The

Working Party consists of representatives from the Police, Fire Service,

    Building Surveyors and the County Council - it considers in detail various

    matters (such as the Spion Kop development at Sheffield Wednesday Football

    Ground) and also any outstanding items from the bi-annual inspections.     The

    Working Party is effectively a co-ordinating body vhich attempts to ensure that

    a balanced and consistent approach is maintained to current issues at the Sports

    Grounds.     Any recommendations it makes are subject to approval by this Panel.


;VThe Health and Safety Executive

" Recommendation 9 of The Popplewell Committee's Interim Report read as follows

     L r e    should be urgent consultation between the Health and Safety Executive and

     the Fire Authorities and local Authorities as to how best to co-ordinate and

■ communicate their inspections and reports'.       Bearing this in mind the local

     office of the Health and Safety Executive was invited to participate in the

     administrative system for safety at sports grounds.     This invitation was

     declined.     The Executive will apparently take no direct part in the


     Certification system.
     In view of this problem the Home Office was contacted and the position

-    explained; it appears that negotiations are under way between the Home Office

fand         the HSE about PoppleweU's recommendation but as yet there has been no


     useful outcome.
      In these circumstances the Council could keep the Health and Safety Executive

                                                   and to invite their comments on them,
      informed of all developments m     Sheffield and
                                          of the Executive to decide whether or not to
      It would then be the responsibility of the txecuc

      respond.

      Fees
      The basis on which fees may be charged is set out in Regulation 14 of the Safety

       o£ sports Grounds Regulations 1976 which states -14.    A local authority may

       determine the fees to be charged in respect of applications for the issue or
amendment of    safety   certificates but such fees shall not in a particular case

exceed an amount commensurate with the work actually and reasonably done."         The

 South Yorkshire County Council did-not fix any fees under the Regulation

apparently     as a Batter of policy and the Panel is therefore asked to decide

which of the following options to adopt:- (a) state as a « t t e r of policy that

 no fees will be" charged in respect of Safety of Sports Grounds legislation or

 (b) decide in principle to fix fees and to ask for a report back on the costs


 to th'e Council.

- Conclusion

 The Panel is asked to:-

 fa)     Note the broad outlines of the administrative system organised by the

         County Council and authorise its continuation for the time being;

  (b)    Note the position of the Health and Safety Executive and request the Head

         of Administration ani Legal Department to keep the Executive informed of

         all natters relating to sports ground safety;

  <c)    Request the Head of Administration and Legal Bepartment to draft new

         safety certificate conditions in consultation with the appropriate

    Perhaps "during performance" inspections could be arranged so that each
    Authority carries out such inspections independently with a degree of central
    co-ordination to prevent two inspections taking place simultaneously. As the
    first step towards the development of a programme of inspections it minh£ be
    appropriate for me to arrange a joint inspection involving representatives from
    all the authorities in order to provide an insight into problems which may be
    encountered.                                            t

 Moving on to the "working party" structure I think it is clear from the meeting
 of 10th March that some clarification of its status is required. It is
 reasonably clear from the County Council’s records that the working party as
 such was actually a decision making body presumably acting under delegated
 powers. However, the normal City Council practice is that the principal powers
 remain with a Committee o r Sub-Committee (in this case the General Purposes
 Panel) with routine matters being delegated to a Chief Officer (in this case
 myself). I would therefore propose to ask the Panel to accept the working party
 >s a forum for discussion.
s
:A    -     a view that the Lead Authority will be able to use the Working Party as
" U s e f u l forum for discussion prior to drawing up that Authorities formal view
 to be submitted to the Certificating Authority.         I propose that when an
 Authority feels that a meeting would be appropriate contact should be made with
 my Chief Licensing Officer, Mr. Bownes, who will then make arrangements for the
"meeting 'to take ‘pla'cie. “Aa -agsada will -be -prepared ana circulated prior to .the. .
■meeting and at t h e conclusion of the meeting Mr. Bownes will' prepare a list
 showing the subjects discussed and the action to be taken by each Lead
 Authority.      This list will be circulated as well.

    Would you please consider the points I have raised and let me have your comments
    on them in due course; it will be necessary for me to formulate a report to the
    General Purposes Panel on the administration of the Certification system.

    Yours faithfully,

     Perhaps "during performance" inspections could be arranged so that each
     Authoritv c a r r i e s out such inspections independently vith a degree of central
     co-ordination to prevent two inspections taking place simultaneously. As the
     first step towards the development of a programme of inspections it might be
     first s p                   arrange a ioint inspection involving representatives from
     all"the^'authorities in order to provide an insight into problems which may be                  _

Meeting of S.A.S.G.A.G - l6 th July. 1987


Mr. Berries -opened the meeting and stated that'the discussions would be divided
into four areas:-

1.   Definition of Rolls
2.   Inspections
3.   Status of Group
4.   Admin. Machinery of the Group


1.   It was agreed that rolls should be broadly defined and responsibilities
     taken on°by the appropriate of the three "lead authorities" i.e. Police,
     Fire and Building Surveyors subject to agreement where overlap occurs.

     A1 contact with the grounds should be through the licensing authority.

     Environmental   Health would    take    a   "general safety roll"                 and not be                          a
     "lead" authority.

2.   The annual inspection is to be          a joint full    inspection to be carried
     oi't nf--r th*» <sn£ of- each sescon.         ' •- '           r~ .;•••     _..r •

     D.P. inspections to be done on an individual basis.   Prior arrangements
     to be made with the Police, but not the Club.    The Licensing Authority
     to be informed when an inspection has taken place.

3.   The meeting was informed that legally the group is essentially an advisory
     authority - only the council can be the ultimate decision making authority.

4.   Individual authorities to correspond to the sports grounds through the
     licensing authority who will subsequently circulate copies of all letters
     to each "lead" authority.

     Meetings of the group will be held at irregular intervals depending
     on nee'd and can be called by any member of the group.      Individual
     authorities need not attend specific meetings if they have no "interest .

     Agendas will be issued prior to each meeting.

REPORT OF THE HEAD OF ADMINISTRATION AND LEGAL DEPARTMENT TO THE GcNERAL
PURPOSES PANEL

SAFETY OF   SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975 - THE CURRENT    SITUATION AND PROPOSALS FORTHE
FUTURE ADMINISTRATION OF THE COUNCIL'SCERTIFICATION F U N C T I 0 ¥ '

Introduction

The Panel will recall that on 1st April I<?86 the City Council inherited from the
South Yorkshire County Council the role of certificating Authority under the
1975 Act.    The Act itself is basically aimed at ensuring adaauate standards   of
safety at   designated stadia; there are three of these in Sheffield at the moment
- Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, Sheffield United Football Club, and the
Owlerton Sports Stadium.  A detailed report on the Act and its application in
Sheffield was submitted to the Panel on 6th May 1<?86.

The Current Situation

The Panel at its meeting in May 1986 identified several main areas for further
investigation.

Pirstlv it was accepted at tne time that the broad outlines Oi. the
administrative system organised by the County Council should be continued ior
the time being.  This system has now been reviewed and the Droposed
reorganisation is detailed later in this repor-.

The Panel also asked that the Health and Safety Executive be keot informed of
a ii Ria'-(-a rs r ^ t i n s to sports ground safety anc that the Association or
Metropolitan Authorities also be asked about the KSI's involvement.           As far as
keeping the ESE informed of safety developments at tne stadia .tne _:<ecu>.i\=
it fairly plain that they would not make any comments.           7h^ sracti^^'-r.?^ ^
therefore discontinued.          The involvement of the A.MA in tne HSc         na? pesr.
s one what forestalled by action, at central Government level to reviev tne ..si s
relationship vith local authorities; this review was announcec m tne                _
Government's reply to the Popplswell Report but no results or cr.at_rsviev na.=
yet been received.          Fortunately, however, the Council's Director or hsalta^ane
Consumer Services has permitted his Officer's to provide n r o r e s s ■^ne-sJ.-rs
safetv input inco the decision making process in relation to saraty or ^
sports grounds.          The problem is, therefore, at least tenoorari.y ras»o_\e_.

The ?='>*'■ also mace reference to consultation on the sarety cr sports srcur.cs
poiicv vith the other District Councils in South Yorkshire.     rnrortunateivf _
attempts at arranging consultation meetings have beer, unsuccessru. to date. ..
is proposed to try again to organise some consultations in tne           na“-_
future, perhaps when the Certification      system has settlec aoiu ir.eacnars*.

The draftins of new safety certificate   conditions ir. consultationviththe
Council’s advisers has been progressing steadily.and new draft conciuicto a.e
currentlv under consideration by those    advisers.   It is hoped that^trar.e*.
 conditions will   be submitted to the Panel at its meeting in Octoo----c             -
 approval.

 As to the question of charging fees under the 1975 legislation, it shoulo *e
 be made clear that such fees are only payaole on tne gran, o. a Cer . - v K u_.
 It is anticioated that if the Panel aporoves the new Certincate concitions .
 Certificate will then be issued to Sheffield United and at thau uime it is
 proposed to deal vith the question of fees.

Future Administration of the Council's Certificating Function

Following a thorough review of the legislation it has become clear that a
detailed administrative system needs to be. established in conncction with ti.a
Council's Certificating function. Discussions on this matter have been underway
for some time with the Police, the Fire Service, the Council's Building
Surveyor and the Director of Health and Consumer Services on the establishment
of such a system.

Accenting that the Council as the Certificating Authority w i U act: on the basis
of advice from experts (such as the Fire Service) the question arises as to how
that advice may be best formulated. In the past, the County Council organised
an Officer Working Party which was apparently used as a forum for discussion
between Officers prior to the final formulation of advice to the Council. That
particular working party also appeared to have some decision making powers.

^s it is essential that meetings take place due to the potential overlap of
requirements in many areas, all the Authorities and Officers have now agreed
that it would be appropriate to establish a revised form of the working party to
perform a similar function for the City Council. It is recommended that the
"Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory Group" (which would consist of
representatives from the Police, the Fire Service, the Building Surveyor's
Division and the Department of Health and Consumer Services), would function as
a forum for discussion between Officers; its most regular use would probably be
the discussion of items of advice to the Council before they are finally       ^
formulated bv the appropriate Authority. Meetings of the Group would be hslc_at
the reauest of one or more Authorities and on receipt of a request the Head^o:
Administration and Legal Department would arrange a meeting and cespatcr.^a list
of items to be discussed. At the conclusion of the meeting a further .ii>- o ;
itains would fee prepared and the details or action agreed to be >-a<sr.
Author!tv would be noted.    It is then anticipated that detailed written asvies
to the Council would be forthcoming and be acted upor. as appropriate.

In addition the Head of Administration and Legal Department will keep copies o^
all relevant correspondence which will bs available to all participants m tor
Group •

Under the cld County Council administrative structure the different iutnoriti?^
represented in their working party had fairly clear-iv denned rcj.es *._tr.i.. w.*—
to operate. Although it can be seen that there is some merit ir. this idea tne^
areas o ' potential overlap of responsibility are quite extensive m ce.a^inc v-.r
spo-ts ^rounds. However it appears that the various-Authorities ar.c. vrricsrs
wish for some definition of roles and the following have been agree*:

It is anticipated that the Health and Consumer Services Department would have an
input on (a) aspects of general safety; (b) the general safety management of
stadia* (c) various special items such as first aid requirements. It will be
appreciated that these areas of responsibility are not exhaustive but it is
anticipated that any areas of doubt will be dealt with by discussions at
advisory group meetings.

Inspections

Moving on to a matter of more general policy it has been suggested that one
large scale inspection per stadium should be carried out by the Group backed up
by a series of inspections which will take place actually during football
matches. This proposal is in line with both the Popplewell Report and with
licensing practice in other areas.

Delegations
There is also a further question to be dealt with at this stage and thatrelates
to the dav to dav decision making required for the running of the Cerd^icatio^
System. At the 'moment decision making powers rest with the Panel but this is a
highlv impractical arrangement which needs to be reviewed ^gently. ^
that as an interim measure all routine matters could be delegated to aead o.
Administration and Legal Department with other matters remaining a*, the
d ^ e t i ™ o" the Panel. It is proposed that when the Certificate or Conations
are in force then the delegation will be much more closely ce^ine-,.
Unfortunately this is not possible at the moment with tne curren. C - . i - i ^ - e o.
Conditions.

Recommendations

The panel is recommended to:-

 (5 )   Kote the current situation;

 (b)    Aoprove the revised administrative system detailed in this resort^inducing
        the establishment of the "Safety of Sports Grounds Aavisorj C-ou, .

 (C)    Delegate to the Head of Administrator, and Legal Department authority to
        dlal'vith all routine matters in connection with the Afitswistra-iv* S>s.e.,.

Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975




I thank you for your letter dated 22nd December, 1978, and the cosy
letter of the Euilding Surveyor of the Sheffield Metropolitan
District Council.

It would seem essential that the officers of the County Council ana
Fletrooolitan District Council involved in the production cr the
censral safety certificate reauired by the Sheffield Wednesday
Football Club under ths above Act, undertake a comprehensive survey
of the ground.   I fael sure that it would be beneficial to the Club
.^ initially, each department acted in unison in this resoecu
rather than separately and I would make the necessary arrangements
with tny_officers for this to                            .       .   -   ....---

V c o n y of the report of each d e p a r t m e n t -'should'be provided to each
 involved department to enable problems to be discussed so what an
 accepted approach might be determined and consolidated into = sincls
 report which should be forwarded to the Club.

This recort, together with that of Dr. Eastwood, would fora ths
basis of a further meeting with officials of the Club as differences
cf opinion, if any, would have been identified.

 I- is my opinion that the necessary comprehensive survey could not
 be undertaken satisfactorily without plan drawings.  In t m s raspec-
 I refer to paragraph 1.3 of the 'green code1:

 .«Ths problem of crowd safety at football grounds is ccmpie: and
 cannot be solved simply by ensuring that each component o. a grouna,
 such as stairs, passages or sections or terracing, id sa-is,dc-oty
 <n i^sPlf.        The inter-relation cf components is essentic... -h_y
 ^ o u l d ' b e compatible and confcina to form a balanced unit".

 Following the receipt cf drawings I suggest that Officers msec to
 a G r e e on identification procedures. In order that e a c h department
 is abla to identify parts of the ground in a uqirc.m ^ n n . x , *
 uculd prefer to have stands and terraces claarly identifier,_e,.i*
 routes, passages, gangways, gateways, doors, etc., numbered m a
 consecutive mannar-and stairways lettered.

  Officers of the County Council and Metropolitan District CoJJnt^ l
  have visited ths ground and I balisva ^V*-*       m ^isit^other
  be part of theTcoraprehensive survey. Findings from visit*
than the survey referred to will be limited and if we involve
ourselves in consultation with tha Club following the submission
of Dr. Eastwood’s report with limitsd information this could
prova unfortunate in tha long tsrm.

As previously mentioned I prsfar to await tha provision of tha
plan drawings which have already been requested and if any
action can be taksn to expedite this mattar it would ba
appreciated.

     Standing Accommodation
     (a)    Spion Kop
                   The general layout of Spion Kop is good.                     It
            has a very adequate number of gangways, with spacings
            well below the maximum laid down in the guide.                    The
            slope strikes a happy balance between the requirements

lh          for good viewing and the requirements of safety.
                         The only questions therefore are the adequacy
            of the crush barriers to justify a high number of
           ...pex'-isit-tsd-r-spsctailors-,      tid- the -x;
            the exits.
                   Where the barriers are adequate in strength
            and spacing,               the guide recommends that the^number            /

            of spectators should not exceed 54 per 10m                   of plan ' '
            area.          Disregarding the gangways the area of Spion
            Kop is approximately 3120m2 which would provide
            a c c o m m o d a t io n    for 16,850 spectators.
                         Crush barriers can satisfy either of two
            standards.                 Category A must be able to withstand a
            test load of 6 kN/metre width (400 lb/foot approximately)
            and Category B must withstand 4.3 kN/metre (290 lb/foot)
            In 1973 tests were made on all the barriers by Toft
            and Brocklebank Ltd.                 Of the 101 barriers on Spion
            Kop,      21 failed to carry the test load of 400 lb and
             a further 15 carried the load but had some actual or
             incipient defect which needed attention.                   Most of
             those which failed the test,                 failed so badly that they
            would probably not satisfy category B standard exther.
             On the other hand,              it was sometimes only one part of a
             long barrier whi c h was weak.                 It should be emphasxsed
             that the general situation was satisfactory compared

             with most grounds.
                    Clearly it would be advisable to bring all the
                                                                                                     SHEET   3.

               should be kept in mind that it is now five years since
               the tests and there may have been some deterioration
               due to rusting.              Most of the barriers are made from
               2 1" diameter tube which only has a thickness of 0.192
               inches when new.               Rusting is now very slow in Sheffield's
               atmosphere, but certain parts of the barriers are subject
               to more rusting than others and it is possible that

                             Spion Kop has three exits, one near each
                    end and one at the top.                                  The total width of
                    these three exits at their narrowest points is 12.5m.
                    The guide assumes a maximum flow rate through such
                    exits of. 60 persons per. minute for each 550mm of

                    of gangways giving a capacity of 7200 spectators.
                    The barriers should be designed to match this figure

                                   The three exits have a total width oi about
                    1 1 . 5m which would permit about 1250 people per minute
                     to leave the ground.                 Thus the terrace could be
                     emptied in about six minutes which is very satisfactory.
                                   The guide suggests that everyone on a terrace
                     should be within 12m of a gangway or exit.                                There are
                     no gangways and some spectators will be 2 5m from an
                     exit.             But we feel this is of no consequence as
                     movement horizontally along this terrace will be easy

                     and quick.
                     The North West Corner Reinforced Concrete Terrace
                                   This area is also illustrated in the drawing
                     1 6 1 0 / 2 X .      The gross area available (there are no
                     gangways)            is about 565 m 2 .           Thus if the crush barriers
                     were adequate and the whole area is included the number
                     of spectators could be about -3,050.

              shown on our drawing 1610/2X,      the area which.can
              be used in calculating spectator capacity is that

              shown in green-      This area is about 535m       corresponding
              to about 2900 spectators.       This would bring the total
              standing at the Leppings Lane end to 10,100.
                      The exits serving this part of the terraces
              are very adequate in width and there will be no
              difficulty in emptying in eight minutes.

                      The form of construction of this stand is
              such that it presents a minimum fire hazard.           The
              gxits are numerous and spaced so that the^ satisfy
              the recommendations of the guide.
                      The exits are very marginally below the
              recommended 1-lm width,     but we do not consider this
              to be of great consequence.
                      Gangways are only 640mm wide for much of their
              length (they widen round the exit).        This is well
              below the green guide recommendation.        However,    it
              is clearly appropriate to take into account the
              general nature of the stand,     the number as well as
              the width of the gangways,     and above all the ease and
              speed   with which spectators can evacuate the stand.
                       On 6 January we counted the number of spectators
              leaving in successive minutes after the final whistle.
              The figures were 71, 72,     80 and 73.    Thereafter
              the number fell off as the spectators were in no hurry.
              This established that in an emergency the green guide
              figure of 80 per minute (relating to a l*lm gangway)
              can be achieved.      With 18 exits for 1 0 , 0 0 0 spectators

               the average is 556 per exit.             Thus the stand would
               empty in about seven minutes, which is within-the
               recommended limit of eight minutes.
                          Our observations in company with the fire
               officer’s staff on 6 January showed that everyone
               had left this stand,           apart from some people who were
               in no hurry,           in about six minutes, although we also
               counted about 40 per exit who left before the final
               whistle.             The overall picture appears very satisfactory

      (b)      The West Stand
                      This stand is very similar to the north stand
               in its construction.             We were not able to accurately
               assess the time taken for it to be vacated on 6
               January because there were many seats which were unsold.
               However,        there is every reason to believe that there
            ' will be        no     difficulty invacating this stand within
               ei-ht minutes also.             There should      be no need   for
                 ***o
                significant modifications.

      (c)      The South Stand
                ~      The structure has been surveyed and appended
                are prints of our drawings 1610/3, 4 and 5, which
                show the plans and cross-section.                 Also attached is
                a seating plan,          drawing No.   1610/6.
                           The upper part of the stand (the covered area)
                has 5710 seats.            These are served by 12 exits (excluding
                those serving the directors box) so that a n average
                of 476 people need to pass through each exit.                   The
                count    by     the fire officer's staff on 6        January   showed
                an average of about 70 per minute passing through one
                exit    w h i c h    corresponds to an emptying time of about
                seven minutes.            Indeed there were very few people

                  still trying to get out six minutes after the final
                  whistle.       A few had no doubt left early and a few
                  were still standing around,         but the stand had
                  substantially emptied in about six minutes.
                            Having left the top of the stand the spectators
                  have to make their way from the first floor landing
   0              via one of three staircases.            Two of these are 3.6m

                  wide and the other 2.4.           This is equivalent to Y l \

          ;7 '\   exactly 8 minutes as permitted by the guide.
                            At ground floor level two of the staircases lead
                  almost straight to the open air, through a compartment
                  which is separated from the main part of the building.
                  •The third staircase passes through a wide lobby which
               • will probably need three sets of self closing fire
                   doors to separate it from the remainder of the building.
                   The club intends to move the paint store from the
                   space behind’ this staircase.
                          The front, open-air part of the south stand is
                   well endowed with exits but these all discharge onto
                   one passage.        This passage has a theoretical capacity
                   of only about -150 people per minute in each direction.
                   This gives an emptying time of 11 minutes.          . Because
                   the stand is open to the air and there is very
                   ready access to the pitch we do not think this rather
                   long emptying time is of any great consequence.

                 It will be r e c a l l e d that in recent years agreement
      has been reached with the police that 55,000 spectators might
      be admitted to the ground.            This involved of the order of
      19.000 - 20,000 spectators being on Spion Kop.                 Indeed,   xt       ,
      is" believed that in the days whe n crowds of approximately
      70.000 were a c c o m m o d a t e d in the ground,   the figure on Spxon

      Kop probably approached 30,000.
             It should also be emphasised that the ground has an
      excellent safety record stretching over very many years.

1.      Pnrnose of Meeting

Following the Working Party’s meeting with the representatives of the
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd. on 13th December, 1978, the
Secretary of the Club had (by letter dated 22nd January , 1979) circulated a
Report, together with Plans, drar^n up by ur. W. Eastwood of Eastwood
and Partners. The Secretary had also suggested a meeting on Friday,
16th February, 1979, to discuss the documents. .             _

The purpose of today's meeting was to consider the views which the Working
Party should put to the Club on the 16th February..


2.      Plans

 fcO     Whilst the ’’Notes for the Guidance of Applicants’’ stated that detailed
 plans at 1:100 scale should be supplied of ail buildings and other accommocaticn
 for spectators, some of the plans supplied were to 1:200 scale. The Fire
 Service felt that the latter size were acceptable provided ail of the plans were
 to the same scale, and it was A G B E E D that the "Notes for the Guidance of
 Applicants" should be amended to read plans to 1:200 scale.

 (b) • The site plan at 1:500 scale had not.been supplied as required by the
 Notes but Eastwood and Partners had undertaken to prepare this in time for
 Friday’s meeting. The firm had also promised that ail site fixtures would be
 'indicated on that plan.

Note of a meeting between the Officer Working Party (Sheffield D istrict) and the
                  Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.

            Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield: 18th April, 1979

PRESENT:       Representing the Club

               Dr. W. Eastwood (Consultant)
               E. England (Secretary)
               H. E. McGee (Chairman)
               R. Whitehead (Director)

               Representing the Working Party

               F.   Davis (South Y orkshire County Fire Service)
               D.   Hurst (South Y orkshire P olice)

Apologies for absence were received from Dr. H. Bailey (Sheffield Area Health
Authority) and H. E. Wright (South Yorkshire County Fire Service).

The Note (previously circulated) of the m eeting held on 2 ndApril, 1979, was considered
in conjunction with a Note (circulated at the meeting) of a meeting between Eastwood
and P artn ers, the South Y orkshire County F ire Service and the City of Sheffield
Metropolitan D istrict Council Building Surveyor’s Department held on 13th A pril, 1979.

The Note of the m eeting held on 2nd A pril, 1979, was agreed, subject to the following
amendments and additions in the light of the further investigations and d iscu ssion s:-

 2A     Spion Kop

 Paras. 1 & 2 - Revised copies of drawing no. 1 6 1 0 /K were circulated at the meeting
 showing the proposed new crush barrier layout, including the two lines of radia
 barriers. T h i s was AGREED in principle.

 Para. 3 - A 16, 850 crowd capacity on the Kop a s existing would mean an unacceptable
 evacuation time of som e 12^ m inutes. Larger and re-aligned gates in the barrier ^
 and improvem ent of the existing upper exit could reduce this tim e to som e 1 0 minuses,
 but 8 minutes could only be achieved by installing a new exit of 3 m etre overall width.
 This could be integrated into the proposed future schem e for enlarging and roofing the
 Kop. The Club AGREED to give consideration to the proposals.
Para. 4 - The exploratory work regarding the Improvement of the headroom had
still to be carried out, but was not expected to be a major item.

P a ra . 5 - B ecause o f the difficulty in devising a suitable method of testing in places
(such as the top of the Kop), it was AGREED that proposals should be formulated
after further d isc u ssio n s between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

P ara. 6 - The Club accepted that the concrete required attention and that the scoreboard
structure should be looked at. It was AGEEED that the question of the height of som e
of the crush b a rriers be considered again after it was seen which of them failed on
testing.                                                                       •

p a r a . 7 - The Club s tr e s s e d that their proposals for the improvement of the means of
e g r e s s would hopefully be carried out in the shorter rather than the longer term future.

P a ra. 8 - The Club hoped that the testing of the existing crush barriers., together with .
the installation of the new crush b arrier layout and alteration of the gates in the existi
b a rrier, could a ll be carried out in the c lo se sea so n . Their aim was to achieve a
16, 850 crowd capacity.

2B         West Terrace

Para 2 - The Club accepted that in view of the c r o s s -fa ll on the north-w est corner
exit, the step s should be re-b u ilt. It was AGEEED that the other m atters would be
considered again after it was seen which of the crush barriers failed on testing.

 2C        North West Corner Terrace

 P a ra . 2 - Whilst accepting the need for the improvement or replacem ent of the
 existing corrugated sheeting, the Club felt they wished to consider whether to carry
 out m ore extensive works s o as to bring the existing unused area into use fo r an
 additional 250/300 sp ectators.

 3.        North Stand

 P a ra . 1 - Dr. Eastwood, the Building Surveyors and the F ire Service had reached
 agreem ent on a schem e which could be recommended to the Club. This would
 involve the rem oval of 10 sea ts from each of the 9 gangways and 4 sea ts from in
 front of each of the 9 upper e x its. The resu lt would mean a lo s s of 126 sea ts
 compared to the 225 in the original proposals. The ClubAGEEED to £ v e
 consideration to the proposal.

 Para 2 - The word at the end o f the fir st line should have been ’T ea’ and not ’T eam ’.
 It w a s AGEEED that Dr. Eastwood and the F ire Service would discuss in detail any
 fir e protection works considered to be n e c e s s a r y .
•A1


      4.     W est Stand

      The Club AGREED that additional exits o f sim ple steel consti’uction should be
      provided from each end of the upper stand.

      5.     South Stand

      Para. 1 - The bases of two stanchions had been exposed by removing floor tim ber.
      Whilst rusting was not e x c e s siv e , it was AGEEED   that all bases would be exposed for
      inspection and, if necessary, ste e l plating will be welded to any corroded parts before
      encasing in concrete for permanent protection. B ecause of the apparent accumulation
      of w aste paper, wood shavings and cigarette ends beneath the floor boards, the
      Club a lso AGEEED that the space beneath the timber floor should be cleaned out.

      Para. 2 - Provided the penning barriers were removed entirely, it was AGEEED that
      it would not be n e c essa ry to rem ove any seats for escape purposes in the upper part
      of the stand (the covered area).

      Para. 3 - It was AGEEED that timber handrails should be provided down each of the
      outer edges of the main staircaSer that the existing iron centre railing should remain,
      and that a new handrail down the centre of each side of the stairway should be installed.
      It was a lso AGEEED that the brick sta ir c a s e w alls should be buttressed where crowd
      surge p ressu re could be generated.

      Para 4 - So far as the front open air part of the stand was concerned, it was AGEEED
      that on the w est side a new exit through a new 1 .2 m etre wide door adjacent to the existing
      snack bar should be provided, with appropriate fire resistance m easures in the
      surrounding a r ea . On the e a s t side, consideration was given to an extension of the
      footway at the front of the stand and the rem oval of the wall, provided the new exit was
      isolated from the Kop exit. It was AGEEED that Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service
      should consider p recisely what m ea su res could be considered satisfactory so as to
      avoid any lo ss of s e a ts.

       6.     Ground Exits

       The 1:500 s ite plan was in the p ro cess of being circulated.

       7.      Communications

       The Club s t r e s s e d they w ere thinking in t e r m s of an upgrading of the existing; public
       address s y s t e m . It was AGREED that the Police should have an over-rid e f c             j
       from their P o lic e Boom, and Dr. Eastwood undertook to look into the possibi ty
       achieving this through radio, rather than w ire, means.

       8.       p o lic e and F ir st Aid F acilities

       Paras 1 & 2 - The P olice s tr e s s e d that it was essential that there was no gap in
       the provision of P olice F ac ilitie s when the temporary structure was replaced }
       the permanent structure. With this in mind, they were happy for the safety a&pec

to receive first priority and to wait for the 19S0 close season for the w o r k to be
carried out. It was understood that Dr. Eailey had not yet completed his investigations
Into the first-aid and medical facilities.


9.       A n y other Topics

The evening of the 27th April was agreed as mutually convenient to test the existing
emergency lighting equipment.


10.'     Future Action

M r . M c G e e stressed that it wa s essential for decisions to be taken urgently if the
Club were to complete their plans, both from a. financial and practical point of view.


The Club were to m a k e application   for financial assistance under the Football
Association's Ground Improvement Scheme, and had to have over 50,000 crowd
capacity if the a i m of attracting international matches was to be achieved. The latest
proposals, if implemented, appeared to give a capacity of s o m e 50,750.

So that they could be noted and returned for agreement, the Working Party asked for
2    copies of all plans (as revised) to be supplied by Dr. Eastwood, especially to the
Fire Service and the Euilding Surveyor.

M r . M c G e e requested that he be advised if it appeared that any undue delay was
occurring as the Club wished to ensure that the certification procedure proceeded without
delay.             .

With regard to future meetings I think it is essential that all matters agreed
              ac^ws are now approaching finality in many areas and it is ncceyca
b e ""recorded,
thct w e have recorded exactly the agreed matters.

X w o u l d also suggest that in view of the approach of certification it would,
perhaps, be advisable to hold future meetings away from the ground, and that
Hr. Vauchan, as the co-ordinator, should chair such meetings.

Yours faithfully,

       ,^G.     General Structural Matters
•     J                                               •



    l'w-        1.        All crush barriers, balustrade walls, fences and railings to be tested
                          and replaced, or strengthened, where necessary.

                 2.       Provision of handrails and suitable headroom to egress routes to be
                          re-assessed after re-routing of gangways etc. has been carried out.


           H.   Em e r g e n c y Lighting

                 1.       The areas shaded yellow on the plan to be covered by a 3 hour m i n i m u m
                          duration emergency lighting system conforming to B S 5266 Part 1 1975 -
                          'The E m e r g e n c y Lighting of Premises'.


                 2.       The use of a double pole switch connecting the emergency lighting
                          system to s o m e essential lighting circuit e.g. bar lights is strongly
                          r e c o m m e n d e d thereby ensuring that the emergency lighting is always
                          switched on.

                                                           3.
I.   Fire Warning- System


     The suitability and type of system to be decided w h e n further discussions have
     taken place.


J.   Fire Extinguishers

     Fire fighting hand appliances are to be installed where indicated by a triangle
     on the attached plan. The colour of the triangle determines the type of
     appliance required. (Please see attached legend). It m a y be that equipment
     is already provided in the building, and the plan shows the final complement
     of appliances.

     T w o gallon water extinguishers to be wall mounted so that the handle is
     approximately one metre f rom floor level. T h e 5lb. dry powder extinguishers
     and glass fibre blanket to be wall mounted, the extinguishers being mounted at
     approximately light switch level.

K.   General Fire Precautions

     1.     All walls and ceilings inside the stands and along escape routes to be
            class 'O' surface spread of flame.

     2.     Provide isolating valves on the pipeline leading to the gas cookers at
            the point adjacent to the escape route f r o m the counter area.


     3.     Quantities of waste paper w ere discovered under the seating in the
             stand. This should be removed and placed in a satisfactory storage
            area.


L.   Training of Safety Stewards and Staff

     T o ensure that the Safety Stewards and Staff are conversant with the safety
     precautions they will be expected to administer, a meeting should be arranged
     with the Fire Service, suitable to all parties.


M.   Notices - Exit Signs

     1.     These signs to have suitable sized white lettering on a green background,
             the size of lettering to be agreed on site.

             T h e position of the exit signs are indicated on the plans by a green
             rectangle containing the letter 'E*.

     2.     If the proposed rewiring of the emergency lighting system is adopted
             as discussed by Mr. Clough and Divisional Officer Jones then, with the
             reduced lighting output, it m a y be necessary to provide a n u m b e r of
             illuminated exit boxes.


                                          4.
Eme r g e n c y Procedure

Eme r g e n c y procedure notices should be placed at strategic points throughout
the ground.


Access for E m e r g e n c y Vehicles

1.       Adequate roads should be provided to ensure that speedy and direct
         access can be obtained by emergency vehicles to all exterior parts of
         the stadium.

2.       Ensure that parked vehicles will not obstruct emergency vehicles on
         these access roads.


Public Address System

T h e existing public address system to be upgraded, with the Police having an
over-ride facility from their Police R o o m .


Police Facilities

A suitable permanent Police R o o m (with facilities as shown on the sketch plan
m a r k e d A A ) to be provided in the 1980 close season.


First Aid Facilities


(i)      Structure

         T h e existing facilities are considered to be below an acceptable standard
         and it is suggested the Club consider providing a m o r e permanent
         structure which is not likely to require up-grading for a very long time.
         The internal finish, particularly of the Treatment area, should be of an
         impervious nature so that it can be easily cleaned and rendered fairly
         sterile and require no decoration. This can be achieved by the use of
         tiles or formica type finish etc....


(ii)     Waiting Area

          T h e Waiting A rea could be arranged within corridor space to minimise
          the cost, where sitting cases could wait for attention on chairs.


 (iii)   Treatment A rea

          The Treatment A r e a should be sufficient to accommodate two or three
          patients at any one time, and consideration should be given to the needs
          for privacy within the treatment area, bearing in mind that the three
          patients m a y well be lying on couches.
(iv)      Lighting'

          Good lighting is essential and strip lighting would be satisfactory.      The
          provision of a power point would also be a basic requirement.


(v)       Water


          A supply of hot and cold water is essential; the cold water suitable
          for drinking. A hand basin and a large Belfast type sink should also
          be provided. The Club might consider whether it would be cheaper in
          the long run to provide stainless steel basins which are not subject to
          chipping.


(vi)      Toilet Requirements


          T h e Club should provide at least one male and one female toilet, for
          the use of the public, and should consider whether they should provide
          an additional toilet for the use of the staff.


(vii)     Storage


          Storage facilities are required for six stretchers, and for two sets of
          wheels for stretchers, blankets and other bed linen.         This storage should
          be lockable.

(viii)    Equipment

          T h e following is a m i n i m u m list to provide a basic service.—


          Treatment couches with lift up ends, two or three in n u m b e r depending
          on space available and/or n u m b e r of cubicles, if the accommodation is
          cubicled.


          Six Stretchers.

          T w o sets of stretcher wheels.

          20 Blankets.

          Six Pillows.

          One Minute-Man Resuscitator.

(ix)     , Telephone Facilities

          A telephone facility would appear to be basic in 1979. This could be
          achieved by an extension from the m a i n switch, or by sharing with
          police.




                                        6.
(x)      Car Parking


        T h e Club might also consider what facilities could be extended to the
         St. John's personnel for the parking of staff cars. •


C r owd Capacity

The following numbers will be considered to be satisfactory, provided that the
r e c o m m e n d e d w o r k as detailed above is carried out:-

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975

Following approval by the County Council and clarification of certain
structural aspects of the South Stand construction, I am now able to 5.
issue the attached General Safety Certificate in respect of the H i l i s b v
Stadium.

As previously mentioned to you, the fee payable has yet to be dotermirw
the County Council and I will, of course, contact you further on this y
as soon as possible.

I would particularly draw your attention to the following paragrapr.s c
Schedule 2 of the Certificate:-

8(1)     -    tha existing First Aid facilities are accepted on an interim b
              only pending the erection of purpose-built facilities in tic-
              close season;

12(1)    - the arrangements for Emergency Lighting in the South Scano '.a
            out in the letter from Messrs. Eastwood & Partners to the Sou
           Yorkshire County Fire Service dated 12th December, 1979) axe
            regarded as acceptable only for the duration of the e x i s t i n g
           batters-7 life;

 14      - the existing Police facilities are accepted on an interim bas
           pending the erection of purpose-built facilities in the I:.*SO
            season;

 30      - use of the Stadium in excessively high wind conditions
                                 and
         - use of the Stadium in excessively high snowfall conditions.

Perhaps you would also treat this letter as the formal notice of issue
by Paragraph 7 cf the Safety of Sports Grounds Regulations 1976.

             Dear Mr. Mallett,

             SAFETY O F SPORTS -GROUNDS' ACT 1975'

             Further to your letter of the 31st March, my Chairman
             is away for another three or four weeks; so you will
             appreciate that X cannot give you Board decisions or
             opinions.  My personal reaction is surprise, as under
             the above act work has been going on continuously since
             it was started last summer and at no time do X feel
             that the Club have lagged behind in its actions to do
             everything that has been promised to be done.

             To take Item 4 of your letter - this is very much in
             the progress, and we are in the hands of the contractors.

             As. regards the training of safety stewards, this was being
             left until the warning system was installed. However2 on
             receipt of your letter I did- contact Mr, Vaughan and
             suggested that if he would like to contact the County -
             Fire Sc-rvJ.ce, all ox xr. stewards v-outd fa?, p . t the ground
             for our match on Easter Monday, and that wiyht be foi
             opportunity to deal with this particular .item. 'XL*
             officers of the Fixe Merv5.ce had intimated to .tae
             previously that any           v?ould be suitabj. to them „

      Dear Mr. Vaughan, ■         .... ....       ....V:

                    Mr. England has sent me a copy of                                                ,y°u r l e tte r o f           31
      March and of his reply dated 3 April.
           I am in a little difficulty in replying to some of the                                                                                .
      points raised as Mr. Clough is on holiday until Tuesday, 8
      April, and Mr. Strange is away until Monday, 14 April.
      Because we are carrying out re-wiring in the South Stand
       and Mr. Clough is better equipped to deal with the comments on
       the Exit signs I will delay replying until he returns.
                    With regard to the comments from the Building Control
       department I may need to reply in greater detail when John
       Strange returns from holiday.-                                                  . However, my            first           comments

       are as follows.
        (i) The cracks between the door frames and supporting wall
                     will be re-inspected.                                           I can only assume ’that this is
                     something which was not noticed in the inspection which
                     we made and the inspections which were -made by the
                     Building Control department at the end of the work.                                                                    It
                     may be that due to shrinkage of the timber a slight
                   • gap has opened since that time.'                                                 We will, of course, have

                  the cracks mortared or covered if this is needed, but
                  might I suggest that minor matters of this kind do not
                  need a letter or need to be dealt with between the
                  periodic inspections which you and we will be carrying
                  out.   . After all the next inspection is less than three         .
                  months a w a y .


       •(ii) i have not been able to discuss the paint used on the
o      r      -      i     '    t    i   Gil'S

                  closed down until 14 April.         However, one of my assistants
                  believes that M r .. Sherriff has recently told Mr. Strange
                  that Mr. Mills saw a painter with a tin of Duliix instead
                  of the Nullifire which we specified.        It would have been
                  appreciated if a telephone call had been made at the time
                  so that we could have-checked with certainty and if
                  necessary taken corrective action.        I will write to you
                  again on this point.


     ’ (iii) Mr. strange mentioned that Mr. Sherriff had queries in a
                  recent telephone conversation whether wired glass has been
                  used where appropriate.         Mr. Strange said that so far
                  as we kn o w wired glass had been used everywhere that the
                  fire officer had requested it, and that the fire officer               <■
                  had .of course, made his own inspection.        The conversation
                  had ended with Mr. Sherriff saying that he would check with
                  the fire officer.


           (iv) We presume that the reference to ’clearance’ refers to
                  the vertical headroom.         It will be recalled that some
                  ingenuity was needed to devise this particular exit, as
                  we were constrained by the levels in the existing stand
                  and the level of the top of the terracing and the exit
                  route.       Our drawings and calculations were submitted to            v
• ’       •   -                                                                      sheet   3.

                    the Building Control department for comment.           They
                    inspected during construction and after the work was
                    completed.       I am not amused by the fact that the
                    headroom is now being queried.          In any case this is
                    a matter for the fire officer, not the Building Control
                    department.      With regard to the sharp edges I suggest
      |             we leave the matter until the inspection in June/July
                    as the season is now almost over, and there is no
                    time to agree further work and have it carried out before
.                   tne" season'-enasr "V                                          •


              (v)   The perimeter fencing       at the north-east c o m e r of the
                    Spion Kop has been appraised for condition "and strength.
                    Bearing in mind the likely pressures at that location,
                    the tests which we carried out where possible, and that
                    we are dealing with_ an existing ground, the fence is
                    satisfactory in my opinion.


 ^            (vi) We will look at the step obstruction, but again unless
                    this is something which is obviously dangerous           (in
                    which case I would have expected the matter to be raised
                    last December)     suggest that discussion be left until the
                    J u ne/J uly .inspection.


              (vii) The mesh fencing under the North stand was         discussed
                    with Mr. Jones of the fire service and he,         like me, was
                    satisfied that there is no hazard which justifies the
                    making of changes.


                    I will write to you again after Mr. Clough returns from
              holiday.
                                                          Yours sincerely,    ■

                   I have now been able to talk with Mr. Clough regarding
    . the exit signs and have pleasure in replying to your points

     Para ii
                   I find the exit signs were erected under the supervision
     of John Strange who is still                                                     on holiday.                    I have quickly
     looked through the certificate of ground safety and have not
     been able to find any reference to lettering size.                                                                            Because
     you do not say which exit signs have not been sited in
     accordance with the plans it is a little difficult for me to
     comment and I suggest this matter be left in abeyance until
     John Strange returns..                                           With regard to the illumination of the
     exit signs, it may be that you are unaware that we are rewiring
     the South Stand and it may -be that the signs you have in mind
     will be appropriately illuminated by both systems when this
     work is complete.

  Para iii
           We have not been able to understand what it is
  which you say does not comply with the requirements
  of paragraph 12 of the certificate.        The agreement
  with the Fire Service      (Mr. K. Jones) was set out in our
  letter of 12 December.        So far as we can see the only
    ossible variation from that agreement is that because
  « £ the rewiring which is now taking place tfe did not
  implement the agreed measures in the 'case of the two exits


  December.           '                     ‘


  Para iv
       The fire warning system is complete except for the
  supply of the trickle charger and battery equipment.          These
  • items were ordered some months ago and if the original
  delivery dates had been adhered to would have been installed
  by now.      Unfortunately the suppliers have failed to
  deliver on time.        We have been applying appropriate pressure
  Q kd    the latest information is as set out in the attached
  copy letter from our electrical contractors which was dated
  24 March.       As you will see from this, two of the four
  outstanding items have very likely been delivered by now
  bu t the signal indicator panel was not expected for four ■
  weeks from 24 Mar.ch and the industrial batteries complete
  with steel stand and ancillary equipment was due to'be
  delivered by Friday, 25 April.


           I understand that there is to be a meeting at the ground
  on Thursday, 10 April, when these can no doubt be discussed.


                                      Yours sincerely,

          Purpose of Meeting

 view of the F A Cup Semi-Final at Hillsborough on 12th April and following recent
sits by the disciplines represented on the Working Party, the Chief Executive of the  ^
mth Yorkshire County Council had raised with the Club by letter aated 31st Marca v^:cu~
atters which apparently were still outstanding.

 letter of reply dated 3rd April had been received from the Club, as well as letters catea
.h and 8th April from the Club's Consultants, M essrs., Eastwood and Partners, giving
     ills of the present position.

      ^   Inspection of Ground

he Working Party inspected the ground in company with the Club's representatives.

)         Training of Safety Stewards

           The Club had felt there was little point in pursuing the training of the Safety
           Stewards until the fire warning system had been completely installed, but with
           agreement the County Fire Service had instructed some stewards yesterday. •
           A°schedule specifying the duties and responsibilities was handed to the Club s
           represe ntatives.

i)        Exit Signs

              The Club's representatives felt that the exit signs generally had been sited where
              required and were of adequate size and/or illuminated.

              It was agreed that there were a number which could be more advantageously sited
              and/or illuminated, and some which might be more effective with larger lettering

                                                        1.

E m ergency Lighting- in the South Stand

A s was evident, com plete r e-w irin g of Che South SUnd with separate circu its had
already com m enced, and the County Tire Service undertook to let M essrs. E asU ood
and Partners know their detailed req uirem en ts.

 F ire Warning System

The Fire Warning System had been in stalled , except for the trickle charger ana
battery equipment. T hese item s had been subject to delivery p roblem s, but he
s y ste m s h o u ld be com plete by the end of the month.

It was agreed that as regards the F .A . Cup Sam i-Final, the Police Communications
b a se which would be at the ground would a lso be used for Fire Service purposes if
 n e c essa ry .                 ‘                                                                 J

b a l i n g of F ire R esistin g Fram es

  Th» sealing c l ths fire r e s is tin g door-frames against the supporting wajls had generally
' b een carried out," but there w_ere a sm a ll number which were now showing, signs o .
 s m a ll gaps.

 F ir s Eetardent Paint

 The Club pointed out that "Nullifire" fir e retardent paint had been specified on trie
 partitions within the South Stand but, as the Contractors were on holiday until
 14th A pril, it was not p o ssib le to say with certainty at this time whether it  acta-.lv ^
 been used.

 Wired Glass

 The Club pointed out that to the b est of their knowledge wired glass had been used
G ie r e v e r required by the County F ire S e r v ic e.

 The Countv F ire Service and the P olice w ere generally satisfied that the sm all panes
 of g la ss in the upper half of the wooden partitions within the South Stand wou^ no i
 normal circum stances be regarded a s a fir e a n d /o r safety hazard The Club       -
 the longer term to consider the fitting of w ired g la s s and, in the short te r m ,
 consider fitting wooden battons as an interim m e a su r e.

  Sharp Edges to Steelwork on South-West Stand_

 Whilst there w ere a number of sharp c o rn er s on the supports, these w ere at a height
 Of at le a st s e v e n fe e t. However, the Club undertook to round them off.

  P erim eter Fencing on the Spion Kop

  The Club pointed out that this had been tested where feasible and the r esu lts forwarded
  to the Chief Executive in January. A copy had been passed to the Building          o iu
  30th January.                                    .   *

     Whilst it was agreed that the erection of the b a rriers at the Upper Exit Area had left
     a sm all adjacent area of approximately one foot wide by four foot long at a low er level
     tha" the remainder of-the exit, it was felt that its position coupled with the crowd
     flow at that point meant that it did not unduly create an hazard. However, the Club
     undertook to give attention to it in the longer term .

    . Mesh Fencing under North Stand

     In view of the normal crowd flow rates on the public side of the m esh fencing and the
     fact that there was no public a c c e s s to its r e a r , it was felt that the timber framea .

1.           Purpose ofMeeting                                 _■           .   .

-Bearing in mind -the -F-.A.'-Cup-Semi-Final which, was to tike place on Saturday.-
 H t h April, 1981, it was felt it would be desirable for the Working Party to
 visit the ground, .especially as‘a small number'of matters had arisen since the
last visit on 10th February, 1981.

2.     ~~ Inspection'of'Ground

 (a)   ' South Stand

The previous comments relating to the roof structure and the exterior windows in
the Ladies’ Toilets below the stand were still applicable.

The X..P.G. cylinders had been removed from beneath the Stand, and tne b<=.u<.eries
supplying the emergency power supply for the police address had bean enclosed^ m
a satisfactory fire resisting metal case. Whilst^the provision of an automatic
battery charger would be a longer term solution, in the short term arrangements^
had been made for the batteries' to be charged before each game and for the public
address system to be checked relying only on the emergency battery supply. The
indicator for the batteries condition was presently m the Public Address_Bo:<-
It was suggested that it would be less likely to      be overlookedifthe indicator
was sited adjacent to the new metal case for thebatteries -

 (b)       West 'Stand

 As previously agreed, the Club would round off the steel supports to the new
 emergency exit (nearest to the South Stand) as soon as a grinder was next present
 at the ground.

 The c r a c k e d ' brickwork at'the rear of the stand which required pointing, the
 apparent distress on the concrete pillar supporting the steps at^the. rear of the
 stand, the cracks in the concrete ?,t the' top'bo both sets of stairs, as well as
 the currently slight corrosion-in the base plate of^the outer steel column
 (nearest to the South Stand) had all been' included in the maintenance programme
 and would be undertaken shortly.-


                                                       1   .
The cracking of the concreting had been attended to by injecting material from
the top. The results had been satisfactory, except in two snail areas where
water seepage had obviously taken, place and which would receive further
attention.

_(d)    North Stand

The expansion cracks which had appeared in the wall of the North Stand (nearest
to the* Spion Kop) had been included in the maintenance schedule and would be
attended to shortly.

 (e)     Spion ’Kop

The infilling of the step adjacent to the handrail on the left of the original
exit at the top of the Kop would be given attention in the close season.

Whilst the brick built chip shop at -the bottom o'f the new exit fron the Kop had
been erected, it was not yet in use.’ It was noted that the siting of the
chip shop had resulted in a possible danger to spectators in that a gap into
which spectators could be pushed,•or possibly stumble because of the camber, had
been created.  As regards the F.A. Cup Semi-Final,

-IT WAS AGREED          •      -•          -- '

that a temporary barrier o f ■scaffolding tubes should be erected between the end
of the new Kop exit outer barriers and the concrete pillar of the lowest of tne
Kop original exit steps. In the longer uerm, the existing barriers would neec.^
extending to fill the gap and ideally, the area between the bottom or the ne.* Xc
exit staircase and the original Kop exit steps should be levelled o n .

 3 ______ Ground Evacuation Frocelure

 Whilst the Club had been supplied with a Schedule on "tire Instruction and Drill
 on 9th April, 1930, consultations between.the County Fire Service and the South
 Yorkshire Police had resulted in the production of an "emergency Evacuation
 Procedure".  The Club undertook to circulate copies of the procedure to all
 Stewards who would be on duty for the F.A. Cup Semi-Final-

                            EMERGENCY EVACUATION PROCEDURE


   The following notes of guidance are prepared and Issued to assist all
   official stewards and others in a position of responsibility at the
   Hillsborough Stadium on the action to be taken a nd’procedures to be followed
   in the event of the possibility of evacuation of the stadium during the
   playing of a game when spectators are present. The notes are not intended to .
   be a comprehensive list of all tha action necessary, but are for personal
   issue to each steward and for retention by the steward for immediate ref­
   erence all the time hs/she is on duty at the stadium.

     It is appreciated that the reasons evacuation may become necessary are many
     and varied, but the most obvious are fires or Information that explosive/
__ .^incendiary devices have been placed somewhere within the stadium/ground.
        t information may be received or discovered either by members of .the staff
        the stadium, or by telephone to the stadium, police., local or national
     newspapers.

   FOR THE DECISION.TQ. -EVACUATE ALL OR PART'OF THE-GROUND'-RESTS-WITH-,THE SENIOR
   MANAGEMENT OF THE CLUB.    (The senior police officer on duty will be in a
   position to aaviae as to whether the ’bomb call’ is likely to be genuine or
   not) .

   Whenever such information becomes known, a message will be relayed to
   police officer on duty in the "P. A- Commentary Box” at the ground, who, on
   instructions from the senior police officer, and irrespective of whether
   the match is in progress or not, will cause the record 'THREE BLIND MICE* to
   be played over the loudspeaker system.

   The playing of that record will indicate to everyone present at the ground, > ‘
   other than spectators, that a possible emergency situation exists.

          £lS part of the regular pre-match brief of referees and linesmen and
          both teams, this information should be passed to then so that the
          game officials are also aware of the possibility of an interruption in
          play and the significance of the playing of the record.

   On hearing that record all club stewards will make their way to their des­
   ignated duty points on gangway s/gates/exits, etc. Those on exit gates will
   ooen the gates and remain at that point. "During this period senior
 • officials will consider the nature of the emergency alleged and will decide
   to evacuate all/Dart of the stadium.- Once that decision has been taken, but
   not until, the senior police officer on duty will cause a spoken message to
   jje relayed over the -IP. A. System" which will have the effect of.

    (1)   Stopping the gane and removing players from the field of play;

    (2)   Informing the spectators/officials of the prccise nature of the
          emergency and its location if known, and requesting all or specified
          sections of the public to leave their seats and make their way out of
          the ground by the nearest normal exit route unless specifically directed
           to do otherwise by means of the "P. A. System .          y
    IT IS STRESSED THAT NO EVACUATION WILL TAKE PLACE EXCEPT ET EXTREME
    EMERGENCY AND ALTHOUGH THE PREPARATORY WARNING RECORD 'THREE BLIND MICE'
    MAY BE PLAYED, THERE IS EVERY POSSIBILITY THAT INITIAL ENQUIRIES WILL
    ESTABLISH THE PERPETRATION OF A EOAX, ETC. , AND IN THAT CASE.. INSTEAD OF
    A SPOKEN MESSAGE TO E V A C U A T E T E E FACT THAT THE E51ERGENCY HAS PASSED
    WILL BE INDICATED BY THE PLAYING OF THE RECORD - 'TEDDY BEARS PICNIC'.
    ON HEARING THIS 'ALL CLEAR' STEWARDS ON EXIT GATES AND GANGWAYS WILL
    REMAIN ON STAND-BY AT THAT POINT FOR FIVE MINUTES BEFORE CLOSING THE GATES
    AND RESUMING THEIR NORMAL DUTY POSITIONS.

    In the event of any steward/club official discovering a fira or receiving
    information that an emergency situation exists within tha ground, he will
    immediately -

     (i)    Notify the Club Secretary by telephone;

    (ii)    Inform any police officer.

^iii)       Ea nust also, on discovering a fire, activate the fira alarm system

It was noted that the monitoring device to-be sited adjacent to the ne% ^
m®tal case for the batteries supplying the emergency power supply for tr.e
public address system (referred to at the meeting on 7th April) had yet to
be provided.

(b)    West Stand

Th« cracked brickwork at the rear of the stand, as well as the apparent
distress on the concrete pillars supporting the steps at the rear of tne
stand and the cracks in the concrete at the top of both sets O l stairs,
had been made good.

As previously agreed, as soon as a grinder was next present at the Stadium
the Club would round off the steel supports to the new emergency exit
(nearest to the South Stand)•

Following experiences at the F.A. Cup Semi-Final match, the Club were
considering revised arrangements on the terracing m front of the Stand.
An assurance was given that the Officer Working Party would be consulted
when these had substance.
  (c)    North-West Terrace

 The two small areas where water seepage had continued to take place after
 treatment had now been satisfactorily treated.

 new Kop exit" outer barriers and the concrete pillar of the lowest of the
 Kop original exit steps(adjacent to     the new brick built chip shop) prior
 to the F.A. Cup Semi-Final match remained. However, the Club intended to
 extend the existing barriers to fill the gap on a permanent basis and to
 level off the area between the bottom of the new Kop exit staircase and the
 original Kop exit steps    prior to the commencement of the forthcoming season.

                                   Radial Fences at Leppings Lane End

               Yfe have been instructed by the Club to organise the
 installation of two radial fences on the terrace at the
 Leppings lane end of the ground.

               It is intended that these fences are so positioned
, that they divide this section of the terrace‘into
  approximately three equal areas, each served by its own
Entrance                 .
               By dividing the terrace more control over supporters
 should result.                           A visiting team with only a few followers
 will be allocated one section, with.the other two sections
 retained by the home supporters.

               Larger contingents of visiting spectators could be
  accommodated in two or all three areas as their numbers
  dictate.
                pt 1.15 metre wide                                gate is proposed at the rear of
  each fence to give access for maintenance and also policing
  during a game.                           The gate could be left open, but fastened
  back, to connect the areas during a game if adjacent ones


                                                                 Registered in England - No. 1134531
EASTWOOD &■ PARTNERS




      are accupied by supporters of the same team.                  When establishing
      the height we have considered that the views to the corner
      flags should not be restricted any further than they are at
      present by the perimeter fence.             We therefore propose that the
      top of the fence should be approximately 16SOmm above the
      terrace.

           This may not prevent the odd spectator climbing the fence
      but should eliminate a mass invasion from one area to the other.
      Fences this height appear to work successfully at St. James's
      Park, the home of Newcastle United.

  ^       We would be pleased if this specific point can be discussed
      within the Working Party and your comments forwarded to us.

      various locations’ around the north "stand. *'Now the gymnasium is -
      open to the general public security toother parts of the ground
      must be maintained.        It is proposed that gates are provided at
      the top of the ramps at both ends of the stand with additional
      gates at ground floor level at the Penistone Road end of the
      stand.     A separate gate will be placed behind 4:he west ramp to.
      prevent people going round the rear of the gymnasium towards
      Leppings Lane.

              The purpose of "the meeting was to consider the letter dated 2nd September
              and plans submitted b y Messrs. Eastwood and Partners-on behalf of the^
              Sheffield Wednesday Football CluB Ltd. relating to the proposed erection
              of Radial Barriers on the West Terrace for crowd control purposes and
              Security Gates at various locations around the North Stand now that the
              gymnasium was open to the general public.                     .    ...

              2..        Radial Barriers on West Terrace                                                                               ....

              Wnilst there were drawbacks to the divisioji of the terrace into
                                                                                                                                                                             V
              approximately three equal areas, each served by its own entrance, the
                                                                                                                                                                             T-
              Working Party felt that increased control on the Terrace snould^result
              from the proposals. For instance there could well be problems with      .
              opposing fans mixing at the rear of the West Stand and/or the final exit
              gates, but the police considered that they could cope with any proolems
                  of this nature.

                  Tne adequacy and positioning of the gates to be installed at the rear of
                  the radial barriers was also discussed, as well as the use of tne     ^
                  existing gates in the pitch perimeter security fence at the front of tne
                                                                                                                                                               ill
                  It was noted that the plans submitted did not indicate the amount of head­
                  room which would be available_at the rear of the Terrace should .the
                  radial barriers and gates be installed.

                  IT WAS AGREED that Mr. Vaughan should notify Messrs. Eastwood and Partners
                  that* the" Officer Working Party sees no objection to the proposals to m s t a l
                  two 1680mm high radial barriers, with 1.15 metre wide gates at the rear,
                  on the West Terrace at the Hillsborough Stadium, subject to.

                           (i)-       the further calculations required by the Building
                                      Authority being satisfactory;

                           (ii)       confirmation that adequate headroom will be
                                       available at the rear of the Terrace, and

                           (iii)      the new gates at the rear of the Terrace also                                                "being
                                       under police control.

 3.    Other Matters

' Two other matters were also raised by the Officer Working Party relating
  to the Police and First Aid Facilities and the siting of certain of taa
 Lottery Tickat Boxes._

 (a)   Police and First Aid Facilities

       It was recalled that t h e ..existing unsatisfactory police and first ^
       aid facilities under the.North Stand had been accepted on an interim
       basis on the' understanding that’ the Club would provide purpose b u n t
       replacement facilities in the 1980 close season.

       It is appreciated that discussions on the detailed requirements are^
       still continuing, but it is filt that the Club should be       to give
       a firm indication when the new police and first aid faciliu.es a.e to ..
       be provided.
 (b)   Lottery Ticket Boxes

       Concern was expressed as to the blocked egress which could result it

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.

Ir realy to your letter dated 14th December, 1981, I understand that _
the Building Authority has contacted your office direct for clarification
or a snail number of points regarding the proposed installation o_ pai-o
of o-ates at the bottom of the two staircases at the back or the fcesu ^
Stand.   Subject to the satisfactory resolution of these points^ana, o-
course, to the gates being secured in the fully open position curing t: a
t.j_3 the public oarts of the stadiua are occupied when matcnes are
being played, the Officer Working Party has no objection to tne^roposa.s^

As regards the radial fences installed on the’West Terrace and the_ _
security gates around the North Stand, the Officer Working Party visr.es
to make the following comments:-

(_)          Radial Barriers on West Terrace

The catches played at the stadium since ;the installation of the barriers
cc-^i-r <-haf thev apoear to be working veil ard satisracteril} e ^ e c t
segregation of opposing groups of fans. However the entire section o,
the Terrace has yet to be given to one group or fans.

Thp Police infora me that, on installation of the new radial barriers, _
th» ex1'sting crush barriers have been extended in some places u? to a..a
comoletely through the new radial barriers at a height or * 6 or w
fT-or th° ground.- The effect is to make it very easy for fans to cli—
froa one pen to another.   In *t-her places the existing crusa barrier
rails have been cut off short of the racial barriers m a m^r.ne-
1eaves dangerous pieces protruding into soae or the gangways.

 (5 )         Security Gates around the North Stand

You will recall that my                   letter of 14th September, 19SI stated that
provided that the gates                   and/or their supports, hin§ ^ ,         °
imoinae on the existing                   critical ramp widths, _tne Orficer Wo-<c.n0                    ]
saw no objection to the                   erection of the security gates.

 I a™. ’nformed that the manner in which the gates have been installed
 has resulted in each gate’s hinge impinging at least 7 2> ^         ^
 of the ramp. This means that there_is a 15 reduction m      -

means of escape on each ramp.

As the Annual winter inspection of the'Hillsborough Stadium is due
to take place anytime around now, I would suggest the opportunity be
taken to discuss these matters at the inspection.

Perhaps you would contact Hr. D. Vaughan of my staff (extension 422)
so that the necessary arrangements may be made.

• For the attention of' Mr. D. Vaughan'                                                                   •


  Dear Mr* Vaughan,
                                            Safety of Sports Ground Act
                     Thank you for your letter of 20 January.
                         I believe -the small number of points needing
  clarification have already been-discussed between
  John Strange and Mr. Sheriff.                                                          One of these refer to the
* ( 0 d for a goal post type frame over the gates but this is
-•rin fact already provided by the sheeting frame.                                                                           There is
  also a small amount of rust staining arising from misplacement
  of reinforcement in the 100mm thick retaining wall.                                                                            There
  is no immediate danger arising from this and an appropriate
  maintenance repair will be carried out.
                     Turning now to the-'radial'barriers on the West
  terrace it is of course accepted that where there is a
  crush barrier passing through or close to the radial barrier
  it will make it easier for anyone who so wishes to climb
  over.                  Nevertheless we believe it is not unreasonable to
  leave the crush barriers as they are.                                                                   If all barriers
  yg^e removed back to a distance say 1.2m from the fence it
  would mean a 2.4m wide gap which is not protected by barriers.


                                                              Registered in England - No. 1134531

      There would be a consequent loss of calculated spectator
      capacity which is undesirable from the Club's point of
      view.      However from the point of view of safety a strip
      of that width without a single crush barrier would be a
      major hazard.
                 It should be kept in mind that the introduction
      of these radial barriers has effected a very great
 '^improvement from the point of view of segregation of
      spectators but to achieve perfection from the point of
      view of segregation brings with it other disadvantages.
      _t..believe— that -what-^va JiaY£*rdpn?...is. .a_ r££isjonafclc._cciupro!iiio£-
  ''between the-'various interests. ■             "
                 In the second paragraph on this subject you
      refer to dangerous pieces of rails protruding from the
      crush barriers.         I have not had an opportunity to check
      this since receiving your letter but I am informed that
      the word    'dangerous' is a little exaggerated ana Uiey
      do not of course protrude into* a gangway as there is no
      gangway at this position.
■ ^              With regard to the security gates around the North
- • stand the point at issue is whether the encroachment into
      the gate width is at all c r i t i c a l _       The remaining clear
      width is 3.300mm which is equivalent to a six unit exit.
      Thus the theoretical number of people who can get out in
      eight minutes using the green book figure of 60 people
      per minute per exit width is 5 , 1 6 0          shared between the two
      routes.      The stand capacity is of course 10,000 and in
      practice more than half the number tend to use the lower
      exits since most spectators are reluctant to walk uphill
      to the upper set of exit stairways.                The picture is that
      fewer than 5,000 people will be trying to get out of
      exits which can accommodate 5,760 in eight minutes.
iASTW O O D & PARTNERS




               There were very good structural reasons for placing
    the gates in this way.                   The theoretical exit capacity has
    not been changed since it was always a six unit gateway.
    There is no funnelling effect, and there is a good
    'reservoir' area upstream of the gates.
               I                      telephoned your office yesterday but gather
    you were on leave and have again telephoned this morning
    with a view to agreeing a tentative date for the winter
^   meeting of the working party.                           I will try again in the
    next day or so.

                     Note of a Meeting held at the Hillsborough Stadium,
                         Sheffield on 4th February,   1982



    PRESENT:   Representing the-Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd

               E.  England          (Secretary)
               Dr. W. Eastwood       (Messrs. Eastwood & Partners)
               J.  Strange          (Messrs. Eastwood & Partners)

               Representing the Officer Working Party (Sheffield District)

               Ms. J. Barker           (South Yorkshire Police)
               R. HeroId               (South Yorkshire Police)

               D. Sheriff              (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District
                                        Council)
               D. Sumner               (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District
                                        Council)
               D . I . Vaughan         (South Yorkshire County Council)
               F. Waterhouse           (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)

           Purpose of Meeting ...

   The purpose of the meeting was to discuss'•■the apparent difference of opinion
   on certain aspects of the radial barriers installed on the West Terrace
   e n d the security gates at the top of the North stand ramps, as well as tc
   carry out the usual winter inspection o t the Stadium.

   2.      Ground Inspection

   A.      West Terrace

    Whilst the whole Terrace had yet to be used, the matches played since the
  e r e c t i o n of the radial barriers indicated that generally they worked well and
1 ^Pjitisfactorily effected the segregation of opposing groups of fans.

   However, the police pointed out that in _places the existing crush barriers
   had been extended up to and, in some cases, complete!} through the new
   radial'barriers, which had the effect of making it relatively easy for anyone
   who wished to do so to climb from one pen to another. Also, in the pen
   nearest to the South Stand, a small length of existing crush barrier had been
   left unsupported.

   IT WAS AGREED -

   (i)   That, on balance, it was preferable from a safety point of view to
   prevent crowd surge by the existing barriers being extended up to and/or
   through the new radial barriers than to completely prevent persons being
   able to climb from one pen to another, subject to review at the end of the
   current season.

    (ii)   That the unsupported small length of existing crush barrier would
   be cut off.

                                               -1 -
B.    West Stand '

One of the security gates which the Club wished to instal at the bottom of
the two staircases had now been erected.

IT WAS AGREED      that this could be regarded as satisfactory.

C.    North Stand

The Fire Service felt that the manner in which the security gates had been
installed at the top of the ramps unduly restricted the. exit width available.

The Club's Consultants and the Fire Service disagreed on the interpretation
of paragraph 16 of the "Green Guide", and consequently on the figure to be
applied°in the calculation for assessing whether the exit width lost at the top
of* the raasos by the method of security gate installation was critical or not.

IT WAS AGREED   that, as the point might well have been covered in the
initial consideration of the Club's application for a General Safety
Certificate, the point would not be pursued at the moment.

      NOTE -    A search of the file subsequently revealed that, as
               suspected, the point had been considered at a
               meeting of the Officer Working Party on 12.-2.79,
               the relevant part of the Note of the meeting jreading:-

       ' '         "the'construction and width of the"ramps being
                    such that they could quite.properly be
                    regarded as elevated roadways' .

D.     Spion Kop

•It was noted that the infilling of the step adjacent to the handrail on
 the left of the original exit at the top of the Koo had taken place: that
 tha boundary fence at the to? of the Kop had been reinforced, and that   the
 existing barriers had been permanently extended and the^area at the foot
 of the new Kop exit (adjacent to the brick built refreshment point)
levelled off as agreed.

^ •    South Stand

The agreement to visually inspect the roof trusses for apparent deflection
af(-er exceptional gale or snow loading conditions vas recalled.

F.    Items of General Maintenance

IT WAS AGREED      that the following items of general maintenance required
attention:-

(i)   The rounding off of the corners on the steelwork of the underside of
the exit at the southerly end of the WestStand   (to be done that day), as
well as the roundingoff of thebrackets to    the NorthStand securitygates.

 (ii) The repair or replacement of the corroding stanchions supporting the
 fencing and sheeting above the boundary wall on the right hand side of
 Gate "0".


                                          -2 -
 (iii)    Xhe cracks'in the concrete terracing of the Spion Kop   to be filled.

(iv)   The wooden support to the electrical line between the brick built
refreshment point and the Owls Club to be fixed more securely.

 (v)   The brick wall between the South Stand and the Spion Kop (nearest
 to the South Stand) to be pointed.

 (vi)   The concrete supporting strut to the wall between the Spion Kop and
 the South Stand (nearest to the Spion Kop) to be protected(cracks and
"exposed bar) .

G.       Temporary Structures

Concern was expressed as to the possibility of inadequate structural stability
of temporary structures, such as scaffolding used xn connection with
television transmissions.

Paragraph 20 of the Club’s General Safety Certificate required T.V. cameras
and portable equipment to be placed only in such positions as may be agreea
between the Police and the Club.   The Club also weregenerally required to
ensure that the Stadium complied with good engineering andbuildingpractices
and with the relevant British Standard Specification or Code of Practice.

IT W\S AGREED        that the question of temporary structures should be ksp~
u n d e r review,   and that the C-luVs Consultants should give advice to tha
 Club.

 3.      Future Developments

A.       Police and First A i d Facilities

'It was likelv that, following continuing consultations with the Police, the
 Club would shortly be in a position to formally notify the County .c-unci1
 that the new Police and First Aid Facilities would be provided m the
 forthcoming close season.

         Additional Turnstiles and Exit Gate in Penistone Road
 B.

 The Club hoaed to formally notify the County Council shortly of
 intention to proceed in the forthcoaing^close « “ on
 some of the existing toilets on the Penis^one^Road side of the Stadium ..
 order to provide additional turnstiles and exit gate on that side oi tne
 Stadium.

 C.      Widening of Walkway and Erection of New Fence

 Because of drainage problems, the existing concrete panel-fence to the
 rear of Che Spion Kop (nearest to the Ovls Club) had had to be removed.
 When settlement was complete, it was intended to widen the e x i s t m 0
 walkway and erect a new fence on the revised line.

1.____Purpose of Meeting

 ne purpose of the meeting was to carry out the "winter" inspection of the
Stadium in accordance with the policy of twice yearly visits to Football
League Grounds in South Yorkshire.

& .i----.p.-rlir;rid'-li'.SP   iO

A.       South Stand

The alterations and extensions to the understand area of the Stand (which
had been completed since the "summer" inspection) were shown to the Officer
Working Party.

IT WAS AGREED -

(i)   That any further areas of spalled concrete on the vertical columns at
the rear of the Stand would continue to be monitored and receive attention
by the Club as a matter of maintenance.

(ii) That the unsecured wire to the illuminated "Exit" sign in the Match
Day Sponsors Lounge would receive attention by the Club.

(iii) That the remaining bridge between the Stand and the Club at the rear
of the Stand (now used solely as a means of escape from the Kitchen area)
should be infilled with mesh from a safety point of view to accord strictly
with the appropriate Regulations.

 (iv) That the two. emergency lights in the Club not operative at the time
 of the inspection would receive urgent attention by the Club.

 B.        West Stand and Terrace

 The Club recalled the practice followed in consultation with the South
 Yorkshire Police of separating home and visiting supporters at the rear
 of the Stand at certain matches (such as with Liverpool) by erecting
 temporary barriers.  This worked well but on all other normal occasions it
 was the policy of the Police to aim for exclusive use by visiting supporters
 of the West Stand and Terrace. On those occasions when the number of
 visiting supDorfers was small and the weather was inclement, it was
 obviously desirable to allow home supporters access to a sheltered area.
4.    Toilet and Catering Facilities

The Officer Working Party confirmed that plans for the revised catering ^
facilities at the rear of the West Stand had been received from the Club s
Architect and had been formally approved.

The Club reported that the scheme for the general up-grading of toilet aad
catering facilities (particularly in the South Stand) was shortly to be
considered by the Board.

IT WAS AGREED that the Club would submit the proposals for^improved toilet
and .catering facilities for approval in the usual way, subject, of course,
to the Board's decision whether to proceed with the scheme.

          Segregation of Visiting Spectators at Leppings Lane End

             The club is anxious to segregate the visiting team's supporters
   as they enter the ground, and also to enable the police to control
   their exit at the end of a game.
       We have prepared the scheme shown on the attached print of our
   drawing 6705/2. This involves the construction of two new banks of
   turnstiles            (Hos 17 - 21 and 22 - 29), and various runs of fencing

_ und new gates.
•     It would be appreciated if the Working Party could consider thl!

1.     Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to consider the letter dated 9th April
and plan from Messrs. Eastwood & Partners relating to the proposals of
the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club to construct two new banks of
turnstiles and various runs of fencing and new^gates m o r d e r to achieve
segregation of visiting supporters at the Leppings Lane end of the
Hillsborough Stadium.

2, - Consideration of-Proposals          . .

The Police representatives pointed out that the proposals had been
promoted in the main by comments they had made to the Club. At one
time* both the West Stand and Terrace had been regarded as exclusively
for the use of visiting supporters, but recent patterns of attendances
at the Stadium made it necessary to allow for some element ot use by
home supporters as well.

The proposals now outlined by the Club were generally acceptable to the
Police representatives, subject to:_

 (a)   additional gates being provided between the turnstile numbered 16
       and the wall of the inner access road;

 (b)   the central area of the Terrace (indicated a s ’the neutral area or
       visiting supporters' terrace) being divided m half by a new
       central radial fence running from the tunnel entrance to the
       pitchside security fence with gates erected so as to permit entry
       to be diverted to either half as appropriate (the proposed new
       secondary radial fence adjacent to the existing fence indicated
       on the plan to be abandoned);

 (c)    the right hand area of the Terrace (indicated as home s « P P ° r t * « ’
        terrace) also to be divided in half by a new c e n t r a l radial fence
        running from back to front with two gates (the existing radial
        fence dividing the present two Terrace areas     neutral area an
        home supporters - to have a second gate installed;

 (d)    the existing pitch perimeter fence to have additional exit gates
        installed - one in the neutral area and one m the home supporters
        area

                                               1 .
The County Fire Service saw no objection in principle to the proposals,
subject to more detailed investigation of the means of escape^aspec -,
and the Building Authority similarly saw no obje^ ° T »   J “J fety of
submission of detailed plans and calculations under both the Safety
Sports Grounds Act and Building Regulations.

        Further to the joint meeting on 18 April 1985, to discuss the proposals for
        new crowd control arrangements, the means of escape implications have now
        been considered. The scheme would appear to be satisfactory providing that
        certain gates have the minimum widths (in metres) as indicated on the enclosed
        plan. It is understood that these gates will be supervised by either the police
        or club officials.

        jShould you require any further information, please do not hesitate to Contact
        this Department.

     In reply to your letter dated 9th April, whilst a meeting of the
     Officer Working Party (Sheffield District) was held on 18th April
     to consider the proposals which you outlined, the County Fire
     Service requested additional time to consider the means of escape
     aspects.

     .I am n o w ‘able to :say that, subject to the incorporation of the v ... _r
      following points and to the submission of detailed plans and
      calculations under both the Safety of Sports Grounds Act and

     generally acceptable

     (a)   additional gates being provided between the turnstile
           numbered 16 and the wall of the inner access road;

     (b)   the central area of the Terrace (indicated as the neutral
            area or visiting supporters' terrace) being divided in
           half by a new central radial fence running from the tunnel
            entrance to the pitchside security fence with gates erected
            so as to permit entry to be diverted to either half as
            appropriate (the proposed new secondary radial fence
            adjacent to the existing fence indicated on the plan to be
           abandoned);

      (c) the right hand area of the Terrace (indicated as home supporters'
         - terrace) also to be divided in half by a new central radial

            area and home supporters - to have a second gate installed);

For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan

Dear. Mr. Vaughan,
                        Safety of Sports 'Ground 'Act '1975
                      Sheffield Wednesday 'Football Club 'PLC
                Thank you for your letter of 2 May giving the comments
of the Officer Working Party on the proposals which we sent
to you on 9 April.
                In the interim period several of the points which you
raised had already been incorporated in our latest scheme
which has yet to be considered by the Club Board.                                                                   However I
would .ask that further consideration should be given to the
request in paragraph                              (c) of your letter for a second gate to
be installed in the radial barrier and for the new radial
barrier which you have asked for to have two gates.-                                                                  If these
gates are meant for use in emergency it would mean having                                                                       a
steward in attendance on each occasion, the expense of which
would hardly be justified.                                               It is our view that in the event of
emergency s pe c t a t o r s can be evacuated quickly enough by the
gates on to the pitch and by the normal exit gates at the rear.
We will of course be prepared to discuss the matter with the
Fire Officer's staff should you so wish.

                                                                                           Yours sincerely,

 Dear Sirs,

 Safety of Snorts Grounds Act, 1975
 Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic

 As requested by your letter dated ISth July, I have written a confirmatory
 letter to the Club regarding the steel sheeting and non-slip surface of
 the timber deck to the South Stand upper seated area (copy attached for
 your information).

 I understand that applications for building regulation/planning approval
• • h a v S '^ s a e r r - a a d e 1E y - H i h c   'C   l c b - £ r i - ? . r e s p e c t . : c i :: v a >   ' ' r e   ^   r o   a   n   i s i t i i r n              '•   •**

 and turnstiles and'alterations to toilet facilities-at the rear o f - t h e ^ - •
 West Stand, Leppings Lane, and (ii) erection of roof and enclosure to the
 Spion Kop Terrace.

Tlic Officer Working Party considered and gave approval in principle to the
rear of the West Stand re-organisation proposals in May but, other than
brief mentions by the Club or yourselves at routine castings cf the
possibility of the Spion Kop being enclosed, no outline plans or details
of such proposals have beer, considered to date.

As on orevious occasions, I am assuming that you will subnit the necessary
detailed plans, specifications and calculations for Safety of Sports Grounds
Act approval (bearing in mind the General Safety Certificate requirement
to give the County Council at least 21 days notice of any proposed
alterations or extensions at the Ground) snould the Club decide to irnpleu.enw
the oroposals after building regulation/planning permission consideration.

                                                                                                   Yours faithfully,

 The purpose of the meeting was tc consider the detailed plans submitted by the
 letter dated 25th July, from Messrs. Eastwood and Partners o£ arrangements
 for the segregation of visiting spectators at the Leppings Lane End of the
Hillsborough Stadium of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club. It was
 recalled that consideration cf outline proposals had taken place by the
Officer Working Party on 18th April, 1985. Whilst formal application had been
made for Building Regulation approval and some of the work had actually
 commenced, Messrs. Eastwood and Partners had apologised by 'phone thac
 submission of the detailed proposals for Safety of Sports Grounds Act
 approval had apparently been overlooked due to pressure of work and stafr
holidays. The plans also included details of repairs to certain crush

. 2. ’   Consideration of Proposals              •

 The 14 detailed- plans .submitted were each considered and discussed individually
                                           r;                   ;                *   •••
'IT WAS AGREED-- that, subject to the           ’following points -and to the submission of
 the necessary detailed calculations             to the Building ’
                                                                 Authority, the proposals
 for segregating visiting supporters             at the Leppings Lane End of the
 Hillsborough Stadium were generally             acceptable:-

 (a)    Plan No. 6705/6 - for both security access and emergency egress purposes
 a pitch perimeter fence gate to be provided;

 (b)    Plan No. 6705/8A - the new handrail by Turnstile 23 to be either
 shortened or re-aligned so as to maintain the exit width between the outer
 (river) wall and Tumstile 23, and the exit width between Turnstile 16 and
 the new handrail not to be less than the width of the roller shutter gate
 between Turnstiles 16 and 17;

 (c)    Plan No. 6705/9A - the single block thickness of the interal walls
 (e.g. the cubicles) is not considered to be substantial enough, and a
 substantial stud partition (timber or steel - suitably faced) is felt to
 be required;

 (d)     Plan No. 67O5/10A - same comments as for plan 9A;

 (e)    Plan No. 6705/llA - no objection in principle, but details of exact
 location required;

 (f)    Plan No. 6705/12 - no objection in principle, but no barrier height
 indicated;

    )    Plan No. 6705/14A - so long as increased thickness is achieved by steep
     oes as indicated on the plan and not by "stepped" arrangements to give
-    foothold, the proposals are satisfactory but the possible need to take
     nTeasures on top of the wall to discourage persons from attempting to climb
     over’will have to be borne in mind;

     (h)    Plan No. 6705/16A - in view of experiences' last year, the front
     corner of the Spion Kop (by the crush barriers numbered^, 8 and 22) to
     either have a Pitch Perimeter Fence Gate or radial barrier(s) to overcome
     possible lateral crushing hazard when large crowds are present;

     (i)    Plan Nc. 6705/17 - for both security access and emergency egress
     purposes, a Eitch Perimeter Fence Gate to be provided;

    -(j)    Stewarding of New Gates - as mentioned'in m y letter of 2nd May,: 1985,
     it is essential that all the new gates are fully supervised by Stewards,
     who must be fit, able and properly trained.

  For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan


  Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                                        Safety of Sportsground Act, 1975
                                  Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC
                  Thank you very much for your letter of 30 July giving the
  outcome of the Working Party meeting on 29 July.                                                     We note
  the general comment that the calculations have to be approved
  by the Building Surveyors Department.                                         We believe that all the
  calculations which are likely to be required have been sent for
  checking and comment.
                  With regard to your detailed observations our response
  is a s ’follows
   (a)            We are not sure of the location on the West terrace of
  the proposed extra security gate.                                        There is already a gate in
  the 2m wide gap formed by the new radial fence for use by the
  police.             This same gate will still be available for the spectators
   in emergency as there are gates into the 2m gap from the terrace
  which will be under the control of the police.                                                   This point may
  perhaps be clarified during the Working Party's visit on 7 August.

   (b)            The foundations'for this fence'are in fact already aligned

 the way you suggest.

  (c) and    (d)
            We are a little surprised by the suggestion that a
  single block thickness is not sufficient for the cubicle
 walls.      The inside of a toilet cubicle is not a very
 vulnerable area and the walls are braced by the door frame.
  Studding is not at all suitable in terms of strength or
 durability, and would probably invite vandalism.

  (e)     The refreshment area is under the most westerly
  staircase up to the north west corner terrace.                   There will
 b£2      oppor.t:iw.iJ~-¥ t.c           on 7 ..^uauct*..   •' .   —   -

  (f)     The handrail is to be at a height of 1250mm (4'1")
  above the horizontal step, measured at the face of the vertical
  step.

  (g)       The stepping of the face of the wall is achieved by 45°
 chamfers which will not form good footholds.

  (h)     Mr. Chester says that the club will certainly not
  object to the provision of another gate at this point, and
  the precise location can be discussed on 7 August.

  (i)     As with point          (a), we are not sure what is intended,
  and the matter can be discussed on 7 August.

  (j)     Your comment regarding stewarding will no doubt, be
  taken care of by Mr. Chester.


            It will be much easier for your Working Party to
  appreciate what is intended when they see the works under
  construction.        There will also be an opportunity to see
  the metal decking of the South stand.


                                      Yours sincerely,

The .purpose of-the m a t i n s waV'to; carr? out-the "sucimsr'-’-'inspecti'-.n of cue
Stadium with particular reference to the Leppings Lane end improvements and
the metal sheeting of the upper seated area of the South Stand.

2.     Ground Inspection.

A.     Leppings Lane End

The progress'of the works to segregate* visiting ^supporters behind and on the
West Terrace and Stand were inspected with particular reference to the
points raised at the Officer Working Party's meeting held on 29th July,
(forwarded to Messrs. Eastwood and Partners by the Chief Executive s letter
of 30th July) and Messrs. Eastwood & Partners reply of 1st August.

M essrs. Eastwood & Partners had confirmed that a l l the c a lc u la t io n s which
were l i k e l y to be required had now been sen t to the Building A uthority tor
checking and comment.

 On the inspection, the Building Authority pointed out what they considered
 to be the poor standard of workmanship in the construction of the new
 dividing wall which was being built behind the -Stand. The p o s i t i o n of the
 Police Personnel access gate and the stepping of the face of the wall by
 45° chamfers so as not to form footholds were acceptable.

 The foundations of the new handrail by Turnstile 23 had actually teen
 aligned so as to maintain the exit width between the outer (river) wall
 and the Turnstile (unlike the indication on the plan submitted) .

 As regards the s i n g l e block th ick n e ss of the in ter n a l w a lls of the c u b ic le s
  in the new male and female t o i l e t f a c i l i t i e s a t the rear of the stand,
 Messrs. Eastwood and Partners considered that the in s id e of a t o i l e t cubic
• was not a very v u ln e r a b le area, and pointed out that the w a l l s were bra e
  by both the outer w a l l s and the door frames. • The Building Authority n
  the assurances g iv e n by Dr. Eastwood, but expressed concern that the
 d iv i d in g w a lls in the new t o i l e t f a c i l i t i e s e v id e n tly did not have any
 fo u n d a tio n s, apparently having been b u i l t s t r a i g h t onto the e x i s t i n g
 c o n c r e te s l a b s . I t was noted that there were some 9 inch th ick b r ic k w a lls
 in the Male T o i l e t s , i t being considered that any hooliganism or vandalism
 would be more l i k e l y to occur there than in the Female T o i l e t s .

 The Club pointed out th at uie new t o i l e t f a c i l i t i e s would not be com pletely
 f i n i s h e d by the f i r s t match of the season (on 17th August) but that
 temporary f a c i l i t i e s would be a v a il a b le and th a t no building m a te r ia l would
 be l e f t on s i t e .

 The p o s i t i o n o f the new refreshment area under the most w e ste r ly s t a i r c a s e
 up to the North-West corner te r ra c e was noted. This again had been .b u ilt
 s t r a i g h t onto the e x i s t i n g concrete s la b s .

 On the Terrace i t s e l f , i t was noted th a t th ere was an e x i s t i n g g a te in the
 new 2 m. wide gap formed by the new r a d ia l fe n c e f o r use by the P o l i c e .
 This g a te would s t i l l be a v a i la b le f o r the use of spectators in an
 emergency as the g a te s a t the top o f the Terrace under the c o n tr o l of the
 P o l i c e would enable s p e c ta to r s to be d ir e c te d down the 2 m. wide gap.
 However, i t was agreed th a t s te p s or a longer g a te would be r eq u ired . I t
         a ls o agreed th a t a new g a te would be required from the new South
 C entral Terrace Pen.

 As regards the upper sea ted stand area , M essrs. Eastwood and Partners had

- both -the Stand ar-d-rit the Access l e v s ! —

 IT WAS AGREED:-

 (a)        th a t the c o n d it io n     of the in t e r n a l w a l ls i n the new male and female
 t o i l e t f a c i l i t i e s a t the   rear of the Stand should               be   monitored;

 (b)   th a t th e e x i s t i n g g a te in the p it c h perimeter fe n c e should e i t h e r be
 extended or have Steps to provide e a s i e r a ccess from the new 2 m. wicc gap
 formed by the new r a d i a l fen ce;

 (c)   th a t a new g a te in the p it c h perimeter fe n c e should be provided from
 the new South C entral Terrace Pen;

       th a t the a d v e r t is in g hoardings a t the fr o n t of the upper seated stand
 area should be s e c u r e ly f ix e d to the concrete w a ll;

 (e)   th a t the s p a l l i n g of the c o n crete of the w a ll at the fr o n t of the
 upper s ea ted stand area should r e c e iv e a t t e n t i o n as a matter of maintenance;

  (f)   th a t the c o r r o s io n of the s t e e l columns at         the rear of the Stand
  should r e c e i v e a t t e n t i o n on a maintenance b a s i s .

 B.        South Stand

 Messrs. Eastwood & Partners reported that the condition of the upper
 concrete outer portion of the exterior wall of the Stand had been
 investigated and was considered to be satisfactory.

  I t was noted th a t the metal sh e etin g of the wooden upper p o r tio n of the
  Stand had been l a r g e l y completed, and the spraying of the n o n - s l ip
  s u r fa c e was to commence v e r y s h o r t l y (and c e r t a i n l y be completed by the
  s t a r t o f the s e a s o n ) .
IT WAS AGREED that the metal sheeting of the wooden upper portion of the
Stand should largely overcome the flamaability problems inherent in such
timber structures, and the Club stated that they would ensure that the
wooden intermediate steps were securely replaced upon completion of the
laying of the metal sheeting.

C.    Spion Kop

Messrs. Eastwood & Partners recalled that outline details of the Club's
proposal to cover the Spion Kop had been senc for the information of the
Officer Working Party by letter dated-22nd July. As part of that scheme,
the bridge portion of the Kop would be removed. Its present condition
remained acceptable with continuing maintenance.

In view of experiences last season, the Club were requested to provide an
additional gate in the pitch perimeter fence in the front corner nearest
to the South Stand to overcome the lateral crushing hazard which could
occur when large crowds were present.

IT WAS AGREED that the Club would provide a new gate in the pitch perimeter
fence in the front c o m e r nearest to the South Stand with a stepped
arrangement to assist access and egress.

D.    North Stand

The X eraporary .snorage facilities'jfreace^^by^t'he^       cf . i.    ..waQ -
(in"front of'the Ladies^’^hangTing Facilities' in" the Sports Hall) were
inspected.

IT WAS AGREED that so long as light combustibles (such as paint) were not
stored in this area, its use continued to be acceptable on a temporary
basis.

E.    Closed Circu.ir .Television Facilities

The advantages for general crowd control and security (both in and outside
the Stadium) which would be given by the recently installed Closed Circuit
Television System were explained to the Officer Working Party.

IT WAS AGREED

(a)   that a 2 \ kg. CO 2 Fire Extinguisher should be installed in both the
Police Control Box and'the Disc Jockey Box;

(b)   that loose external wires on the outside of the Boxes should be made
secure.

Mr. Vaughan pointed out that -the -Local Government Act, 1985, would abolish ^
the South Yorkshire County Council (and -the other Metropolitan'County Councils)
on 31st March, 1986. From 1st April, 1986, the Certificating Authority under
the Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975, would be the appropriate District
Council. In the case of the Hillsborough Stadium this would naturally be
the Sheffield City Council. For this reason, it.had been'suggested^to the
City Council that 'appropriate representatives in addition to the Building
Surveyors’ Division might find it useful to be present at the meeting, and
Mrs. L. Baihforth and. Mr. J. Derricott were welcomed and introduced to the
remainder of the representatives present.             •.

      :I^:'J>urpbs~e''-of ^Meeting

••S*e purpose'"ok           t h e :m e e t i n g was.two-fold; .firstly to-discuss^.the further
^detail’      s" of 'development proposals, at :the stadium forwarded, with, the letter
  Hated 23rd December, 1985, from Messrs. Eastwood^and Partners and, secon ly,
 ; t o 'c a r r y ' o u t the "winter" i n s p e c t io n o f. th e .Stadium.

 ^        Development Proposals for the Spicin Kop

 The further details were in-addition to the comments set out in the letter
'••dated 29.th November, 1985,’on the observations-made following the Officer
;Working Party meeting held on 13th November.
        (i)    Sheeting of Outer Face                                                   r-

        Dr. Eastwood reported that the sheeting of the enlarged Spion Kop at
        the rear and sides would result in the structure being virtually
        sealed.  In reply to queries -from the County Fire Service, he confirmed
’*      that no storage would be allowed under the structure and that checks
        for any accumulations .of rubbish would be undertaken on a regular basis-

        (ii)   Climbing of the-Inner Steel Frame

        As regards the possiblity of..unruly spectators climbing the inner steel
        frame of the new-structure,'Dr. Eastwood reported that the bottom boom          j
        member was now to be omitted.. The resultant height of ove^.lO feet
        would make it very difficult far spectators to climb the structure. •

        (iii) New Step and Barrier Layout

        Drawing N o . (664.8/56^was -circulated and considered. This related to the
        new step and barrier layout on the .Spion Kop, and Dr. Eastwood reported
        in particular on the discussions which he' had had with the Planning
        Authority as to the height of an intermediate or a low.second rail to
        the barriers, where the. drop .to -the gangway .below could be over one metre
        in places. He sought the Officer Working ."Partyrs v i e w s .and the merits'
        of the options were considered.

        IT WAS AGREED that, in the .view of the Officer Working Party, the best

       ■s. height' cf some 200 •».                     ' •               ..........

 B.     .Facilities for the Disabled                                          .X:

  To illustrate that the figures originally quoted to provide facilities for the
  disabled at the foot of the Spion Kop (nearest to-the North Stand) were not
  unrealistic, Dr .--"Eastwood reported on the breakdown of the tender figures
   (opened on Konday) for the enlarged, roofed Spion Kop. -He still considered
  that any such proposals would involve the loss of-up to 1,000..of the extra
  5,000 spectator places which.would be provided by the enlarged Spion Kop.
  Other areas of .the Stadium had also been considered and investigated, but
  none could provide as large a flat, easily accessible area -as that in front of
  the North Stand, which had been successfully used.for so.long without any major
  problems. Up to 80 disabled persons, plus attendants, used the area.. The only
^ a j o r drawback he ssv was .that when there was a strong southerly wind, rain
  could be blown onto the disabled, despite the cantilever roof of the North
  Stand extending virtually to the pitch.       F<pr this reason, the Club were willing
  to roof an area from approximately 'the letter "0" on the results board to the
  end of the Stand .(nearest--to' the Spion Kop)-.with a substantial roof, including
  armoured glass where .there might be V visibility .problem, 'provided that this
  w a s supported .bj the Officer .Working . T a r t y _ * • -   ■ ■ :   ^         •

 Whilst accepting much of ‘
                          .what *;Dr..‘
                                      "Eastwood-said; "the .Officer Working Party
 (and the Police representatives in "p'articular) still'expressed somp ;cor--.nrn as
 to whether making semi-permanent facilities, for the disabled in front of the
 North Stand was the appropriate and^'correct .thing'to do.

 The Building Authority confirmed that, after further investigations, it was
 considered that th e ’disabled facilities requirements of the Building
 Regulations 1985 did not appear to strictlyJapply to the roofing of the
 enlarged Spion Kop. •
II WAS AGREED that, in the first instance, Dr. Eastwood would prepare sketch
plans of the suggested roofed disabled facilities in front of the North Stand
for consideration by the Officer Working Party.

C.     Ground Inspection
       (i)   West Terrace and Stand

The Police representatives confirmed that the revised segregation arrangements
to the rear of the Stand worked well on by far the majority of occasions.

Dr. Eastwood pointed out that the segregation rail in the upper seated area'
of the stand could be moved within .certain limits if the Police considered
that this would achieve a useful purpose.

IT WAS AGREED

(a)   that the additional advertisement hoardings, at the front of the upper
seated stand area (nearest to the North-West Terrace) should also be securely
fixed to concrete wall;                        -

(b)   that further areas-of spalled concrete at the front of the upper                                                .■ .
seated stand area should received "'attention as matters of maintenance.

       (ii)   North-West Terrace                                                                 •

                                            ^oiruinfeL^ereCCii•.on.ciie'upper fcorfn-.' . ..
West T e r r a c e 'should be securely fixed.

       (iii) North Stand

The area for the suggested covered disabled facilities was inspected.

As p r e v i o u s l y - mentioned by-Dr. Eastwood’,-the possibility of providing an
increased width access to the pitch area (between the Nor."h Stand and the
Spion Kop) for possible use by emergency vehicles, as well as for maintenance
by the Club was discussed. -The facility could be incorporated into the
enlarged Spion Kop proposals relatively easily.

It WAS AGREED that, whilst the County Fire Service felt that such a facility
was not essential for their purposes, it could be useful for use by emergency
vehicles in certain situations and generally should be supported.

       (iv)   Spion Kop

Dr. Eastwood indicated the extent of the work to construct'the enlarged,,
roofed, Spion Kop, a n d .confirmed that steps would-be -ta£ensto prevent-
unauthorised access to areas where work might'be .in Progress duringjtbe^ ^^                                          -.

assist access and egress, had been provided.               _■ • .  .

       (v)    South Stand

It was noted that the metal-sheeting of the. wooden floor of-the upper    •
portion of the Stand (with sprayed non-slip surface) had proved to be of an
acceptable appearance in use, and generally appeared to provide a compromise
solution to the flammability problems inherent in such wooden structures.

IT WAS AGREED that its condition would continue to be monitored.                                 .

SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS : REVISED EDITION OF 'THE GUIDE TO SAFETY AT
                           SPORTS GROUNDS

Introduction

1.   This circular introduces the revised edition of the Guide to Safety at Sports
Grounds (the "Green Guide") a copy of which is enclosed for all recipients.

2.   As stated in paragraph 9 of Hone Office circular 5/198^ the revised edition
of the C-reen Guide has been drawn up primarily in the light of both the interim and
Final Reports of the Popplevell Inquiry, although where practicable additions have
been made to take account of comments from elsewhere. The Guide remains a voluntary
code and is intended to be applied flexibly to take account of the individual
circumstances and needs of particular grounds.

Content and Main Changes of the Guide

3-   Although the format and structure of the new Guide have been changed m an
attempt to facilitate reading, this revised edition continues to rely heavily on uhe
technical material of the previous Guide, the substantive advice of whicn vas
acknowledged by the Popplewell Inquiry to have stood up well to detailed scrutiny.
The new Guide is therefore still orientated towards 1football-type1 stadia out,
unlike its predecessor, it is made clear that it also applies to sports grounds used
for other sports.

4.   The main changes in the new Guide are that greater emphasis .is placed throoghou-
the latest edition on management responsibility to which a new chapter is devoted
(Chapter 2) and there is a further additional chapter on stewardmg (Chapter o;.
The advice on fire safety has been expanded and amendments made to chapter 14 on
crowd control. General advice on temporary stands is offered in Chapter 10.

Distribution

5.   The Guide has been issued to the main representative sporting organisations anc
to all sports grounds designated under Section 1 of the Safety of Spores Groundo A c l
1975.
E.R.


  Supplementary

  6.   An additional copy of this circular and Green Guide are enclosed, where
  appropriate, for the Chief Fire Officer.

 7.   Further copies of the Guide are available from HMSO, HMSO Bookshops and HMSO
 Accredited Agents as from    October 1986.

 9.   Any enquiries about the contents of this circular should be directed to:
 Mrs R Davies 01-213 5566.

    Dear Sir.

    Safety "of Sports Grounds Act 1975 — Sheffield United Football Club'and
    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club__________________________________ _

    I am writing to ask for your comments in writing as to the conditi-m of the
    above two stadia under the 1975 Act from the Fire Service point of view.

    What I would like from you is written confirmation that as far as the Fire
    Authority is concerned both stadia meet your requirements tinder the 1975
    legislation.

    If it should be that there are outstanding matters which require attention
    please detail these in your response; I think it would be helpful to all parties
    if any defects outstanding were fully detailed so that action could be taken to
    remedy them.

    Please be advised that I am aware of the south stand roof problem at Sheffield
    Wednesday and as you know I am taking steps to ascertain the Club's position on
    that problem.

    I hope you will be able to let me have your reply to this letter in the near
    future.

’   Yours faithfully,

         open if pressure were generated by a croud.           No record can bo found

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 - Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

In November 1986 I asked both the Police and Fire Service to comment on the
condition of your stadium having regard to the provisions of the 1975 Act- I
have also asked the Building Surveyor to make similar comments but I have not
received them as yet.

The Police have indicated that they are quite satisfied with the stadium and
have indicated that the degree of co-operation which they receive is very
satisfactory.

The Fire Service have, however, made a number of comments and I attach for your
information a copy of their letter to me of 18th February.  I think the letter
is largely self-explanatory but I would particularly like to refer to the
comments which are made in respect of final exit gates. As you can see from the
                —    ».■», _   t* J —       O -     -J n       ~   ~ a     c A   f K a   c 1   i   ’ n <>                  V i p v ^   ^   \ C . a . T 51(3

that as and when they reach the end of their useful life they must be replaced
with outward opening doors. The Fire Service have also produced a drawing (a
copy of which I enclose) to show a better arrangement for securing the sliding
gates against forced entry from the outside during the course of the game. The
Fire Service feel that this hook type arrangement will be more easily used in
the event of an emergency than the current locks, about which they are very
concerned.

Would you please let me have your comments on the Fire Service letter as soon as
possible.

Yours faithfully,




Head of Department

 Dear Sir,

 Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 ~ Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

 In November 1986 I asked both the Police and Fire Service to comment on the
 condition of your stadium having regard to the provisions of the 1975 Act. I
 have also asked the Building Surveyor to make similar comments but I have not
 received them as yet.

 The Police have indicated that as at 6th January, 1987 they are quite satisfied
 with the stadium and have indicated that the degree of co-operation which they
 receive is very satisfactory.

 The Fire Service have, however, made a number of comments and I attach for your
 information a copy of their letter to me of 18th February.  Some points i:i the
 letter have now been further clarified as follows:-

 (a) The timber buildings referred to should (if still required) be re-sited away
 from the walkways.

 (b) As far as the locked doors in the south stand are concerned they will be
 dealt with by the Fire Service under the Fire Certificate.

 (c) Gates must be unlocked and stewarded at all times, during matches: if this
 cannot be arranged, panic fastenings would probably be insisted upon.

 I think the rest of the letter is largely self-explanatory but I would
 particularly like to refer to the conunents which are made in respect of final
 exit gates.  As you can see from the letter the Fire Service are concerned about
 the sliding gates and have indicated that as and when they reach the end of
 their useful life they must be replaced with outward opening doors. The Fire
 Service have also produced a drawing (a copy of which I enclose) to show a
 better arrangement for securing the sliding gates against forced entry from the
 outside during the course of the game. The Fire Service feel that this hook
 type arrangement will be more easily used in the event of an emergency than the
 current locks, about which they are very concerned.

 Encs.

Dear Sire,

In reply to your latter dated l';th May, 1987 regarding the "Future Administration
of the Council's Certificating Function" under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act
1975, please find belcw the observations of this Department.

1.   With respect tc the schedule detailing a proposed division of responsibilities
     between authorities it is felt that this should remain along the lines of
     the document issued hr the previous certificating authority i.e. South Yorkshire
     County Council, a copy of which is attached.     As this document has steed the
     test of tine with Tc:< problems, it is recommended that a meeting of all author­
     ities concerned be called as seen as possible in order tc discuss the division
     of responsibilities it lays down.

     Whatever the outcome one area i/hero there r.ay be a need for emphasis is a
     reference to the fact that all authorities should be more aware of other author-
|    ities responsibilities and that when considering any proposals all aspects
     of the green guide should be tal'ion into account in order that full consul­
     tation can take place with other interested authorities.

2.   The proposal for one annual inspection by the working       group in conjunction
     with individual inspections by authorities as and when      considered necessary
     is agreed with although it is envisaged that because       of manpower resource
     limitations the degree of central co-ordination referred   to nay cause problems.

     The Fire Authority would. wish to carry, out such inspections subject to the
     limitations ref’erred to above and under varying conditions at the ground.
     Obviously any adverse comments on crowd safety would be forwarded to your
     Department.   As to the annual inspection, a good time would be at the end
     or towards the end of a season in order that any necessary work can be followed
     up before the cervr.enconcnt of a new season.

3.   Whilst the situation regarding the status of working group is fully appreciated,
     this authority feels that the recognition of the group as a decision making
     body by the City Council is imperative if it is to regain effective. As under
     the County Council however, the terras of reference of the group would be within
     the conditions of certification laid down by the City Council, anything beyond
     these terms being referred back via your Department for a Committee decision.

                                                                           Cont• •••
^City of Sheffield                      -   2   -                         7.7.1987
 Metropolitan District




4. The procedure outlined for calling additional meetings of the working group
    is agreed with although it is considered essential that full minutes of all
 • meetings are produced and. circulated and in particular should make • direct
    reference to outstanding matters from previous meetings in order that these
    are not 'lc3t* in the minutes.


In addition to the above'matters it would bs appreciated if both Sheffield United
and Sheffield Wednesday Football Clubs were contacted in order to discuss the
outstanding features dealt with in correspondence between 'Cf Division Headquarters
and your Department dated 9th December, 1936 in respect of Sheffield United and
18 th February, 1907 in respect of Sheffield Wednesday.

If there sre any queries on the above matters, pie a>j0 do not hesitate to contact
the Officer concerned.

Yours faithfully,




Chief Firs Officer

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds                 Act 1975 -
Future Administration of                 the Council's                  Certificating                     Function

Following a meeting on Tuesday 10th March I have given some further thought to
the above subject.

Many points were raised at the meeting but I think that the general feeling was
that the roles of each Authority involved in the system should be defined
perhaps along the lines adopted by the South Yorkshire County Council.

I have no objection in principal to roles being defined in this way but I should
make it clear that if it is agreed that particular Authorities adopt particul*
roles then they will be under a duty to consult with other interested parties
where there is an overlap of interest. As I see it the Authority which carries
out a particular role will have the responsibility of advising the Council s
Certificating Authority on all matters falling within that Lead Authority role.

I have drawn up a draft Schedule which attempts to d e f i n e Lead Authority roles.
I should point out that  the draft is intended to be open for discussion and I
would therefore welcomeyour comments on it.    Would you please also let me know
if there are any other matters which should be included in the Schedul .

Moving onto the question of inspections of stadia, this point was a l s o discussed
at t h e meeting on 10th March. My view is that the existing system of bi annual
limited inspections is no longer appropriate; I feel that one major “ spection
per year should be carried out on each stadium which should include all the
areas and installations within the scope of the legislation. ^ To bade “P this
inspection there should be a number of "during performance inspections y
Officers.    I think that there is general agreement in relation to dx*rxng
performance" inspections as they would highlight the performance of the safety
 system at each stadium whilst it is in operation.


                                                                                              734690 - Mr. Bownes

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 -
D raft revised Safety Certificate Conditions

I enclose for your attention a copy of the new draft Certificate conditions
which I have prepared.  Please bear in mind that these conditions are a fiJst
draft only and are in a basic form (i.e. they have not as yet been tailored to
the needs of individual stadia).  I also enclose a first draft of the
interpretation section of the Certificate which will help when reading the new
conditions.

I would welcome your comments on the conditions, preferably in writing. If you
feel that it would be helpful to discuss the conditions at a meeting then please
contact Mr. Bownes on the telephone number given below who will make the
appropriate arrangements.

Yours faithfully




 Head of Department

DRAFT REVISED SAFETY CERTIFICATE CONDITIONS

In reply to your l e t t e r dated 7^h July re the above, please find below
the observations o f t h i s Department

Section S(a )        An additional item agreed with Barnsley and Doncaster Councils
                     in respect of th e ir standard conditions i s that the age
                     range o f stewards should be 18 - 65-

Section        10(a)          Whilst sp e c ifie d in the green guide, i t i s d i f f i c u l t to
                         imagine how th is task can be con trolled by stewards.           This
                         n atter should be considered further.

Section        1 0 (i)       Reference should be made to the opening andsecuring open
                         of e x i t s on the in tia t io n of any emergency procedure or
                         at the end of a game and to a s s is t in g and d irectin g spectators
                         out of the e x i t s .

Section 18               Add . . . "The emergency power supply should operate independ­
                         en tly o f the main power supply     and come into automatic
                         operation   on the fa ilu r e of the l a t t e r and be capable of
                         maintaining the necessary power output for a minimum period
                         of three hours.

Section        23        Reference   to "compressed gas or liquid" should be amended
                         to . .     "flammable liq u id or compressed gas (except f i r e
                         extinguishing apparatus)".

Section 24               Add a f t e r "whatsoever"   "whether combustible or not".

Section 28               The old SYCC c e r t i f i c a t e required th a t the P olice had knowledge
                          of the whereabouts of the doctor.

Section        29        Again the old SYCC c e r t i f i c a t e   required that members of
                          the p r e s s, T.V. and radio were i d e n t if ia b le .
                                     -   2   -




Section   35(d) This requires that the electrical installation be examined
               and a report submitted to the Council every 12 months.
               The same requirement should al 3o apply to emergency lighting,
               and fire warning (including P.A.) systems.

Section   35 (f) Sub paragraph (iii) requires emergency lighting to be tested
                at least 24 hours prior to an activity. It would be preferable
                that the original requirement of      testing 3 hours before
                an activity be maintained.

Two additional items for consideration are:-

 (i)   That a competent electrician employed or      retained   by   the Holder
       shall be present during a specified activity.

(ii)   The Holder shall provide and maintain within the stadium      to the
       satisfaction of the Council the access routes for emergency vehicles
       shown on the plans.

SCHEDULE - Interpretation

Whereas the old SYCC Certificate required certain matters (e.g. fire alarms,
extinguishers ezc.) and the maintenance of these to be to the satisfaction
of the Chief Fire Officer, the proposed Certificate now requires these
to be to satisfaction of the City Council.

This  Department does not foresee this causingany problems subject to
copies of the required annual certificates of test being forwarded to
us for examination.

If there are any queries on the above matters, please contact Divisional
Officer Grinshaw.

Also enclosed for ycur information is a list of sports grounds and m d e e r
sports premises within Sheffield and known to this Department.

Yours faithfully,




Chief Fire Officer

   Dear Sir,

   Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds - 1986 Edition

   I refer to the revised Guide which was recently published by K.M. Cova^^e^t
   following the Poppelweli Report.  I would like to draw your attention to t: e n~w
   Guide and particularly to Chapter 2 entitled "Management Re sponsibility .

   This Chapter sets out in detail the sort of matters which ground management ^
   should be responsible for and I regard it as essential that the management or
   designated stadia should be entirely familiar with it and follow its guidance.

    Would you please, therefore, confirm in writing.-

       (a) that you have obtained and intend to retain on the premises a copy of the
          Guide;

       (b) that your Company and its Officers are familiar with the Guide and intend
           to perform the management duties outlined in Chapter 2 of the Guiae,    e
           Company should also take immediate steps to appoint a Safety ° “ icer as^
           defined in Chapter 2 and confirmation of that appointment should be sen.
           the Council as soon as possible.

  ' Yours faithfully,

Dear Sir,

 Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 -
.S h e ffie ld Wednesday. Fcofb?!! Club rile, __


I enclose fo r your a tte n tio n two copies of a l e t t e r which
I have received from Messrs Eastwood & Partners dated the
3rd February, 1988. I think the majority of the l e t t e r i s
straigh t forward, hut I am concerned about the l a s t para­
graph on sheet seven o f the l e t t e r . In view o f the appa­
rent c r it is is m o f the Fire Service contained in that para­
graph, you may think i t appropriate to respond d irectly to
Messrs Eastwood                         &
                        Partners. Perhaps you would l e t me have
a copy of your l e t t e r i n due course.

I look forward to hearing from you on the remainder of
 xstwood’j l e t t e r i n the f a i r l y near future.

Yours f a i t h f u ll y ,




Head of Department

     irs ir. rscsipt cf a copy -cf your*-letter di-ter            .1SCQ.f•
  of Mr- D Bov/nss re your reply ■to "our letter dated 18 February 19S7.

  Your comments regarding the various items as listed are receiving our attention.
  However, your comments on sheet 7 stating that each new member of the Fire Service
  to the to the Officer Working Party puts forward different recommendations have
  been throughly investigated and our observations are as follows.
  Station Officer           has attended meetings of the Officer Working Party since
  November 1985 and for two year prior to -his Station Officer ’’.llcock v<as the -■
  responsible Officer.
  The only time when another Officer may have been involved was when Station Officer
  Woodhouse was absent for 13 weeks at the Fire Service College during late 1386.
  Station Officer            has also been involved in Liquor Licensing Act work as well
  .iS Fire Precaution Act work at the ground.
   It would appear therefore that the clubs remarks are a little exagerated, and every
   endevour is made by this Authority for continuity of fire precaution standards.

      Dear Sir,                                                                          6

      Safety of Sports Grounds - Draft Revised Safety Certificate Conditions

      I refer to your letter of 13th August 1987 (your reference FP19/2/4:RG/EB) in
      connection with Safety Certificate Conditions.

      I now enclose for your attention a copy of the final revised Safety Certificate
      Conditions which as far as possible incorporate the comments made in your
      letter. You will appreciate that the wording of certain of your comments has
      had to be amended slightly but I hope that the objective has none the less been
      achieved.

      There are four points which require some further consideration:-

              (a)       You say in your letter that an age range should be specified in
                        connection with stewards.  I think however that the wording of
                        Condition 11 should be satisfactory without stipulating an age range.
                        No final decision has yet been taken on this issue and you may like to
                        consider it further;

              (b)       police knowledge of the whereabouts of a doctor - I believe this is
                        adequately covered in Condition 7;

              (c)       identifiability of press T.V. and radio personnel - I am not sure of
                        the justification for such a Condition and wonder if you have any
                        further comments on it;

              (d)       the attendance of competent electrician - again I wonder what the
                        justification for this Condition would be.

      Would you please let me have your comments on the new Conditions in due course.


      Yours faithfully,




      Head of Department

                       GUIDANCE FOR SAFETY CERTIFICATE HOLDERS >




 This note has been prepared by the Sheffield City Council in-order to inform
 Certificate Holders as to the general background of the Safety'Certificate
 Conditions. The Council in dealing with Safety Certificates‘ .takes advice from
 the Chief Fire Officer, the Chief Constable, the Director ofVgealth and Consumer
 Services and the Council's Building Surveyor. These Officersv'and the Council
 itself is concerned to see as far as possible that the spectators at any
 specified activities are reasonably safe.                      .

*• GUIDANCE

 Where advice is given to the holder by any of the four Officers mentioned it
 should be acted upon in accordance with the time constraints given in the !
 advice. The holder is reminded that failure to take steps to ensure the
 reasonable safety of spectators could give rise to a prosecution.

  The Chief Constable and his Officers have a particularly important role in
  relation to "public order" situations the correct handling of which should
  reduce any risk to spectator safety.

  The Chief Constable must therefore be provided with appropriate facilities at
  the stadium for control, crowd surveillance, detention and administrative^
  purposes. These facilities are essential if public order is to be maintained
  and the risk to spectators minimised.

  The Chief Constable must also be informed at the earliest possible moment of the
  proposed date and content of all specified activities so that appropriate
  planning can take place.

  In addition there must h e consultation and agreement between the holder and the
  Chief Constable well in advance of specified activities about t h e proposed
  methods of admission and the segregation of spectators. Consultation must also
  take place if advance information is such that public order difficulties may
  arise. As a result of this consultation it is possible that the Chief Constable
  may require, for reasons of preserving public order, that the specified activity
  is ’’all ticket" or the specified activity should not be played at all at the
  Stadium or the day and the time of the specified activity should be changed.

  The Chief Constable should also be able to use whatever means are appropriate to
  exercise control over spectators for reasons of safety and as part of this
  control he and his Officers should be allowed full access to all areas of t e
  Stadium.

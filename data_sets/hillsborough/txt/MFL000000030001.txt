Dear Harry,

Meeting 11.a.m. Saturday   27th April 1991.

     Thank you for your letter of the 22nd April 1991, regarding
the above meeting.

     Although I tried hard to extricate myself from various
commitments on Saturday 27th April, I found it impossible to do
so, and therefore couldn't possibly be with you, as I didn't
receive your letter until the 24th.




                                   Best wishes,
                                Yours sincerely,




                                    Martin Flannery.M.P.

M!    R John Major has told th e^ fouseof Com­
      mons that the Vietnamese boat people in
     •HOhg Kong will have to be repatriated by
force and against their will. He can be given
credit for having made diplomatic efforts to find
alternative homes for^ne boat people in other
countries, and for having attempted to extract
assurances from tlie particularly unpleasant
Communist regime in Vietnam that when the
boat people p re s&it back where they came from           Keeping order: conventional wisdom insists the police cannot do th e ir jo b w ithout wholehearted public support
they will r^pt be'penalised. His decision to force
the boat rieople back to Vietnam, however, is a
grossly uncivilised actwhich dishonours and dis­                  e c e n t ev en ts                                                                        to face the truth; nothing

are the undeniably appalling conditions of over­

Dear Home Secretary,

The Hillsborough Disaster.

     You will be aware that the recent coroners' inquest on the above terrible
disaster at the Hillsborough Football Ground, resulted in a verdict of accidental
death.  This verdict is diametrically opposed to the findings of the Taylor Report,
which showed the grave weaknesses in the policing of the match that day.

     This is a most unsatisfactory state of affairs, and I believe that the situation
justifies a review of the role of coroners’ courts in cases where the jury is
drastically restricted in its findings.

     We cannot have a situation where so many deaths and injuries have occurred,and
where there is dreadful confusion in the minds of the general public,as a result
of serious conflict between a major report, and a coroners' court.

     There is outrage in the minds of people generally in Liverpool, and especially
among the families and relatives of the deceased and injured.

     Not only was the jury instructed within the narrow confines of what their
verdict should be,but so was the coroner, and there is in my opinion, a great gap
between unlawful killing, and accidental death, and of course, the open verdict.

     I am sending you a copy of a cutting from the Yorkshire Post of March 30th last,
and am sending a copy of this letter and cutting to the Attorney General.

     I do hope something can be done, as the misery and bitterness which this conflict
of findings has engendered has left a vacuum which is most unhealthy and certainly
unsatisfactory.

     I would welcome your comments.



                                                           Yours sincerely,

a great gap between unlawful killing, and accidental death, and of course,
the open verdict.

      I am sending you a copy of a cutting from the Yorkshire Post of
March 30th last, and am sending a copy of this letter and cutting to the
Attorney General.

     I do hope something can be done, as the misery and bitterness which
this conflict of findings has engendered , has left a vacuum which is most
unhealthy and certainly unsatisfactory.

     I would welcome your comments.                            ^   _

    Thank you for sending to me a copy of your letter of the 9th
    April   1991   to the   Home   Secretary   about   the   Inquest    held     in
    respect of those who died in the Hillsborough Disaster.


    As you are aware, my own Ministerial responsibility is for the
    work of the Crown Prosecution Service;         I wrote to you on 6th
    November 1990 in this context explaining the manner in which the
    question of prosecution had been approached and the outcome of
    the consideration given to the case by the Director of Public
    Prosecutions.


    The point now made about the relationship between the Inquest
    verdict and the findings of Lord Justice Taylor is one on which
    it is more appropriate for the Home Secretary rather than myself
    to comment.

Dear Sir,

            Public Enquiry into the Hillsborough Tragedy.

          I am   enclosing two letters relating to the FA cup
semi  final match held at Hillsborough in 1981,       from  the
Football Association, and from the Chief Constable of South
Yorkshire police.   The events   of that day were remarkably
similar to the reported events of last Saturday. The major
difference seems to be that the Police realised the dangers and
blocked the entrances to the terraces. It seems that had the
lessons of that day been learned, last weeks tragedy need never
have happened. I would therefore suggest that this area is one
which should be examined by the enquiry.



                                           Yours Faithfully,




                                                                    3

                                                                       j




           Deai

           I refer to your letter of 16 April 1981 in which you make reference to
           your attendance at the Semi-Final at Hillsborough football ground on
           Saturday 11 April 1981.

          As you no doubt appreciate, there was a serious crushing problem in the
          Leppings Lane end of the ground which necessitated the police allowing
          approximately 500 spectators on to the track in order to prevent serious
          injury. I am not in a position to say whether there was an excessive
          number of tickets sold, but I regret that you and your sons were unable
          to gain access to view the match.

          I would suggest that so far as any reimbursement of your ticket money is
          concerned that you take this matter up with the Football Association.

          I am sorry that your visit to Sheffield was spoiled in this way, but in
          the interests of safety the police had no alternative but to exclude any
          further people from gaining access to the Leppings Lane of the ground.

          Yours sincerely

somewhere else.

There were     lots of fans about,   either eating or drinking,       but    it was

quite orderly.     The three of us went off to try to buy a drink,             we

walked quite a long way but we did not find any where that was                open.

We returned to the ground at about 2.40pm           (1440) and tried to get

into the ground.      By this time there were a large number of fans

trying to get into the grounds,       as    it was packed solid.     They were

not formed into queues or anything.           There did not seem to be any

organisation of these     people.     I saw np stewards     but I do remember

seeing some police officers on horses, and           I think some standing,

but they did not seem to be doing much about what was happening.                    I

saw fans climbing onto walls to get in,          but again the police did not

seem to be stopping them.

I got   in the crush and eventually got to the t u r n s t i l e s , where my

ticket was taken and ripped.         I imagined that the two mates,         James

HENNESSEY and James DELANEY were           just behind me, but when I got      in

the ground     I waited for them but       they did not cotne in while I

waited.    1   did not see either of       them again.

As I stood     there two other blokes      I know vaguely came    up to me and

asked me to go with them.       I said I was waiting for my two mates,              but

then I realised that a gate next to the turnstiles had been opened

and some fans were getting      in, so I decided to go up and get a place

to see the match.      By this time    it would be about 2.45pm (1445).

I went through the tunnel whi ch was directly            in f ront of me and got

onto the terraces.      I realised it was very packed and a crush was

forming,     if you were not   careful you lost your footing.        It was    not

too bad,   I have been in situations        like that before.

I. decided to go left when I got on the terrace.             I pushed my way

through the people, as      it was my intention to get to the side to get

higher to see the game.        I eventually got to two metal       fences    that

        were close together about 3/4" apart,          climbed over them to a place

        where   it was nothing like as packed,        in fact people were sitting on

        the steps where I was right up against the dividing          lane between the

         terrace and the Worth Stand and quite near the back.          I got there at

        about the time the players      ran o u t . (dkQZS                  <‘     rAdkS/loj

        The game had been on just a few minutes when I suddenly saw peo pie

         coming onto the pitch -from the terrace behind the goal.          I did not

         realise what had happened till      1 saw bodies    laying on the ground,

         with police trying to revive people by pressing their         chests.

         I stopped in the ground till about 4 . 1 5 / 3 0 pm (1615/1630), then went

         back to the bus and eventually went home.

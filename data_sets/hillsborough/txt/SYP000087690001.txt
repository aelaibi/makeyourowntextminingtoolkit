              On    15th April,       1989     ( 1 5 0 4 8 9 ),   I was working          in that Hospital          w h e n at

              about 3 .20      pm (1520 hrs)            I was made aware             that a major          incident     had

              o c c u r r e d at H i l l s b o r o u g h Football      Stadium.



              I arrived      in the Ca s u a l t y D epartment at 3.25                    pro (1525 h r s ) whe n major

              incident      cases were         just     beginning        to arrive.           I could hear        the

              ambu l a n c e s arriving.

                                          ----------------------------
   learned was a Mr Paul B r a d ^ . / He was a white male,                     unconscious,        with

   fixed dilated pupils,            rej^JM?citation was         unsuccessful      and    I declared

   him dead at      1665 hrs      that day.        I c a n ’t describe      his    clothing.        I

   w rote my name on his a b d o m e n a nd the time              I had    certified him dead.

   He was blue      coloured and         pulseless.



   I next    received a        14 or    15 year    old young man from the C a s u a l t y

   entrance,      he was    conscious      but oblivious         to his surroundings and had

   o b v i o u s l y suffe r e d from anoxia.       He had no external            injuries and after

   assessement      in casualty,         I accompanied         him to W ard 60.         I don't     know

   his    name.    I believe      he was     later t r a n s f e r r e d to the Royal       Hallmashire

   Hospital,      Sheffield.



   I remained on W ard 60 and a s s e s s e d 3 other young male                    patients,       who

   had s u f f e r e d minor    injuries.



   At ar o u n d 4 .30 pm      (1630 hrs)     I returned to the triage              point    in

   casualty,      but this was         fully staffed.          I returned to Ward 60,             and

  jss e s s e s r and treated a p p r o x i m a t e l y ten    (10)    other young and middle

   igedyroen, who a g a i n had suffe r e d minor              chest and    limb injuries.              I

   ioyn't know their        names      but one was      from                        N Wales.



\ / One   further man,      about 20 years         of age was         unconscious   and had the

   signs    of Hypoxia brain           injury,    his   condition d e t e r i o r a t e d and he

   star t e d fitting.         He was    intubated by an a n a e s t h e t i s t and tr a n s f e r r e d

   to the    Intensive Care Unit.



   At a r o u n d 6 pm   (1800 h r s ? there were         no further       patients arriving                on

   W ar d 60 and    I proceeded to Ward 66,              where many of the          patients       had

             male about 45 years                old.     His   chest     X ray was abnormal         and a sus p i c i o n

             of    ruptured thoracic a orta was                 raised.      I a r r a n g e d an a n g i o g r a m w hich

             patient was        returned to the ward.

berea v e d or inju red as a result of the t r a g e d y at H i l l s b o r o u g h on
the 15th April 1989.

Clients of the g r o u p wer e invited by means of a n e w s l e t t e r and
r e g u l a r b u lletins issued by the S t e e r i n a C o m m i t t e e to make

    ITEM NO 1. CH O I C E OF V ENUE

    It is s u b mitted that the fol l o w i n g factors should be taken into
    acco u n t w h e n d e c i d i n g the venue for s i g n i f i c a n t football m a t c h e s
    such as the s e m i - f i n a l of the F.A. c o m p e t i t i o n held on the 15th
    A pril 1989:-

    i.      The ground       should     have   the h i g h e s t p o s s i b l e   sa f e t y
            standard.

    ii.     The ground should be g e o g r a p h i c a l l y s u i t a b l e        for access          by
            s u p p o r t e r s of both clubs.

    iii.    Those r e s p o n s i b l e for p o l i c i n g the e vent should have                had
            pr e v i o u s e x p e r i e n c e of c o n t r o l l i n g large crowds.

            In a d d i t i o n there should       be a d e q u a t e   c o n s u l t a t i o n s with
            both clubs involved.



    ITEM NO     2. T I C K E T ALLOCATION.

    i.     It is sug g e s t e d that the m a j o r i t y of tickets should be
            a l located to the clu b wit h the h i g h e s t average home gate.

    ii.    Strenuous steps shou ld be taken to p r e v e n t the sale of
            tickets by touts.    As m e n t i o n e d below, stre e t s leading
            to the ground should be sealed off and fans w i t h o u t tickets


â€¢
            should not be allowed into the o u t e r p e r i m e t e r area.



    ITEM NO     3. T I C K E T FORMAT

    T i c k e t s should c l e a r l y state that s p e c t a t o r s should be in their
    p o s i t i o n s at least half an h our before the s c h e d u l e d kick off and
    the tickets should also c arry c l e a r d i r e c t i o n s for the ticket
    ho l d e r to the r e l e v a n t area of the ground.             Perhaps a small
    basic plan of the ground could be p r i n t e d on the ticket itself.




                                                -1-
ITEM NO 4 TRAVEL FACILITIES

Serious c o n s i d e r a t i o n should be g iven to i m p r o v i n g faci l i t i e s         for
s p e c t a t o r s ariv i n g both by p u b l i c and by p r i v a t e transport.
Man y Brit i s h grou n d s are located in enclosed, built up areas
w h i c h a llow b o t t l e n e c k s of traffic and s p e c t a t o r s to arise.
P e d e s t r i a n access should o n l y be allowed to areas i m m e d i a t e l y
s u r r o u n d i n g the ground.

An a l t e r n a t i v e means of a l l o w i n g fans eas y access to and from
grounds can be seen in D u s s e l d o r f and Cologne, w h e r e tramcar
t e r minals are s i t uated near to the stadium, and b a r riers p r o v i d e d
to chan n e l que u e s of fans to and from the tram c a r entrances.



ITEM NO     5. A C C E S S TO G R O U N D

i.     It is sug g e s t e d that a series of "outer p e r i m e t e r " control
       p o i n t s should be e s t a b l i s h e d , e f f e c t i v e l y p r o v i d i n g fil tered
       access to the area w h i c h i m m e d i a t e l y s u r r o u n d s the ground
       itself.           T hese cont r o l p o i n t s should c o n s i s t of na r r o w
       g a t e w a y s c o n t r o l l e d by s t e w a r d s and p o l i c e wh o w ould check
       tick ets and refuse e n t r y to fans w i t h o u t them.


ii.    Once beyond the o u t e r p e r i m e t e r , the fans w o u l d have
       a d e q u a t e room to meet one another, buy r e f r e s h m e n t s and
       p r o g r a m m e s and locate the c o r r e c t e n t r y gate.

iii.   I n creased numb e r s of entr a n c e s , t u r n s t i l e s and exits to the
       ground itself shou ld be p r o vided.                       These should be a d e quate
       in number to a c c o m o d a t e large numbers of fans o v e r a short
       period.      S t r u c t u r e d q u e i n g faci l i t i e s to the r e s p e c t i v e
       gates should be p r ovided.                   The o u t e r p e r i m e t e r control
       po i n t s could of co u r s e be used to cont r o l the numb e r s of
       fans q u e i n g o u t s i d e the gate at any one time.

iv.    W h e r e v e r n e c e s s a r y the m atch kick off       should     be dela y e d
       until all fans are inside the ground.

v.     An a d e q u a t e c o m m u n i c a t i o n s y s t e m should be set up between
       those c o n t r o l l i n g the crowd o u t s i d e the ground and those
       inside the
       ground.



ITEM NO     6. G R O U N D PLANS A N D SIGN P O S T I N G

C lear ground p lans show i n g the r e l e v a n t area to be o c c u p i e d by
each ticket h o l d e r should be e r e c t e d both o u t s i d e and inside each
ground.         If p o s s i b l e each ticket should be c l e a r l y ma r k e d with
re l e v a n t directions.
Once inside the ground there should be sign p osts c l e a r l y
p o i n t i n g the w a y for each ticket holder.                       Ground p lans d i s p l a y e d
in a        p r o m i n e n t p o s i t i o n w i t h i n the grou n d s should d e m o n s t r a t e to
fans w h i c h areas are a v a i l a b l e for them to o c c u p y and give
d i r e c t i o n s to those areas.                   It w ould be p r e f e r a b l e if the
internal ground p l a n s could be e l e c t r o n i c so that they could,
a u t o m a t i c a l l y sho w w h e n c e r t a i n areas of e.g. ter r a c i n g wer e
full.



ITEM NO 7. G R O U N D SA F E T Y

D if f e r i n g views are e x p r e s s e d    as   to w h e t h e r sta d i a should       become
all se a t e r or not.

One view is that all the t e rracing a c c o m o d a t i o n should be
w i t h d r a w n and replaced by seating.       It is felt that w h i l s t this
w o u l d limit the c a p a c i t y of the ground, it w o u l d both p r e v e n t the
d a n g e r of crowd "surging" and w o u l d also e f f e c t i v e l y d i m i n i s h the
nu m b e r of fans seek i n g acce ss to a ground w i t h o u t tickets.
Stewa r d s should be a v a i l a b l e to s how fans to their seats.

An a l t e r n a t i v e vie w e x p r e s s e d is that s t a n d i n g room should be
maintained, but that p a r t i t i o n i n g fences used to s u b - d i v i d e
s t a n d i n g e n c l o s u r e s into small pens should be removed, to en a b l e
fans to spread out as needed.                      C r i t i c i s m is also d i r e c t e d at
t e r racing w h i c h has to be e n t e r e d from the rear, a l l o w i n g the
e x e r t i o n of forward pressure.

It is g e n e r a l l y felt that all p e r i m e t e r fences should be removed
immediately.                If p e r i m e t e r fences are to remain in position,
then it is e s s e n t i a l that they should be r e p l a c e d w i t h fencing
w h i c h can be op e n e d a u t o m a t i c a l l y in the e vent of an emergency.
A l t e r n a t i v e l y , if the fences do not have an a u t o m a t i c open i n g
facility, then c u t t i n g e q u i p m e n t m u s t be a v a i l a b l e and trained
o p e r a t o r s a v a i l a b l e to use it to ens u r e that fast access can be
gained to the t e r races if an e m e r g e n c y arises.

In addition, an e f f e c t i v e p u b l i c address s y s t e m should be
installed at each ground, p r e f e r a b l y to include e l e c t r o n i c notice
boards.    E f f e c t i v e s t e w a r d i n g should be i m p l e m e n t e d as a m a t t e r
of course.



ITEM NO 8. G R O U N D F A C I L I T I E S

It is s u b mitted that each gr o u n d should have a m i n i m u m level of
faci l i t i e s w h i c h should include the f o l l o w i n g : -

i.     Clean toilet facilities.
ii.    F acilities for sale of n e w s p a p e r s and magazines.
iii.   F a cilities for some p r e - m a t c h e n t e r t a i n m e n t .
iv.    Facil i t i e s for the p r o v i s i o n of refreshments.




                                               -3-
In respect of iv. o p i n i o n s are d i v i d e d as to the sale of alcohol
in or n ear f o o tball grounds.           One vie w is that alcohol should be
p r o h i b i t e d from grou n d s and that p u b l i c houses and off licences
w i t h i n the area of the ground should be closed on m a t c h days,
w ith alcohol being c o n f i s c a t e d at the o u t e r p e r i m e t e r control
poi n t s and wit h d r u n k e n fans being refused admission.

The o t h e r vie w m a i n t a i n s that alcohol is now an integral p art of
the football fan's "day out" and that p r o h i b i t i o n of alcohol onl y
leads to more d e t e r m i n e d and c o n c e n t r a t e d c o n s u m p t i o n of it p r i o r
to the match.         T h o s e taking this v i e w feel that alco h o l should
in fact be on sale w i t h i n the gr o u n d itself.


ITEM N O 9. C R O W D C O N T R O L A N D P O L I C I N G METH O D S

i.     The o p e r a t i o n of o u t e r p e r i m t e r control po i n t s w o u l d a llow
       p o l i c e and s t e wards to o p e r a t e a "filter" type s y s t e m for
       fans ariv i n g in large numbers.                   Drunk a n d / o r t icketless
       fans could be e x c l u d e d from the inner area.

ii.    There should be n a t i o n a l c o o p e r a t i o n betw e e n v a r i o u s p o l i c e
       forces to d e t e r m i n e the m o s t e f f e c t i v e wa y of c o n t r o l l i n g
       football fans, and a d e q u a t e numbers of p r o p e r l y trained
       stewa r d s should also be in a t t e n d a n c e and r e a d y and able to
       take an active role.

iii.   A r e v i e w of p o l i c i n g m e t h o d s should be u n d e r t a k e n in an
       attempt to avoid all football fans being treated as
       "hooligans".           This a t t i t u d e appears p r e v a l e n t and creates
       re s e n t m e n t and antagonism.             It should be r e c o g n i s e d that
       the g reat m a j o r i t y of football s p e c t a t o r s have no inter est
       in c r e a t i n g or b e c oming involved in trouble.

iv.    It is felt that f o o tball p l a y e r s t h e m s e l v e s should rec o g n i s e
       their own r e s p o n s i b i l i t y in r e s p e c t of their spectators,
       by d e m o n s t r a t i n g p r o p e r c o n d u c t on the pitch.

v.     W h e r e i n d i v i d u a l s u p p o r t e r s are k n o w n to have caused crowd
       trouble in the past, it is sug g e s t e d that their p h o t o g r a p h
       should be p r o m i n e n t l y d i s p l a y e d on m atch days and that they
       should be e x c l u d e d from f u r t h e r matches.                Lists of t r o u b l e Â­
       some fans should be n a t i o n a l l y available.



ITEM NO     10.   E M E R G E N C Y S E R VICES

i.     It is s u g g e s t e d each gr o u n d should make c o n t i n g e n c y p lans
       for the e m e r g e n c y servi c e s to dea l wit h a m a j o r disaster.
       It should be ensu r e d that e m e r g e n c y s e r v i c e s are f ully aware
       of the l o c a t i o n of the gro u n d and the p o i n t s of access to it

       P r ovisions should be made for a d e q u a t e and imm e d i a t e m e d i c a l
       a t t e n t i o n to be available.      Each ground should have m e d i c a l
       f a cilities to be m a i n t a i n e d to a high standard, to include
       r e s u s c i t a t i o n equipment.




                                                  -4-
        A r r a n g e m e n t s should be m a d e for one indi v i d u a l to take o v e r Â­
        all cont r o l of the e m e r g e n c y s e r v i c e s in the e vent of a
        d i s a s t e r occuring.

ii.     In f o r m a t i o n facilities.           An a d e q u a t e s y s t e m of e m e r g e n c y
        te lephone numbers should be p r o v i d e d to cope wit h the vast
        n u m b e r of e n q u i r i e s w h i c h f o l l o w a d i s a s t e r such as that at
        Hills b o r o u g h .      Perhaps a n a t i o n a l e n q u i r i e s serv i c e could
        be set up, to be brought into o p e r a t i o n o n l y in the e vent of
        a m a j o r disaster.

iii. W h e r e rel a t i v e s are m a k i n g e n q u i r i e s a bout a fa m i l y m e m b e r
     wh o has not been traced a fter a r e a s o n a b l e p e r i o d of time,
     it is sug g e s t e d that the e m e r g e n c y s e r v i c e s should take the
     initi a t i v e to invite them to attend at the s cene of the
     d i s a s t e r to as s i s t in i d e n t i f i c a t i o n proced u r e s .  At
     H i l l s b o r o u g h this was on more than one o c c a s i o n left to
     the initi a t i v e of families concerned.

iv.     It is s u g g e s t e d that w h e r e p o l i c e "scenes of crime" o f f i c e r s
        are a t t e n d i n g m a t c h e s in p l a i n clothes, they should have
        some means of c l e a r i d e n t i f i c a t i o n - e.g. a c o l o u r e d tabard-

                             SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF MR. AND
                                      MRS. ASHCROFT.


We do not propose to make any submissions in relation to the matters directly
appertaining to the circumstances at the Ground. These are well covered by
submissions made by others.

The submissions which we wish to make relate to the facilities available to
the families of the dead and injured following the Disaster.

The information facilities available for the families were totally inadequate
to cope with a Disaster of the magnitude w h i c h occurred at Hillsborough.
Emergency telephone numbers were provided but it is quite clear that the
emergency numbers provided were totally inadequate to cope with the numbers
of enquiries being made. It was only as a result of approaches made through
Warrington Police that any information at all was given to Mr. and Mrs. Ashcrof ,

It became plain on the Sunday morning that something serious had befallen
Mr. and Mrs. Ashcroft's son as he had not returned from Hillsborough. A full
description of their son was provided on a number of occasions and Mr. an
Mrs. Ashcroft were told on more than one occasion that there was nobody
fitting that description amongst the victims of the Disaster.

their emergency centres being swamped by distraught relatives, an m v i a ion
to Mr. and Mrs. Ashcroft to visit Sheffield was not made. It was a suggestion
made by Mr. and Mrs. Ashcroft at approximately lunchtime on the Sunday which
resulted in their travelling to Sheffield. We accept that we are judging this
matter with the benefit of hindsight but we feel that it was not unreasona le
to come to the conclusion that if somebody who had attended the Match had
not returned home by early Sunday morning that something serious had occurre
to that person. At that point there was still a number of unidentified bodies.
Consideration should have been given at that point to the question of inviting
the families to go to Sheffield to assist in identification procedures.

                      SUGGESTIONS/SUBMISSIONS OF STEPHEN JONES

                                           OF

                                PENWORTHAM, PRESTON.    LANCS,



1 .______ GROUND SAFETY - All perimeter fencing should be removed before the
start of the next football season.      Also partioning fences which sub divide
enclosures in to small pens.      There is no doubt in my mind that the layout
of the Leppings Lane end contributed to the high death toll.        Had we been
able to spread out we could have accommodated those coming in late.        Please
note also that any terrace which is entered from the rear is a potential death
trap.   More and better club stewarding is required.       I saw none atHillsborough
and consequently my wife and I went on to a part of the terrace which later
became overloaded while adjacent pens were unfilled.        S.W.F.C. had no regard
for   the safety of   spectators and as such should be prosecuted   to extinction.


2 .______ CHOICE OF VENUE - The criteria by which venues are chosen for the
semi final of the F.A. cup should not be influenced by club Chairmen having
friends at Lancaster Gate.     They should include the ground being up to safety
standard, geographically suitable for both clubs, and those responsible for
policing the event having the experience of controlling big crowds.        Hillsborough
met none of these.     Old Trafford was a much more suitable location.     It is
a pityit took   95    deaths for those in authority to see it.


3 .______ TICKET ALLOCATION - In future the majority of tickets     should go to
the club with the highest average home gate. L.F.C.'s allocation would only
cover their season ticket holders and so it obvious a large number of ticketless
fans travelled on the day adding to the confusion and crush outside Gate C.
Also to stop ticketless fans travelling on the day, touting should be illegal
and the streets leading to the ground sealed off.        Anyone wanting access to
the ground should be asked to produce a ticket.        This was the case at the
Parc de Prancs stadium in Paris which I attended a 'European cup final.       It
can be done here.     I would also recommend that tickets are printed with the
rider that spectators should be in their places at least half an hour before
the kick off.    I wonder how many of those who seem so knowledgeable of events
outside Gate C were swilling beer when respectable fans were in the ground.
_L:______ ALCOHOL - All pubs in the vicinity of the ground should be closed
for the reason mentioned above.   Any alcohol in the possession of fans should
be confiscated.   Any fan arriving at the ground drunk should not be allowed
entry.


5_;______ EMERGENCY SERVICES - No provision was made by S.W.F.C. for a major
disaster.   How many of our people would be here now if immediate medical
attention had been available?   The response of emergency services was slow
and hampered by both the ground's location and Police incompetance in failing
to assess the seriousness of the situation.

Proposals for safer football stadia
      by               (who was present at Hillsborough
                        on 15th April 1989)

1.    ALL football stadia should be all-seater,
      therefore it would be quite pointless and futile
      for fans to arrive at the ground without tickets.
      Also, with every person being seated, there would
      be little danger of people being pushed forward
      and suffocated by the crowd surging behind them.

2.    The football stadia should be better policed,
      i.e. more officers should be on duty INSIDE and
      OUTSIDE the ground and a system of queueing should
      be put into effect in order to enter the ground
      in an orderly fashion.

3.    There should be many more stewards on duty,
      showing fans to their seats, etc.

k.    All areas inside the ground should be well
      signposted - indicating where one's seats are
      situated.

 5.     Better access into the ground is required, i.e.
        more entrances, exits and turnstiles.

 6.     More liaison is ESSENTIAL between police officers
        INSIDE and OUTSIDE the stadium.

        xf necessary* commencement of match should be
        delayed in order to ascertain that all the fans
        are inside the stadium at kick-off.

didn't        follow the          coach as          it drove a r o u n d        picking     up various            members

of the        club from various                   points.          The Hewitt      brothers       d i d n ’t travel           on

the mini            bus.

We    t r a v e l l e d to L e i c e s t e r       where      we    picked    up another member             of the

club and then went                    up the Ml         to Sheffield.            We made       no stops      after

that.         There were          no travel          delays.          The traffic was fairly h eavy                      as

we    got     to     Sheffield.             It was      starting       to build up a             little     bit.

We a r r i v e d      in S h e f f i e l d at about            12.30    prn to     1 pm.       U s u a l l y we    drive

staight        to the ground a n d                 obtain      programmes        before we go and             park       up.

This     time        though we w e r e n ’t a l l o w e d to drive                 to the      ground.       We were

directed            by the Police            to a side         road off the Halifax F oad w h e r e we

were     told        to park.          There       were a l r e a d y 4 or 5 other m i n i b u s e s          parked

there.          I    should think            that     by now        it was     closer    to       1 pm.

W h e n we got          off   the mini            bus we      found that anot h e r         3 or 4 police

tickets w hich we did.                   Apart       from myself             every o n e was        s u b j e c t e d to a

brief     search w h i c h        I presumed to be for alcohol                            or any offensive

weapons.

We then all walked                to    the    ground to buy                 programmes. We         d i d n ’t have

any escort we knew our way                      in     any      case and d i d n ’t, need any               directions.

There were          quite a few          police        about but            the m a j o r i y     of suppo r t e r s were

only    just       starting       to arrive.

We bought          programmes at          the    ground.              By    now    it i/as about          1.30     pm.       2

of us went          back    to the mini b u s             to    put    the    mp©g ramrnes        in, myself          and

_____ (whose        surname       I d o n ’t know).              We Jreft the            others     to thems e l v e s

_____ and myself           went    to t h e H ors e a r j f J o c key Pu b w h i c h                is somewhere

over    the South S tand               side    of the          /ound.         There were          other     s u pporters

d r i nking    in there,          just Liverpool                fans.        I noticed that            some      pubs were

closed w h i c h s u r p r i s e d me.           r w o u l d have            thought       it better        to either

close all          of the    pubs      or none at all.

We    left    the     pub at about 2.20              pm and w a l k e d           back    to      the ground.             I did

not witn e s s        any disorder fighting                    or drun k e n e s s       throughout.           It,    was

a b o u t 2.3 0     pm w hen we         came    back       over       the    bridge       i n L e p p i n g s L.a n e ,

just    before       the turnstiles.

Straightaway          I saw this mass                of    p e o p 1e s p r e a d i n g    out    from the

turnstiles          into    L e p pings        lane.       No one was             rushing or        a n y t h i n g like

that,     it was      just a steady mass                   of people.              We    had to     get    over to the

left    hand side          of the      turn s t i l e s        in order       to get       through to get             to the

N o r t h S tand      (around gate A area).                    It took       10 to       15      minutes      to

get    through        to the      turnstile.              It was      quite       tight.          It was more packed

than    I ’d ever       seen before            or experienced. / There                     had been the            same

p r o b 1 e m at    t h e s e m i fin a 1 the year               be&dfred         (which      I also attended)               but

it had not          been    quite as          bad.

The    only Police          I saw were m o u n t e d police and                     some       standing       by the

    t u r n s t i l e s-      They were       searching        some    people      but    I felt that           perhaps

    they were wa s t e d            in that       position as         they w o u l d n ’t have         been able        to

    get away from the                 turn s t i l e s    if they     had needed to.             I d i d n ’t see any

    stewards           outside      the     turnstiles.

    I did have             d i f f i c u l t y getting     to my entry       point and entering                 the

    ground?          purely because           of the       crush outside          the    ground.

    I went          thro u g h a t u rnstile and han d e d by ticket                     in.     I didn't        see any

    gates       other       than the        turnstiles       open and       I didn't witness              the    opening

    of any gates.                 I didn't witness any              u n a u t h o r i s e d entry to the ground,

        Once    through the           t urnstiles         I knew where       I had to go so             I wasn't

    really          looking       for any     signs       to the N o r t h Stand.          Once at        the North

    Stand       I had to          look    for the        numbers    by the    entrances,           there were

    plenty of stewards                   about    though     if you       needed to ask.              I had no

    problems          in finding my seat.

    I did       not witness           any   disorder        or other       incidents       between        the    entry

    point and my m a t c h               viewing    point.         I did not witn e s s          the    consumption

    of any alcohol                within    the    ground.         I was    not   near     the    barrier        in pen

v   nor       did    I see     it break.

    I took          up my m a t c h      veiwing    position at a Pout                     pm,     I was

          h                           I didn't      see any        fights    or disturbances.                  What was
    —
    unsual          was    that at       looking    towards        the West S t a n d the          side    pens were

    virtually             empty    compared       to the middle           ones„    My     first       thought     was

    that       they hadn't          sold all       the     tickets     or that      people were           late.       It

    became          evident       before    the kick        off    that    people were          very    tightly

    packed behind the                 goal mouth.           I remember       thinking          that    I wouldn't

    want       to be       in there.

    I didn't          notice any          great    surge     in the West Stand.                 I wa s n ' t    involved

    in any          crowd    crush.

    I first          noticed       people     climbing       out of the       pens       just after        the    kick

    off.        1 did not think             it was a pitch            invasion.          I realised        it was
                                                                                                          PAGE
                                                                                                          S2669

people      trying      to get        out of the            crowd because      they were       so tightly

packed.         In fact                              turned    to me    straightaway         saying    that     they

should      stop the         game.

After     the game       had stop p e d             people were       carried out and         laid out        into

the    pitch     in front of where we were                      seated.       I could see       people giving

them m o u t h to m outh            etc.        1 am not able          to say though,         where anyone

actually        died.        I myself          didn't assist wit h any of the dead or                     injured

I left the        football          ground a r o u n d 5 pm.            I left of my own accord.

There were        some a n n o u n c e m e n t s       but    I couldn't      hear    some    of them.

At no time        did    1 witn e s s a n y thing             that    1 consider      to be    criminal

offence.         I saw a lot of                people       having    'strong'    words wit h the         police

a fter    the    game.         I didn't a c t u a l l y        see anyone      attack a n ybody.I         cannot

say a n y t h i n g about         the Hewitt           brothers.        I didn't      see    them at

all    that day.         I am aware             though that          they always      used to go behind

the    goa1 mouth.

After     the m a t c h was         stop p e d the mai n         problem was         that    there were       no

announcements           to    let    people          know    of the    severity      of the    situation.

This w o uld have            quietened          down some       of the more       noisy N o t t i n g h a m

F orest    fans might           have      shut       up earlier.        A line of Police O f f icers

lined up,        p r esumably        to    prevent any          trouble      from the Notts        Forest

End.      This    stop p e d any          trouble       but    I wonder wh y      if so many Po l i c e

O f f i c e r s were a v i a l b e       then then why          h a d n ’t they Jbfeen used outside             the

L e p p i n g s Lsane    tur n s t i l e       to    prevent    the    c rus^f outside       there.     There

also     a p e p a r e d to be a         lack of       communiatiafi betw e e n the           police and        the

other     e m ergency        services.              Police    seejyred to be standing and             looking

rather     than a c t i v e l y      doing anything.                 There also      seemed    to be a

general      lack    of faci l i t i e s and a m e n i t i e s          available.          For a ground

holding      that    number         of    people       I would       have   thro u g h that    they should

have     had better          equ i p m e n t    etc.

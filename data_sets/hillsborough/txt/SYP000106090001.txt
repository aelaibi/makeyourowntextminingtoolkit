                 SUBJECT:    H i n sb0rough Disaster Enquiry


                 With regards to the above subject I have to report as follows*

                 At 9 ,k 3 aa on Saturday the 15th of April 1989 I paraded for duty on the
                 North stand at Hillsborough Football Cround re the F.A. Cup Semi Final
                 between Liverpool Club and Nottingham Forest*

                 I was in serial 58 the sergeant of which was P S Williamson.

                 Our duties for the game were to pafcral Berries Road from the Five Arches
                 Public House to Moonshine Lane, both sides of the carriageways until
                 the game had started.

                 At 2.50pm our serial made their way to the Fenistone Road side of the ground
                 to be conveyed to Claywheels Lane* for meal.
                 On our arrival at this location at approximately 3 .^0 pÂ® we were taken
                 into the ground on the perimeter track in front of the Hottingham Forest
                 fans on the fenistone Road stand, being instructed to prevent these fans
                 from invading the pitch.

                 At this time there were a lot of fans on the pitch at the Leppings Lane
                 stand, milling about.

                 Somet'ime later I became aware that some supporters had been injured and
                 in fact died
                 At 7pm I was stood down at Claywheeld Lane along with the rest of my serial.

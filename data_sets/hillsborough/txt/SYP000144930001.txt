                          At approximately           10.10 am on the            15th April;,       19S9      I set off

from my home                 in S h e f f i e l d ar riving at the H i l l s b o r o u g h stadium at                     10.

20 am,          on reaching              the P l a y e r ’s entrance where               the Stewards            sign    in,

was a p p r o a c h e d fay a lad wearing a                       '’brown      leather    jacket"        asking me         if

1 wantsa              to buy some             tickets,     when      I replied by saying            I worked            here

he answe r e d              " Y o u ’re no good to me",                and walked off        towards Fe n i s t o n e




1    t h e n waiKeel             in    the    ground    on w h e r e    I put m y    name    down       on   the    sheet,

I was        surprised that my name was                                                                  on Sheet        no

         Whilst            signing my name one of my                    colleagues       stood behind me

awaiting              his    turn,       he    commented       about     a   supporter      with    a    scouse      accent

who      had      a       large       amount    of   money     and     quite   a   few   tickets        to   sell.       We

Chen       went,       outside          to    discuss    the    match.




ien minutes went                       by before we        re “-entered the ground and as                    I

a p p r o a c h e d tne Waiting                 room my name was             called out and given my job,                       I
    was    placed      on    turnstile         no         to   which    it    is   on   the   Leppings       Ln   end    of

    the gates were            not opene d due to there                   being       no supporters       outside,,



    At a p p r o x i m a t e l y   11 am         11.13 am we decided to open the gates.

    of abuse       from fans and quite a few fans                            tried to jump over w ithout

    tickets.         Some fans were             complaining            that    the fans outside were

    pushing and squashing a W oman Police Officer against                                      the wall,          she

even t u a l l y was          pulled through my turnstile,                         very shaky and white.                 I

was       then told after              the     rush had gone to close my gate as                       I was       the

first          to open.



At 3.05          pm I heard a big               roar      from the       crowd.         At that moment Police

Officers asked all                   of us to shut all                turnstiles,         I then    counted my

ticket stubs              total 332.            One of the stewards                came around and took                 the

f inishi ng         no's.          After     locking my doors             I went outside           to w hi ch     I saw

some        fans sat on            Ihe tloor        it was at         this    time      I was still     unaware of

I made my way               round the back of the North Stand, to hand, my tickets                                       in.

on which          I saw some          injured        people making            their way out to the

a w a i t i n g ambulances.                On having           seen this      I quickly       put my ticket          bag

inside ihy coat and went                      to assist         the    injured and do oossibly what                     I

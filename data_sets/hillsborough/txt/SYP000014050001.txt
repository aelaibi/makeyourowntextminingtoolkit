                                      Hillsborough Incident - Sheffield

                                         Saturday, 15th April, 1989




               For your information and favour of onward transmission to the
          investigators of the West Midlands Police, I enclose a duty report submitted
          by Superintendent Sattler and statements of evidence tendered by
          Constables 'G'                            'G'
          *G’                    and 'X'                      who were all on duty
          on Saturday, 15th April, 1989.

               There was a traffic hold-up on the motorway; the tail-back being
          caused by the heavy volume of traffic travelling to Sheffield via the M67/A57
          route. As you are probably aware, the M67 terminates at Hattersley/Mottram
          and from then onwards, is a single lane carriageway travelling through the
          villages of Mottram, Broadbottom and Hollingworth into the Derbyshire
          Constabulary area. Even on a normal work day, this route is heavily used
          causing long tail-backs of traffic. The use of that route by traffic
          attending an F.A. Cup Semi-Final would only exacerbate the situation, which
          has worsened in the past twelve months with the opening of the Stocksbridge
          inter-section of the Ml near Huddersfield.

               As Sheffield is often used as an F.A. Cup Semi-Final venue, this
          Division arranges for extra patrols en-route but has not previously
          experienced problems with fans travelling to the game; our contingency plans
          usually relate to the evening on the return from the match whereby fans
          usually visit hostelries in the Broadbottom, Hollingworth and Mottram
          areas and have in previous years, caused Police and the local public some
          considerable problems. There were no such problems on the evening of
          Saturday, 15th April, 1989.

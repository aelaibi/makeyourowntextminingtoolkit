the      Kick          off        -       that        I was          looking              down           at    the       crowd        from           a       position

 in     the        center             of       the       stand        slightly                     to    the       left     of      the         central             tunnel              —

 push          forward            down             the     terracing                 -    pushing              the       people          that            were       already

 standing              there              forward.                The       scene              reminded             me     of     the      type              of    pictures

 that      are         seen           on       television                       -        in        the       nature        programmes                    -    when

 This          wedge         of       peo pie             seemed,          to       go     forward             down        the      t e r r a c e n g , bus,

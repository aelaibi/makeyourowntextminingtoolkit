            reported to            Inspector Sca r f s          in the Football               Clu b Gymnasium.

some    people were        being      crushed      in the West Stand.                   1 heard the Chief

Inspector       with the m e g a p h o n e       telling     the    supporters           not to try to

enter    the    ground.       The su pp o r t e r s    were       taking     no notice.            I then

walked     into the en c l o s u r e       where    the t u r n s t i l e s are and e n l i s t e d the

help of several PCs and a Sergeant.                          I i n s t r u c t e d the        officers     to move

the    supporters      out    of the       enclosure and to              close    the gates.             I did

this    in an effort         to    prevent       even more        supporters          from e n t ering         the

ground.

A few minutes        later,       at about^^T'TS pm            (1510)      I.) saw      some    people

                 emerging         from the exit            gate of the* W e s j ^ ^ a n d ^ Some men were                             helping

                 people      get      out of the gate,              these 'people a p p e a r e d to~be                   in pain and

                 were    holding           their    chests and stomachs.                     I went       to these         people and

                 a d m i n i s t e r e d what      first aid        1 could.             I then saw a man               come        running

                 out    carrying a young                 boy,    the    boy was         extremely         pale.        By this            time

                 there were a lot of s upporters                            outside       the     exit    gates,       most         of these

                 were    shouting and swearing at Police O f f i c e r s                              and saying           that       there

                 were    quite a few            people      being       crushed to death.                   I then went              with

                 se v e r a 1 other         officers       into the enc 1 osure at the                      rea.r of the Wsst

                 area.       I also saw several                  people        lying on the ground                  being a t t e n d e d to

                 by friends           or    relatives.           A g a in     I rendered what             first aid          1 could

                 until     a mb ul a n c e and fire             service        personnel          arrived.          I then o r g a n i s e d

                 a m b u la nc e .

                 I saw quite a lot of                    casualties          around       the     first a/'cl room,            I then

be h i n d the ground g ym na s i u m and were              loaded up and despa t c h e d from

that    point.          Whe n there were        no more     casualties        I went   to P e n i s t o n e Rd

s ta d i u m as        required.

S ho r t l y a f t e r w a r d s , I presume      it will    have     been just after 5.00             pm

(1700)      I was        in the a r e a of the Police         room w h e n I saw several Police

Of f i c:ers behind one of the                prison b u s e s .    These     officers were         openly

crying and were             very distressed.            I m an ag ed to obtain keys           for a

p e r s o n n e 1 carrier,        I took     these officers         to the van,      placed them        in it

and drove           them to C l a y w he el s Ln where       I left them to obtain some

refreshments.              1 returned to the ground where                 I again assisted

Inspector Scarfe                in the traffic        d i rection    needed    in the ground and             in

Pe ni st on e Rd.

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 7.3 0    pm   (1930)     the same date,        I was    i nstructed to go

to C l a y w he el s Ln         in order     to account     for the Police          vehicles        in use

there a n d to organise               transport       for serials who were           to be stood down.

At 9.10       pm       (2110)    I returned to the ground with PC Dicks with

e m e r ge nc y     lighting      e q uipment w hich we set up wit h            inspector Scarfe.                 I

was    then enga g e d with the setting up and                      running    of material          comforts

to be     p rovided for the            relatives and friends            of the deceased             persons

who    had just arrived.               I also was       in charge of several            police      officers

On the mai n gate who were                   keeping the Press         out a n d ad m i t t i n g

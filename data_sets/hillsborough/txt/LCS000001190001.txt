Dr. Popper made some remarks pa r t i c ul ar ly for the jury:-
This     is an in quisitional      court    rather  than an   advacarial
court.
Inqu es ts have limited o bj ec ti ve s
1) Who the deceased was
2) How, when and ./Where he/she died
3) Particulars to be r e g i s t e r e d e.g. name, d.o.b. etc.

N e i t h e r the coroner   nor    the    jury     is   to express     opinion   on any
o t h e r matter.

In most inquests the time is spent on 'how' the person died.
T h e s e inquests are even more lim it ed because we will not be
d e a l i n g with ' h o w 1. This is due to other inves tig ati ons by the
D.P.P. concerning criminal proceedings.

No ev idence will be a l l o w e d         that    is   in any way      critical   of   a
p e r s o n or corporation.

S u m m a r i e s will each be p r e s e n t e d on each case by West Midla nds
P o l i c e officer.
An y Post Mortem e v i de nc e will be pr ese nte d by a pa tho log ist

p re se nt ed .

V i d e o s and ph o t o g r a p h i c e v i d en ce will not be used.

P l a n s of the ground, the pens etc, will be shown and used to
i n d i c a t e whereabouts of the deceased. Tr ans cri pts will contain
c o p i e s of these plans.

Dr.   Popper went on to make             several    comments to the       families.

(1)      Blood samples.        Dr.  Po ppe r gave the a u t h o ri sa ti on for
s a mp l e s to be a n a ly se d for alcohol. He gave this a u t h o ri sa ti on
"in view of the situation".

(2) Viewing a r r a n g e m e n t s @ the M e d i c o- Le ga l Centre. There has
b e e n some c r i ti ci s m of having to view bodies through a glass
screen.

Dr.   Popper    feels    that     it wo uld      have   been   imposs ibl e   to cha nge

this because of the l i m i t at ion s of the building design, "it
isn't a Chapel of Rest" he said. The purpose of viewing is
only for identification.

(3) Use of the gym as a t e m p o r a r y morgue.                    In    Dr.   Popper's
o p i n i o n this was extremely convenient.

(4) Poloroid photos of the dead were taken at Dr. Popper's
r e qu es t in order to avoid families having to look at po ss ibl y
do ze ns of bodies before finding their loved ones.

(5) The moving of bodies from                hospi tal       to gym.      This   was   also
on Dr. Popper's authorisation.

This was      firstly in order to take photos.

Secondly      to   have   a   compl ete     'set'     of    photos   for    families     to
view.

N.B. Most of the bodies taken to                    the    gym were identified so a
formal system had to be devised.

fail, body lacks oxygen.

Pict ure in gen er a l of those who died was of as ph y x i a caused by
being so crus hed that the chest co ul dn' t move to breath.

Brain dam age occurs after about 5 minutes of asphyxia. Loss of
co nsciousness, m e r c i f ul l y occurs usua lly about 15 seconds after
asphyxia.

There      is often vomitting as part               of the last ph as e prior to
death     - Part of the act of dying.               Inhalation of vomit is also
often     involved.

Pr of es so r  Ush er        re assured families        that  those  suffering

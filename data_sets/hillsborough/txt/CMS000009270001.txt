           Dear

           Thank you for your recent letter to the Prime Minister which has
           been passed to this department in view of our responsibilities for
           the Safety of Sports Grounds Act.  I apologise for the delay in
           replying to you.

           Lord Justice Taylor recognised, in his Final Report, that there is
           no single solution to achieve crowd safety and cure all the
           problems of crowd control.  However, he was satisfied that seating
           does more to achieve these objectives than any other single
           measure.  He also considered that moving to all seated
           accommodation was consistent with the policies of both FIFA and
           UEFA.

           I understand your feelings and those of many others who wish to
           stand at football matches.  However, Lord Justice Taylor said in
           his Final Report:

           "I am not convinced that the cherished culture of the terraces is
           wholly lost when fans are seated. ... The communal spirit is still
           there and finds ready expression.  To such extent as the seating
           limits togetherness or prevents movement, that price is surely
           worth paying for the benefits in safety and control."

           This is a view with which the Government is in agreement.

           Lord Justice Taylor also commented that it should be possible for
           clubs to plan a price structure which suits the cheapest seats to
           the pockets of those presently paying to stand.  He pointed to
           Ibrox where seating is £6 and standing is £4, which he did not
           consider to be a prohibitive price or differential.  Therefore, the
           fears of many spectators that they may no longer be able to afford
           to attend football matches may be unnecessary.

                                                               Yours sincerely




                                                              MR S BILBE

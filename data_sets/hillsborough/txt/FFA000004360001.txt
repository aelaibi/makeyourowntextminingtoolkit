 MISS RICKARD                                17 April 1989




 FA/HILLSBOROUGH



 Telephoning              and discussing with her the issue of
 Counsel.     I said that it seemed to me that this was of such
 importance that there ought to be a Leader as well as a
 Junior involved.    She said that she was about to have a meeting
 with Graham Kelly and would raise that with him.        I also
 mentioned to her that Graham Kelly had been on Kilroy's
 programme this morning, and in view of the number of
 interviews etc that were being given, I thought it would be
 helpful if someone made sure that there were videos of all
 TV recordings.


 Telephoning Julian Gibson-Watt's clerk and
 clerk.    Julian Gibson-Watt will be available       With regard
to                            was a little hesitant           is
presently sitting as a Recorder,              was concerned that
there is a case that          has in the Court of Appeal or
House of Lords in June which will take up some considerable
time.          is also anxious not to do long cases,
was going to speak to          and phone me back,


Attending           on his telephoning when he told me that
        was flattered to be asked, however his wife was having
a baby shortly and if the enquiry was going to take place in
the north he was not that keen on being away.         I said I
quite understood.     We discussed other possible Counsel and
there was               and              in those Chambers,
____________ is apparently ex-director of Tottenham and is
known to the FA.     I said I was not certain that actually
knowledge of football was a pre-requisite to doing this job,
in some ways it might be better if someone did not have that
knowledge.     The reason was that the FA were already
entrenched enough without having someone who rather shared
their views.     It was left that I would come back to
if I needed any further help.


Speaking to              again when I mentioned to her that
perhaps we ought to have a meeting in the next day or so to
make sure that we were all going in the same direction.       I
mentioned to her that I would be in Germany on Thursday and
Friday.   I also mentioned to her the question of public
liability and that she should notify the public liability
insurers if she hasn't done so already.    She said that she
would make sure that that was passed on.


Total time! engaged: 2 hours 45 minutes

                        Mr. England said that access should be through gate 'O'
             on Penistone Road.                                      It was possible for narrow vehicles to
             travel along the back of the North Stand but large vehicles
             may have to go round the ground to reach the Leppings Lane end.

      Arrangements for access outside these can be made.

                        M r . England said that huts could be sited at the back of
            the North Stand and materials stored at the side of the
            gymnasium or under the North Stand adjacent to the Police hut.

 Dear Sirs,

                                     Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Limited
                                                  New Crush Barriers and Handrails

              We write to confirm the following items raised either by
 yourself or by a representative of the other contractors preparing
 tender prices for the work.
              1.     Referring to page 9 of the document, the completion
                     date              should read 23 July and not 23 June.                 The
                     Appendix is therefore correct.                    We would expect
                     work on site to begin no later than 29 May.

              2.     Page 38, please transpose the quantities against
                     items 3 and 4 to read Item 3 - 2 nr, Item 4 - 3 nr.

              3.     Please amend Clause 2.06 of the Specification to
                     read,
                                  In the corner area between the West and North
                     Stands eight bases will be excavated through insitu
                     concrete terracing with an expected average waist
                     depth of 150mm.  This is reinforced with one layer
                                                              2
                     of mesh with an nominal mass of 6.1 lb/yd . Eight
                     bases in this area will be excavated through mass
                     concrete for the full depth.                   Again a layer of mesh
                     reinforcement is likely to be encountered.

              Two revised copies of page 38 are enclosed, amended to
 cater for the extra over cost of this excavation.

Dear Mr England


     We have pleasure in enclosing a marked up copy of our
drawing 1610/7A shoving the seats in the South Stand which
we have relinquished to accommodtte the widened gangways.
      Presumably some ticket holders will have to be offered
alternative seats for next season.


      Yours sincerely

      Dear Sirs

                                      Crush Barrier and Wall Testing Equipment

                     Further to our telephone conversation today we have
      pleasure in inviting you to tender for the manufacture and
       supply of a testing rig to be used for loading crush barriers
       and walls at sports stadia.
                     Enclosed is a single copy of our drawing 1861/1
       showing an arrangement of the test rig, and two gauge posts.
                     You should include in your price the cost of providing
       the hydraulic jacks and central hand operated pump unit.                                                            The
       jacks should have a capacity of not less than                                                      2\   tons with an
       approximate travel of 75 mm.                                    The hydraulic unit should have
       the facility for operating both jacks or one jack if the twin
       test rig is divided into two for testing single barriers.
                     Please allow for applying a coat of priming paint,
       followed by an undercoat and gloss coat.                                                 (Dulux or similar
      Alkyd paint).
                     It is our intention to begin testing barriers later
       this month so it is imperative that a price is submitted as
       soon as possible.                           If you have any queries would you please
       contact Mr John Strange at this office.
                                                                                         Yours faithfully,

    Dear Sirs

                Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Limited
                      New Crush Barriers and Handrails

              You will recall that last February we invited you to tender
     for new crush barriers at Hillsborough.                                            For various reasons
    the work scheduled as programme (a) could not be accommodated
    between league                  fixtures and a programme similar to (b) is to be
    adopted.          All the work is now to be done during the closed
    season.
              You will see from the layout drawings that the barrier
    arrangements have been substantially revised.                                                     It has therefore
    been decided to invite tenders a second time from the two lowest
    tenderers, but to include the considerable amounts of handrailing
    now required in the same contract.


              Yours faithfully,

    Dear Mr         England,

                                     Certificate of Safety, Progress Report
                                                      and Revised Cost Estimates


    Further Inspection in Company with Fire Service
              It will be recalled that at the end of the discussions on
    18 April, it was agreed to hold a further meeting with the fire
    officers on the evening of 27 April.                                                 This was to permit the
    emergency lighting to be inspected and also to agree on the
    details of a number of matters to do with means of exit which
    had been requested by the fire officer.                                                     Subsequently this
    meeting was brought forward to Tuesday 24 April.
              We inspected the various escape routes through the south
    stand.        There is a great deal of timber about and the upper
    deck is one large compartment which would easily fill with
    smoke.        However the final agreement is that only the enclosed
    spaces such as bars and offices need to be separated from
    the escape routes by improved fire protection.                                                            Thus no new
    walls are required, and only a part of the timber and glass
    walling has to have its fire resistance improved.
              On one interpretation of the Building Regulations it might
    be argued that ’two hour' fire resistance is required such as in




                                                    R egistered in E ng lan d -   No. 1 1 3 453 1
EASTWOOD & PARTNERS




   say large department stores and office buildings.     The fire officer
   has agreed to 'one hour' resistance.    Further, he has accepted
  our suggestion that this 'one hour' resistance be obtained by
  creating a sandwich with two non-combustible layers placed on the
  two faces of the existing timber partitions, even though this
  too is not in accordance with the Building Regulations.        The glazing
  of these partitions will need to be replaced by Georgian wired
  glass.
          We have not yet had a written confirmation of the agreement
  on these matters, but in my view the fire department have been
  very reasonable and realistic.
          We agreed the location of the proposed new escape door
  through the refreshment bar from the west end of the front of
  the south stand.     At the east end the extra escape route requested
  was to have resulted in the loss of a seat at the end of each of
  the front 6 rows, but our suggestion of an extension outward
  towards Spion Kop was agreed as an alternative.      This can be
  achieved without the loss of usable standing space.      The
  detailed design is now being prepared for your approval.
          Spion Kop was the subject of considerable discussion.
  Increasing the width at the downstream end of the existing south
  corner exit route presents no great difficulty, but our choice
  of the route for the additional exit was objected to as it
  was not close enough to the highest part of the Kop where the
  greatest number of spectators are congregated.     Placing the
  exit route at the highest point obviously adds to the expense
  and in my view is less desirable from the safety viewpoint.
  However, we believe we have found a route which takes advantage
  of some level areas on the way down thus mitigating the extra
  cost.     This location may also fit more easily into a scheme for
  an enlarged Kop. A detailed scheme is therefore being prepared
  for your consideration.
          Our proposals for improvement of the existing rear exit
  route from the Kop were approved and agreement was reached on the
  treatment of the tunnel forming the other exit to give a headroom
  of 7 ft.
EASTWOOD & PARTNERS




          In the north stand I am pleased to say that the earlier
   request that the wire mesh barriers near the police post should
   be removed and replaced by something more substantial was
   dropped.  They can now remain.
        The workshop under the east end of the south stand had not
   been open at previous inspections. It was found to contain
   joinery machinery and wood as well as a few gallons of
   inflammable liquids.    Some improvement of fire resistance to
   windows and doors was requested, which we believe can be achieved
   fairly cheaply, but we await the detailed comments.
          The loss of 126 seats from the North Stand was discussed
   at the meeting on 18 April.     This is very regrettable and in
   my view unnecessary.    However, I am given to understand that
   certain members of the working party had pressed strongly for
   one seat to be lost on eveiy row in each gangway of all three
   stands,    so as to be exactly in accordance with the green ’code’.
   If this or anything like it had been required we would have
   recommended an appeal to the Minister.     Fortunately, means of
   exit are the province of the fire brigade and their more
   moderate view plus perhaps your     and our resistance prevailed.
          You will recall that the West stand exits do not give
   sufficient     units for the stand to be evacuated in 8 minutes^
   and two further 1.1m wide routes had been requested.     We explained
   a method of cantilevering out to form a gangway at the front of
   the stand.    Two such gangways would be formed, one in each of the
   two end bays, and they will discharge into the terraces from
   which the exits are adequate.     The proposals were approved and we
   are preparing drawings and ci>st estimates for your consideration.
          The exits from the west and south west terraces present
    no problems.
         After dark a test was carried out on the emergency lighting.
    The    performance of the batteries was very good considering their
    age (25 years).
         The west stand is well served in the seating areas but has
    inadequate emergency lighting of the exit corridors and staircases.
    There is some borrowed light through the translucent sheets but
EASTWOOD & PARTNERS




   the fire officers clearly thought this inadequate.    We await
   their detailed comments and suggestions.
                                   j.
        The south stand is adequately served by emergency lights.
   Spion Kop could not be judged fairly because some light bulbs
   appeared to be missing.    However, some extra lights are clearly
   going to be called for.    We still await the fire officer's
   requirements, but in the meantime are looking into the cheapest
   way to improve the situation.
        At present the north stand relies for emergency lighting
   on an alternative circuit from Penistone Road served by a
   different sub-station.    Unfortunately, in the event of a total
   power failure this would still leave the stand with no emergency
   lighting.   The fire officers were quite categoric in saying this is
   unacceptable.
        The solution is likely to be expensive.    The present battery
   supply would not carry the extra load and even it it would, most
   of the lights are fluorescent and so will not function on
   direct current.    Thus, an emergency direct current supply would
   necessitate a completely new extra set of emergency lights
   with the attendant cabling.
        It seems to us that at some time in the future you may
   decide to have a sufficiently large generator set to be completely
   independent of the grid, even for your floodlights.    The batteries
   will need to be coaxed along until that time.    The new load which
   is to be put on the emergency system round three sides of the ground
   (West stand, the Kop and North stand) will be of the order of
   50 KW.   We suggest that the best interim solution may be to
   purchase an a.c. generator set which will provide the necessary
   power and which will feed the existing lighting systems thus
   avoiding the need for extensive new cabling and light fittings.


        The Present Position
        It will be recalled that we obtained tenders for work on
   the Kop crush barriers in February.    This was before the request
   for radial barriers,and the proposed extra barriers were not at
EASTWOOD   St   PARTNERS




   that time in continuous rows.       The Building Surveyor's view is
   that the barriers should not be staggered as in our first design
   even though we believe that our proposed arrangements will permit
   easier packing of spectators and hence better distribution.          In
   order to help persuade the working party to agree to a Kop
   capacity of 16,850 - the very maximum which the code would
   allow on this area - we have revised our barrier layout to be
   in line with their preference.
           The radial barriers have been added, the system of handrails
   for the exit from the Kop, and the new barriers on the north west
   terrace are now included.       Tenders have now been invited for
   this comprehensive scheme.       They are due for return on 11 May
   which will enable a start to be made (subject to the Board's
   approval) on 21 May.
           This invitation to tender does not include the strengthening
   of boundary fences and various division barriers within the
   ground.       The Building Surveyor's representatives are being very
   insistent that all these otherfences must be brought up to
   the code standard immediately.       I suggest we wait until we see
   the failure rate (and the actual strength) of these itemSbefore
   deciding on tactics.       The codes does countenance some latitude
   for existing structures and we may well decide to make an issue
   of this matter in appropriate parts,of the ground.
           One matter of which you should be aware is that we are
   ignoring the code in designing the new crush barriers.       The code
   requires a new barrier to be designed for 5 kN/m length with
   a factor of safety of 2 which means a collapse load of not less
   than 10 kN/m.       The test load for existing barriers is 6 kN/m.
   We are aiming to pass the test but are not designing for 10 kN/m.
   This saves about one-third on cost, and is, we believe, legitimate
   for barriers constructed prior to the granting of the first
   certificate.
           Schemes are being prepared for the fire protection in the
   south stand, the buttressing of brickwork ballustrades, treatment
   of spalling concete, and handrailing in stairways, as well as the
   improvement of exits.       All these items will be out to tender in
EASTWOOD b PARTNERS




   the next couple of weeks so that the work can be substantially
   completed by the start of the new season.
        On the electrical side, testing of all the existing
   installation will take place in the next two weeks.    Any work
   which is required will be included in a single contract
   together with the improvements to the emergency lighting which
   we expect will be required by the fire officer.


        Updating of Cost Estimates
        After these recent meetings, we are now in a much better
   position to update the cost estimates, although the exact
   scope of the work is not precisely defined until we have the
   fire officer's report.   It should also be kept in mind that work <
   this kind is so unusual as to produce widely fluctuating tender
   prices, with corresponding difficulty in giving precise estimates
   in advance.
        Our estimate of the cost of the works is now as follows:-


        New crush barriers on Spion Kop,
        west terrace and north-west corner,
        including radial barriers and
        handrailing of exit ramp and steps                £

        improving headroom at north end and
        exit width at south end.                      12,300

        Testing of barriers and any necessary
        retests say                                      3,000

        Work on boundary fences (provisional)            5,000

Dear Mr. England,
     I enclose a copy of the letter sent with the various sets
of drawings to members of the working party.    My office has
also checked with the Building Surveyors Department concerning
the minutes of the meeting held on Wednesday, 11 April, and
has received confirmation that they were in fact received.
The Fire Service believe that they were received but in Mr. Jones'
absence, we cannot yet be certain.    However, our post book
shows that they were posted first class on Friday, 13 April,
together with your copy.


                                     Yours sincerely,

                                                   Dr. W. Eastwood    Eastwood and Partners
                                                   Mr. J. A. Strange      »i    ii    ii
                                                   Mr. A. C. Mortimer

              South Stand

                     The fire-services officer proposed a new exit from the
              front terracing under the stand and through a new 1.2m wide
              door adjacent to the existing snack bar.                                                 Wall surrounding
              this area to have 1 hour fire resistance.                                                 Existing doors
              to be self closing with 1 hour fire resistance.

                     The fire officers requested that all walls enclosing
              offices, lounges, bars and the press box have 1 hours fire
              resistance.                   It was agreed by Building Surveyors representatives
              that the existing construction could be upgraded by forming
              a sandwich using *Supertex* or a similar product.

                     Mr. Jones is to send to Eastwood and Partners a copy
              of South Stand seating plan showing his proposals for removing
              seats to increase the capacity of gangways after dividing
              barriers are removed.

    EASTWOOD & PARTNERS




     4.         Mr. Mills requested that the brick staircase walls be
           buttressed where crowd surge pressure could be generated.
           (At a later inspection the location of these buttresses
           was agreed).     Handrails to be added as was agreed at the
          meeting on 2 April.

     5.         Prior to the meeting the    bases of two stanchions had
           been exposed by removing floor timber.     Rusting is not
           excessive.     All bases will be exposed for inspection.     If
           necessary steel plating will be welded to any corroded parts
           before encasing in concrete for permanent protection.
                In inspecting the two bases,waste paper, and shavings
           of wood together with cigarette ends were found in considerable
           quantities beneath the floor boards.     The club to be advised
           that the space beneath the timber floor should be cleaned out.


          North Stand
     6.        It was agreed to recommend to the club that 10 seats
          would be removed from each of the 9 gangways and 4 seats
           from in front of each of the 9 upper exits.     *The total
          number of seats lost is therefore 126 compared with 225
          in the original proposals.


          Spion Kop
    7.         Eastwoodand Partners to send revised copies of drawing
          number 1610/1X showing the new crush barrier layout including
          two lines of radial barriers to               and Mr. Jones
          for their comments.

    8.         Eastwood's proposals for improving the existing upper
          Exit from Spion Kop agreed in principle as shown     on drawing
          1610/12.      The dividing handrail on the ramp will be taken
          past the whole of the first staircase.                             J
    9.         The Building Surveyors representative asked     that the
          scoreboard structure be surveyed with particular reference
          to stability under wind loading.

       West Stand
            Additional exits to be provided from upper stand on
       the lines discussed at the meeting on 2 April.


       Further Action
             An evening meeting to inspect the emergency lighting
       will be held shortly after Easter.      Mr. Jones will contact
       Eastwood and Partners on returning from leave to arrange
       a date.

                                Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
               Examination and Testing of the Electrical Installation

         The South Yorkshire County Council have indicated that the
 electrical installation must comply with the standards required by
 the Institution of Electrical Engineers for the issue of an Inspection
 Certificate.                      To establish compliance inspection and tests will be
 required as follows


 1.            Visual Examination
                     All equipment and cabling must be examined visually so
               far as is practical.                               This will require removal of access
               panels, but need not involve dismantling or examination of
               cabling which is inaccessible.                                       Such cabling and equipment
               would be assessed on the basis of the electrical tests
               described below.                          The visual examination should reveal no
               evidence of significant physical damage or any likely
               possibility of this occurring.


 2.            Polarity Checks
                     Every appliance or motor and every socket outlet must
               be checked for correct polarity of connections, and every

       single-pole control device or fuse verified to be
       connected in the live conductor only.


  3.   Earth Continuity
             A separate test of every earth-continuity conductor
       is required to establish that the impedance measured
       from each appliance or fitting to the consumers earthing
       point does not exceed the appropriate value.


  4.   Earth Loop Impedance
             To establish that an earth fault will cause a
       sufficiently high current flow to operate fuses or
       circuit-breakers, an "earth-loop impedance” test is
       required for each sub-circuit or fitting.


  5.   Insulation Test
             Each circuit must be tested as part of a group
       containing at least fifty outlets to a voltage not less
       than 500 volts d.c., and the insulation resistance under
       the specified conditions must not be less than one megohm.


  6.   Ring Circuit Continuity
             A check is required to ensure that all the conductors
       of any ring circuits are continuous.     This will normally
       require each conductor of the ring to be ’broken’ and
       reconnected.


  7*   Circuit Loadings
             The highest likely circuit loads must be assessed and
       a check made to ensure that this is within the capacity of
       the appropriate cables and fuses.      The loading may be
       assessed from a knowledge of all the appliances and fittings

         which are likely to be in use together, or if more
         convenient by measurement of currents in each circuit
         during a period of maximum demand.


         The above tests will require a full knowledge of the
   installation and the rating of all equipment and cables.
   Unfortunately, it appears that the Club do not press any
   drawings of the electrical installation.
         We have been in touch with Mr. Bownes of Bownes & Co., who
   has a certain number of relevant drawings in his possession but
   none at all relating to the South Stand installation.   If we are
   not able to locate a sufficiently complete set of drawings it
   will be necessary to do an electrical survey to establish the
   arrangement and ratings of the various circuits and appliances.

        10.2 Beams
        T h e fire resistance o f a reinforced or prestressed concrete beam depends on the a m o u n t o f protective cover,
        consisting o f concrete with o r without an insulating encasement, provided to the reinforcement o r tendons.
        It is also necessary for the beam to have a m inim um width to avoid failure o f the concrete before the
        reinforcement or tendons reach the critical temperature.
           Typical performances are given in Table 54 for reinforced concrete beams and in Table 55 for prestressed
        concrete beams, both for siliceous aggregate concrete and for lightweight aggregate concrete.

        d u e to ultimate loads should be considered in this calculation and when reinforcement is used in combination
        with tendons its equivalent area should be used.
           Tables 54 and 55 give the average concrcte cover required to provide the stated fire resistance but in no
        case should the nominal concrcte cover to any bar o r tendon be less than half this value no r less than the

            In addition, in ccrtain cases when using siliceous aggregate concrctc it will be necessary to consider the
        provision o f supplementary reinforcement to hold the concrete cover in position.

          Mr. England is trying to arrange
          another meeting and the dates he
          has given me are 21, 22, and 28
          March.      I think 21 March is the
          date he would prefer as they have
          a Board meeting on 22 March.
          I said I would ring him back when
          I have had a word with you.

     Dear Sirs,
                                                                   Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
                                                                             New Crush Barriers
                 Further to the discussions during the visit to site with
     Mr. Mortimer today, we write to confirm the following items
     raised either by yourself or by a representative of the other
      contractors preparing tender prices for the work.
      1.         The existing terracing, except                                                    the corner area between the
                 West and North Stands, drawing 1610/2X, is constructed
                 from either precast or insitu concrete step units with an
                 expected average waist depth of 17 5mm.                                                               These units are
                 unlikely to be reinforced.
                 In the corner area between the West and North Stands
                 nine bases will be excavated through insitu concrete
                 terracing with an expected average waist depth of 150mm.
                 This is reinforced with one layer of mesh with a nominal
                 mass of 6.1 lb/yd2.                                             Ten bases in this area will be
                 excavated through mass concrete for the full depth.                                                                 Again
                 a layer of mesh reinforcement is likely to be encountered.
                 All the existing concrete terracing is founded on made




                                                                      Registered in England -   No. 1134531
/                                                                     SHEET



    EASTWOOD £r PARTNERS




            ground comprising a mixture of sandy soil, some ash and
            brick rubble.     In some places it is likely that old
             timber sleepers will be encountered.

       2.   The new bases are to be finished to levels that match the
            existing steps.    The concrete is to be finished with
            a steel trowel and then swept over with a stiff course
            brush.

       3.   The Main Contractor will accept delivery of the posts and
            barriers, transport these to the barrier locations and then
             erect, line and level them before casting into position.

       4.   Please enter the sum of £9,600 against the Prime Cost
             Item for programme A and £9,000 against the Prime Cost
             Item for programme B.

       5.    If programme B is adopted work involving the use of
            machinery will not be allowed between 5-8 July inclusive.

       6.   The work will be phased in programme A as follows
             Phase 1 : Half of west terrace plus any one
                       quarter of the Spion Kop.
            Phase 2 : The other half of the west terrace plus one of
                       the three remaining quarters of the Spion Kop.
             Phase 3 : The south west corner of the terrace plus one of
                       the two remaining quarters of the Spion Kop.
             Phase 4 : The rema-iming quarter of the Spion Kop.

       7.    Please amend the Appendix to read
             Liquidated damages for delay (47)
                       Programme A               £1000/day
                       Programme B                 £100/week

                                                                 New Crush Barriers

          On behalf of our clients, Sheffield Wednesday Football
    Club Limited, we have pleasure in inviting you to tender for
    the supply, fabrication, delivery and site welding of the
    steelwork associated with new crush barriers.

          Drawings and Specification
          Enclosed is a copy of our drawing 1010/14 showing two
    alternative schemes and copies of our drawings 1610/1X and 2X
    showing location of new barriers. One using mild steel the
    other using high yield steel members. A copy of our steelwork
    specification is also enclosed.

                 Two programmes are being considered.
                 (a) The barriers are to be in position and capable of
                 withstanding loads by 31 March 1979. The Main Contractor
                 would begin excavation and preparation work as soon as
                 possible. Work on the barriers would be done in phased
                 selected areas to cause the minimum inconvenience to
                 spectators during league matches.                                       Allow in your tender
                 for doing the site welding on two visits per week.

EASTWOOD & PARTNERS




       (b) The barriers are to be installed during the closed
       season. All the work would be done through June, July
       and part of August 1979. The site welding could then
       be done in one operation towards the end of this period.


       Overtime
       The cost of any overtime working which may be necessary to
 ensure that delivery of the steelwork is made in accordance with
 the chosen programme is to be included in the tender price.


       Attendance
       The Contractor must allow in his price for the general
 attendance of one trade upon another, including all Sub-Contractors
 and for the provision of all plant and equipment.
       The Main Contractor will unload the steelwork at the
 site and carry the members to the position of the barriers.


       Conditions of Contract
       The Conditions of Contract will be the Fifth Edition (1973)
 issued by the Institution of Civil Engineers and Federation of
 Civil Engineering Contractors, with amendments but the variation
 of price (Labour and Materials) clause is NOT included.


       Completion of Tender
       Your tender should be on a fixed price basis and include
 for a 2 \% discount to the Main Contractor. State the price of
 each barrier scheme, drawing 1601/14, for the two programmes.
 This will give four separate prices for the work.
       Your tender is to remain open for acceptance for a period
 of 4 weeks from the date of return. The invitors of this tender
 do not undertake to accept the lowest tender, or any, received.


       Return of Tender
       All tenders must be returned in the envelope provided to
 Eastwood and Partners no later than noon on 9 February, 1979.
       We would be pleased if you would acknowledge receipt of
  this document and confirm whether you intend to submit a tender.

Dear Mr. England,
                     Testing of Crush Barriers
       I thought you would like to have for your records a
copy of the quotation from Toft and Brocklebank Ltd.for
testing the crush barriers.   X asked then to allow for the
extra barriers which are likely to be installed and as you
will see, their estivate is a ainiaua of i      and a aaxiaua
of i
       Their daily charges are considerably aore than we would
charge if we carried out the testing ourselves and we would
also still feel obliged to give soae supervision which would
add to the cost.   X therefore propose that we should do the
work ourselves.

                                   Yours sincerely,

Dear Sirs,

                                           Sheffield Wednesday F.C.

     We thank you for your letter dated 8th January, 1979,
regarding further testing of barriers at the above ground.

     Our basis of charging is a lump sum of £     plus £
per day for'the actual testing. In this case we estimate
that it would not be less than two weeks and not more than
three weeks, i.e. between £      and £         One of the
main factors influencing the time is tine supervision and
checking carried out by the Local Authority and, of course,
we have no control of this.

     We would welcome the opportunity of carrying out this
work for you, but wish to point out that we are fully
committed until the end of March. However, you would
probably prefer to have the testing carried out during the
close season as several other clubs are planning.

     An early decision would be appreciated to enable us to
plan this into our testing programme.




                                                       Yours faithfully,

Dear Mr. England,
       I have pleasure in enclosing seven sets of our drawings
Nos. 1610/1-10 plus a 1-1290 scale plan of the whole ground.
       As you will see, in addition to making our own survey
drawings of Spion Kop and the West terrace, we have surveyed
and aade drawings of the South stand.   We have also made new
drawings of the North stand and West stand since the scale of
those obtained from Husbands would probably not have satisfied
the Local Authority.
       I suggest that one set be sent to each of the South
Yorkshire County Council, the Policf Authority, Fire Brigade
and the City of Sheffield Building Surveyor, leaving three sets
for your own use.
       I am drawing up a modified version of our report for
submission to the Local Authority and will have copies with me
on Friday.   I expect to arrive at the ground about 10 a.i. and
will be accompanied by ay senior services engineer.   I should
be grateful If you could arrange for a representative of the
electrical contractor to be present so that he can help with our
initial inspection of the electrical installation,

Dear Sirs,
                 Testing of Crush Barriers at Sheffield
                          Wednesday F.C.
    In 1973 you carried out loading tests on the crush barriers
at Sheffield Wednesday's ground.    The results were given in
your report dated 20 July, 1973*    The club has not had to
apply for a Certificate of Safety due to its being in the third
Division.    However, it is now contemplating doing so on a
voluntary basis and has engaged this practice to c a r r y out the
necessary design woirk and supervision of remedial work.
    We are at present preparing a cost estimate.     One of the
items will be a test on all the crush barriers at a loading of
6 kN/m. run.    I should be grateful if you could let me have
a budget figure for carrying out the necessary tests and the
provision of a factual report.
    The barriers which you tested in 1973 are all still in
existence, and by the time the tests are carried out they will
have been strengthened to take account of your findings in 1973.
In addition to the original barriers it is anticipated that a
further 450m of barriers will have been installed.        These will
be in varying lengths up to 10m long and the total number of new
barriers ulll be about 75.    Your budget figure should also
take account of ths fact that all barrisrs are likely to have
to bs tested this tine.    You sill recall that on the
previous occasion you only tested one of the barriers of
type e (Get of 14).   Certain others sere not tested because
there was no suitable Jacking point.    You may assume that for
these particular barriers ve shall provide faryou some
appropriate means of achieving a reaction should the local
authority insist on the test being done.
    An early reply would be appreciated.

                                  Yours faithfully,

            Observation at j w l w tonjtidlmi on Saturday,
                             8 January
        I have pleasure in enclosing the three tickets for the
use of yourself, Hr, Jones and Hr. Davies,      unfortunately
there has been m m confusion at Hillsborough and only three
tickets have been sent to me.      They are now trying to let me
have a fourth one very close by.      I shall look out for you
at the ground and possibly I will sit with you and Hr. Jones
if Hr. Davies‘doesn't mind moving to another nearby seat.
        Also enclosed are three tickets for admission to the
reception lounge after the match where I think a c u r of tea
and light refreshments will be available*
        I shall look forward to seeing you there.

    D e a r Sir,


    Safety of Sports Grounds Act. 1975

    I thank you for your letter of 1 st December.

    Following m y letter of 30 th N o v e m b e r and the telephone conversation which
    Mr. D. Vaughan of m y staff had with you today, arrangements are being m a d e for
    the Officer Working Party to be present at the Hillsborough Stadium at 10 .30 a.m.
    on Wednesday next, 13 th December, 1978 , for a preliminary meeting with the
    Club.


    A small w o r d of explanation on the constitution of the Officer Working Party m a y
    be helpful. The County Committee concerned decided that the approach must be
    multi-disciplinary, and accordingly, the Working Party consists of representatives
    of the Police, the Fire Service, the District Council Building Surveyor's
    Department, with co-ordination being undertaken by the County Council's
    Administration Department.

    It m a y also be helpful if the Club were aware in advance of the meeting of the terms
    and conditions contained in the standard form of General Safety Certificate.
    Accordingly, two copies of the draft are attached for your information.


                                                                       Yours faithfully,

                     TESTING OF CRUSH BARRIERS AT SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY F.C.

             A preliminary meeting wa* held at the Club attended by the Secretary
    If L________ , w              of Husband and Co., the Clubs Consulting
    Engineers and Messrs K.H. Toft and R.G. Brocklebank.

         Mr Hayes explained that two years previously his firm had carried out
    a series of tests on the barriers.  Although the design load for the barriers
    was based on the figure of 206lbs per foot for balcony balustrades in the
    British Standard Code of Practice No. 3 Chapter V, it was anticipated that'
    tins figure would be increased following the Ibrox disaster. It was
    therefore decided to use a figure of 3001bs per foot for these tests i.e.
    an overload of some 45 %. It was discovered that certain barriers would
    not withstand this figure of 3001bs per foot and these barriers were
    immediately strengthened.

            ■Hie recommendations in the Wheatley Report regarding the design of
    Sio^t. S m ? * 8 are.that the barriers should be designed to withstand either
    340 or 2301bs per foot run depending on where the barriers are on the
   ground, the slope of the terracing and the horizontal distance between the
   barriers (Page 31 , para 41 .2 ). It has been agreed with the Home Office that
   ooonu flgur®s should be increased for testing existing barriers to 400 and
   2oolbs per foot run respectively, to give an adequate safety margin.
        The two ends of the ground have their own entrances, there being no
   terracing on the sides of the ground. According to the recommendations ui
   the Wheatley Report, all the terracing on the ground is classified as
    peak viewing" and therefore the barriers were tested generally to 4001bb
   per foot run.  The exceptions were- two rows of barriers (numbers 23 to 31
   and 32 to 3»). In the case of these two rows, the spacing between each row
   ol barriers was 5 '8" on terracing with a slope of 1 in 4. This close
   spacing allows a reduction in the test load and therefore these two rows
   were tested at the reduced loading of 288lbs per foot run.

        The barriers are numbered and ve have used these as reference in this
   report.  They are located as follows

                  Spion Kop              -   Penistone Road End       Barriers    1 to 101
                  Lepping Lane End —         Ground Level             Barriers 102 to 130
                        ditto                Suspended Terrace        Barriers 131 to 144

            There are five types of barriers on the ground.

  ■£EP-?- l a ) A horizontal steel rail of- 2§" diameter is supported bv vertical
  posts consisting of 2" x 2" m.s. angle together with a diagonal bracing 01
  the same material in front of the posts.       The bracing is bent horizontally
  at the top of the barrier and joined to the vertical leg by a gusset plate.
  The horizontal rail is fixed by a clamp, bolted to the vertical and
  horizontal angles.      The barriers vary from single to multiple spans.

            8" x 8" concrete posts at 11>0" centres support a horizontal tube
         diame^er* At “‘id span, the tube has an additional support from
  4 x 2   vertical channels welded to the tube and bolted to the terrace   The
  channels in turn are strengthened by 2*" x 2^" angle struts concreted into
  the terracing 18 behind the channel and welded to the channel just below
  the horizontal rail.

            7" x 4 " R.S.J. posts support a 3 " diameter horizontal tube.                      The
  tube is continuous and sleeved through the web of the posts.

  to *      (<D   e» X 4” Vertical R.S.J's support a 44'* 0/S diameter tube.
                                                                  3
                                                                                           Con t d.....
                            Continued.     i




Type (e)   This is a tubular barrier using 2 f" diameter tube throughout.
The vertical posts and horizontal rail are made of continuous tube bent to
a goal post configuration with rounded corners.   The horizontal tube is
strengthened by a raker of the same material welded to the rail 18" from
each end and 18" in front of the barrier at terrace level sloping into the
barrier until it is 6" away at the top. The raker is then bent to make a
horizontal welded connection with the rail.
Taking the areas in numerical or$er:-      *           ;;

Spion Kop.

The majority of barriers on the ground are contained in this area mostly
consisting of type (a). Failure of these barriers when it occurred, was
due to:-
1.   corrosion - usually of the top bracket holding the horizontal rail.
2.   weak foundations, allowing the barrier to be pulled out of the terrace.
3.   too great a span - generally’in excess of 8'0" - allowing the
     horizontal rail to bend excessively under load.
4.   the distance between the raker and vertical post being insufficient at
     terrace level i.e. 12" apart instead of the normal 18" to 24", failure
     in this case occurring from bending of the posts and rakers.
     Particulars of each failure are given in the Appendix.

     As previously mentioned, due to the close proximity of barriers behind,
barriers 32 to 38 were loaded to the equivalent U.D.L. of 288 lbs per foot
run. These are type (b) and have been strengthened previously.     They
withstood the test loads satisfactorily with the exception of barriers 37
and 38 which failed due to each having one span of 1 1 '6". Of the type (c)
barriers (No's. 8 2 , 83 and 84) only one was tested and failed due to weak
foundations. Further testing of this type was not continued to avoid
possible damage.

     The following barriers were not completely tested due to obstructions
or lack of terracing behind, No»s. 1 , 31 , 48 , 62, 73 , 81, 85, 90, 94, 99,
100 and 101.

Leppings Lane End.

At ground level, the barriers consisted, with one exception, of type (a).
Please refer to the Appendix for details of those barriers which were not
strong enough. Barrier 126 was type (d) and withstood the test load.
On the suspended terracing, a tubular barrier, type (e) has been installed
which, unfortunately, was found to be inadequate to take the test load.
Excessive bending started to take place in both the rail and mid post.
Testing was not continued as thef barrier tested was considered to be typical
of those in this section and we wished to avoid any unnecessary damage.
     Barriers 125 and 127 were not completely tested dtie to obstructions or
lack of terracing hehind.

Perimeter Wall.

A section of insitu wall which generally measured 3 '6" high x 4" thick was
tested and found to be satisfactory. However, at one corner of the Spion
Kop there is a small section of perimeter wall made from precast concrete
planks 2" thick and 12" wide, supported by 6n x 5” concrete posts, slotted
to take the concrete planks. Previous experience on other grounds has
shown that this wall can withstand an equivalent U.D.L. of approximately
3001bs per foot run if in good condition.



                                                            «fs   Gontd

Other Points.

Certain parts of the fencing guarding the drop at the back of the Spion
Kop are not very strong and should be strengthened.

The fencing guarding a drop over the exit tunnel at the left corner of the
Spion K6p has terracing hehind and therefore has pressure exerted during a
match.            ^
This fence was tested and started to fail at an equivalent U.D.L. of l 801 bs
per foot run.
Handrailing on some of the exit stairs from terracing and seated areas does
not conform with the report. (Page 23 para 13 .4 ).

Conclusion.

The ground is well^maintained and the failure rate for the barriers is well
below the average for grounds tested so far.
As with many otherjClub’s, the barriers are not spaced according to the
recommendations in -the Wheatley Report. This is particularly noticeable at
the top of the Spion Kop and the suspended terracing at Leppings Lane. In
both areas the terracing has a steep slope of 1 in 2 and due to the space
between barriers an effective distance between them of 18 feet measured at
right angles to the terracing.

     Finally, we would like to thank :         for his co-operation in
carrying out these tests together with]_________ whose knowledge of the
ground and experience with the original testing were of great value.

have taken photo-copies for our own records but X shall be
grateful if yoacould keep the Busband originals in a safe
plaoe as they are slightly better quality than the prists we
have taken and we aay need to copy froa the originals on
future occasions.

Dear Mr. England,
     I was very pleased to have your letter of 1 December
informing us of your Board’s decision with regard to the
obtaining of a Certificate of Safety for the ground.
     It is our intention to commence the survey on Wednesday,
of this week, 6 December, subject to my own availability.
I am due to appear in a Public Inquiry on Humberside
tomorrow and if I am still required to give evidence on
Wednesday, we should need to postpone the start of work
at the ground until the day after.
     We will work within the budget of £500 which I had
previously indicated to you.

                                      Tour8 sincerely,
                                                                Fli-E   (h(0

Dsar Mr. Whithead,
                  Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.
     I havt plcaiurt in returning the prints of drawings
obtained from Husbands.   Even though one or two are still
missing, the great majority of the information we would
need in an application for a Certificate is contained in
the ones we already have.   We should need to hive enlarge­
ments made but this presents no difficulty.
     It would of course still be necessary to survey the
South stand and Spion Cop before an application could be
submitted. However, as we agreed last week, in the first
instance you need only commit yourselves to a limited
amount of expenditure M y not exceeding £900 in order to
get sufficiently far to see whether you have any major
problems, and what the effect would be on your capacity if
any remedial work were carried out.

                                       Tours sincerely.

Dear Mr. England,
     Mr. Whitehead vary kindly lot m have a sight of
tha prints which ha had obtainad from Husband & Co. Evan
though these do not contain all tha information w« would
raqulra thay give sufficient to make the task relatively
easy so far as the North stand and West stand are concerned.
I have now returned the prints to Mr. Whitehead but we have
taken photo-copies to keep on our file.
     If you wish to go so far as making an application for
a Certificate we shall still need to survey the South
stand and Spion Cop.   But as I said in my letter last week,
for an expenditure not exceeding £500 we would be able to
take the survey sufficiently far to let you have a report
on what would be involved (if anything) in bringing the
ground up to standard, and alternatively, what would b« the
likely effect on the ground capacity in any Certificate if
you do not carry out any improvements for the time being.

                                      Tours sincerely,

Dear Mr England

                  Certificate of Safety
        I enclose a list of drawings which are likely to
give the information we need concerning the North Stand,
the Vest Stand and the North Vest Terrace and Stand* I m m
sending a copy direct to Mr Vhitehead so that he can wake
his enquiries of Mr English,
        Since Friday I have given s o u thought to the overall
situation and 1 think that you should proceed a step at a
time so mi to reduce any unnecessary expenditure to a minimum.
        I aa confident that in considering the granting of a
Certificate the Local Authority is unlikely to raise any
difficulties with regard to the North Stand and the Vest Stand
You may be vulnerable so far as splon cop is concerned since
there may be a significant reduction in the number of
spectators permitted, unless there is an increase in the
number of    barriers or possibly some strengthening. The
South Stand may also be questioned with regard to its fire
resistance and the consequent M e d for speedier evacuation of
spectators.
        As a first step, 1 suggest you commission an outline
survey of the standing accommodation plus the South Stand,
which should only be taken sufficiently far as to give you an
idea of the possible loss of spectator capacity if no remedial
work is carried out, and also to give you an idea of the
possible cost of remedial work if the present capacity is to
be maintained.
      Should you decide that it is appropriate to commission a
first stage survey and report on these lines, I would suggest
that an expenditure limit of say £500 should he imposed on
whoever you employ to carry out the work.
      X aa sure that if there is any aspect of the matter
which you would like to discuss you will not hesitate to give
me a ring.
      Yours slnetarely,

                 Roy Whitehead made an approach to m e asking what drawings we had
                 relating to Sheffield Wednesday.

                 We have now made a check through all our m icro film s of drawings
                 and the enclosed is a com plete list.

                 I believe M r. Whitehead sought a general ground plan, but if one
                 ex ists, we w ere n ever com m issioned to draw it. We have of course
                 plans relating to sections of the ground e .g . north stand, but whenever
                 E r i c T aylor re f e r r e d to an o v erall layout 1 believe it was a special
                 plan related to rating purposes.

                 Dear Dr. Eastwood,

                 SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

                 I have pleasure in confirming telephone conversation with
                 your Secretary this morning, making an appointment for you
                 to meet my Chairman, Mr. H.E. McGee at Hillsborough on
                 Friday, 3rd November 1978 at 11.30 a.m.

                 I do not know if you are conversant with the layout at
                 Hillsborough, but if it could be of any assistance to
                 you and you would like to have a look around the ground,
                 I should only be too pleased to show you around the
                 stadium prior to the meeting.

                 Perhaps your Secretary could ring me if you wish to
                 come to the ground a little before 11.30 a.m.

                 Yours sincerely,




                 Secretary.

Tuesday, 30th September, 1997                                                                         Index Page 21
 1   LORD JUSTICE      STUART-SMITH: I have obviously read your
 2        submissions for which          I thank you very much.     I am not
 3        sure that I have necessarily read all the appendices so
 4        far, because I was working on the one that you
 5        originally sent.       I have read everything in this bundle.
 6        What I would like to do, unless there is some other way
 7        in which you would want to do it, is to go through your
 8        written submissions and ask you some questions about
 9        them.     I have a shorthand writer here, largely for my
10        own convenience so that I do not have to take notes the
11        whole time.     Then there may be things that we will want
12        to pursue and on which I will want you to give me
13        further points in due course.
14                Do you think that that is a convenient way in which
15        to do it?
16   MR JONES:     Certainly,   it is.
17   LORD JUSTICE      STUART-SMITH: The first point about which
18        I would like your help is that in paragraph 2 you accept
19        that it is impracticable and maybe undesirable for a
20        fresh inquest to be convened.          What I am a little
21        concerned about is how that ties in with section 13 of
22        the Coroner's Act.       Section 13.1 lays down the
23        conditions under which section 13.2 applies.            "This
24        section applies, where on an application by or under the
25        authority of the Attorney-General, the High Court is
26        satisfied with respect to the respective coroner,
27        either" - and then we need not bother with 1(a) - "an
28        inquest has been held by him that whether by reason of
29        fraud, rejection of evidence, irregularity of
30        proceedings, insufficient inquiry" - and this is the
31        relative one - "the discovery of new facts or evidence,
32        it is necessary or desirable in the interests of justice
33        that another inquest should be held."          Then the
34        jurisdiction of the High Court arises to order a new
35        inquest and to quash the inquisition.
36                As I see it, the power to quash the inquisition or
37       to quash the verdict only arises if paragraph 13.1(b) is
38        satisfied, but how does that fit in with your acceptance
39       that it is impracticable and maybe undesirable to have a


                                           2
 1        fresh inquest?
 2   MR JONES:    I think that what we would be asking for is
 3        both encouragement of the Attorney-General to exercise
 4        his fiat, but also for leave to apply for judicial
 5        review, because, on a leave to apply for judicial
 6        review, the two matters go forward together.
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    I quite see that you might
 8        be able to apply for judicial review, but at the moment
 9        I am concerned about this section of the Coroner's Act.
10        If you accept that it is really not on to have a fresh
11        inquest, with which, if I may say so, I entirely agree,
12        then it does not seem to me that the Attorney-General's
13        jurisdiction under 13.1 applies.    Do you accept that?
14   MR JONES:    I take your point, yes, but I think that what
15        we wanted to do is to present the' options, and those are
16        the two options by which the matter does come before the
17        High Court. But, bearing in mind the concession you
18        make, judicial review,   I accept is the more appropriate
19        remedy.
20   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    It looks like the only remedy,
21        does it not, so far as the inquest is concerned?
22   MR JONES:    I think that that is probably correct.
23   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    If you have second thoughts
24        about that, no doubt you will come back to me.
25   MR JONES:   Of course.   Obviously, as you know, there are
26        many cases in which the Divisional Court has quashed the
27        inquisition, but, nonetheless, not ordered a fresh
28        inquest.
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    That is under judicial review.
30   MR JONES:   Exactly.
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    I appreciate that.
32               It is only a minor point, but in paragraph 4 you
33        talk about the advantages of the Divisional Court.      In
34        practice, the Divisional Court very seldom hears oral
35        evidence.
36   MR JONES:   It does, however, have the power to do so.
37   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    Yes, but I do not think that
38        I have ever encountered a Divisional Court case where
39        there has been oral evidence.    Have you?


                                     3
 1   MR JONES:    I have, but I have to accept that it was on
 2        a very limited matter.
 3   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    It may be cross-examination
 4        on an affidavit.
 5   MR JONES:   Yes.
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    Is that what you had in mind?
 7   MR JONES:   Yes, it is.   I would imagine that, if the matter
 8        were referred back to the Divisional Court, then the
 9        Divisional Court does have, obviously, the power, if it
10        chooses, to order cross-examination upon affidavits. We
11        assume that there are, obviously, going to be formidable
12        conflicts of evidence here, especially in relation to
13        the video evidence, and there may be in respect of some
14        of the medical evidence, and the court, therefore, would
15        be in a position to control the procedure by deciding
16        whether to have oral evidence or how much.
17               If there were some other type of judicial inquiry,
18        which could hear a limited amount of oral evidence while
19        accepting affidavit evidence over the background to the
20        matter, then I think that that would serve the interests
21        of the families.
22   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    What do you have in mind?
23   MR JONES:   I do not know. The only type of which I am aware
24        is a Divisional Court type of hearing.    It seemed to us
25        that what you, Lord Justice, would wish to avoid and the
26        families would also wish to avoid, is some type of
27        first-instance inquiry of the kind which Lord Justice
28        Taylor conducted, where there were 170 witnesses in six
29        weeks, or of the type of inquest procedure where you are
30        hearing primary evidence which nobody wants, it is time
31        consuming, people have died, memories have lapsed and so
32        on. What is somehow needed in our submission is the
33        acceptance by some legal route or other of
34        uncontroversial background evidence of which, of course,
35       there is a huge amount which can be summarised and so
36       on, and much of which is found in the Divisional Court
37        judgment in 1993 and in Lord Justice Taylor's own
38        inquiry, but what we have on top of that accepted body
39       of fact are these hugely controversial areas which have


                                     4
 1        to be looked a t .
 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     We will come to that in a
 3        moment.     I am not quite clear so far as a judicial
 4        inquiry is concerned. Obviously, it would be disastrous
 5        to re-open the whole thing.
 6   MR JONES:   Absolutely.
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     You would have other
 8        controversial issues reopened, and we all know that
 9        there are controversial issues still in other areas, and
10        the last thing that anybody would want, I should have
11        thought, was for those to be reopened.      So what you have
12        in mind is some very limited form of judicial inquiry
13        other than a Divisional Court one, do you?
14   MR JONES:     If it were possible.   Among the members of
15        the Group,    I think one of the greatest sources of
16        grievance and even rancour is the existence of the
17        verdicts of accidental death, which the families feel
18        were procured by insufficiencies of the inquiry and,
19        indeed, fraud.
20               One of the reasons why we proposed judicial review
21        was that the court does have power to strike down
22        verdicts without then recommending or ordering any
23        further inquest or first-instance type of inquiry. It
24        seemed to us that that could only really be done by a
25        judicial review type of inquiry. We do not know of any
26        other form of legal mechanism by which we can have a
27        public inquiry of that kind, which can strike down the
28        verdicts of accidental death on the basis that they were
29        procured by faults which we attempt to summarise in this
30        paper, unless it be that type of application to the High
31        Court.
32   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     But there is no point in
33        striking down a verdict of accidental death unless there
34        is a real possibility of substituting a verdict of
35        unlawful killing.
36   MR JONES:   The High Court has in the past, I know,
37        quashed verdicts.     It did so in a case in which I was
38        concerned called Linane, which went to the High Court on
39        two occasions.


                                      5
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     What is the reference to that?
 2   MR JONES:    I do not have it offhand, perhaps we could
 3        send a note to you.     The court held, I am sure that it
 4        was Lord Justice Farquharson, who gave the principal
 5        judgment - I am talking from recollection of about eight
 6        years ago and I know there were precedents - ordered
 7        that the verdict be struck down, but declined in the
 8        exercise of its discretion to order a fresh inquest on
 9        the basis that time had passed.
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     So you have no verdict?
11   MR JONES:    No, you have no verdict.
12   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     How is that going to help
13        you?
14   MR JONES:    First of all, in two ways. What we would wish
15        is for the Divisional Court to examine these facts - if
16        necessary, decide between evidence - and assert that
17        there have been the faults of which we complain in the
18        course of the inquest verdicts and to strike down the
19        verdicts.     That would, many members of the Group feel,
20        be a great source of comfort to them, because what they
21        want above all is a public acknowledgment of things that
22        went wrong - of the insufficiency of inquiry at the
23        inquest - even if they accept that after all this time
24        it is very difficult, indeed impossible, to get at the
25        facts concerning their individual relative's death.
26   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    But the verdict of accidental
27        death does not imply lack of fault on the part of the
28        police or, indeed, other people concerned.
29   MR JONES:    We argue that it does.
30   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    Well, that is not right.
31   MR JONES:    That has been the public presentation. That is
32        the public perception of a verdict of accidental death.
33   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    But plainly not right, if I
34        may say so.    The coroner was clearly right, was he not,
35        when he said that a verdict of accidental death did not
36        absolve the police or, indeed, anybody else from
37        culpability.    The police have admitted liability and I
38        think to some extent the Club has as well, I am not
39        sure.


                                      6
 1   MR JONES:   I think that this probably calls into question
 2        what went on at the inquest overall.      If accidental
 3        death really says nothing other than that "we do not
 4        find in any one individual manslaughter", then something
 5        like 120 days have been spent by the families listening
 6        to evidence which, as it now turns out, we argue was
 7        false, incorrect and in some respects deliberately
 8        misleading.
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      We will come to that in
10        a moment, but what is troubling me at the moment is
11        that, assuming for the moment that the coroner was
12        correct - and I think that the Divisional Court says
13        that he was - in saying that a verdict of accidental
14        death does not mean that nobody is to blame and, bearing
15        in mind that the police have admitted liability - I do
16        not know what the compromised arrangements were, but I
17        am looking into that - then it is quite plain that the
18        police, and maybe others, have admitted liability and
19        negligence.
20   MR JONES:   Yes.
21   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      There is nothing inconsistent
22        between a verdict of accidental death and culpability.
23        This happens every day of the week.      In road accidents,
24        there is a verdict of accidental death, the driver is
25        prosecuted for careless driving or dangerous driving or
26        whatever,     and the insurance company admits liability.
27        There is nothing inconsistent between those two
28        verdicts.
29   MR JONES:   There may not be anything legally inconsistent,
30        but the public presentation, Lord Justice, is that after
31        90 days the whole focus and the purpose of the inquest
32        from the families' point of view and, indeed, the
33        public's and the presentation of the police, we argue,
34        was that, was this a question (as we say the South
35        Yorkshire authorities presented to the jury) where there
36        may have been some faults or there may have been some
37        errors of judgment or there may, on the other hand, have
38        been huge problems caused by drunken crowds, supporters
          who caused enormous problems for the police, in which


                                       7
 1        case, if that is the general reflection of the state of
 2        the evidence, accidental death, or, on the other hand,
 3        was it a question of where serious criminal neglect was
 4        instanced by at least one member of the police causing
 5        death?
 6               There was by the end of the inquest an enormous
 7        gulf between the attitude of the Family Support Group,
 8        on the one hand, and the South Yorkshire authorities, on
 9        the other, and the way in which the jury had to decide
10        that issue or to try to reconcile that was to say
11        "accidental death", which was publicly regarded and
12        presented as being a vindication of the South Yorkshire
13        Police and, we would argue, an undermining of the Taylor
14        inquiry or, on the other hand, unlawful killing, if
15        there was a recognition of serious faults causing death.
16        That is the public presentation and the public
17        perception.
18   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       You say that. This is one of
19        the problems that I have on this, because Lord Justice
20        Taylor made it perfectly plain to the families in
21        criticising the police as the main cause of the disaster
22        and the admission of liability by the police seems to
23        confirm that.     The problem, as you know, with a verdict
24        of unlawful killing is that, although it is not allowed
25        to identify an individual person, in effect, you have
26        got to isolate it to the responsibility of a particular
27        person.
28   MR JONES:     Or at least one.
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Yes, at least one. That makes
30        it, actually, much more difficult, particularly in a
31        case where there is clearly a number of causes operating
32        and so on.     At any rate, I think that I see the way in
33        which you put it.
34   MR HICKS:     On the liability point, we do not think that they
35        have admitted liability.
36   MR JONES:   We do not believe that they have ever accepted
37        liability. They have made payments, but they have made
38        payments without acknowledging liability. That is our
39        understanding of the position.


                                        8
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     But they have settled all the
 2        cases   on a full liability basis.
 3   MR JONES:    They have settled them, but without
 4        admission of liability.
 5   MR HICKS:    They have not dealt with them all either yet.
 6        There   are still some outstanding.
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     But has there been an issue,
 8        except as between possible defendants, on liability?
 9   MR JONES:     I do not believe that any cases have been
10        contested, but they have been settled on the basis that
11        the police have not accepted liability.
12   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     What about            There
13        was never any contest on liability there.
14   MR JONES:    As I understand the position, the police
15        have settled the claims, they have not contested in
16        court liability, but they have settled them outside
17        court without admitting liability.
18   MR HAMMOND: All parties met behind closed doors in
19        Manchester and, when they came out, on what they had
20        apportioned blame to, they would not say whether it was
21        50 per cent the police, 25 per cent Eastwood,      15 per
22        cent to Sheffield Wednesday or whatever. They went
23        behind closed doors and came out with a figure and said,
24        "Yes, we have accepted liability between us"
25   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I shall have to look into this,
26        but my understanding is that the claims were all settled
27        on a full liability basis as between the police and the
28        claimants, but that there were third-party proceedings,
29        I think, between the police, the Club, Eastwood and,
30        possibly, the City Council.      I am not sure who the
31        parties to that were.
32   MR HICKS:    It is those four, sir.
33   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Those third-party proceedings
34        went to trial and, after three days, the case was
35        settled. The case was settled on a basis that was not
36        disclosed publicly.     Is that your understanding?
37   MR HICKS:    My understanding of it is that they
38        were mainly insured by the Municipal and Mutual, as was,
39        now the Zurich, and, effectively, the four defendants


                                      9
 1        would all have ended up coming back to the same cash tin
 2        at the end of the day.       We think that that is why South
 3        Yorkshire Police, if you like, accepted they would stand
 4        in the shoes - or the Police Authority I should
 5        s a y -----
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     You may be right, Mr Hicks,
 7        but I rather doubt that the same insurance company was
 8        insuring all four.    It would not be likely, would it?
 9   MR HICKS:    I think that it is. Certainly, three out of the
10        four.
11   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Perhaps we can find out.    I
12        have asked to be told about this settlement.       Unless
13        there is anything more that you want to say on that, we
14        will move on.
15   MR JONES:    No. We will look into the point ourselves as
16        well, if we may.
17   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Can we turn on then to
18        what is really your first main point?
19   MR JONES:    I wonder if I might just make this
20        additional observation.       I do not know whether you,
21        yourself, or the Home Office or any other party might
22        have suggested any other type of form of inquiry that
23        there might be.
24   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I have not suggested anything
25        at all.
26   MR JONES:    I simply wondered whether it had come up
27        in discussion.
28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I am restricted by my terms
29        of reference, obviously, but, if there is some limited
30        form of inquiry that you think would be beneficial which
31        is not an application to the Divisional Court, then,
32        perhaps, you could give it some further thought.          I am
33        not going to recommend to the Home Secretary that he has
34        a judicial inquiry into this without good reason,
35        obviously, because I do not want for a moment the whole
36        thing to be reopened.
37   MR JONES:    I understand that.
38   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     If it can be some limited
39        procedure other than going to the Divisional


                                        10
 1        Court ----     I think that the problem is that it is a
 2        question of jurisdiction.
 3   MR JONES:     Obviously, what is unsatisfactory is this.
 4        For the sake of argument, if evidence has been
 5        suppressed,    if there has been insufficiency of inquiry
 6        and if evidence has been hidden, and it takes a period
 7        of seven or eight years for that evidence to come to
 8        light to the families,       it does seem, in our submission,
 9        highly unsatisfactory that, because the recognition that
10        the passage of eight years makes a complete fresh
11        inquest undesirable,       for that reason there should not be
12        a formal judicial inquiry under existing machinery which
13        can actually examine the effect of the new evidence upon
14        the original verdict.
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        If you are going to make
16        a submission on that basis,        I would be grateful if you
17        would trace the statutory framework on which it can be
18        done.     At the moment,    I do not think that that is really
19        quite what I have in mind.         I can see the argument about
20        the application to the Divisional Court, but I am not
21        sure quite that one can have, as it were, a limited
22        judicial inquiry.
23                If you think that there is a statutory route to
24        that, perhaps you would let me know.
25   MR JONES:     I do not want to be presumptuous, but
26        do you have something in mind, so to speak, on a
27        provisional basis?
28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       No, I do not think that I have.
29        I suppose that I could advise the Home Secretary to
30        reopen the judicial inquiry, Lord Justice Taylor's
31        inquiry,    in certain respects.     I suppose that that would
32        be possible.     I think that that might be possible.
33        Certainly, that seems to be part of the terms of
34        reference.
35                Can we move on then to the video evidence, which is
36        the sort of first plank?
37                In paragraph 12 of your submissions you say of Lord
38        Justice Taylor,    "He says that the decision should have
39        been accompanied by measures to divert the fans away


                                        11
 1        from the tunnel into pens three and four, which he found
 2        were over full by 2.50.      (Paragraph 184)   Although he
 3        accepted the police evidence that they were unable to
 4        see the terraces because of a faulty camera, he found
 5        that it was foreseeable that opening the gate would
 6        cause injuries in the pens".
 7               I know that he accepted that the police did not
 8        appreciate that the pens were full, but I have not
 9        picked up anywhere that the police were unable to see
10        the terraces and still less that they were unable to see
11        the terraces because of a faulty camera.       Do you follow?
12   MR JONES:   Yes.
13   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      It seems to me to be crucial
14        to your submissions, this particular sentence, that "the
15        police were unable to see the terraces, because of a
16        faulty camera".      "Because of a faulty camera": this is
17        the theme that underlies the whole of this submission,
18        as I understand it.
19   MR JONES:   Yes. The submission would have the same force
20        if the conclusion was from the evidence on this point
21        that they had a very bad view or a very poor view or an
22        inadequate view of the terraces.
23   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Perhaps, we will come to that
24        in a moment, but at the moment your submission seems to
25        me to be based on the fact that the police excuse for
26        not realising what was plain to be seen was because of
27        the faulty camera number 5.
28   MR JONES:   It is a mixture of the faulty camera number 5
29        and what they are saying about their field of vision
30        from the control box. The problem is that at neither the
31        inquest nor at Lord Justice Taylor's inquiry, it seems
32        to us, did anybody really focus on the question of the
33        cameras nor of the view, because everybody was
34        concentrating on the Leppings Lane part of the problem;
35        in other words, the view visible on the video tape of
36        the enormous build up outside the Leppings Lane
37        terraces.     It seems that, because of that concentration
38        upon the state of play outside the gates, outside the
39        turnstiles, nobody has actually focused upon the


                                      12
 1        question or persisted in the question, what could you
 2        see either with a naked eye or upon the cameras, because
 3        that simply was not the focus.
 4   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         That is the difficulty that I
 5        find with this whole submission.         It is right that I
 6        should put it to you so that you can deal with it.            I
 7        have not read much of the inquest evidence yet other
 8        than what you have put before me, and I may have to look
 9        at some of that, but I have read nearly all the evidence
10        before Lord Justice Taylor and, of course, I have read
11        his findings.     If we look at paragraph 49 of his
12        findings,     "The nerve centre for the police control is
13        the control room, a box situated in the south-west
14        corner of the ground between the south stand and pen one
15        and the west terracing. The box is elevated and reached
16        by a number of steps. It has windows commanding views of
17        the pitch and straight along the line of the west
18        perimeter fence. The box is very small and has seats for
19        only three officers.      Superintendent Murray was in
20        control    ...11 and so on.
21               Then the next paragraph,      "Five television screens
22        show views of five roving cameras fixed at high points
23        on the stands and directed both inside and outside the
24        ground. There is also a master screen that flipped in
25        rotation from one camera view to another and which made
26        the video recording. The cameras have a zoom facility to
27        close in on any point of interest, specifically there
28        were good camera views of the west terracing of the
29        Leppings Lane turnstiles and beyond them of Leppings
30        Lane itself".
31               That seems to me to be a specific finding that
32        there were good camera views of the west terracing.
33   MR JONES:   Yes.
34   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         That is a pretty important
35        finding,    is it not?
36   MR JONES:    It is, and Chief Inspector McRobbie, for example,
37        is one of those who gave that evidence and he was not
38        called at the inquest.
39   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Let us go on to paragraph 170,


                                         13
 1        about two thirds of the way down that paragraph,       "There
 2        were good views from the control box and the television
 3        screens there. There were officers on the perimeter
 4        track ..."     Perhaps,   I should go back a little bit
 5        further, because this is a question of seeing how full
 6        the pens were.     That is what he is talking about there.
 7   MR JONES:  Yes.
 8   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       "There were good views from
 9        the control box and the television screens there."          That
10        is a specific finding of fact, that there was a good
11        view through the window and from the television screens
12        visible there.
13   MR JONES:    Yes.
14   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      That is your case, is it not?
15        Well, it is not your case.        Your case appears now to be
16        that the police were saying that the only reason why
17        they did not notice things was because this camera was
18        down.
19   MR JONES:    If you look at the evidence given to the
20        inquest, you will find that all the officers concerned
21        are saying - I would like, if I can to go to all these
22        examples - is that the camera picture was faulty, you
23        could not get a good view, because of where they were
24        sitting, because the angles are rather poor, and the
25        effect of both evidence about the video and of their own
26        observation is that "our view was poor", and the
27        coroner, as we set out in the extracts, describes this
28        as "the heart of the problem".
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I read that.   Can I just take
30        you to one further of Lord Justice Taylor's findings?
31        It is paragraph 244.      It is observation from the control
32        room.    "Stream from Gate C flowed through the tunnel.
33        The officers in the control room would be expected to
34        keep a close watch on pens three and four. They had a
35       direct view of them from the elevated position through
36       their window. Although they had no field glasses, there
37       was a zoom facility on the TV camera. The radio was then
38       working again" and so on and so forth.        Then he says,
39        "None of this was seen or recognised in the control


                                       14
 1        room". What he is saying, as I understand it, is, well,
 2        there it was, they could see it, what they did not do
 3        was to put two and two together. They had not
 4        appreciated that the pens were full to bursting, so to
 5        speak, and they had not appreciated that by opening the
 6        gates and letting a whole lot more people in, they were
 7        all going to go down the tunnel.     He says, in terms,
 8        that they jolly well should have done. That is the gist
 9        of his findings, really, and I think that that would be
10        the gist of an admission of negligence or a finding of
11        negligence against the police in their civil suit.
12   MR JONES:   Yes, I completely accept what you say and I
13        accept that that sentence by itself is misleading.        I
14        think that we have taken that from an observation - or
15        certainly Mr Collins made - that Lord Justice Taylor
16        made in questioning one of the witness.     But the basis
17        you have put to me is, certainly, we say, a reflection
18        of the proper position.     We say that the camera has been
19        shown by Houldsworth now, quite contrary to what the
20        police officers told the jury, particularly Police
21        Constable Bichard, to be working properly and adequately
22        and it is shown to be able to focus, to zoom, to pan and
23        to tilt at the relevant times and not to be affected by
24        flare. What our argument is is that the presentation to
25        the inquest by the police was an attempt to reverse in
26        de facto the findings of Lord Justice Taylor’s inquiry.
27        The evidence put forward by the police officers to the
28        coroner's jury, in fact, is wrong.    It denies what Lord
29        Justice Taylor finds as a fault.     It tries to excuse by
30        saying that the camera equipment was faulty, when Roger
31        Houldsworth's evidence now demonstrably proves that it
32        was not faulty.
33   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     But you do not need Roger
34        Houldsworth's evidence.     Here it is in black and white
35        in Lord Justice Taylor's findings.
36   MR JONES:   But not to the jury. That is our point. The
37        jury was given a completely different view by virtue of
38        the evidence of Police Constable Bichard and his
39        colleagues.


                                     15
 1   MR HICKS:     He refused to take Taylor.
 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        That is a slightly different
 3        point.     As I understand it, he said,    "I have got to re­
 4        examine the questions which Lord Justice Taylor
 5        considered".
 6               We will have to look at this because, as I say, I
 7        have     not read any of the inquest evidence other than
 8        what     you have put before me.    I would like you to
 9        identify     and make good the statements that it was the
10        police officers in the control box - that is
11        particularly Murray and Duckenfield, who were the two
12        people mainly concerned - who were saying that they
13        could not see what was happening on the terraces because
14        of the faulty camera.        I have not picked that up and it
15        seems to me to be quite contrary to what they were
16        saying to Lord Justice Taylor.
17   MR JONES:     It is. There was a very significant difference
18        of emphasis between what the officers who gave evidence
19        at both inquiries said to Lord Justice Taylor and to the
20        inquest and, specifically, there are questions as to
21        why, for example, McRobbie, who gave evidence that the
22        view was good, was not called at the inquest, but had
23        been called by Lord Justice Taylor.        Probably, the best
24        thing would be for us to provide to you extracts of the
25        relevant evidence from the coroner's inquest.
26   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I imagine that you have
27        identified some already.
28   MR JONES:     Yes, but not all.
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        What troubles me is - and it
30        may be that I am still in a preliminary stage of this
31        inquiry - that I have been through the evidence before
32        Lord Justice Taylor with some care and there are a great
33        many citations from that evidence where I think - I am
34        not sure that I have got one from Murray, but everybody
35        else says that they had a good view through the windows
36        of the control box.
37   MR JONES:     Yes, that is, however, not what the effect of
38        the evidence is at the inquest.
39   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Then that is what I want to be


                                        16
 1        shown.     Can I just ask you about this?     You were not at
 2        the inquest, but Mr Hicks was and, I imagine, Mr Hammond
 3        was, too.     I have the impression that the jury went to
 4        the ground, did they?
 5   MR HAMMOND:     Yes.
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Did they go into the police
 7        control box?
 8   MR HICKS:     Yes, and were,   indeed, shown around by
 9        Houldsworth. Houldsworth was in attendance.         Forgive me
10        if I am speaking out of turn, I am not quite sure how
11        these proceedings are carried out ----
12   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      No.    I am only addressing Mr
13        Jones, principally, because I am going through his
14        submissions.      I understand that you are both members of
15        the Support Group.
16   MR HICKS:     Yes, I am the chairman and Phil is the vice-
17        chairman .
18   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       So I rather assumed that you
19        had approved the submissions and these were the
20        submissions that you want to advance.
21   MR HICKS:     With respect to you, sir, we are also trying
22        not to confuse you either, because, obviously, we have
23        lived with this for many years, you have had it only for
24        a couple of mont hs.      I hope that I am not speaking out
25        of turn.     I do not think that we have an issue with what
26        Taylor says.      In fact, we agree with Taylor. This is
27        reinforcing your impression. Taylor's finding, if you
28        like, of finding the police predominantly culpable is
29        accepting the fact that they could see - they should be
30        able to see both visually and aided by CCTV. We accept
31        that. That is, again, part of our submission. We would
32        agree with everything that you are saying in the sense
33        that Taylor does not say - I mean, that is the reason
34       why he found the police particularly responsible for
35        lack of control.     The point that Alun is bringing up
36       now, I think,      is that, when you move on into the inquest
37        sequence, which do not forget followed Taylor, that was
38       then tried to be rewritten. That is one of our major
39        issues.     I would go so far as to say that "porkies" were


                                       17
 1        even told under oath at the inquest to try to support
 2        the view and, effectively, to trash Taylor in respect of
 3        that.
 4   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    But I think that the only
 5        point that I am making, and, perhaps,     I am not making it
 6        very well at the moment,     is that it seems to me to be
 7        abundantly clear from all the evidence that was given at
 8        the Taylor inquiry that the police had a good view from
 9        the control box and, indeed, anybody who went there
10        could see so.    I do not know whether you have been to
11        Hillsborough?
12   MR JONES:    I have not myself.
13   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    I went last week.    Of course,
14        it is quite different now and the police control box has
15        been moved, but it is perfectly clear what sort of
16        vision that they would have got.      You can see it from
17        the photographs.     I find it very difficult that anybody
18        could really have thought that there was not a good view
19        out of the window.
20   MR JONES:    The jury asked a question about why there were
21        incomplete videos.
22   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    They asked about the videos,
23        yes.
24   MR JONES:    They asked about them in two questions. This
25        is paragraph 51 of our submissions.      They mentioned the
26        video evidence of the terraces twice.      In asking about
27        the video evidence of the terraces, they had been
28        wishing to test the oral evidence that the police had
29        given them about it or to see whether the video evidence
30        by the zoom facility showed much more evident distress
31        than the police said that they were able to see from
32        their view in the control box.     What the video shows
33        that Mr Hicks has now obtained from Yorkshire Television
34        this year is that at twenty-past-two, you can actually
35        see the zooming in on to a group of four or five people,
36        with a young man behaving in a slightly lively way,
37        smoking, as though the police were saying,     "Well, let us
38        just have a look and see what they are doing".       That
39        zoom facility was available and, according to Roger


                                       18
     1        Houldsworth's evidence, not showing any flare at all
 2            upon the relevant television screen and, therefore,          it
 3            is to be assumed that the five police officers in the
 4            control room, as well as studying the Leppings Lane
 5            Terraces, are looking at the other five pictures showing
 6            different parts of the ground and are able to just zoom
 7            in at the push of a button. That, we suggest,       is the
 8            significance of the jury's question,       "Let us have a look
 9            at the video". There are two videos and five cameras, so
10            that you can at any one time record what two of the five
11            cameras are showing, so it would be the easiest thing
12            for one of the five policemen whoever is patrolling the
13            video just to zoom in and have a look at the position in
14            the crowd, as they had been doing at twenty-past-two.
15            The jury were shown a video which is of very poor
16            quality indeed and asked twice questions about the video
17            evidence of the terraces, and they are shown that it was
18            working in a faulty way.        It is no better than what you
19            have seen already. We know from Houldsworth and from the
20            video in the possession of Yorkshire Television that the
21            facility which enabled the police to get close-up views
22            just at the push of a switch button was, in fact,
23            working closely.
24       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:   That is what Lord Justice Taylor
25            found.
26       MR JONES:   He found that, but the jury were misled.
27       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:   We will look at the evidence of
28            Mr Bichard, and it is mainly Bichard's evidence, is it
29            not?
30       MR JONES:   Well, it is Bichard and Goddard, yes.
31       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:   I find it a little surprising
32            that he was not cross-examined about this.
33       MR JONES:   That is another issue.      If I could try to
34            explain the background and we have not reflected this in
35            the submissions, because I did not regard it as our
36            function here to start discussing the conduct of the
37            barristers at the inquest, but it has to be appreciated
38            that there were a total of nine lawyers or groups of
39            lawyers representing the South Yorkshire authorities.


                                         19
 1        Each of the four senior officers had his own lawyer. The
 2        South Yorkshire Police had their own lawyer. The
 3        Ambulance Service, the football club, the council. The
 4        families had Mr Hytner QC at an early stage in the
 5        preliminary inquest for one or two days, but Tom King,
 6        then a junior (he took silk right at the end of the
 7        inquest) was acting for well over 45 of the families,
 8        together with Mr Frazer, the solicitor.     The two of
 9        them, we argue, and as you can see, appeared to be
10        struggling against formidable problems to represent the
11        interests of 40 families. There were supposed to be 95
12        individual inquests going on.    They were also seeking,
13        as best they could, to represent the interests of other
14        people who had not formally instructed them who were
15        members of the Group.
16               The fact of the matter is that in their cross-
17        examinations they did not say,   "You said something
18        different to Lord Justice Taylor."     We do not believe
19        that they had access to transcripts. The overwhelming
20        body of resources and legal fire power were concentrated
21        in the South Yorkshire authorities before a South
22        Yorkshire coroner, before a Sheffield jury.
23   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    I am aware that that is a
24        bone of contention for all sorts of reasons.
25   MR JONES:   I met six families in 1993 and I have spent four
26        days in Liverpool, Julian Knowles has spent an extra
27        week in Liverpool preparing for this. What we found
28        again and again is that, when you speak to the
29        representatives of the family, they tell you,    "Just
30        before I was about to give evidence,    I was shown my
31        statement.    I was in an emotional state and I was given
32        about ten minutes to read it through".    Also those
33        family members will tell you that, when they go into
34        court, at the first sign of distress, which came very
35        quickly, their evidence was then wrapped up and so they
36        leave, usually with great expressions of effusive
37        thanks, pity and sympathy for them, and none of them had
38        the opportunity to come back, having collected
39        themselves, to give evidence.    However, all the


                                    20
 1        witnesses for the South Yorkshire authorities who gave
 2        evidence had copies of their own statements.       They were
 3        seen visibly outside court reading them and putting them
 4        back into their pockets, so they had been given copies.
 5        The access to information and the imbalance of access to
 6        information is one of the powerful grievances that the
 7        people have who are members of the Group who instruct
 8        me.    The proof of that is that we now find six to eight
 9        years after the event that we are now getting statements
10        provided by the South Yorkshire authorities which are
11        showing a completely different picture in relation to
12        individuals from that that was summarised at the time.
13        I do not want to get into that for the time being, but
14        any question that the lawyers did not cross-examine
15        fiercely enough has to be examined, we submit, against
16        that background, that they did not have the information.
17        They were, so to speak, playing away.    They were out
18        numbered and they did not have access to transcripts.
19   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    Why was that?
20   MR JONES:    Because the coroner took the approach at the
21        inquest, following the case Ex Parte Peach, which he was
22        entitled to do, of not disclosing relevant material, of
23        not disclosing police records and police statements to
24        the families.
25   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    That I understand, but the
26        transcript of the Taylor inquiry -----
27   MR HICKS:    Mr Jones used the term "transcripts",    I think
28        he meant statements. They would have had access,
29        obviously, to the Taylor inquiry transcripts.      We did
30        not have access to the statements.
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    That is what I thought the
32        position was.
33               What I was talking about was cross-examination on
34        the basis of the evidence before Lord Justice Taylor.
35        Indeed, Lord Justice Taylor's findings are clear about
36        this.
37               You see my difficulty on this point.     If there is
38        anything else that you want to say about it, do, but I
39        think that I see the way in which you put it now.


                                     21
 1   MR JONES:     We do have access to all the information here
 2        and we have referred to it. We do have available all the
 3        evidence of Bichard and Goddard and the others.
 4   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          If there is anything else -
 5        and I am particularly concerned with Duckenfield and
 6        Murray on this - any further evidence which indicates
 7        that they said to the inquest jury,           “We could not see
 8        what was happening in pens three and four, because this
 9        camera was not working", then that is what I should like
10        to see. That would be very crucial evidence on this
11        point.     My impression is, and, as I say, I have only
12        looked at their evidence before Taylor, that that is
13        completely contrary to what they were saying.           I would
14        like to take you up on one point where you deal with
15        Duckenfield's evidence         before Lord Justice Taylor at
16        paragraph 38.          It is 21st May, page 129. "He said that
17        he did not use the zoom facility at all, but, mainly
18        looked out of the window".           That word "mainly" does not
19        appear in my copy of his evidence and it is rather
20        crucial.
21                I have the transcript of 31st May, Day 8, here.
22        Question:    "Did you use or was the zoom facility used at
23        all to have a closer look at the situation in pens 3 and
24        4 once it was apparent that someone was climbing over
25        the fence?       (A)    Not that I am aware of, sir. That may
26        have been the case, but I looked through the window".
27                     My impression is that Duckenfield, in fact,
28                all of
29        them,    I think, looked at the screen which showed what
30        was happening at Leppings Lane, gate 3 and the build­
31        ups, but otherwise they used their own eyes through the
32        windows to see what was happening in the ground.          Is
33        that right?
34   MR JONES:     That is what they were saying, but we can show
35        that it was wrong by the zooming upon the tape which has
36        this year been discovered in Yorkshire Television.             I
37        notice the question put after that is,         "I think I am
38        right in saying on the composite video, for all its
39        length,    I do not recall any zoom pictures in that


                                          22
 1        video". That is put by Mr Collins, as he then was, or
 2        Lord Justice Taylor to which the reply was,          "I cannot
 3        recall". That is certainly right upon the composite as
 4        it is shown to the jury.           The zoom is not shown. We have
 5        now got the complete video from which it is clear that
 6        there is a zoom facility and it was being used.
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I take that point and I want to
 8        look at that, because, although I have,          I have obviously
 9        not picked up all the things that you say that one can
10        see.     I am not even quite sure that we have the right
11        v id e o .
12   MR JONES:     That is a major question in itself.
13   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Can I be clear about this?
14        Mr Hicks, you can probably answer this. The composite
15        video that was shown to the Taylor inquiry,          I have seen.
16        As I understand it, it is made up partly from the police
17        video, partly of club video and partly of BBC.           So far
18        as the Leppings Lane shots are concerned, one of them is
19        from police camera 1, which was mounted on the west
20        stand, and       part of it is the club camera, which was
21        mounted on       a post and overlooked the turnstiles A to G.
22   MR HICKS:     Yes.
23   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        What I am not quite clear about
24        is the footage.        I think that there is a lot of footage
25        that comes       from BBC cameras, not fixed cameras, but
26        roving cameras.
27   MR HICKS:     Some of that is police evidence as well.        There
28        were police roving cameras as well.
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Did the police have roving
30        cameras?        Was that after?
31   MR HICKS:     Both before, after and in the gymnasium. One
32        of the tapes that we have from Yorkshire Television has
33        about eight minutes colour material of actually inside
34        the mortuary - inside the gymnasium.
35   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I have seen that.     I think that
36        that was not initially disclosed, because it was thought
37        to be very harrowing.
38   MR HAMMOND:       We asked for that and they would not give it to
39        us, but that is something that the families need to


                                            23
 1        have.
 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I think that one of the problems
 3        about that is that the police have taken the view that
 4        they should not disclose pictures which show dead bodies
 5        other than the ones concerned.
 6   MR HICKS:     We would take issue with that, sir.
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Anyhow,   I can tell you that
 8        I have seen a good deal of that.
 9   MR HAMMOND:     Was the video that you saw just eight
10        minutes long of the temporary mortuary in the gymnasium?
11   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        That is what I have seen.
12   MR HICKS:     There was some other footage of fans arriving
13        outside, showing them walking along the Leppings Lane
14        terraces.
15   MR BONE:    I have seen all that.       They have a video taken
16        by the underwater search team,         I think they are called,
17        where the fellow is first of all outside the gates
18        seeing people arrive in Leppings Lane and then later on
19        it leaps to scenes in the mortuary.
20   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Anyhow,   I am right in thinking
21        that that composite tape, which was shown to Lord
22        Justice Taylor, was also shown to the jury?
23   MR HICKS:     Yes.     Would you like me to elaborate on that?
24   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Yes, but could I just ask you
25        some questions first, so I am clear on things.           Is that
26        the only video material that was shown to the jury or
27        was something else shown?
28   MR HAMMOND:     They showed the disaster and they showed the
29        year before on a split screen. There were two minutes of
30        14.40 at 1989 and 1988 was 14.38.         They showed you the
31        build up of the crowds from the previous year and the
32        disaster year too.
33   MR BONE:    This was a split-screen video?
34   MR HAMMOND:     Yes.
35   MR BONE:    They were running simultaneously 1989 and 1988?
36   MR HAMMOND:     Yes.
37   MR BONE:    We have that.
38   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I have not seen that.
     MR HICKS:     They showed that, but that was no use, because


                                        24
 1        you are talking about two minutes and a lot happened in
 2        two minutes.
 3   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Apart from that, was anything
 4        else shown to the jury?
 5   MR HICKS:     We are not aware of it, sir.     In fact, they
 6        actually asked for extra footage and this is the bit
 7        that we find unacceptable and remarkable, that this has
 8        suddenly turned up.
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I am coming to that.
10        I have a note somewhere about the factual position on
11        these videos which I want to check with you.           I made a
12        note because it is a complicated business.           Maybe I
13        should get this typed up, but we can correct it as we go
14        along.     As I see it the position is this, so far as the
15        club is concerned, they had 19 CCTV cameras trained on
16        the turnstiles.        One of these was not working as it was
17        trained on a brick wall.        One was showing turnstiles A
18        to G and footage from this was used in the compilation
19        tape.     It shows gate C opening on two occasions.       A
20        further monitor screen could pick up anything shown on
21        any of the five police CCTV cameras, but it had no
22        ability to record this. The operator in the club control
23        room could select which police screen he wished to
24        watch.     Is that right?
25   MR HICKS:     Yes.
26   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Between 4.30 pm on 15th April
27        and 9 am on 16th April, two tapes were stolen from the
28        club control room. One was that mentioned in paragraph 2
29        above, namely the quite useless one, and the other
30        showed turnstiles 9 to 16, neither are relevant to this
31        inquiry.        These tapes have never been found.
32   MR JONES:     Precisely. They were stolen from a locked and
33        alarmed room.        But they are, in fact, irrelevant.
34   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        And, as far as I can see,
35        there has never been any suggestion that the police were
36        in any way involved in that.
37   MR JONES:     All we know is that those videos were taken
38        from a locked and an alarmed room by somebody who must
39        have thought they were useful.


                                         25
     1   MR HICKS:     Forgive me, we have never said that.
 2       MR JONES:     We do not know.
 3       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Is there the slightest
 4            evidence that the police were involved in that?
 5       MR HICKS:     No. All we would say to that, sir, is that this
 6            was a major incident site, it was under total police
 7            control and we find it remarkable that the tapes have
 8            disappeared. We accept fully that the content is
 9            irrelevant, but we think that the issue is --
10       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I am bound to say that, if the
11            police were trying to suppress something, they might
12            have done a better job than they did.        There is no
13            evidence, is there, that the police were involved in
14            this?     Quite frankly,   I should have thought that the
15            probabilities are that it was somebody at the club.
16       MR JONES:     We do not even know whether it has been
17            investigated.
18       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       It was investigated.
19       MR HICKS:     We do not think so.
20       MR HAMMOND:     Only two people had the keys to that
21            room.
22       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Reading Houldsworth's evidence,
23            and I may have got this wrong,       I thought that he last
24            saw them about 4.30 when he went out, and he did not
25            lock the room at that stage.        He went back to lock it up
26            later.     I do not think that we need to spend a lot of
27            time on this, because they are completely irrelevant.
28       MR HICKS:     We accept that the content of the tapes is
29            irrelevant.     It is the fact that they'disappeared on
30            which we take issue.       We believe that that is relevant.
31       MR HAMMOND:     It started that night from those tapes going
32            missing.     The cover up started from those tapes going
33            missing.
34       MR JONES:     Not only that, but Mr Duckenfield was saying
35            that afternoon to the man from the Football Association,
36            Graham Kelly, that the Liverpool fans had burst down the
37            gates.
38       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      That was disgraceful.
39       MR JONES:     We argue that it appears right from the start,


                                             26
 1        from that moment onwards, there was a deliberate attempt
 2        to disguise the truth.     Mr Duckenfield was saying that
 3        to Mr Graham Kelly.    In fact, Peter Robinson, who was the
 4        chief executive of Liverpool Football Club, on hearing
 5        about it, went and took a photograph of the gates, which
 6        we think might have prevented that falsehood being
 7        repeated and developed.     But right from that time, in
 8        addition, you have police officers saying to the
 9        newspapers that Liverpool fans were looting the bodies
10        of other supporters and they were far more drunk than
11        the evidence before Lord Justice Taylor clearly
12        establishes, and from that time onwards from a very
13        early point, it looks as though there is a deliberate
14        attempt being made by the South Yorkshire Police to
15        throw the blame for the disaster upon the Liverpool
16        fans.   In those circumstances, where these two tapes go
17        missing from the club control room at a time when these
18        things are being said, in our submission, the matter is
19        worthy of note at least, when one considers that the
20        coroner is saying to Mr Bichard, when he gives his
21        evidence,   "We do not have one of the tapes", and that is
22        one of the tapes from the control room.
23   MR HICKS:    There is one other factor, not to dwell on it
24        too much, which is that Houldsworth told me in a
25        discussion that I had with him that underneath the
26        stairs a cupboard was built for mounting these video
27        units in.    As you say, there were 19 to 20 units.     The
28        comment that he made to me was that the numbering system
29        of the videos is, in fact, a little different to what
30        you would expect.     Part of his theory was that, if you
31        were an outsider wishing to take tapes away that were
32        important, you could well have taken these tapes
33        thinking that they were from a different camera, because
34        the numbering system is different to the actual ----
35   MS ADLINGTON:    I think that it was the camera trained on
36        gate C.
37   MR HICKS:    If, for instance, you were removing tapes
38        for gate C, you could actually have taken the wrong
39        ones, because of the funny numbering system that the


                                     27
 1        police had. That is the point that I was trying to make.
 2        We do not accept that the police may not have been
 3        involved.     Our actual position is that we think that
 4        they may have had a finger in it, forgive me speaking
 5        out of turn.
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     So far as the police cameras
 7        are concerned, there are five CCTV cameras as follows.
 8                 Number 1, mounted on the west stand showing the
 9        turnstiles A to G, Leppings Lane and part of the
10        concourse inside, black and white.      There was nothing
11        wrong with that camera, zoom facilities, panning, etc.
12                Number 2, mounted on the south stand, in colour,
13        could turn on to Leppings Lane terraces.
14                Number 3, mounted on the south stand, above the
15        players'    tunnel, black and white, of no particular
16        significance.
17                Number 4, mounted on the Kop, looking over
18        Pennistone Road turnstiles, not relevant.
19                Number 5, mounted near the south-west corner of the
20        west stand near the score board shown on the plan. This
21        was the nearest to the police control box, but did not
22        give exactly the same views. Black and white.
23                All these cameras were working during the day. They
24        could be swizzled and zoomed by PC Bichard in the
25        control box.     Pictures from them could be observed on
26        the screens in the control box in real time, but no tape
27        recording was made unless it was transferred to one of
28        the two further monitors in the control room.
29   MR JONES:     Yes, you can record from any of the five at
30        will.
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     So you can see what is going on
32        on the camera?
33   MR HICKS:     Yes. Can I explain this?   Those are the
34        screens, cameras 1 to 5, that is the numbering, and then
35        there are two further screens which show what is going
36        into the two video machines which were mounted under the
37        desk.
38   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I think that I have seen these
39        photographs, so do not worry about those now.


                                      28
     1   MR HICKS:    Yes, I am sure that you have.
 2       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      There were two further
 3            monitors that could be used to tape record any of the
 4            scenes shown by any of the five cameras.        They could
 5            make this recording in real time or in time lapse.
 6            Extracts from these tapes were used for the compilation
 7            tape.
 8       MR HICKS:    Yes.
 9       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Camera 5 had been
10            malfunctioning. The picture was affected by flare. Mr
11            Houldsworth had worked on this on the morning of the
12            15th. There was some dispute as to whether it had been
13            completely cured.
14       MR JONES:    We say that it had been. We say that Roger
15            Houldsworth's new statement makes it absolutely clear
16            that it was working perfectly. We point to the fact that
17            he was not called to give evidence at the inquest.
18       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      We will have to look at that.
19       MR HICKS:   He actually worked on it on the Friday as well.
20            He worked on it prior to the match.
21       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      As far as the tapes are
22            concerned, all the tapes except those stolen from the
23            club were handed to the South Yorkshire Police.
24       MR HICKS:    Yes.
25       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      The West Midlands Police made
26            a compilation tape that was shown to Lord Justice Taylor
27            and the jury.    This has extracts from both the club, the
28            police and the BBC tapes.        That you have already
29            confirmed.
30                   One of the tapes, which was recording the product
31            of police cameras, ran out. This was because Police
32            Constable Bichard did not replace the three-hour tapes
33            until later.    Is that right?
34       MR HICKS:    That is correct.
35       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      The other tape did not run
36            out as it was on time lapse.        I am not quite sure
37            whether that is right.      Did it run out at some stage?
38       MR HICKS:   According to what we have got from Yorkshire
39            Television, he actually changed the tape. There is a


                                          29
 1        one-minute gap. We can give you another piece of
 2        evidence on that.      He changed the tape in deck A, but he
 3        did not change the tape in deck B until a half-an-hour
 4        gap had taken place.      There is a one-minute gap.
 5   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Is A the time-lapse one?
 6   MR HICKS:     I do not think that that is absolutely right
 7        about the time lapse, sir. There are elements of time
 8        lapse on both machines, including some of the footage
 9        that we can show you.
10   MR JONES:     I think that the way in which I eventually
11        understood this was that there are, therefore, two video
12        records from two video recorders, one of which is
13        irrelevant for our purposes altogether and we have just
14        forgotten about it.
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Was that the one that was not
16        renewed?
17   MR JONES:     No, that was the one that was changed quickly.
18        That is a video record that we can ignore. There were
19        two video recorders, one of them we can ignore
20        altogether. The one that we cannot ignore ----
21   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Just so I get it clear, which
22        on the photograph is the one that we can ignore?
23   MR HICKS:     We do not actually know, sir, which one it is.
24        There are two machines. This is the operating desk where
25        Bichard sits and the two machines are mounted below
26        there.     These are the sequencers on the top which
27        enables him to flip between the various cameras or to
28        select any one manually. These are the controls for each
29        camera, cameras 1 to 5 again.      He can obviously pan,
30        tilt and zoom these and he can record.        We will submit
31        to you the tapes from Yorkshire Television when we get
32        them tidied up properly. We did not think that it was as
33        relevant as it is in people's understanding, but,
34        effectively, there is deck A or VCR A, whichever way you
35        prefer, and that was running from 12 o'clock through
36        until 17.22.
37   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Throughout?
38   MR HICKS:     Throughout.   He changes the tape.   It goes from
39        12 until four minutes after three, when he puts a new


                                       30
 1        tape in.    I am sorry,   I am misleading you.     If you look
 2        below, there is a one-minute gap.      He used PI - we are
 3        not sure why there is this numbering, this is how it
 4        came from Yorkshire.      That tape runs from 11.59 through
 5        to 15.34 and then the second tape runs from 15.35
 6        through to 17.22.    So it is almost continuous.
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Is that in real time?
 8   MR HICKS:   There is a bit of each, because each machine
 9        is capable of switching one to another.      The only
10        relevance of the time lapse, as you will appreciate,
11        sir, is that you are taking a photograph every three to
12        five seconds instead of every second.
13   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I follow that.
14   MR HICKS:   It gives you a lot longer on the tape, that is
15        all.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     What was deck B doing?
17   MR HICKS:   Deck B is where Bichard forgets the tape.
18        It starts at 11.59 through to 15.04. He then puts the
19        other tape in at 15.34, so there is half-an-hour's gap.
20        Then that runs again through to 17.22.
21   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     What was that showing photograph
22        of?
23   MR HICKS:   That is the one which contains photographs of
24        camera 5.
25   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     That is not irrelevant.
26   MR HICKS:   No, that is not.
27   MR JONES:   The one that is irrelevant    is the other one.
28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     That is deck A, is it?     What
29        was deck A showing then?
30   MR HICKS:   A combination. Either deck    could show any of
31        the five cameras and could record any of the five
32        cameras.
33   MR JONES:   The one that is virtually continuous except
34        for one minute shows irrelevant shots which are for our
35        purposes irrelevant.      The one which was showing and
36        intermittently recording camera 5 is the one where there
37        is the half-an-hour gap after 15.04.
38   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     We know that the camera is
39        working all the time.     What I am anxious to see is the


                                      31
 1        shots from camera 5 during that time.        That is what you
 2        are going to show me?
 3   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Yes.   On that one you get
 4        clear shots showing zooming, panning and tilting working
 5        properly at 20-past-two.      Therefore, we say that it is
 6        to be assumed that it was working in exactly the same
 7        way throughout all the period of time, as Roger
 8        Houldsworth says, because he was, himself, on the single
 9        video monitor which he had which was common to the
10        police seeing perfect and ordinary pictures from that.
11   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      We will come to that.      But what
12        the police say, as I understand it, is that from half-
13        past-two onwards they were concentrating on what was
14        happening at Leppings Lane and what was being shown on
15        that camera.
16   MR JONES:   They do, but our point is that on one of the
17        five screens at which they are looking, they can see all
18        the time continuously pictures of camera 5, whether or
19        not it is recording, which are perfect.
20   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      That I follow. Equally, they
21        can see perfectly well out of the window what is
22        happening on the terraces.
23   MR JONES:   To the extent     that they say that you can   get
24        a proper view, y e s .
25   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      There is no doubt that they could
26        get a proper view.
27   MR HICKS:   They gave the opposite impression to the jury.
28        That is one of our main issues.
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      We will come to that.
30   MR JONES:   It is also the ability to focus on faces,
31        which is important. Part of the reason why you have the
32        zoom facility is in order that the police at any time,
33        with their expertise, can focus upon areas of trouble.
34        That might be because there is crowd trouble or it might
35        be because somebody has had a heart attack.        It might be
36        because you want to get an ambulance into somebody.
37        There might be    some particular reason. The reason why
38        you have these    five facilities and the zoom is precisely
39        so that these highly-experienced officers can at any


                                       32
 1        time say,    "Let us look at what is happening down there".
 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I follow that.      It is mainly
 3        f o r --
 4   MR HICKS:     Anti-hooliganism.
 5   MR JONES:     Mainly for that.
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Was there evidence from any of
 7        the witnesses that they were for the purposes about
 8        which you have just told me?
 9   MR JONES:     I think that we have quoted what was said in
10        the police review.        It is page 11.      I think that we have
11        quoted the purpose of them.            It is in the context of
12        identifying offenders.           It is the footnote that we quote
13        there.     This is the quality and the purpose.           It is in
14        order to see incidents and employ necessary resources to
15        abate them.     For example, Bichard had been there for
16        years, Ryan had been there for years, so had Murray,
17        although Duckenfield had not, and so they must be, we
18        say, instinctively able at a flick of a switch to say,
19        "Let's just have a look at what is happening there".
20        That would have shown and must have presented them with
21        evidence of distress, clear evidence of pressure and
22        pain and people being jammed together from five-to-three
23        on, at exactly the same time as the order was made to
24        open the gates.
25   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I    am   trying to get the factual
26        position of this. So        far as     the tape shown to     the jury
27        was concerned in relation to            camera 5, there is nothing
28        before 15.02, is there?
29   MR JONES:     That is right.
30   MR HICKS:     What was shown     was very poor quality.
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Why was that?
32   MR HICKS:     That is one of the questions that we would
33        ask.
34   MR JONES:     In fact, we have brought it with us. The
35        compilation tape shown to the jury of which an exact
36        copy was given to Mr Glover, who is one of the prominent
37        members of the Group, is of very poor quality, indeed.
38        It shows a lot of fuzz and a            lot of flaring.
39   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        We have seen     a copy ofthat.


                                           33
 1   MR HAMMOND:     That is exactly what the jury was shown.
 2   MR JONES:     It is the significance of the new tape and of the
 3        evidence of Roger Houldsworth that the picture, in fact,
 4        was checked by him in the morning, he did repairs to get
 5        rid of flare and was, in fact, perfect. Therefore, the
 6        view upon the screen, which would have been the view
 7        upon the video had it been recorded was perfect.        It was
 8        in perfect working order. The conclusion from that must
 9        be, we argue, that what the jury were shown was not a
10        representation of what the police were shown, but it was
11        a deliberately distorted version to make it look as
12        though the quality of the picture was very poor.        What
13        seems to us is important is that the original of that
14        video, which was shown to the jury, is examined,
15        because, if Houldsworth is correct and the video
16        obtained from Yorkshire Television showing camera 5
17        proves that he is correct, that must mean that what the
18        jury was shown was a deliberately distorted version of
19        the picture made to look as though the police could not
20        see, because the picture was flawed, when, in fact, they
21        had a perfect view.
22   MR BONE:    You mean that the police put the fuzz and flare
23        on afterwards?
24   MR JONES:     Yes.
25   MR HICKS:     Or you could select a piece of tape, and you
26        almost half the quality every time you copy a VHS tape.
27        I am sure you have seen this yourself if you have copied
28        a film from one video to another.
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     You told me earlier that the
30        compilation tape that was shown to the jury was the same
31        as the one shown to Lord Justice Taylor.
32   MR HICKS:     Yes.
33   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     And of the same quality?
34   MR HICKS:     Yes, the same very poor quality.   Part of the
35        reason that we accepted wrongly that camera 5 was not
36        working correctly was that we did not know any better.
37        We obviously had not found Houldsworth at that time. The
38        bits of tape that we had seen were of very poor quality.
39   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Apart from saying to


                                      34
 1        Lord Justice Taylor that they had had this trouble with
 2        the camera, it had not been completely renewed and it
 3        was not as good as it had been, Bichard accepted that it
 4        was showing pictures.
 5   MR HICKS:     No, he did not. With respect, sir, I think
 6        that you mentioned Duckenfield and Murray earlier.             in
 7        his evidence to Lord Justice Taylor, Bichard ----
 8   MR HAMMOND:     Bichard to the coroner ---
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I am talking about
10        Lord Justice Taylor.
11   MR HAMMOND:     Bichard did not say that it was working.       He
12        said it was a flaring.
13   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I can look at that.
14   MR HAMMOND:     To the coroner, Bichard said     that the camera
15        was not working, it was just parked.
16   MR JONES:     To Lord Justice Taylor it was:     "Thequality
17        had been improved, it was not up to the mark,        but it was
18        a lot of better than it had been. We were getting
19        pictures.     That is the best way of describing it".
20   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Yes, that is what I had in mind.
21   MR JONES:     To the coroner he described it as being flaring.
22   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Where is this?
23   MR JONES:     This is to the coroner at page 380.      I am sorry,
24        we have not got the date.        It is his evidence to the
25        coroner's inquest.     It is between B and C, "What was the
26        camera looking at before 15.02 as far as you can
27        recollect?    (A)   My recollections are that the particular
28        camera had been faulty and you saw some of the problems
29        that occurred". That is a reference to the video.         "You
30        are getting what is called flare, it's reflection of
31        light, and you lose the picture. The camera was not
32        really being used as much as it would normally be
33        because of the substandard picture.         It was just left in
34        position. That is why the picture never really moved at
35        all, because it was set and left in that position".
36               While I am on the page, you will see,      "If I tell
37        you we cannot find that particular tape, would that make
38        any difference to your answer? (A) I have no idea at all
39        where it could have gone.        It was part of the tape and


                                      35
 1        the tapes were all sealed up at the end of the d a y " .
 2               The coroner is putting there that one of the police
 3        tapes in a disaster of this magnitude has gone missing
 4        and we do not know where it i s .
 5   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Bichard is saying,   "Well, I don't
 6        know what has happened to it".
 7   MR JONES:     That is right.
 8   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     In fact, just to carry this
 9        further forward. As I understand it, the South Yorkshire
10        Police had it all the time.
11   MR HICKS:     This is the one that has miraculously turned
12        up in a safe now.
13   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     We do not have to use emotive
14        language.     It has now turned up in a safe where?
15   MR HICKS:     At South Yorkshire Police.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Can I just trace this through?
17        It is said, as I understand it, and this is your
18        assertion, Mr Hicks, that at some stage, and I do not
19        know precisely when, South Yorkshire Television were
20        given this tape by the chief constable or under his
21        authority.     Is that right?
22   MR HICKS:     When they first started researching the
23        programme, they had a meeting - it was, of course, Peter
24        Wright in those days, not Richard Wells, as it is now -
25        and they had a couple of meetings with him.        At the end
26        of one of those meetings, and we do not know the exact
27        date, unfortunately, they were, effectively, given a box
28        of tapes.
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     What sort of date are we talking
30        about?
31   MR HICKS:     The programme went out at the beginning of
32        February 1990, so we would be talking late 1989, the
33        autumn of 1989.
34   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Post-Taylor?
35   MR HICKS:     Yes, post-Taylor, but pre-inquest.
36   MR JONES:     What the Yorkshire Television, therefore, get
37        is a second generation version of that video, because,
38        as we understand it, the original has remained all the
39        time in South Yorkshire. The one that Mr Hicks has been


                                      36
     1        given this year, which we say is very clear, is a second
     2        generation copy of what Yorkshire Television have.
     3   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Yorkshire Television have still
 4            got what they were given, have they?
 5       MR HICKS:     Yes.
 6       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        We have not had that from them?
 7       MR HICKS:     No. They are prepared to talk to you if you wish
 8            them to.
 9       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Just let me ask questions for
10            the moment.        They have still got that.   You say that the
11            South Yorkshire Police have still got the original.
12       MR HICKS:     We believe so.
13       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Why do you believe so?
14       MR HAMMOND:     That is what Richard Wells came out with.
15            He said that the tape had been in his safe for the last
16            eight years.
17       MS ADLINGTON:        He said that they had found the missing
18            tape - that was January - in his safe.
19       MR HICKS:     It is only supposition that that particular
20            tape, the one to which you are referring, is, in fact,
21            the tape from camera 5 prior to 13.02.         We have not
22            seen that tape.
23       MR JONES:     It is the parent of the one that Yorkshire
24            Television have.
25       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Be that as it may, Yorkshire
26            Television have the first copy?
27       MR JONES:     We believe so, yes.
28       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       You have seen that?
29       MR HICKS:     Yes, and I have now got a copy.
30       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       You have now a complete copy,
31            have you?
32       MR HICKS:     Yes.    There were actually 12 tapes in the box,
33            sir. Some of them have only a small amount on them. As I
34            explained, one only had eight minutes on.
35       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       You at some stage made a
36            compilation tape, is that right?
37       MR HICKS:     To call it a compilation tape is, perhaps,
38            wrong.     What we have done is that we have edited out the
39            shots from camera 5.        If you will appreciate, when you


                                             37
     1        are on a sequencer, you can, if you like, set it for a
 2            long time. What we were trying to do was to save time
 3            for the likes of yourself to show (a) that there were
 4            lots of shots from camera 5 and (b) that they were of
 5            good quality from 12 noon right up until the 15.04 and
 6            again from 15.34 through until 17.22.            We accept that
 7            there is no recorded footage from camera 5 between 15.04
 8            to 15.34.     We accept that there is half an hour missing.
 9       MR HAMMOND:     Well, we have not seen it.
10       MR HICKS:     It is missing from what we have got.        We do not
11            know whether it is missing in South Yorkshire, of
12            course.
13       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       What you have now got is what
14            was translated,    if that is the right word, from these
15            five screens on to deck A or deck B.
16       MR HICKS:     We have an exact copy, admittedly not of pristine
17            quality.
18       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       There would be no record other
19            than from that of what was actually being shown on these
20            five screens?
21       MR JONES:     That is right.
22       MR HICKS:     We accept that,    sir.   The reason that   I showed
23            you that, of course, is that you must bear in mind that
24            all the time the cameras are on, those screens are lit
25            up.    They would see it on the screen even though it is
26            not actually recorded.
27       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       You do have to bear in mind
28            that people may not necessarily be paying attention to
29            all of those screens.
30       MR HAMMOND:     What are they    there for then?
31       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I do   not want to    get into too
32            much argument on th i s .
33       MR JONES:     If I may say so, I think that admits the
34            point about the zoom, because on this one at 20-past-
35            two, as we say, you do find - and there are five of them
36            in the box - that one of them is actually zooming in.
37       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         I take that point.      Equally,
38            and I may have to see the police about this, I would
39            suppose that, if they are zooming on something, it is


                                            38
 1        because there is some interest and they would            probably
 2        record that on one of the decks A or B.
 3   MR JONES:   Not necessarily.
 4   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Not necessarily, but that is what
 5        I would expect would happen.
 6   MR HICKS:   Yes.   Could I just pick up on the camera 5 point?
 7        You know exactly where it is, do you?
 8   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Yes,     I know where it is.
 9   MR HICKS:   As we said earlier, it is meant to be a
10        hooliganism    camera, if I can use that generic term.         It
11        has the capability to produce evidence-quality video
12        pictures, so they could be produced in court if
13        proceedings were taken.      One of the issues that we have
14        had, and particularly since the tapes have come to
15        light, is that we have said that the camera was working.
16        We accept Lord Justice Taylor's position, but the
17        coroner's position was that the camera was not working
18        or was working to a degree that was unsatisfactory.
19        They then changed their story and said,        "No, we have
20        never said that the camera was not working, we said that
21        the monitor was not working". Another crucial feature
22        that you may miss in the evidence is that the eyes of
23        the operator is the television screen. When he is
24        sitting at his desk working these buttons to move the
25        camera around, he has to look at the television screen,
26        because that is showing him what the camera is looking
27        at. That also shows that the television screen has to be
28        working. The second version of the fault that the South
29        Yorkshire Police put out, which is why it is a totally
30        ridiculous situation ----
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Where do we get these versions
32        that the police have put out?         You deal with it
33        somewhere in your submissions.
34   MR JONES:   It is paragraph 53.        We have not provided the
35        supporting document for that.
36   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Can you do that?
37   MR JONES:   Yes, we will.
38   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I think that I am reasonably
39        clear now. We have seen what Mr Hicks has produced for


                                       39
 1         us, have we not?
 2   MR BONE:      Yes, we have.           It is this material here.
 3   MR HICKS:      These are actually copies of the tapes,
 4         You will see this P.l. Some of this will be relevant to
 5         camera 5 and some of it will not be.
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:              What I meant, Chris, is that
 7         I have seen those?
 8   MR BO N E :   Y e s , you h a v e .
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:              Just to be quite clear about
10         this, these are not exact copies of what Yorkshire
11         Television have or what you believe the police have
12         still got, but they are extracts that you have made
13         f r o m ---
14   MR HICKS:      Can I say that I do not absolutely remember
15         that particular set, sir, but we have a full set of
16         exactly what was on the decks. We have even checked them
17         through frame by frame'.
18   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:              Have we got that?
19   MR HICKS:      No, we have not.          We have ordered a full set
20         for you from Yorkshire Television and some copies of the
21         First Tuesday programme.
22   MR BONE:      This South Yorkshire material will be all 12
23         tapes contained in the box?
24   MR HICKS:      Yes, all those are numbered up.          I have brought
25         a few with me.         A lot of it is material that is not
26         relevant.       This is the version, particularly if it is
27         the one that came when I put the statement in, where, to
28         try to save you the time,            I basically chopped out the
29         material between the sequence of camera 5 ----
30   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:              What I shall probably do
31         is look at these again and you, Chris, can look through
32         the whole lot.
33   MR BONE:      I will.
34   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:              I shall look through extracts.
35   MR HICKS:      Could I make the point that the quality of these
36         is at least third/fourth generation and what I would
37         like to show you, if I could, while we are here, is the
38         copy I have.        We would say that the copy that I have
39         from South Yorkshire is at least third or fourth


                                               40
 1        generation and it is still excellent.
 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          Why do we not have a break
 3        for coffee?          Then maybe we can have a viewing of these.
 4   MR HICKS:     To save time, sir, we have brought the section
 5        of the tape which shows one of the crucial parts, we
 6        say, if you like, in a snapshot.
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          That would be helpful.
 8                                   (Short BreakV
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         There is something that
10        you can help me on, Mr Hicks.            I assume that the jury
11        had those bundles of photographs that were produced to
12        Lord Justice Taylor?
13   MR HICKS:     We think so, but we are not absolutely certain.
14   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Because here one has a very good
15        view from the police box.            You have seen these, have
16        you?
17   MR HAMMOND:     They did not have that pack.         They might have
18        taken them into the deliberation room.            They might have
19        been given them at the very end, but they did not have
20        them with them.         Any photographs were just passed around
21        the jury and then brought back.
22   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         They did not have a bundle
23        of photographs?
24   MR HICKS:     No.
25   MS ADLINGTON: They were given an exhibit number as and when
26        they were produced.
27   MR HAMMOND:     They were given an exhibit number of C 5 .1
28        or whatever and it was flashed up on the screen. That
29        was it then. That was for everyone to see.            I cannot
30        remember seeing that amount at all.
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Presumably, these photographs
32        have been available to you, have they, from the time of
33        Lord Justice Taylor's inquiry?
34   MR HAMMOND:     No, because we can only get photographs
35        pertaining to my son.
36   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Have you had copies of these,
37        Ms Adlington?
38   MS ADLINGTON:       No.
39   MR HAMMOND:     I sent away for videos and photographs and I


                                          41
 1        got a reply back on Thursday, was it not, Ann, saying
 2        "n o ".
 3   MR HICKS:     I think that it is fair to say that they were
 4        available to the legal people and various solicitors
 5        would have had them. We have a few of them.           I have some
 6        of them, but we do not have a full set.
 7   MR JONES:     We will check.
 8   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        The ones that are significant
 9        are the ones of the police control box.           It is also
10        quite interesting, because you can see the position of
11        camera 5 from these photographs.        You have seen that,
12        have you?
13   MR HICKS:     I think that they are the same ones.
14   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        That is the camera there. There
15        you have the view down the terraces and so on. There is
16        a similar one there.
17   MR JONES:     They are not dissimilar to the ones we have.
18   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I expect that they are the same
19        photographs.    (Lord Justice Stuart-Smith and Mr Hicks
20        looked through the photographs^
21   MR HICKS :     The reason      why I have not given you the
22        Yorkshire    Television lists of all the tapes yet is that
23        their camera numbering is different to ours.          For some
24        reason they have used a different numbering system and
25        it would be confusing.
26   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        This is something that we have
27        seen already, is it not?
28   MR BONE:     We have seen these pictures and the version we
29        have we got from Trevor.
30        (Video One shown )
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        This is pen one or pen two?
32   MR HICKS:     We are not absolutely sure.     You are seeing
33        a long shot there.
34   MR BONE:      That is the      other end of the ground.
35   MR HICKS:It has now     flicked on to the Leppings Lane
36        terracing.     You see the camera is tilting.      It is panning
37        to the right there.        The time base, by the way, comes
38        from the video machine, it is not from the cameras.
39   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        What time is this?


                                         42
 1   MR HICKS:     This is 14.18.   This is already at least a
 2        second or possibly third generation copy, but, in fact,
 3        one of those two ladies has come forward now,
 4                   She has been recognised by friends of hers who
 5        have seen this clip on the television. Even though they
 6        have a copy of a copy, it was good enough for these
 7        people to be recognised.      I will just leave it running,
 8        because in a moment we will see it zoom in.        That shows
 9        that the camera is working and we would say that that
10        shows convincingly that the television must be working,
11        because Bichard can only control the camera by looking
12        at the monitor, when their second story was,       "We never
13        said that the camera was not faulty. We said that it was
14        the television monitor".
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Do we know which pen this is?
16   MR HICKS:     We think that it is pen two.     That is one of the
17        radial fences.
18   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     That is what I would have
19        thought.
20   MR JONES:     It is definitely camera 5.
21   MR HICKS:     It is absolutely definitely camera 5.     Iwill
22        zoom it on and then I will bring it back.        I will just
23        leave it running now normal time, so you can see the
24        time it takes .    This is exactly what the operator would
25        be seeing on the television screen.         You can see quite
26        clearly now the facial features and this is on at least
27        a second or third generation copy.
28   MR BONE:     We have seen this in the version you sent us,
29        which    was third or fourth generation.
30   MR HICKS:     But you will appreciate that we have kept    these
31        under lock and key, because, if they were to disappear,
32        a lot of our argument changes.       You see again now the
33        cameras being moved by the operator, Bichard.        You can
34        see quite clearly there and, as we say, that is at least
35        a second or third generation.        I believe that it is
36        probably third or fourth.        The quality that Bichard
37        would have got would have been first class.
38   MR BONE:     You can see a person smoking, a chap reading
39        a magazine, people talking to each other.


                                      43
     1   MR HICKS: You see the camera moving around, panning
 2            and zooming.     Everything is working perfectly
 3            satisfactorily.
 4       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     We have always known that the
 5            zoom was working perfectly satisfactorily.        Is this on
 6            the normal thing?     This is the widest angle that the
 7            camera can give, is it?
 8       MR HICKS:     No, it can come back again.    You saw it
 9            zoom in and now it has come back.       I stopped the tape,
10            obviously, at this point to save your time.          I have done
11            another compilation where on the back end of that there
12            is this very piece which again is a copy of this tape.
13       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Do we have any shots of pens
14            three and four from this camera?
15       MR HICKS:     We do have a little later.    I am not sure
16            whether it is on this tape or not.
17       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     That is the other end, is it?
18       MR HICKS:     Yes.
19       MR HAMMOND:     What is happening there is that Liverpool
20            supporters are coming in with Nottingham Forest.
21       MR HICKS:     That is the black-and-white camera which is
22            on top of the south stand, camera 2.
23       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     They had a problem, did they
24            not, because some people were going the wrong end?
25       MR HICKS:     There were some Liverpool Forest supporters
26            in the Nottingham Forest end and the police were
27            bringing them out.      It is not so good on this, but you
28            can see the guy with the turban and the beard and you
29            can see the police officer's face, and that is at the
30            farthest end of the ground. The same camera is also
31            capable of looking at the terraces.
32       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     This is not camera 5?
33       MR HICKS:     No, this is camera 2.   The black-and-white
34            one on the top of the south stand.      That camera is also
35            capable of looking at the terraces so, even if camera 5
36            was not working, part of our argument, where again we
37            are reinforcing what Taylor said, is that they could
38            have used one of the other cameras, if they had so
39            wished.


                                          44
 1               If I take this on, you will see that it starts
 2        going around the ground again.
 3   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      They had a problem at that end
 4        and this is why they were recording it.
 5   MR HICKS:    That is right.     I have asked for Yorkshire
 6        Television to do a full set of these tapes for you, so
 7        you will get the same quality as this one.         Their tapes
 8        are now on broadcast.
 9               This is the end of that particular tape. This is
10        not something that I have done.       It is when someone has
11        been editing the tape.      Yorkshire Television does not
12        think it is them, they think it may have been when
13        Yorkshire had them.      It is actually running backwards if
14        you look at it.      Someone is winding this back now.      You
15        see it going back on the sequences.       That means that we
16        have some other shots from camera 5 on the seating area
17        above the terraces on the west stand.
18   LORD JUSTICE    STUART-SMITH:    This is still camera 2?
19   MR HICKS:   Yes.   That is the end of that tape.
20   LORD JUSTICE    STUART-SMITH:    That shows reasonably quality
21        pictures from camera 5 of pen two?
22   MR HICKS:   Yes.   It could be pen three, but we cannot
23        be certain from that.
24   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I am pretty sure it is not.
25   MR BONE:    In fact, you can see pen three, because you
26        can see beyond the fence.
27   LORD JUSTICE    STUART-SMITH:    Yes. You can see the
28        fence between pens two and three.
29   MR HICKS:    I can wind this back a bit or we can go
30        back to one of the other sections.
31        (Video Two Shown )
32   MR HICKS:   This is Pennistone Road end.     We are looking
33        at 12.09, so it is fairly early on in the day.
34   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      This is camera 4?
35   MR HICKS:   Yes.   This is the colour camera.
36   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      South stand number two,
37        I think.
38   MR HICKS:   What this shows is your ability to put
39        any of the five cameras to any one of the two tape


                                       45
     1         decks, so you could have almost any permutation.
     2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:           We know that there is
     3         a recording some time between half-past-two and            3
 4             o'clock roughly from this camera 5.
 5       MR HICKS:      Yes,    and it is contained onthe tapes.
 6       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:             Not camera 5, I mean
 7             camera 1.        A lot of that is shown on the compilation
 8             tape.
 9       MR   HICKS:    A lot of the Leppings Lane stuff is. The
10             thing that we wanted to make clear is that there is none
11             of camera 5 on the compilation tape. There was a very
12             short amount of it which is in time lapse mode when it
13             is looking       at the top of the fence.
14       MR HAMMOND:      At    15.02.
15       MR HICKS:      This    is the perimeter fence when people are
16             climbing over.
17       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:           That is when the police say
18             that their attention was drawn to it by people climbing
19             out.
20       MR   HICKS:    And it would fit into the theory that they felt
21             that    they were dealing with a pitch invasion and not a
22             disaster, because the camera parks, as it is called, it
23             stops on the fence and leaves it running in standard
24             time.    When you look at the proper tapes, it switches
25             from time-lapse mode back to ordinary time mode, which
26             again you would probably want to use if you are picking
27             out individuals.          It does actually zoom in as well.
28             Again, it proves that the camera and the monitor were
29             working.        We have had to spend a bit of time looking
30             through these.
31       MR BONE:      These tapes that you are going to give us from
32             Yorkshire TV, they will be, effectively, third
33             generation, will they, because you start off with the
34             original tape that the police did on the day, then a
35             copy of that was made and given to Yorkshire Television
36             and then Yorkshire Television have made a copy or you
37             have made a copy of it, which you have got.
38       MR HICKS:      It is actually worse than that.       Yorkshire
39             Television transferred the VHS tapes that they got - and


                                               46
 1        we think returned them to Yorkshire - on to beta tapes
 2        which are the large broadcast quality tapes.         The copy
 3        that I have is from those.      It is at least fourth
 4        generation.     What I cannot be certain about is if at any
 5        time they have been enhanced.       We do not believe so.
 6        Yorkshire do not think that they did enhance them.          The
 7        only reason that we found them, as I think we said, is
 8        by accident. We were actually looking for Roger
 9        Houldsworth having his interview.
10                Can I just show you this?   This is actually a shot
11        of pen three looking through the perimeter fence.        This
12        is at quarter-past-12. This again shows that camera 5
13        was working as early as 12.15 and much later on in the
14        tapes you will see that it is still working at 5.30.         If
15        I whiz it forward,    just to save time, that is Pennistone
16        Road again and we are back at looking from the colour
17        camera.     This is going on the sequencer.
18   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     This is the thing flicking from
19        one to the other automatically?
20   MR HICKS:    Yes.   You can do it automatically or you can
21        override it manually by pressing any of the buttons.
22   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     At this stage it is flicking
23        automatically from one to the other, you think.
24   MR HICKS:    Yes.   There are again further shots.
25   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     What do you say that is?
26   MR HICKS:    This is again pen three.    It is the same
27        shot that you will see at various times leading up.         If
28        I move this on a bit further, you will start seeing that
29        they move the camera from looking through the radial
30        fence to the terrace.     That is 12.20.   This is the same
31        shot
32        again of pen three.
33   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I would like you to fix on
34        that.     You are probably right, but I am not convinced
35        quite which pen that is.
36   MR HICKS:    (12.22 pm)   This is the police control camera,
37        so this will be Leppings Lane camera, number 1, but it
38        is actually swinging around now and this is at the side.
39        The River Don is here.     We are looking back up towards


                                     47
 1        where the directors'       entrance and car park is.        Again,
 2        you see it zooming in.
 3   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I do not understand that last
 4        one.      The camera is onthe west stand,        is it not?
 5   MR HICKS:     If     I just let itrun through now     and we can
 6        stop it at any point.        I will run it back at normal
 7        speed.        You see the camera is panning around.      This is
 8        the television crew.        You are now looking at the side.
 9        Gate C is up here somewhere. We are now going up along
10        in between the River Don here.
11   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        That must be a roving camera,
12        must it not?
13   MR HICKS:     No.I think that it     is camera 1.      What we
14        are looking at is this area here and I           think that they
15        have panned down.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Maybe, yes.
17   MR HAMMOND:        It must have gone around 180 degrees to come
18        back round there.
19   MR HICKS:     (12.23.44) There is an example of flaring there,
20        which I think is quite interesting.
21   MR JONES:     Take it back to the scene by the river again.
22        (12.23.10)
23   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        This is camera 1?
24   MR HICKS:     Looking at the river.      (12.23.34)    There is
25        gate C and this is very early on in the day.
26   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Can you show me the flaring
27        that you talked about?
28   MR HICKS:     I think that it comes in a second.         Because it
29        has picked up the bright sun sky, this has gone dark.
30        It is the opposite to flaring.         I cannot remember the
31        term for it.        As soon as he brings it below the level of
32        the horizon ----
33   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        This is a different camera,
34        is it not?
35   MR HICKS:     No.     That is the Pennistone Road camera.        That
36        is another shot of the terrace.         (12.24.56)     We are
37        looking at the north side now.         This is the roundabout
38        where Leppings Lane comes into
39   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        This is Pennistone Road again?


                                         48
 1   MR HICKS:    This is Pennistone Road, but it is looking in a
 2        northerly direction. The earlier shots you saw were in a
 3        southerly direction.     This is camera 4.
 4   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Now we are back to camera 2.
 5   MR HICKS:    Yes.   (12.25.40) Camera 1.     That is the same
 6        camera that we saw just pan down.
 7   MR BONE:    Mr Hammond says that it can go around
 8        180 degrees.
 9   MR HICKS:    About 270 degrees is the full length they can
10        do.
11   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     This is the stand.    (12.27.58)
12   MR HICKS:    Yes.   This is the stand above it.     This is
13        camera 5 again now.     The terraces are directly below
14        here and this    is the concrete parapet that people     were
15        being pulled over.     I will take it forward because it
16        goes on to lots of sequences.
17               One of the issues, which again I put in my
18        statement, that I find incomprehensible is that, whoever
19        put the compilation tape together, they could be
20        forgiven missing,    say, one or two extracts from camera
21        5, but there are so many of them that you would have to
22        deliberately miss them.
23   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     The compilation tape does not
24        show anything    at this time.
25   MR HICKS:   No, but   for the jury to be left with the
26        impression that camera 5 was not working, then the
27        coroner's officers, which were basically the West
28        Midlands Police, basically, had to ignore all these
29        shots, because, obviously, each and every one of those
30        show that it was working.        Effectively, that tape, which
31        I think you have there, is with all these bits cut out.
32               (12.33.56)   Again, as we go further on, this is
33        building up.     One of the shots that I was, in fact,
34        going to point out was that                who was pulled out
35        and taken around the back, where someone makes the
36        comment about the police officer who did not help, you
37        can actually see him on this video.
38               I will take it on a little bit.      You will see very
39        much the same thing except that, if you look in the


                                      49
 1        bottom corner, they moved the camera across and you can
 2        actually see the head of the tunnel with two people
 3        sitting on the wall. There is not a direct shot across
 4        the terrace.     I will accept that.
 5                (12.40.50)   That is an illustration of flaring. The
 6        camera has come on to it and, because it is in bright
 7        sunlight, it takes a second or two for the iris to alter
 8        automatically with the intensity of the light.
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Can    we just go   back onthat?
10   MR HICKS:      You can see the vast difference      between where
11        they are in the shade and where they are in bright
12        sunlight.      If you leave the camera alone, it will
13        gradually adjust.     You can see that that man's face is
14        not very visible.
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Is it adjusting?
16   MR HICKS:      It is very marginal, it is hard      to tellon
17        here,     but, as I say, if it had been left on there long
18        enough, it would actually adjust.        Preferably, you are
19        better off if you are either in the dark or in the
20        brightness.
21   MR BONE:     In fact, the camera could have been showing that
22        scene for a long time and it is only this bit that has
23        been recorded.
24   MR HICKS:    Again, the problem is that, if you have a very
25        bright area, the camera will adjust to the bright area
26        and the dark area becomes almost impossible to see.
27   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     That is peculiar to this
28        particular camera, is it?
29   MR HICKS:    No, that is peculiar to every close-circuit
30        television camera.      In fact, if you have ever tried to
31        do a wedding video, for instance, and there is a bright
32        window, it will make everything go blue.
33                (12.46.47)   This is Pennistone Road.     I think
34        that here again he has overridden the sequencer, because
35        he wants to see why all the people were getting off the
36        bus, and there are police officers there.         Again, he is
37        just screening the camera from south to north on
38        Pennistone Road.      I have not actually counted them, but
39        I have estimated that there is something like at least


                                       50
 1        50 shots from camera 5.
 2   MR BONE:     On this tape?
 3   MR HICKS:     Yes, on this tape.
 4   MR BONE:     There is another tape, A or B.
 5   MR HICKS:     If you think that it is relevant,          I will add
 6        them all up.
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:           I do not think that you need
 8        to bother about that.           I think that you have made the
 9        point.     Can we move on a bit nearer to the relevant
10        time?
11   MR JONES:     While that is being done, can I point you to
12        a couple of passages in Bichard's evidence to the
13        coroner.
14   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:           Have you referred to them in
15        your submissions?
16   MR JONES:     Yes.         Paragraph 28.    Four lines down on page 80,
17        Bichard says,          "The camera was not really being used as
18        much as it would normally be because of the substandard
19        picture.        It was just left in position".        Above that is
20        where he says it was giving              flare. Then on page 92 at
21        the foot of the page, he is              asked,"What do you say,
22        officer, so far as the ability of the camera to give you
23        an idea?        (A)     It will not give you a view of
24        overcrowding.          (Q) It would not be a sound judgment to
25        make any decision about overcrowding from the monitor.
26        (A) It would not be a sound judgment."
27                Then over at page 96,          "Do you maintain the view
28        that the zoom facility is such that it is not possible
29        to zoom in, so one can clearly identify a given
30        individual if one wishes to              do so?(A) Sir,   I am quite
31        happy with that comment, yes. When there is a group, a
32        large crowd, to pick out an individual would be
33        difficult.       (Q)     You can clearly zoom in so you can
34        clearly see the facial features, can you not?              (A)   I do
35        not think so, sir".
36                That is what we say, combined with the evidence
37        that you have been shown, gives a completely misleading
38        picture.    I have a passage in Mr Bichard's evidence.             It
39        is the passage on page 96 to which I have just referred.


                                            51
 1          At D: "Do you maintain the view that the zoom facility
 2          is set so that it is not possible to zoom in, so one can
 3          clearly identify a given individual if one wished to?
 4          (A) Sir, I am quite        happy with that comment, yes. (Q)
 5          You maintain that?         (A)     Yes."
 6                  Over the page at C, Mr King says,          "I cannot take
 7          that any further with y o u ."
 8   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          Where are we getting to now?
 9   MR HICKS:       I think that we have gone to the end of the
10          tape.     I was trying     to go further forward. It may          be
11          that I have not brought the later tape with              me.
12   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          What are you wanting to show
13          me?
14   MR HICKS:       You asked to see a bit further forward.
15   LORD   JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:            Yes,   I wanted to see what was
16          being recorded really between half-past-two and                three.
17   MR JONES:       It is almost entirely Leppings Lane, the entrance?
18   MR HICKS:       Yes.   That is not on this tape,         I beg your
19          pardon. This tape is concentrated on camera 5.
20   MR JONES:       I am fairly sure it is just really the
21          press outside the entrance of Leppings Lane turnstiles.
22          You can see gate C being opened, it shows all that.
23   MR KNOWLES:       It shows that it was a steady walking pace
24          through gate C.      It was not a crush or a rush.
25   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          Yes, I have seen that.
26                  Where do we pick up camera 5 again?           Is that when
27          the people are climbing over the fence at two minutes
28          past three?
29   MR HAMMOND:       15.02, yes.
30   MR JONES:       Then it stopped     at that position.       It was    frozen
31          at that position, because the officers say that they
32          thought it was a pitch invasion.             All you see is people
33          climbing over and pulling other people over.
34   MR HICKS:       This one is a copy of a copy.          This will
35          show us gate A, but the quality will obviously be less,
36          because this is a copy of the Yorkshire Television copy.
37                  If you would like to carry on, I will find the
38          relevant part of the tape.
39   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          I am not quite sure how much


                                              52
 1         more there is to deal with.      There is one question that
 2         I wanted to ask you about Mr Houldsworth.           On page 16
 3         of your submission you are dealing with the interview
 4         with Mr Houldsworth by Yorkshire Television. This is
 5         appendix 5.    You say in your submission,    "It
 6         corroborates Mr Houldsworth1s more recent evidence that
 7         all the cameras were working properly.       in interview, Mr
 8         Houldsworth refers to camera 1, in fact, this is camera
 9         5. This camera was variously described during the Taylor
10         inquiry and the inquest as a score-board camera."
11               Where do you get that from, because that is not my
12         understanding of what Mr Houldsworth is saying in this
13         interview?
14   MR HICKS:  The score-board camera and camera 5 are one and
15         the same.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Let us just find the passage.
17         He refers to camera 1, does he not?
18   MR JON ES: Y e s .
19   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I have to say that I think
20         you may be wrong about that.      It is in the interview
21        with Yorkshire Television.       It is the third page of his
22         interview.
23               "... I've linked the video inputs down to here so
24         that the policeman, Harold Guest and Wednesday's own
25         security man can see what the police are actually
26         looking at. We put it on to camera 1, which is the west
27         stand camera which overlooks the Leppings Lane end".
28         That is camera 1 and not camera 5.
29   MR HICKS:    I think he means camera 5, sir.
30   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I do not think that he does.
31               If we go on,   "... and you could see that the crowd
32         was building up. This kept continuing up to about
33         approximately two thirty, two thirty five      where we
34         could see that from that camera and also from the camera
35         that is part of the Wednesday’s own system, it overlooks
36         turnstiles A to G and gate C, that it was a very, sort
37         of abnormal build up". He is plainly referring here to
38         camera 1.
39               I think then we can skip on a bit. At the bottom,


                                      53
 1        "At approximately twenty-to-three, somewhere around
 2        about that region, we did notice that gate C was open
 3        and an influx of people came through the gate.
 4        Eventually the police got that under control by putting
 5        a police horse across gate C ..."      That is camera 1.
 6             Then he is asked,    " ... can you tell me what made
 7        you think it was abnormal?      What you saw on the
 8        monitors?   (A)   Well, what we saw on the monitors was
 9        the mass of humanity that was outside the gates and
10        looking from the monitors themselves and from the inputs
11        that were going through on the computer system that
12        there was no relationship between the two. There was,
13        there seemed to be less people as though t h e y ’d got only
14        a small crowd outside coming through the turnstiles.           So
15        that led us to believe, or led me to believe, that the
16        crowd outside were forcing so much pressure against the
17        entrances to the turnstiles, instead of being like an
18        orderly queue.    You d o n ’t look for the type of problem
19        that obviously did occur, but you could see that there
20        was a problem.    Now what the cause of that problem was I
21        honestly d i d n ’t know but I have my own thoughts that too
22        many people had come too late ..."      to see the game and
23        so on and so forth.
24             Then a little bit further on at page 7, he says,
25        "Well what I saw on the screens from both the camera on
26        A to G and from the police monitor that the others.        A
27        large build up of people outside Leppings Lane
28        turnstiles which sent very abnormal     ..."   This is
29        plainly camera 1 that he is talking about here.
30             A little further down,     "At about twenty-to-three,
31        somewhere in that region, gate C was opened, at the time
32        we d i d n 't know why it was opened ..."   He is seeing this
33        on the police relay through the club control room.
34   MS ADLINGTON: You could also see that on the Sheffield
35        Wednesday camera that was trained on the turnstile
36        areas.
37   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    Absolutely, but what he is
38        saying throughout this passage is that they are looking
39        at the Leppings Lane entrance, the turnstile entrance,


                                     54
 1        through the police camera 1 and their own camera.
 2               Then a little further on, on page 8, "It continued
 3        the same as it had before up to about I would say ten-
 4        to, five-to-three when we heard that gate C was asked to
 5        be opened by the police". Again, he is clearly talking
 6        about camera 1.      It goes on,   "It was opened and the flow
 7        of people came through.      It came through first fairly
 8        steadily.      It built up to a surge, died off for a short
 9        while and then it built up again and it built up then
10        and it was at that point that I left the room to go down
11        to the entrance, to the players'       entrance,   just to see
12        exactly what was happening in the central p e n s ."
13               All this for the reasons that I have indicated seem
14        to me quite clearly to be referring to police camera 1.
15   MR HICKS:    Yes.   I have to say that I have very little
16        knowledge of the club systems.
17   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Obviously,   I may have to ask
18        Mr Houldsworth about this, but it is actually quite an
19        important part of your submission that, actually, what
20        Houldsworth is saying is,     "I am looking at the police
21        relay of camera 5".     I do not think that he is saying
22        anything of the sort.
23   MR JONES:    I agree.
24   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     The only place where he does
25        come near that is in his comments on Bichard's evidence
26        at page 2.     He talks about Goddard.    This is at page 86
27        of your bundle.     "I was able to see what the police
28        could see on their monitors", and he specifically
29        remembers checking to see the state of pens three and
30        four when the order was given to open the gates.         "I
31        could see very clearly that the pens were full to the
32        point of overcrowding".
33               Correct me if I am wrong, but that is the only
34        place that I have picked up where Houldsworth says that
35        he could see pens three and four.
36   MR JONES:   Yes, unless, as we have thought, and we could
37        be wrong about it, there is a confusion between cameras
38        1 and 5.
39   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I do not think that there is


                                      55
 1        any confusion.     I think, if I may say so, it is a bit of
 2        wishful thinking.
 3   MR JONES:     If you are right, Lord Justice, then what you
 4        have pointed out is that there is no earlier specific
 5        reference by Roger Houldsworth to what he is now saying?
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Yes.   I shall obviously have
 7        to speak to him about this, but I just wanted to be sure
 8        that you, as it were, agree with me that what he appears
 9        to be saying, at any rate, to the Yorkshire Television
10        is reference to -----
11   MR JONES:     Unless there is the confusion which we have
12        discussed.     I cannot now remember what the source of the
13        belief is that there was.
14   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     It may be this comment that
15        he makes again, but I agree with you that that is,
16        obviously, an important thing.     I shall have to try to
17        clarify that when I see him.
18   MR KNOWLES:    Can I just draw one passage to your attention
19        from the interview and it is open to various
20        interpretations?     It is page 8 of the interview.     At the
21        top it begins,    " ... the ground from gate C which
22        relieved the pressure" and at the end of that long
23        extract, he says,    "... I left the room to go down to the
24        entrance, to the players'    entrance, just to see exactly
25        what was happening in the central pens". He is asked,
26        "Why did you do that?     (A) Because again from the police
27        system we could see that there was a ..."      Then there is
28        a break in the sense and then,    "and from the computer
29        system we could see how many that were supposedly to be
30        allowed in that end of the ground..."     Again, it is
31        ambiguous and you will have to ask him precisely what he
32        meant by that.     There he is referring to the pens and
33        what they can see on the police system. That is the
34        closest that he comes to saying in this interview that
35        he could see the pens.
36   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     You may be right.   I must
37        confess that I read that as being,    "Well, I could see
38        from the police things that they were all flooding in
39        through gate C and I knew how many thousands had come


                                      56
 1          through on my monitors and I put two and two together
 2          and thought I had better go and see what is happening".
 3          All this, in fact, is not as early as he seems to think,
 4          because he seems to get out on to the pitch when the
 5          game is called off.           I cannot quite remember where the
 6          control room i s .
 7   MR B O N E :   It is in the playe rs' tunnel.
 8   MR HICKS:           It is above the players'    tunnel in the
 9          south stand.         There are no windows.
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:             I follow that.    It is half
11          a minute to get out from there down on to the pitch?
12   MR HICKS:       I would think so.
13   MR HAMMOND:          He says,    "At that point I remember from the
14          number already displayed on the monitor ... from the
15          Leppings End turnstiles that a dangerous situation was
16          being created.           I left the room and went down to the
17         players' tunnel to the pitch and just as I did so the
18          referee stopped the match."
19   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:            That is what I am saying.       It
20          is a combination of what he sees on camera 1, coupled
21         with his knowledge of the figures from the computer that
22         makes him think there may be a dangerous situation.
23   MS ADLINGTON:          What Roger Houldsworth said in interview,
24          in fact, is that the club system was trained on the
25          turnstile area and gate C and the video on gate C showed
26         quite clearly the gate being opened.              I think those are
27          the scenes that he is referring to in the First Tuesday
28          interview.        He could see the opening of the gate on the
29          club system.
30   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:            I quite agree. That    is all   on
31          the compilation tape.          There are two views    on the
32          compilation tape, one from the police camera number 1
33          and one from the club camera.            The commentator says,      "We
34          are now going to look at another camera with the same
35          v ie w " .    I do not think that I have any more questions on
36          the videos.
37   MR HICKS:       This is, in fact, the little bit that we are
38          talking about.           (14.47.38).   This is from camera 1.       It
39          is in time-lapse mode, which is why it is flicking.


                                              57
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:           This was all on the compilation.
 2   MR HICKS:     Yes.     Of course, we are just coming up to the
 3        opening of gate C now.
 4   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:           I have seen all this.     Can
 5        we go to where it clocks on to camera 5 again?
 6   MR HICKS:     This is back on camera 5 .        (15.02.40)
 7   MR BONE:     My impression is that we have seen this on
 8        the compilation tape.
 9   MR HICKS:     You have, but the quality is not so good.
10   MR JONES:    The quality is dramatically different.
11   MR HICKS:     (15.02.57)     This is camera 5.
12   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:           There is a good deal of
13        flaring.        What is that?
14   MR HICKS:    That is flaring because the camera is bright.
15        Now you can see it coming in.           It is also in time-lapse
16        mode.    This is when he first puts the camera on and it
17        stays parked in that position.           I believe that this is
18        why he has picked it up now and why he leaves it there,
19        because he has to override the sequencer otherwise it
20        will switch off again, because he is looking to see
21        whether this is a pitch invasion or not.
22   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:           If he overrides the sequencer,
23        does it always go on to time lapse?
24   MR HICKS:    No, he has to select time lapse separately.
25        All the sequencer does is to select which cable the
26        signal comes from.
27   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:           He might select time lapse
28        if he wanted to have the evidence to prosecute somebody?
29   MR HICKS:    Yes.      It stays on there for quite a while.
30   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:           What do you want me to
31        conclude from this?
32   MR JONES:    That this is deliberately fixed upon an
33        area because the police think that there is a pitch
34        invasion. They think that it is worth recording because
35        they can identify faces.           Therefore, they knew that the
36        zoom facility, contrary to what Mr Bichard was saying,
37        was working perfectly, because at the time somebody took
38        the decision to say,       "We can record that and get useful
39        evidence from it."


                                           58
 1   MR HICKS:     This proves that the camera was working and the
 2        monitor was working.
 3   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Are there any zooms at this
 4        stage?
 5   MR HICKS:     I do not think that thee are in this particular
 6        section.    I think that it just stays there.      This goes on
 7        until,    I think, after 4 o'clock.
 8   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Just in that one fixed position?
 9   MR HICKS:  Yes.
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Is it right that as soon as it
11        switches on to camera 5, you have simply got this one
12        position, no zooming and no panning?
13   MR JONES:     Yes, presumably because people were then doing
14        other things.
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Presumably, they needed to record
16        it because they thought that it was a pitch invasion.
17   MR HICKS:     Bear in mind that it was in time-lapse mode
18        before he switched to camera 5, so, if you were busy, if
19        you were not particularly bothered -----
20   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        That looks like flaring again
21        to me.     (15.08.33)
22   MR HICKS:     Because he has gone in there and it is dark
23        now, the camera has adjusted to it.
24   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        All this was available on
25        the compilation tape, was it not?
26   MR JONES:      Yes, but we say in very much worse quality
27        than     that, which      has prompted   the jury's questions.
28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        That applies to what happened
29        before 15.02, does it not?
30   MR JONES:      Yes, but Ihave seen it and it is of very
31        poor quality and       I do not think that it is going   to help
32        us very much.
33   MR HICKS:     Whereas what we were trying to show you is that
34        there is a lot of footage before 15.02 which is of good
35        quality.
36   MR BONE:    From camera 5?
37   MR HICKS:     If I am not mistaken, that is the sort of
38        quality that is on the compilation tape. As you saw,
39        both before it and after it, there is better footage


                                         59
 1        than that.
 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I think that we are going to have
 3        to look at these in     our own time.   Unless there is any
 4        further point that you want to make on it, I think that
 5        we will move on.
 6   MR JONES:    If I can just make a single comment on
 7        Houldsworth, accepting the point that you make to us is
 8        correct and we have misunderstood it, we will say that
 9        the significance of Roger Houldsworth's evidence is that
10        he was visited by the police in 1989 and statements were
11        taken from him, but     he was not called before the
12        coroner's jury even     though his existence was   known and
13        he had been mentioned.
14   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     He had been known of
15        throughout.     He had been referred to in terms before
16        Lord Justice Taylor.
17   MR JONES:   Yes, and we say that he is a crucial witness,
18        because he had inspected that morning.
19   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I have your point on that
20        anyway.
21   MR HICKS:   Could I just make one point?     We were not
22        aware of Houldsworth and Houldsworth's significance
23        until the research for the Hillsborough programme
24        started.
25   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I follow that, Mr Hicks,
26        but, quite obviously, Lord Justice Taylor was aware of
27        Mr Houldsworth.     Whether the coroner was or not, I do
28        not know.
29   MR ADLINGTON:     Yes, sir, he was.
30   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Anyhow, there it is.     It is
31        a question of whether his evidence was seen to be
32        material at the time.
33               Can we go on to part two, so to speak, because in
34        many ways this is rather more complicated?
35               The point to which you are directing all this, as I
36        understand it, is (a) a criticism of the coroner's
37        decision to cut off at 3.15 and (b) the possibility
38        that, if he had not done that, there might have been a
39        verdict of neglect on the part of the emergency


                                      60
 1        services.     Is that right?
 2   MR JONES:     Yes, or the police or unlawful killing on the
 3        basis    of neglect.   It would     not be possible if such a
 4        verdict were returned, because of the way in which the
 5        coroner's rules are framed, to say who the jury had
 6        contemplated was ----
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     How could it be unlawful killing
 8        if you simply did not get there soon enough and did not
 9        try remedial equipment which was not available?         How can
10        that be unlawful killing?
11   MR JONES:     It would be unlawful killing on the basis     of
12        neglect. Again, the distinction we draw, and         it is as
13        important here as it was in relation to the first point,
14        is that Lord Justice Taylor found that no officer took
15        effective charge of the evacuation of the injured from
16        the pens.     We have summarised these findings at the top
17        of page 19.     There was no organised evacuation until
18        3.12, there was delay in activating the major accident
19        plan, there was no request for cutting gear, no co­
20        ordination of rescue efforts and there were cases where
21        the earlier provision of medical treatment might have
22        made a difference and more lives might have been saved.
23        Whether or not that justified one verdict or another by
24        the jury, we say was the part of the function of the
25        coroner's inquest under statute to determine those
26        questions, because death was caused in many instances,
27        as is now apparent, we say, at least from the evidence
28        of Dr Walker, by the failure to treat people at the
29        scene.
30   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     The cause of death is the
31        crushing.
32   MR JONES:     The medical cause, yes, but the question that the
33        jury had to answer under section 4 is not simply the
34        narrow medical question, but it is how he came by his
35        death.     Indeed, it was presumably in an attempt to
36        answer the generality of that question that the coroner
37        concentrated so much evidence upon questions,        such as,
38        for example, drink.     Seventeen pages of his summing up
39        were directed to questions about how people got to the


                                         61
 1        ground and why they were late, whether the cause of the
 2        incident was excessive consumption of alcohol, which was
 3        a recurring theme of the inquest, when found that it was
 4        irrelevant.
 5   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     He did not find that it was
 6        irrelevant.
 7   MR JONES:    Not irrelevant, but irrelevant on the question
 8        of causation.     We say that it is clear from the videos
 9        that you have seen of the press around Leppings Lane
10        terraces that it is the press of people, it is not the
11        press of unruly people.     There are sporadic instances as
12        Lord Justice Taylor points out.
13               To answer the question "How?" we argue that you
14        have to answer the following question: in any one
15        individual case, you have to look at the question of
16        causation, the substantial cause. There will be many
17        causes, but there are many instances which have come to
18        light since to which Dr Walker's evidence is important
19        and casts important light upon where you can clearly say
20        that a substantial cause of death was the fact that a
21        person was not treated.
22               The 3.15 cut off was chosen not because matters
23        after that could not be relevant in themselves, but
24        because the coroner said that the overwhelming weight of
25        the pathological evidence was that all those who died
26        had become rapidly unconscious and, having become
27        rapidly unconscious, death would have followed in a
28        matter of minutes. Therefore, there was no point in
29        examining any events after 3.15 because they could not
30        have been causative.
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Can I just take you up on that?
32        I am not sure that I have the coroner's ruling on this
33        other than is reflected in the Divisional Court.
34   MR JONES:   You have not got that in your papers, no.    It
35        is appendix 20.
36   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I may be quite wrong about it,
37        because I have not read it, but I thought that what the
38        coroner was saying was that, even though some people
39        died later, and it was obvious that some people did die


                                     62
 1        later, because we know that Lee Nichol died two days
 2        later and ---
 3   MR HICKS:     There was Tony Bland, the boy who was in coma
 4        for two ye a r s .
 5   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I was not thinking of him, I
 6        am afraid.
 7   MR HAMMOND:     Andrew Spearritt died in the evening.
 8   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     That is right, yes.     It
 9        was well known that those people died later, but I
10        thought that what he was saying was that the injuries
11        from which they died had been suffered by six minutes
12        past three and -----
13   MR JONES:     And that death was, therefore, inevitable.
14   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Therefore, the death was going
15        to happen.
16   MR JONES:     That is right.
17   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     You say, do you, that those
18        people might have been saved if help had come a few
19        minutes earlier?
20   MR JONES:     Yes, or if there had been better help and more
21        of it. The fact of the deaths is that of the 95 who died
22        only 14 ever got to hospital at all. We have examples,
23        and the examples are clear from Dr Walker and, in fact,
24        from Dr Wardrope's article in the British Medical
25        Journal,    that there were many cases where people were
26        unconscious who did, in fact, recover from the
27        unconsciousness and that the unconsciousness was not a
28        prelude to and inevitably followed by death.
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     That is clear from his evidence
30        at the inquest, is it not?
31   MR JONES:     Dr Wardrope's evidence at the inquest has a
32        number of flaws, but the justification for the cut-off
33        point was that the coroner said,       "We are not going to
34        investigate any question of how people were dealt with
35        at the ground after 3.15.        The reason we are not going
36        to do that is because they were all, effectively, dead
37        anyway."
38   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Well, they had received injuries
39        from which they died.


                                      63
 1   MR JONES:    Yes.     But people were simply carried across, as
 2        we know, to the gymnasium and a number of them were
 3        carried to the back of the Leppings Lane terraces, and
 4        they were left.       We do know that of a number of people
 5        who were unconscious some of them were revived at the
 6        scene by friends, others of them spontaneously recovered
 7        from unconsciousness ----
 8   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          That has been known throughout,
 9        has it not?
10   MR JONES:    The justification for the 3.15 point is that you
11        can be confident that, when people lost consciousness,
12        their deaths would have followed, normally within six
13        minutes, in some cases later, but it was inevitable.
14        What the new evidence shows, which we submit is
15        absolutely clear, is that people did recover from
16        unconsciousness if they had had the good fortune to be
17        treated. Some of those in hospital did, we know, recover
18        from unconsciousness and they were revived and were
19        restored to full health, others of them on the pitch,
20        who by accident had treatment, recovered, whereas
21        others, it appears a large quantity of the 95, were
22        simply left on the ground ----
23   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         These are a number of different
24        points.    I think, maybe, we should go through your
25        submissions and I will try to deal with some of the
26        points on which I want your help on.
27   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Can we go to paragraph 71
28        where you are dealing with the British Medical Journal
29        article?       You say,    "The coroner took the view that on
30        the overwhelming pathological evidence available to him
31        permanent irrecoverable damage had by then been suffered
32        by the deceased.          In November 1991 a very different
33        account occurred in the British Medical Journal written
34        by Mr Wardrope.       Many injured people taken to hospital
35        survived and recovered."
36               That did not appear for the first time, surely, in
37        November 1991.       That must have been apparent right at
38        the outset and, indeed, from Dr Wardrope's evidence to
39        the coroner.


                                          64
 1   MR JONES:     Dr Wardrope's evidence to the coroner, we say,
 2        does not make that clear.                It is, in fact, in itself
 3        highly misleading.             That is in flag 17.
 4   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:             Page 610 I have marked in
 5        your submissions.             This is appendix 7.     I think that Dr
 6        Wardrope's evidence appears in two pla c es .
 7                At G:   "Then within the next hour, how many patients
 8        approximately did you receive?               (A) 87 patients.    (Q) So
 9        you got more than half a day's work on average in an
10        hour?     (A)   Yes.         Of those patients, how many went to
11        the coronary care unit - I mean intensive care or
12        coronary care?         (A)    There were 17 patients who went to
13        intensive care units.             (Q)     So large a number?    (A)
14        Yes.     (Q)    In addition to that, there were also patients
15        who never made it to coronary care, unfortunately, who
16        were dead?       (A)     That is correct".
17                At the bottom of the page he deals with the
18        triaging thing.         Then he deals with the individual
19        cases.     It is clear,         I think, from that that some of
20        them were sent to the intensive care unit and some were
21        not.     I think that I am right in saying that four never
22        got to the intensive care unit, so nine or so went to
23        the intensive care unit.                At any rate, it seemed to me
24        to be reasonably clear from Wardrope's evidence.                  It may
25        be that you have to derive it from the way in which he
26        deals with it, but there were 17 patients that went to
27        intensive care or coronary care and of those eight or
28        nine died and by implication, therefore, the others did
29        not.
30   MR JONES:     What we say is significant is the way in which
31        the coroner dealt with t h i s . He referred first of all to
32        the statement. That is page 612 at E: "Have you got a
33        copy of your statement? (A)                Yes, I have".   That is a
34        statement that we have never seen and it has been
35        refused to Ann Adlington as recently as yesterday.                    The
36        coroner, on the basis of that statement, asks about, as
37        you point out, individual cases.                Then at page 616, he
38        says at D:      "I think you observed that from your
39        reconstruction of what you had seen. What was your


                                             65
 1        observation with regard to people who came in in cardiac
 2        arrest? That is what I want to ask.         (A)   Some people
 3        who came in in cardiac arrest, we were able to get their
 4        heart going, but, unfortunately,       in the three cases we
 5        did none of these patients survived. The longest that
 6        one survived was the young boy, Lee Nichol, who
 7        unfortunately was brain dead.        (Q)   Would it be fair to
 8        say that everyone who came in in cardiac arrest, in
 9        fact, died?   (A) Yes."
10               That is the summary of the evidence put forward to
11        Mr Wardrope. We know from his own article that there
12        were a large number of patients who came in who were, in
13        fact, unconscious ----
14   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     That does not mean to say that
15        they had cardiac arrest, does it?
16   MR JONES:   No, it does not. That is the point I make.
17        The coroner gives the impression, in our submission,
18        that people who are brought to the hospital, people with
19        cardiac arrest, are damaged. What he does not say,
20        because it completely undermines the unconsciousness
21        leading inevitably to death theory, is that there are a
22        number of people there who are unconscious who are
23        revived from unconsciousness.       Had that evidence been
24        given and had those facts been known, then the whole of
25        the 3.15 cut-off point would have been completely
26        undermined, because it would have become clear,
27        therefore, that unconsciousness did not necessarily and
28        inevitably lead to death.        It would have raised the
29        question: how were people treated who were unconscious
30        after the 3.15 cut off who did not get to hospital at
31        all?
32   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     But you would not go to
33        intensive care, would you, unless you were unconscious?
34   MR JONES:   We do not know. There were a lot of people
35        with broken bones.    There were some cases of collapsed
36        lungs, pneumothorax, caused by collapsed ribs.
37               If one hears about the 3.15 cut off and reads this
38        evidence of Dr Wardrope, you get the impression that
39        they were overwhelmed with numbers, the emergency plan


                                      66
 1        went into operation and that anyone who had signs of
 2        cardiac arrest died.     This is a complete
 3        misrepresentation, we argue, of the evidence not to
 4        point out and not to adduce evidence that some of those
 5        who survived were people who were unconscious, which is
 6        the clear implication of the evidence contained in the
 7        article, it emerges from Dr Walker's evidence and it
 8        also emerges from accounts which have now arisen in
 9        individual cases from people who were actually treated
10        at the ground itself.    All that evidence undermines and
11        demolishes the 3.15 cut-off period.
12             The point that I am very anxious to make, if I can,
13        is that at the mini inquests in 1990 summaries were
14        produced - witnesses were not cross-examined, but
15        summaries were produced - of the circumstances in which
16        people died; hostile or probing questions were not
17        allowed. The coroner indicated that the time for that
18        would come at the main inquest, which then started, as
19        we know, in late 1990.    It was at that point that the
20        coroner said that there are going to be no investigation
21        of the circumstances of individual deaths, how long
22        people were alive or how they were treated, because we
23        are stopping events at 3.15, and the reason that we are
24        stopping events at 3.15 is, as the Divisional Court
25        pointed out, that the overwhelming weight of the
26        pathological evidence is that those people who died had
27        died as a direct consequence of unconsciousness and,
28        once unconsciousness was caused before 3.15 in the
29        crush, that was the end of it.    The proper analysis of
30        the medical evidence, which was not adduced before the
31        jury - it may or may not have been in Dr Wardrope's
32        statement, but it is contained in his medical article
33        later and Dr Walker's evidence - is as one's common
34        sense would suggest very much more complicated.     There
35        is the example of a man called Spearritt ----
36   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    I am sorry, but, surely,
37        everybody appreciated, did they not, that people were
38        being taken to hospital, because they were alive, or it
39        was thought that they were alive, and it was hoped that


                                     67
 1        some of them would recover?      That is just a
 2        generalisation. There was no point in taking them to
 3        hospital if they had been certified dead.
 4   MR JONES: N o .
 5   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     This is why, in fact,
 6        most of the dead never got to hospital at all, as I
 7        understand it, they were certified dead at the ground.
 8   MR JONES:   It happened over a period of hours.       But our
 9        argument is that in a major disaster plan,       we would
10        argue that it is a basic entitlement that,       if you are
11        injured in an accident of this kind, you are not left            in
12        a mortuary to    be certified as dead.   There    should not be
13        an assertion made, perhaps, two hours later that a
14        person is dead when he has been left in a gymnasium or
15        in many cases at the back of the Leppings Lane terraces.
16        People were left there because they were unconscious in
17        many instances.     It is not known when they died.        The
18        people who are members of the Group find themselves in
19        this position. They were assured by the coroner that
20        their sons had lapsed into unconsciousness and died very
21        quickly and over the years it has come to light in a
22        variety of cases that that was not the position, because
23        people were treating people at the ground later, some of
24        them were revived later at the ground itself by people
25        who might have been friends, they might have been police
26        officers, they might have been ambulancemen, in many
27        cases people were revived, because assistance was given
28        to them.     In other cases, all they know is that their
29        sons were pronounced dead, it might have been an hour,
30        two hours or three hours after the event, who might,
31        because we know it happened in a number of cases, have
32        survived if they had even been put in a recovery
33        position or if the major accident disaster plan had
34        worked promptly or if the ----
35   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I am sorry to stop you, but one
36        still has to look at the problems in the context of what
37        is going to happen. How is this going to affect a
38        verdict by the coroner?     This is what troubles me.       One
39        might take a particular instant - I think that there is


                                      68
 1        one where you say that the unfortunate young man was not
 2        put in the recovery position.     Because collectively,    I
 3        suppose, the police, the ambulance services, the St
 4        John's Ambulance or, indeed, anyone else who happened to
 5        know anything about first aid, did not put that person
 6        in the recovery position when they might have done - I
 7        think that there is a case of somebody who swallowed his
 8        tongue, is there not, which is one of the reasons why
 9        you put people in the recovery position, as I understand
10        it - you could not possibly suggest that failure to do
11        that would amount to unlawful killing.
12   MR JONES:   We do not know what the jury would have thought.
13   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     No, but I have to address
14        these problems.   It is not any good saying,   "I don't
15        know what the jury would have made of it".     I have to
16        see whether or not there is a reasonable possibility,      I
17        think maybe that that is the lowest one can put it, that
18        some other verdict might have been given.
19   MR JONES:   We would argue that, for example, under the
20        judicial review procedure, it would be open to the court
21        to say that the verdicts in this case have been procured
22        by fraud, suppression of evidence or insufficiency of
23        inquiry. We cannot say that the evidence would have been
24        different. We are not going to reconvene a new inquest,
25        a new poor substitute, but we are going to strike it
26        down, because it has been procured by the suppression of
27        evidence. That in itself is a function which we argue
28        the law ought to assume in this case, where there is
29        clear evidence which was not put before the lawyers or
30        the jury that people died in circumstances other than
31        rapid unconsciousness followed by rapid death.
32   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I see the way in which you put
33        it, but, in fact, it was known, as we have already said
34        in two cases, that they were not dead immediately.
35   MR JONES:   But the coroner did not even allow the jury
36        to hear that. Those could have been two freak cases.
37   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Does that not emerge from
38        Dr Wardrope's evidence?     I have only looked at one or
39        two of these body files.     If you look at page 596, Mr


                                     69
 1        Hammond, the summary says that he died in the general
 2        hospital.
 3   MR JONES:    We know in the case of Mr and Mrs Hammond's
 4        son that the jury were told that he was brain dead, that
 5        he was actually dead at the ground. We now know from Dr
 6        Walker's evidence that he actually treated Philip
 7        Hammond and that his heart was beating. We know that his
 8        heart was restarted, that he survived for a time, but
 9        later died. We know that now as a result of Dr Walker's
10        evidence, but Mr and Mrs Hammond were told, when they
11        could not cross-examine, that he was brain dead at the
12        ground.    When people find out that they have been misled
13        in that way, then there is a legitimate interest in our
14        submission in saying that there should be a judicial
15        examination into why that happened.
16               Of course, the 3.15 cut off was not imposed at the
17        time of the mini inquests, that there was no cross-
18        examination. The 3.15 cut off point was imposed at the
19        time of the beginning of the main inquest.         Therefore,
20       what happened at the main inquest was that you will find
21       days and days of evidence asking people how they had
22       travelled to the ground, how they got across the
23       Pennines, what did they do before they went to the game,
24       did they walk about, how much did they have to drink,
25        how much did other people have to drink, yet by the time
26        the individual circumstances of their deaths came about,
27        which is what the families wanted to discover, the
28        coroner says,   "No more: 3.15.      You cannot hear about
29        it".    So Mr and Mrs Hammond's case is a very good
30        example. Dr Slater positively finds that there was brain
31        death at the ground itself and Mr Frazer expresses
32        reassurance on the part of the family for being told
33        that (page 600), but Dr Walker, who is a crucial player
34        in these events, now turns out to have actually
35        succeeded in getting his heart working again at the
36        hospital and he survived.        The family say,   "Why were we
37        not told that?"    The answer is they conclude, as did all
38        the other families,   "We were not told that, because it
39        did not fit the 3.15 death period, and the 3.15 cut-off


                                      70
 1        point was extraordinarily convenient to all the South
 2        Yorkshire authorities who would not have had to pay any
 3        damages for pain and suffering". That is what they think
 4        and they are entitled to think that.
 5   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I see that, but it is a little
 6        surprising in those circumstances, is it not, if the
 7        summary produced actually records that he died in
 8        hospital?     That is presumably based on the fact that he
 9        was treated in hospital, as we know.
10   MR JONES:     We know now, yes.
11   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        We knew at the time, did we not?
12   MRS HAMMOND:     He says that he was probably brought in, had
13        no cardiac activity and taken straight to the mortuary.
14   MR JONES:     That is what Dr Slater said.
15   MR HAMMOND:    What you have to think about - and I am just
16        talking about Phil now - is that all the evidence that
17        they brought up about Phil was to say that he was dead
18        before he left the ground.          They had four witnesses to
19        say that Phil was alive, he had a pulse, but they did
20        not put any of the ambulancemen or policemen before the
21        jury to say that he was alive. All that was said to Dr
22        Wardrope, as you can see on page 76, is,          "Can you give
23        me your best guess?"     Dr Wardrope was not even there
24        when Philip got admitted.
25   MR JONES:     It was Dr Walker who treated him and said,
26        "and succeeded in restoring heart and breathing".
27   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Can we. go back to the question
28        that I asked you earlier?           I quite understand the
29        anxiety to know precisely when somebody died and in what
30        circumstances, but let us assume that all this was
31        presented to the jury that, in fact, it was correct that
32        he died in hospital as the summary indicates and that Dr
33        Slater's opinion that he died before he got there was
34        wrong.     How is that going possibly to affect any inquest
35        verdict that could be given?
36   MR JONES:     If that case, taken together with others,
37        establishes a pattern of systematic misleading of
38        individual relatives, then, first of all, if the matter
39        went back by way of judicial review, it would be open to


                                         71
 1          the High Court to say,       "This has been procured by fraud
 2          and we strike down the verdict".
 3   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          That is a very strenuous thing
 4          to say, Mr Jones - fraud by the coroner.
 5   MR JONES:       One of the difficulties that we have is that
 6          we do not know precisely what the coroner knew.           If I
 7          can give an example, the coroner is saying,        "Have you
 8          seen a copy of your statement?" and Dr Wardrope says,
 9          "Yes".        We have asked for a copy of that statement and
10          we have       not been given it.
11   LORD    JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       That is probably because
12          Dr Wardrope has not consented to it being given to you.
13   MR JONES:       You are right, that is the position.
14   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          Then in those circumstances, the
15          police take the view, rightly or wrongly, that they
16          should not hand it over.        You may say that that is
17          wrong, but there is no reason why I should not see the
18          statement and I shall look at it.        All I am saying is
19          this.        It seems to me at the moment to be a long shot
20          from saying,       "OK, Dr Slater was wrong when he said that
21          this boy had died before he got to hospital; the summary
22          was, in fact, right that he died in hospital; we now
23          know that that is almost certainly correct, because we
24          have Dr Walker saying so" to saying that the coroner
25          fraudulently suppressed that evidence.         It is an
26          allegation of fraud.
27   MR JONES:       I    do not know how much evidence the coroner had
28          and how       much he was given by the police officers who
29          were giving him information, because the coroner's
30          questions can only be as good as the information that he
31          is given. One of the questions that arises in this case
32          is this.       Dr Walker's evidence is plainly primary
33          evidence of medical care.          It is plainly as good as any
34          of that which was called by the pathologists.           It was
35          plainly relevant to at least two of the deaths.           It was
36          also relevant to the findings that Lord Justice Taylor
37          had made about the delay in the implementation of the
38          major disaster accident plan.
39   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Why was it relevant to that?


                                          72
 1   MR JONES:   Because he says that it was not running properly,
 2        as I understand it.     That is Dr Walker's evidence.     But
 3        his evidence is plainly relevant to the question of
 4        treating people who died, treating people in hospital
 5        who could be named and identified.       One would have
 6        thought that his evidence would have been primary
 7        evidence to be adduced and put before the jury. He had
 8        actually been commended and praised by Dr Wardrope, as
 9        you have seen.     He had been asked to make a statement
10        for the inquiry which he did. As we know, it is included
11        in this bundle.     When you find that he is treating
12        people, he has got complaints about the way in which the
13        system operated, he gives evidence that there were
14        people who were revived in a number of cases, that he
15        tried hard in others but failed, and he criticises the
16        way in which there was a response to the emergency, then
17        the families say,    "What is the explanation for him not
18        being called?     What is the explanation for Dr Wardrope
19        only being directed to the question of coronary cases
20        who did all die rather than to the question of
21        unconscious patients, many of whom were revived, which
22        automatically leads to the question: what would have
23        happened to people who had been treated medically or
24        taken to hospital rather than left on a slab in the
25        gymnasium or at the back of the terraces for several
26        hours?"   In those circumstances, over the years, as more
27        and more facts come to light, the families say,
28        "Everything we now discover tends to repudiate the
29        significance of the 3.15 cut off".       Everything suggests
30        that the position was more complicated in a number of
31        individual cases.     People have come to light who have
32        said that in the case of Kevin Williams, at about ten-
33        to-four, he said "Mum".
34   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     That came to light much later.
35   MR JONES:   That came to light in 1991, certainly not before
36        the inquest. That was between the inquest and the 1993
37        investigation.     There are other cases which we have seen
38        and which we produce here.       So many of them, therefore,
39        go to show that the position is more complex.       The


                                      73
 1        people in the Family Support Group, who are not people
 2        who are difficult or subversive or hostile by character
 3        to authority, say,   "We can only conclude that this
 4        evidence was not put either to the coroner or by the
 5        coroner to the jury, because it suggested fault on the
 6        part of a large number of people", and they feel that
 7        they have been deceived by not having the investigation
 8        into the circumstances of their individual relative's
 9        death disclosed. Where they were not given information,
10        it is not surprising that, as over the years different
11        things come to light of which Dr Walker is a conspicuous
12        example, they say,   "Well, why was it not?"   They
13        conclude, in my submission rightly, that it is because
14        an attempt was made to present only such evidence as
15        presented an orderly and quick and simple position of
16        them.
17   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    Can we deal with some of the
18        specific points then that you raise?    So far as Dr
19        Wardrope's evidence is concerned,   I think that we have
20        dealt with that.   It seems to me apparent from what he
21        said at the inquest that there were a number of people
22        who went to the intensive care and not all of them died.
23   MR JONES:    Yes, but you have heard my argument about that.
24   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    You say that, when you look at
25        the article, it is apparent that the people who went to
26        the intensive care were all unconscious.
27   MR JONES:    No, a large number of those who were unconscious
28        actually survived.    In the Northern General Hospital
29        there were 13 patients with cardiac arrest who died.
30        There were, however, ten unconscious and convulsing, two
31        on ventilation, a number of them went to the intensive
32        care unit and to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital and a
33        large number of them were discharged and recovered.       For
34        example, why could the jury not have been referred to
35        this table very simply at the bottom of page 620, where
36        it shows that 88 people went to the Northern General
37        Hospital?
38   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    They were told that 87 people
39        went.


                                     74
 1   MR JONES:   Thirteen with cardiac arrest effectively died.
 2        That is the bit that the coroner concentrates on.
 3   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Four are dead on arrival,
 4        seven, mortuary after attempted resuscitation (that is
 5        11) and two in intensive care unit after resuscitation.
 6        Then there are ten unconscious and convulsing and they
 7        go to intensive care ----
 8   MR JONES:   And ventilation.
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     And ventilation.
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I quite agree with you that there
11        is more detail in this, but I thought that one could
12        more or less spell this out.     It is true that it is not
13        put in quite such a clear way, but it     seemed to me that
14        by reading Wardrope's evidence in the way in which I
15        have suggested to you you can read it, you certainly get
16        the impression that a number of people who were taken to
17        the intensive unit certainly came     out of it.
18   MR JONES:   Yes.   I am sure there is an   example of this with
19        someone who had pneumothorax, the puncture of a lung by
20        a rib, and there were some people who had been hit on
21        the head and there were people with broken arms when
22        they were pushed up against the ----
23   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I do not think that they
24        would have gone into intensive care.
25   MR JONES:   Whatever, but, when the jury were being told
26        that for those who had died death was inevitable after
27        they became unconscious,    surely it would have completely
28        undermined that to say,    "Did you have unconscious
29        patients?" to which the answer would have been "Yes, and
30        they were treated and they survived".        Because the whole
31        theory of the 3.15 cut off is based upon the theory
32        that, once you are unconscious, you have had it.
33   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I am not sure that that quite
34        represents it, does it?     I thought that, once you had
35        had intermittent crushing for a period of four to six
36        minutes, or whatever it was, first of all,
37        unconsciousness would arise very early on, in a matter
38        of seconds, and, provided that that crushing was
39        continued for that length of time, then death was


                                      75
 1        inevitable.
 2   MR JONES:   Yes .
 3   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I know that there is some
 4        dispute between the pathologists as to how long that
 5        should be.     The evidence before Lord Justice Taylor was
 6        the same as the evidence at the inquest that it was four
 7        to six minutes.
 8   MR HICKS:   One of our contentions is that there are
 9        two types of crush injury: there is traumatic asphyxia
10        and there is crush asphyxia.    One is, obviously, fatal
11        and the other one is a recoverable situation.
12   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    It depends how long it goes
13        on for.
14   MR HICKS:   Exactly, and the severity of it.   One of the
15        best definitions that I have heard for traumatic
16        asphyxia is if you are, say, working at the bottom of a
17        lift shaft and the lift falls on you, it is a sudden
18        impact, it also stays there and, obviously, the person
19        is crushed beyond recovery.
20   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    I appreciate that there are
21        differences.    I think that the cause of death was given
22        as crush asphyxia.
23   MR HICKS:   No, in most cases it is traumatic and we would
24        expect it to be the other way, because, even with the
25        enclosure, there was still a possibility for certain
26        people to move. As we know, some people were washed out
27        through the emergency gate.                     is a good
28        example.   Under those circumstances, we would have
29        expected crush asphyxia more than traumatic asphyxia.
30   MR JONES:   Can I ask you to look at paragraph 93 of our
31        submissions, which we argue is a very clear example?        ]
32        spoke to Mr Spearritt about four weeks ago.     "Mr
33        Spearritt was in pen four with his son, Adam, who died
34        in intensive care.    Now, Mr Spearritt arrived at the
35
36

38
39


                                     76
 1        made a full recovery. There is just no evidence as to
 2        what happened to him between 3.06 and 5 pm.       The medical
 3        records are completely silent about how it happened."
 4               We argue, therefore, that there were a number of
 5        people who were assumed to be dead and were taken to one
 6        of the areas which was set aside for dead bodies.
 7        Because of what happened in other cases, it is
 8        reasonable to conclude that Mr Spearritt was also left
 9        for dead outside Leppings Lane stand or in the
10        gymnasium. So here is a man who gets to hospital and
11        around 5 pm
12
13   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:
14   MR JONES:   Yes, he did.
15   MR HICKS:
16
17   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:
18
19   MR JONES:   Yes, exactly.
20   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Presumably, that was known
21        to everybody.
22   MR JONES:   The jury were not told, because the jury were
23        not given evidence about what happened to these people
24        after 3.15. The jury just were not told that. They were
25        told that people who became unconscious died, therefore,
26        we do not need to examine the causes of death after
27        3.15, because everything causative has happened before.
28        We know that there are a number, of who Mr Spearritt is
29        one,
30   MR KNOWLES:   I think that Mr Spearritt's evidence at the
31        inquest, because he was with his son, who also died, was
32        very much focused on his son and his attempts to get a
33        police officer to help.
34   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Absolutely. The whole
35        concentration was on the people who died. Therefore, as
36        I understand it, no one went into the circumstances of
37        those who survived.
38   MR JONES:   That is our complaint, because the fact that
39        people did survive having been unconscious was known to


                                      77
 1        people and undermined by itself the point about the 3.15
 2        cut off, which was that people were then irretrievably
 3        dying or irretrievably injured and ----
 4   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Only if they had been crushed
 5        for a sufficient length of time.     If they had not
 6        been crushed for that length of time, then they were
 7        able to recover.
 8   MR JONES:   How do we know that those who were dead had
 9        been crushed for that length of time?     Only because in
10        the end they were dead, so people assumed that they must
11        have been crushed for that length of time.
12   LORD JUSTICE   STUART-SMITH: They were not crushed once they
13        emerged from the pens, were they?
14   MR JONES:   No, they were not.    If we take Mr Spearritt as
15        an example, all we know is that he was unconscious and
16        lying down and taken to hospital at 5 o'clock, so there
17        is a two-hour gap when he is unconscious. The question
18        is posed, therefore, how many of the 95 people who died
19        were left unconscious and died not because death was
20        inevitable, but because, like Mr Spearritt, they could
21        have been revived or treated but were not, because they
22        were just left lying in piles of bodies?
23   LORD JUSTICE   STUART-SMITH: You may be right, but,   as I
24        understand it, what was happening both at the    Leppings
25        Lane end and the gymnasium and I think also in the bit
26        by the south stand where the fire brigade set up a sort
27        of clearing station, was that ambulance people and
28        doctors were triaging these various people. Dr Ashton
29        was one of the people who was at Leppings Lane and he
30        says that the important thing to do was to decide who
31        was dead and, therefore, there was no point in sending
32        them to hospital, and those who were still alive who
33        might be recoverable.     It is obvious - or at least it
34        seems obvious to me - that the people who were sent to
35        hospital were by and large people who it was thought
36        might survive.     They would not have been sent to
37        hospital otherwise.
38   MR JONES:   No one called any evidence about this.
39   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     It seems to me to be self-


                                      78
 1          evident.
 2   MR JONES:      We have cases which have come to light
 3          since, and Kevin Williams is a very good example. He is
 4          convulsing and he is actually heard to be talking.
 5   MR HICKS:      Can I give the example of Roger Ball?    I know
 6          Roger Ball personally, so I know a little bit more about
 7          the story than what is actually in here.      It could be
 8          argued that, had Roger Ball not had the good fortune to
 9          be seen by one of the mines rescue people, that he also
10          would have been a casualty.      He did not go to hospital.
11          He was crushed, he was taken out through the terrace and
12          was, in fact, put at the back of Leppings Lane, where he
13          was effectively laid with a number of bodies (we are not
14          exactly sure how many).     He is a good example of someone
15          who could well have been a fatality, had it not been for
16          the fact that this mines rescue person              must be
17          the same fellow - saw a tiny bubble in the corner of his
18          mouth. They were actually looking for a friend of theirs
19          who was    missing. They were members of a mines rescue
20          team, so they had first-aid knowledge and they revived
21          Roger Ball.
22   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       They slapped him on the face.
23          He did not actually even have mouth-to-mouth
24          resuscitation, did he?
25   MR HICKS:      I do not know in detail.
26   LORD   JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Ball, himself, says that he
27          recovered consciousness, someone was slapping him in the
28          face.     I think that that is
29   MR HICKS:      That is right, who I believe is a member of
30          a mines rescue team.     There is an argument that Ball
31          could have gone the other way, he could have slipped
32          into deeper unconsciousness and, perhaps, expired.
33   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Possibly, but Ball is obviously
34          somebody who was not crushed for a sufficient length of
35          time to make him die.
36   MR HICKS:      No, and again this is the argument which has
37          been put forward. There may have been other people who
38          were not crushed to the definition of traumatic
39          asphyxia, who similarly did not receive treatment and,


                                        79
 1        therefore, died.
 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     On the treatment that they
 3        received,    I thought that the evidence, particularly
 4        before Lord Justice Taylor, was that, basically, the
 5        first aid that could be given was cardiac massage and
 6        mouth—to—mouth resuscitation, possibly some oxygen as
 7        well, but, basically, that was the first aid that was
 8        needed.     There may be instances, but, if so, I have not
 9        picked them up, because I have not been through all the
10        body files that the police have, where somebody did not
11        have mouth-to-mouth resuscitation or cardiac massage
12        tried, possibly because it was quite obvious that the
13        person was dead.     I certainly have the impression that
14        anybody who was unconscious and believed to be alive
15        received resuscitative first-aid treatment and, in a
16        sense, Mr Ball is an example of this, although the
17        first-aid treatment that he appears to have received was
18        no more than being slapped about the face.
19        Unfortunately,   I was not looking for this point when I
20        went through the evidence before Lord Justice Taylor,
21        because I did not get your submissions on this.     My
22        recollection is that some of the witnesses there
23        actually also said that they had been unconscious and
24        that they had recovered.     It has been known and, as it
25        seems to me, quite clear from the word "go" that not
26        everyone who was unconscious died.
27   MR JONES:   But it was not presented to the jury.
28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    I see that, but the
29        difficulty is that people make assumptions in the
30        presentation of evidence - obviously I have not formed
31        any view about this and that is why I am asking you
32        these questions - and it does not seem to me that it
33        follows that, because this point is not brought out that
34        people were unaware of it.
35   MR JONES:   They were aware of it in certain instances, but
36        the complaint that we make - these we understand are
37        your terms of reference - is that there is new evidence
38        available which was not available to the coroner or to
39        the coroner's jury and that the 3.15 cut-off point


                                     80
 1        prevented the jury from hearing it.            in my submission,
 2        it does not matter whether or not some people might have
 3        known about it, the point of the inquest was to find out
 4        how and the point should have been presented to the
 5        jury. The jury were told,           "You take it from me that any
 6        events causative in any of these 95 cases finish at
 7        3.15.      You are not allowed to investigate it because it
 8        is so clear beyond all doubt that we are not
 9        investigating after that".           That is what is wrong.   It
10        is not whether or not some people might have known it or
11        known it in individual cases, it is that the matter was
12        not presented and investigated.
13   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         And that is, in effect, a
14        fraudulent concealment.
15   MR JONES:     Yes, we say that it is on the part of we know
16        not whom, but what we do know is that the coroner was
17        assisted by, and Lord Justice Taylor makes the point,
18        over 400 officers of the West Midlands Police. Those
19        people are the people who are concerned with the sifting
20        of evidence.          In the same way that Houldsworth's
21        evidence has not been presented to the jury neither has
22        Dr W a l k e r 's .
23   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         There are thousands of witnesses
24        whose evidence has not been given.
25   MR JONES:     But these two are central.        Houldsworth's
26        evidence is directed to the point, as the coroner
27        himself says, that is probably the most critical
28        question in the case.
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Let    us not go over the
30        video again.
31   MR JONES:     Houldsworth's evidence, had it been presented
32        even to the coroner, we submit, would have clearly
33        undermined the very basis of his 3.15 cut-off point.
34                          (Adjourned for a Short Time^
35   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Mr Hicks, Mr Hammond and
36        Mrs Hammond, you may not have appreciated the way in
37        which I am approaching this matter.           I think that
38        counsel realise that any argument which is put forward
39        has to be tested and that I put forward to them problems


                                          81
 1        which occur to me so that they can either deal with them
 2        or not deal with them as the case may be.      You may not,
 3        perhaps, have appreciated the fact that I am not going
 4        through all the facts in the written submissions,
 5        because I have got them in writing.      I am really only
 6        dealing with certain points where I     feel that I need    to
 7        test the     argument to make sure that it stands up.      I am
 8        sure that you probably do appreciate that.
 9                You may have got the impression that I am being a
10        bit tough on Mr Jones.     I usually am tough on Mr Jones.
11        The whole point of an exercise of this sort is for me to
12        test the     arguments, test the points that are being put
13        forward.      If I just simply sit here like a dummy and
14        accept everything that is said, it is not going to help.
15        The arguments have to stand up to criticism and scrutiny
16        and that is what it is all about.
17                I hope that you have not got any wrong impression.
18   MR HICKS:     Your perception is very well founded, sir.
19   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Anyhow, that is what I am trying
20        to do.     I am trying to test the points that are being
21        made.     If I perceive weaknesses in the argument, then
22        they have to be dealt with.      If they are not dealt with,
23        then it is a weakness in your case.      If they are dealt
24        with, then I am satisfied.
25   MR JONES:     One of the concerns that we do have about this,
26        and I am sure that you probably share it in a way, is
27        that we are in a curious legal position.      The scrutiny
28        is obviously informal and it follows no statutory
29        procedure or precedent, so far as I am aware.      We
30        submitted a lot of this material last April, of course,
31        to the then Secretary of State and we have presumed that
32        that material would have been supplied to, perhaps, the
33        coroner or the South Yorkshire Police or whatever so
34        that they could make comments on it.      I think we also
35        assume that you are obviously making inquiries yourself
36        of the South Yorkshire Police and, perhaps, also the
37        coroner and, perhaps, also others.      It is our submission
38        that we ought to be allowed to see or to know, so to
39        speak, the position being taken or the evidence being


                                      82
 1        offered by other people whose interests might be hostile
 2        to those of the Group who are making representations to
 3        you.   It would obviously be unsatisfactory in our
 4        submission if at the end of the inquiry there were a
 5        ruling or a recommendation by yourself, made upon the
 6        basis of material on which we had not had the
 7        opportunity to comment.      Our submission that full
 8        disclosure is important is, I think, probably the
 9        sharper because the way in which the inquest was handled
10        there was this very tight control of information so that
11        the families were given very little information indeed.
12        I do not know whether it is your intention to disclose
13        to us material.
14   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I went to Hillsborough last
15        Wednesday and, obviously,     I saw the police. They, in
16        fact, asked me the same question.      I said, no, I was not
17        going to give them an opportunity to comment on all the
18        evidence. They did initially,     I think, send some
19        comments on what had been put to the Home Secretary.
20   MR BONE:    Yes, they did.
21   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      It was really commenting on
22        the questions raised by the television thing, because it
23        was the television programme which sparked this off.
24        This is not a public inquiry, it is not a court of
25        inquiry, it is a scrutiny and, therefore,     I have to look
26        at what is put forward as fresh evidence.      I, obviously,
27        have to test it to see whether it is credible, and
28        rather on the Ladd v Marshall principles to see whether
29        it would have any effect. That is really what I am
30        doing.    In some cases,   I may have to go back to the
31        police for an explanation or I may have to go to them to
32        find out how certain things were done.     I would not
33        necessarily think that I should come back to you and say
34        that that is what has been done otherwise the thing will
35        never end.
36               If there are clearly controversial matters on
37        issues which I think could affect the outcome of the
38        various proceedings and so on, which can only be tested
39        by cross-examination and so on, that is a different


                                      83
 1        matter.     For example, when I see Mr Houldsworth, who I
 2        intend to see,    I certainly do not intend to throw him
 3        open to cross-examination by either you or the police or
 4        anything of the sort.     I shall ask him questions.     I
 5        think that probably his evidence will be available at
 6        the end of the day to see what he had really said.       We
 7        have much of it already, but I have indicated to you
 8        that there are problem areas in his evidence which need
 9        to be cleared up.     I do not envisage at the moment
10        either going to the police about everything that has
11        been said on your behalf or, if I ask the police for
12        clarification of various things, that I will necessarily
13        come and tell you about that either.
14               I quite understand that you might like it to be
15        otherwise, but, frankly,    I do not see that that is my
16        function.     I think that the situation will never end if
17        that is the position.     As I say, it is not a public
18        inquiry and it is not an adversarial system.      It is an
19        inquisitorial system by me to see if there is evidence
20        such that I should advise the Secretary of State to do
21        something about it.
22               I think that it is quite clear to me that I will
23        need to look at some of the material available in the
24        police archives.     If I need to have a further input from
25        you or any of the supporters, then I shall ask for it.
26        I do not know whether you have been supplied with any of
27        what the police call "body files".
28   MR JONES:   We have had a few.
29   MS ADLINGTON: We have 16 in total.
30   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     You know the sort of form that
31        they take.
32   MR HICKS:      I have my two daughters' ones there.   They have
33        just arrived.
34   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Maybe you have not had a chance
35        to look at them yet.
36   MR HICKS:    I have had a look at one.
37   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Basically, what they do is this.
38        I do not know if I will get it in the right sequence.
39        There is the summary which is prepared by the police


                                      84
 1        officer who gave evidence at the mini inquest, there is
 2        a continuity sheet, one example of which is already in
 3        your bundle, which seeks to trace the time that they
 4        left home, which probably is not particularly important,
 5        but really from the time they arrived at the stadium, to
 6        trace it right through from the disaster, the crushing,
 7        the removal, who attended them, where they were taken,
 8        when they were certified dead, when they were identified
 9        and so on. I have seen one or two of those.        Obviously,
10        a great deal of detailed investigation went into the
11        preparation of those.      In many ways, they are very
12        remarkable. They are supported by the witnesses'
13        statements which are on the file. Again, you will have
14        seen some examples of those.        You probably will not have
15        seen all of them.      Then there is fairly graphic
16        evidence, which I think Inspector Latham dealt with
17        mainly, at the mini inquests, where people have been
18        identified from various video material, photographs and
19        so on and traced from positions in the crowd, being seen
20        running across, and you get instances of police officers
21        being able to identify themselves carrying a stretcher
22        or something of that sort, and then they are traced
23        through.      In all these cases where there are queries
24        about them,     I will, obviously, look at the body files
25        and see.      I think that this is one of the points that I
26        wanted to take you up on.        It is the case of Roberts.
27   MR JONES:   Yes,   I was just about to turn that up.     It
28        is at paragraph 84, page 21.        It is in flag 12.
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      The point about this is that
30        I was a bit troubled, when I read your submission,
31        obviously, but, when I looked at the material, it seemed
32        to me to be reasonably clear that Police Constable
33        Wadsworth was mistaken in thinking that it was Mr
34        Roberts that he had dealt with.        I will tell you why I
35        think that.     It is the penultimate page of his
36        handwritten statement.
37               "I then looked over to the other side of the
38        driveway where by now 8 to 10 apparently dead bodies
39        were laid out.     I saw a police woman knelt down giving


                                      85
 1        cardiac massage to one of the bodies which had been
 2        presumed dead. An ambulanceman was also just attending
 3        the same person and I went over and commenced giving
 4        mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to the man with the aid of
 5        a resus-aid".    I do not quite know what that is.     "This
 6        continued for about ten minutes while the ambulanceman
 7        and another attending doctor fitted up a drip on his
 8        arm. Prior to being placed in an ambulance, it was
 9        stated that he had pulse".
10               If he was placed in an ambulance, he, presumably,
11        must have been taken to hospital.     I think that that is
12        evident from what he says.     I cannot trace any record of
13        Mr Roberts having gone to hospital.
14   MR JONES:   No, but that recalls to me what Dr Wardrope said -
15        and the coroner was at pains to adduce this evidence -
16        that the paperwork was in a mess at the hospital.
17   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:   At least they knew who the
18        people were who went to hospital.
19   MR JONES:   Yes, but, perhaps, at what time or ----
20   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    I have looked through
21        W ardrope1s evidence.   He deals with every single one of
22        the people who went to hospital and died.
23   MR JONES:   You mean in the summaries of the evidence given
24        at the beginning?
25   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:   No, it is page 610.      At page
26        613 he deals with the people who were taken to hospital.
27        At page 612 he starts off.     There you have Lee Nichol,
28        who is number 2, and then you go through them.       You will
29        find that in the next three pages he deals with Hammond,
30        Barry Bennett, Victoria Hicks, Stephen Harris, Alan
31        Spearritt, Gary Jones, Stephen O'Neil, Paul Brady, John
32        Gill Hooley, Steele, Thomas and Arthur Horrocks.       Those
33        are all the people who were taken to that hospital who
34        died and Roberts is not one of them.     I know that he
35        says subsequently that he identified him by his falling
36        and so on, but I am bound to say that it seemed to me
37        that he just must be mistaken about this.
38   MR JONES:   I take the point, but, on the other hand, if
39        you look at it from the other end, so to speak, the


                                    86
 1        chart at the beginning of this session talking about
 2        Police Constable Best as being the relevant officer, if,
 3        in fact, you look at Police Constable Best's statement
 4        about this, which is page 72 at the foot of the page,
 5        there is no reference in there to dealing with at all or
 6        identification of any person called Roberts.      There is a
 7        description of someone, which is on page 75 in the
 8        middle of the page,   "He was large, approximately 25 to
 9        30, fair hair, not wearing a shirt".      There there is no
10        identification or description of Roberts.
11   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I am just reminding myself of
12        the various officers concerned.
13   MR JONES:    PC Best is on the fourth page.    It is after
14        15.10. That is probably the one. On the left it says,
15        "One man I helped carry"     Then "Graham Roberts was
16        breathing when I put him in the lane.      Moments later
17        when I returned with someone I saw that he was dea d" .
18        The only statement about that that we have from Mr Best
19        is the statement starting at page 72 and there is no
20        identification in that of Mr Roberts.
21   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Maybe you have not duplicated
22        all material here.    It is Sinclair, is it not, who ----
23   MR JONES:   He claims to deal with him after PC Best.
24   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I think that the point I am
25        making is that there is no doubt that Mr Roberts was
26        taken to the gymnasium.     It is 16.15. This is Sinclair.
27        "I returned to the Leppings Lane side of the stadium.        I
28        was allocated one of the people who I had seen
29        apparently dead on my arrival at Leppings Lane stand.        I
30        now know this man to be Graham John Roberts.      I was
31        working with the dead and injured outside the stadium" -
32        this is Ashton, and Sinclair is apparently there at the
33        same time.    Then Sinclair says,   "I accompanied the
34        deceased to the gymnasium area.     I remained with the
35        deceased in the gymnasium."     Then Sinclair, again at
36        1.50 the next morning,    "At approximately 1.50 hours his
37        friends arrived at the gymnasium and positively
38        identified him to me".
39               I do not know whether you have got Sinclair's


                                     87
 1        statement, but it is not exhibited here.     What I
 2        understand Sinclair to be saying is that,     "I, as it
 3        were, picked up Roberts at the Leppings Lane end, I
 4        stayed with him, I went with him to the gymnasium,        I was
 5        with him all the time until he was identified".        He and
 6        Wadsworth simply cannot be talking about the same
 7        person.
 8   MR JONES:     That may be right. We have no more statements.
 9        I have spoken personally to Mr and Mrs Roberts about
10        this case when I was in Liverpool last month and the
11        material that they have is the material we have here.
12   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     There must be more material.
13   MR BONE:     There must be, yes.
14   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I had assumed that this was one
15        of the body files that you had been sent.
16   MR JONES:    What we have been sent is the material that is
17        here.
18   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     It is quite obvious that what
19        you have not been sent is a copy of Mr Sinclair's
20        statement.
21   MR JONES:    Exactly.
22   MR HICKS:     If I can say that we have my two daughters'
23        body files there and one of the things that I
24        immediately noticed was your comment earlier that there
25        is no summary.     Ann has had a letter, if I can just read
26        it, "Following a meeting I had with the coroner, he has
27        decided that the Glen 18 sudden death forms and,
28        incidentally, the West Midlands Police summary of
29        evidence will not now be released and Mr Dorries is
30        writing to you regarding this".
31                That again gives us a problem in that until we get
32        the body files we do not know who all the statements are
33        from. We can then go through the formality of requesting
34        the statements, but, once again, if it is not in the
35        body files, we have no means of knowing. Sinclair is a
36        perfect example.     If the summary is not there and there
37        is no reference to him on the continuity chart ----
38   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     The summaries were given at the
39        mini inquest, were they not?


                                        88
     1   MR JONES:     They were read, yes.
 2       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         I may be wrong in saying that
 3            they are on the body files.         I thought they were.
 4       MS ADLINGTON:     On some of them they w e r e .
 5       MR HICKS:       I will be perfectly honest with you, we got them
 6            from the Hidden trial, where my daughters ----
 7       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        As I say, I got at random some
 8            of these body files.         I, obviously, did not know the
 9            details, because I had not had your submissions.           I will
10            ask for the body files on all these people who are
11            referred to.     I would expect to find a statement from
12            Sinclair supporting what is seen in this continuity
13            sheet.     That is how the continuity sheets are made up.
14            There will also be statements from Mr Dunderdale, too,
15            probably in this particular case. All I am pointing out
16            to you is that in this particular case it looks to me as
17            though Sinclair and Wadsworth are not talking about the
18            same      person. Sinclair is obviously right, because he was
19            with     the body from the time it was taken to the
20            gymnasium until the time that it was identified by the
21            friends and added to that is the fact that there is no
22            record of Mr Roberts being taken to hospital.
23       MR JONES:     The puzzle, obviously, is why Wadsworth said,
24            "I feel that the man I gave mouth to mouth to is body
25            number 79".
26       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I follow that, but I do not
27            really think that I can follow up every hare.          It seems
28            to me that it is     perfectly plain that for        whatever
29            reason, and     I do not suppose for a moment        that he will
30            now know the reason, he made a mistake in identifying
31            that particular person.        Do not let us waste time on
32            that now.     If you think that I am wrong about that,
33            perhaps you     will come back to me.     I will     certainly get
34            hold of the     body file.     Quite honestly,   I   was very
35            impressed by these body files. They seem to me to have
36            been dealt with meticulously and with great care, having
37            regard, particularly, to the difficulty of tracing
38            people and carrying through the continuity of them, but
39            it is perfectly true that I only looked at one or two of


                                             89
 1        them and I may have looked at particularly good
 2        examples.     They were not ones that were put under my
 3        nose, they were just ones that I picked out at random.
 4        That deals with Roberts.       If you think that I am wrong
 5        about that, then I would like you to come back to me.
 6               What about Mr Abbott?     This is page 24.    What is
 7        this appeal in The Liverpool E c h o ?   Is that something
 8        that has occurred recently?
 9   MR JONES:     Yes, it is.
10   MR HICKS:     It is not actually an appeal as such.      You will
11        appreciate that in the aftermath of the programme there
12        was a lot of interest and we started getting telephone
13        calls from all types of people.      As we started getting
14        witnesses coming forward, there were contradictory
15        things that we understood.       Indirectly, it is partly to
16        do with the video tapes.       I used the example of
17                   the lady we saw on that close-up shot in the
18        corner, who came forward on the back of a newspaper
19        article that was in The Liverpool Echo. What we did then
20        over a period of a couple of weeks was printed a
21        telephone number so that anyone else who felt that they
22        had information of which we might not be aware could
23        telephone us.     In fact, some of the people who are
24        listed here we were not aware of before,
25        is probably one of the best examples of that. These were
26        people, if you like, that the Family Group are saying we
27        are not aware of. Some of those are witnesses relating
28        to people, others were people who had been through a set
29        of circumstances, which, if you like, supported our
30        proposition of what had actually happened on the day.
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Have we got a signed statement
32        from Mr McDermott now?
33   MR JONES:     We have asked for one. This man came forward about
34        three weeks ago when Mr Julian Knowles was in Liverpool
35        after I w a s .
36   MR KNOWLES:     The circumstances of this are as follows.
37        I drafted this, in fact, I was in Liverpool on the basis
38        of notes of an interview which, I think, Ms Adlington or
39        a researcher working for the Group had taken.          This is


                                      90
 1        taken first hand from his evidence. There is not yet an
 2        actual signed formal witness statement from him.            It has
 3        been asked for and we do anticipate getting it.
 4   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          Do we know which hospital he was
 5        taken to?
 6   MS ADLINGTON: The Royal Hallamshire.
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          Do we know whether he was
 8        suffering from cardiac arrest?
 9   MR KNOWLES:     He has seen his medical notes and he has been
10        informed that he did suffer a cardiac arrest.
11   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         We could presumably get the
12        notes from the Hallamshire Hospital.
13   MR KNOWLES:     Yes.
14   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Does he show up on that
15        chart of Dr Wardrope?
16   MR KNOWLES:     I do not think that he does.       It is slightly
17        peripheral, but that is, in fact, Ian McDermott's photo
18        in the newspaper the following day.
19   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Where did this come from?
20   MS ADLINGTON:       It   was the     Sunday People.
21   MR HICKS:      A lot     of the photographs were taken by
22        independent photographers, photographers working for
23        various newspapers.
24   MS ADLINGTON:       Ian McDermott actually produced that himself.
25   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         You have not put that into my
26        papers?
27   MS ADLINGTON: We are waiting for a signed statement.
28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Andrew Sephton is again one of
29        the ones       for which I      shall have to getthe body file.
30        You have       not had the      body file on him?
31   MR JONES:     No.   All we have had are the statements that
32        we have here.        Again,   I have spoken to Mrs Sephton and I
33        believe that everything that we have had is here.           We
34        have not a body file.
35   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         I have a note against paragraph
36        80(2).     You said that PC Kenny gives conflicting
37        accounts of where he took custody of Andrew's body.              I
38        was not sure that these were conflicting.           What appendix
39        is this?


                                          91
 1   MR JONES:     This is appendix 9.
 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I think we start with his
 3        statement of 19th May, page 2.           "I then became aware
 4        that it was not a pitch invasion but a crush had taken
 5        place. We were stood in this line approximately five
 6        minutes when we were told to move behind the north stand
 7        to the area of the gymnasium and the police room.              Once
 8        at this location, an unidentified man was carried into
 9        the area on an advertisement board.           I checked the body
10        for signs of life, but none could be found. The body was
11        then taken into the gymnasium where it was placed on the
12        floor.    I remained with the body until it was identified
13        by Ann Sephton as Colin Andrew Sephton".
14               So he says that he first comes across it outside
15        and the body is taken into the gymnasium.           His next
16        statement is on 23rd June.         "Further to my statement.
17        Andrew Sephton. All identifications of the deceased by
18        the various people were made to me and I remained with
19        the deceased from the pitch to the gymnasium and on to
20        the medico-legal centre."
21               Finally, on the last page of his last statement of
22        4th July 1989, he     says,    "I took     over thisbody outside
23        the gym after about half a         dozen fans had dumped him
24        there".
25               I was not clear what the inconsistency was that you
26        were saying.    I think that you rather thought that at
27        one stage he was saying that he had taken him over in
28        the gymnasium and not outside.           You say that he asserts
29        in his statement of 19th May that he took custody of
30        Andrew's body when it was brought into the gymnasium.
31        That is not how I read it.
32   MR KNOWLES:    Perhaps I   can deal with        the point,because
33        I drafted it. Certainly, it struck me that an
34        interpretation of it is that in the initial statement he
35        gives the impression that Andrew is brought to him and
36        he checks him and then takes him into the gymnasium. The
37        conflict is not so much on the geography.           It is, is the
38        fan brought to him and then checked or is it that he
39        comes across the body which is just lying there?               The


                                        92
 1        conflict is not so much is it in the gym or is it
 2        outside.        It is, is it brought to him, checked and
 3        officially taken in and placed with the others or is it
 4        just that a body has been left there by fans no doubt
 5        acting under great stress and PC Kenny just comes across
 6        it?     It is the use of the word "dumped" more than
 7        anything.       "Dumped" tends to imply just left there.
 8   LORD JUSTICE STUART—SMITH:        I am afraid that I had not picked
 9        that up.
10   MR KNOWLES: That was more the point.          It was not so much
11        on the geography.
12   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Let us just look at it from
13        that point of view.       Once at this location, an
14        unidentified man was carried into the area on an
15        advertisement board" and so on.
16   MR JONES:     It looks as if they were trying to help him.
17        Of course, the second one makes it look as if they have
18        j u s t -----
19   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I do not think that that is
20        your best point, Mr Jones, if I may put it like that.               I
21        would not have thought that there was anything really in
22        that.
23
24   MR JONES:     That is appendix 10.
25   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       There was one appendix that I
26        thought was missing.       Anyhow,    I will come back to that.
27        Are we going to get a signed statement from him?
28   MR JONES:    Yes.    The person who was taking a statement from
29        him,    I am afraid, has just given birth.
30   MR KNOWLES:     Once again, where this evidence has come        from,
31        both him and Mr Wordsley, who also assists, were           both
32        interviewed and notes of interview were taken
33        contemporaneously.       Perhaps,    I should say that the Group
34        has a researcher working part time and she has been
35        responsible for dealing with a lot of this evidence.               It
36        is first-hand evidence that comes from the person
37        himself, albeit not actually in a section 9 form.
38   MR HICKS:     I spoke to him on the telephone.       His very
39        first contact with us was when he telephoned my home,


                                        93
 1        which was one of the numbers that was given in the
 2        newspaper article. Obviously, the basic story is
 3        correct.        Then       went to see him and she has taken a
 4        statement, if you like, in terms of what actually
 5        happened to him.
 6   MR JONES:     We have a doctor's statement, too.
 7   MR HICKS:     We have, I think, got his medical report.
 8   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         He recovered consciousness in
 9        the ambulance.         Is that right?
10   MR HICKS:     Yes.
11   MR JONES:     He was waking up on the football pitch is the
12        medical statement.
13   MR KNOWLES:     It was a court yard outside the west stand.
14   MR HICKS:     After which he is put in an ambulance.
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          I thought somewhere or other
16        he had said that he had recovered consciousness in the
17        ambulance.
18   MR JONES:     His second statement says he was put conscious
19        but in shock into the ambulance.
20   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         He recovered consciousness
21        before he was put into the ambulance.
22
23
24   MR JONES:     No.
25   MR KNOWLES:     I think that it is right to say that
26        actually his bony injuries were the most severe of
27        anyone who survived.
28                                            H Some of those who died only
29        had one fractured rib. He had been very severely
30        crushed, as the doctor's report makes clear.
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        With regard to the use of the
32        words "threw on the floor",          I suppose "dropped
33        uncaringly on the floor" is much the same.
34   MR JONES:     Then we go on to say that that case is related
35        to the 3.15 cut off.
36   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         I follow that.    Then there is
37        the heading,      "Supporters who are presumed to be dead,
38        but survived".         If they were taken to the gym, they were
39        examined by a doctor, as I understand it.


                                         94
 1   MR JONES:     At some point, yes.      There were certifications
 2        of death at intervals after 4 o'clock.
 3   LORD JUSTICE STUART—SMITH:      I think that there were three
 4        or four doctors who were doing that, were there not?
 5   MR JONES:  Yes.
 6   MR HAMMOND:     You see that in the video of the gymnasium.
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I have seen that.
 8   MR HICKS:     We think that that is Dr Bullas.
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART—SMITH:      The fact that death is certified
10        at a particular time does not mean that the person has
11        died at that particular time, but they are dead by then.
12   MR HICKS:     That is the problem that you will have next
13        week, sir, not all the     families appreciate that. We have
14        been trying to make it     clear to them.
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I am sure that that is right.
16               As I say, in dealing with this question of people
17        who were unconscious and who recovered^ I happened to
18        glance through my notes on this, but                    who
19        gave evidence at the Taylor Inquiry said that he had
20        recovered.     He was unconscious.     I think that he was
21        taken to hospital and recovered.        I think that he was in
22        hospital until midday the following day or something
23        like that.     My recollection, and I may be wrong about
24        this, is that other witnesses who gave evidence to the
25        Taylor inquiry said much the same.
26   MR JONES:     They did.   We point out in here that
27        Lord Justice Taylor did, in fact, specifically say that
28        in what he called marginal cases, he thinks that with
29        prompter treatment lives might have been saved. That is
30        paragraphs 251 and 252 of his report.        Of course, the
31        significance of that, we say, is that he was not
32        examining individual cases.        If he knew of some cases,
33        it is because they came out accidentally, so to speak,
34        as they were drawn to his attention, but, of course, it
35        was not his function to examine the causes of death in
36        the 95 cases.
37   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      If you are right about this,
38        there are two completely separate questions, are there
39        not? There is the fact that the police failed to


                                       95
 1        appreciate what was going on and Lord Justice Taylor
 2        criticises them for that.          That is hardly going to add
 3        to the sort of prospect of an unlawful killing verdict,
 4        is it?
 5   MR JONES:     I agree.     In fact, we discussed this in the short
 6        adjournment.        We do want to emphasise the point that it
 7        is not simply verdicts that we are looking at.          The
 8        value to most relatives of people who attend inquests,
 9        of course, is not the verdict, they are normally
10        indifferent to the verdict. What they want to do is to
11        find out what happened and it is the function of the
12        inquest not simply to produce a verdict, but to provide
13        the information and the evidence as to how death was
14        caused.     In our submission, it would not be right to
15        concentrate on whether the verdicts would necessarily be
16        different.     What we are complaining about here is that
17        there was just a failure to make the inquiries which
18        would have given people that information and, as we have
19        argued, the concealment of evidence. But in this respect
20        it is that evidence has now come out which shows that
21        the 3.15 cut off for whatever reason, in good faith or
22        not, was inappropriate and did not answer the questions
23        because it was imposed irrespective of evidence which
24        was available or could have been made available to the
25        court but was not.
26   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       How do you relate this to any
27        particular case?       This is the difficulty that I have.
28        Supposing the coroner had not had a cut-off point and
29        supposing, for example, in the case of Lee Nichol, he
30        had traced the whole thing through - I do not know
31        whether he did or not, but let us assume that he did not
32        - are you saying that there should have been an inquiry
33        as to the nursing conditions in the hospital when he got
34        there?
35   MR JONES:     It is inevitably a question of degree, but here
36        there was no inquiry at all beyond 3.15. That is the
37        point that we made. I think that probably the Philip
38        Hammond case is a very good example of this, where one
39        would have expected not simply the dead-body man to have


                                        96
 1         been called to give evidence, but the live-body man, who
 2         would have given evidence about what happened in the
 3         hospital.     I know that it is 95 people and one
 4         appreciates that it is an appalling administrative
 5         burden and so on, but that type of evidence should have
 6         been called in the individual cases.
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       This is not normally done in
 8         an inquest of a person who is killed in a motor
 9         accident.
10   MR JONES:     I cannot answer that, because most of those
11         inquests are utterly uncontroversial. In most cases
12         there would be a discussion between the coroner and the
13         family.     It would be clear what had happened, the family
14         would, no doubt, have spoken to people at the hospital
15         themselves and, no doubt, in 99 cases out of 100 where
16         this happens, a car's brakes fail or whatever, then it
17         is all relatively straightforward,     subject to the
18         question of criminal liability, if there is any question
19         of police prosecution.     Where there is controversy of
20        this kind, and especially where you have an inquest
21        which is attended by findings of blame beforehand by the
22         inquiry and huge conflicts of feeling engendered by the
23        press, The Sun newspaper and everything else, then you
24        would expect it.
25   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I think this is quite
26         important.
27   MR JON E S:   I agree it i s .
28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I can quite see that, if there
29         is some suggestion of medical negligence, such that
30        there was a separate cause of death, but I do not think
31        that there is any suggestion of that anywhere.        I have
32         not seen any suggestion of that.     At the Taylor inquiry
33         he specifically says that nobody suggested that the
34         emergency services were in any way to blame at all. He
35        went into that in quite considerable detail.        I agree
36        not in individual cases, but overall he went into the
37        response of the ambulance services and so on and so
38        forth.     Although there is clearly a criticism of the
39        police in not appreciating earlier what was happening


                                       97
 1        and not setting the emergency services into operation
 2        quicker,   I have not seen anything anywhere to suggest
 3        that the actual treatment by the emergency services,
 4        when they arrived or when people were taken to hospital,
 5        was open to criticism.    It is true that they did not
 6        have defibrillators and so on, but Lord Justice Taylor
 7        dealt with those criticisms.
 8   MR JONES:   He did, yes.   I appreciate that in dealing with an
 9        inquest of 95 people you do have problems.    I can see
10        that there is a huge area in which a view can
11        legitimately be taken about how far you follow through
12        questions of care and attention after that.     One can
13        understand and appreciate that.    But, when one considers
14        that Lord Justice Taylor had himself, without looking at
15        individual cases, made those criticisms which we have
16        set out on page 19 and had said that probably there was
17        little that could have been achieved in most cases,
18        however soon doctors had been summoned, but there were
19        marginal cases where earlier attention might have made a
20        difference, the fundamental objection we have is that to
21        say after that finding "3.15 and no more" prevents you
22        from investigating the very area which Lord Justice
23        Taylor has said is open for investigation and where
24        there might in particular cases have been a difference.
25        That is not an area where he has investigated.     He is
26        not charged, so to speak, with investigating the
27        question of in which case or past cases or whatever
28        might there have been a difference.
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    But that is a criticism, is it,
30        of the police for not responding quickly enough?
31   MR JONES:   It is, yes.
32   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    That simply comes back to the
33        original criticism of them as a whole.    If we have any
34        further proceedings, you are not going to get a more
35        robust criticism of the police than came from Lord
36        Justice Taylor, coupled with what appears to me to be a
37        clear admission of liability by the police.    Whether or
38        not it is in terms or not is neither here nor there.       It
39        is possible, but I do not see how you can ever


                                     98
 1        investigate it in each particular case that, if someone
 2        had spotted X lying on the pitch a few minutes earlier
 3        and had given them mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, which
 4        they did not get as quickly as possible, that might have
 5        made a difference.   It seems to me to be an impossible
 6        task.
 7   MR JONES:   My feeling is that really what the families are
 8        looking for, and I expect that they will express this to
 9        you as they have to us, sir, when you see them next
10        week, and what people want above all in the case is an
11        acknowledgement that the inquest did not do what they
12        were led to believe that it was going to do and just cut
13        it off at 3.15. If I can give you an example, there is
14        Mr and Mrs Tootle. They attended and drove every day
15        from Liverpool to Sheffield for 90 days in an old car.
16        They are not the sort of people who have had more than a
17        basic education, they do not assert themselves, and they
18        went there thinking that critical questions could be
19        asked or questions to which the answers may be
20        controversial would be asked at the main inquest. Then
21        they sit there for 90 days through the inquest and the
22        only time they hear their son's name mentioned is when
23        his name is read out on the list.   Frustration has
24        stayed with them over the years - and I have seen Mrs
25        Tootle every time I have been involved in this case now
26        - and there is a relentless determination on them to
27        have answered or to have some explanation or
28        acknowledgement of why there was this 3.15 cut off so
29        that they could not discover the answers, when that was
30        what they understood was the purpose of the inquest.
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:   I am not sure that I have read
32        the ruling of the coroner on this or where it is that
33        you say that he led them to believe that all these
34        things would be dealt with later.
35   MR JONES:   It was the mini inquest.
36   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:   Do not let us waste time on it
37        now, but what I   would like to see is what the coroner
38        said about it and, in particular, where you say that he
39        led them to believe that all these things would be dealt


                                    99
 1        with.
 2                The other point that I have on this is that this
 3        question of the 3.15 cut off was dealt with by the
 4        Divisional Court.     I am sure that you appreciate that I
 5        am not the Court of Appeal.      I cannot reverse the
 6        findings of the Divisional Court even if I thought they
 7        were wrong and at the moment I cannot see any reason to
 8        differ from them.     I quite appreciate that, if there is
 9        really fresh evidence that puts a different complexion
10        on it, then the matter may have to be considered, but I
11        think that one of the problems that I have experienced
12        and I know that I am going to experience next week is
13        that there has been a mass of criticism of one sort or
14        another of how the inquest was conducted.      I have read
15        Professor Scratton's book on it and many of the
16        criticisms are totally irrelevant from my point of view,
17        but they do highlight why the people are so upset.
18   MR JONES:    In public law terms, we say that we have fresh
19        evidence. The discretionary element which will impel a
20        further inquiry is all these attendant circumstances,
21        such as non-disclosure,    3.15 cut-off point and so on.
22        I, of course, appreciate and I have explained that you
23        are not there in any way to review the findings of the
24        Divisional Court. That is why we attach so much
25        importance to Houldsworth and Walker.
26   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I appreciate that.
27   MR JONES:    Combined with the new facts of the individual
28        cases. The rest is, so to speak, relevant to discretion,
29        the points that I am making now about, for example, the
30        Tootles.
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I know that you appreciate the
32        problem.
33   MR JONES:     I have explained it.
34   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I am going to have to try to
35        explain that to the families.
36   MR JONES:    What we will do, if we may, is we will put
37        together as fast as we can a note of the coroner's
38        decisions about the 3.15 cut off and when he expressed
39        them.    We will do that, I hope, within days.


                                     100
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Returning to this, at page 29
 2        you deal with Edward Spearritt.        You say that, because
 3        there is no record of what happened to him between 3.06
 4        and 5 o 'clock and because of what happened in other
 5        cases, it is reasonable to conclude that Mr Spearritt
 6        was left for dead outside Leppings Lane.        If I may say
 7        so, it seems to me to be a bit of a non sequitur.
 8   MR JONES:     I think that I would turn it around to say
 9        that there was reason to suppose that, if he was
10        unconscious for two hours, there must have been many
11        other people unconscious for a decent period of time in
12        whom death was not inevitable.
13   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     That is a different point.
14        The point that you are making here is that because one
15        person, Mr Ball I think, was put down next to a dead
16        man, Mr Spearritt had been abandoned for dead as well.
17   MR JONES:     It is simply that there is no explanation
18        available as to why it is 5 o'clock that he arrives at
19        the hospital. There is a two-hour gap from the time when
20        he must have been unconscious, so he must have b$en
21        somewhere.
22   MR HAMMOND:     The pens had been emptied by 23 minutes past.
23   MS ADLINGTON:     He was in pen four.
24   MR HAMMOND:     He had been missing for two hours.
25   MR JONES:      I think that the relevance
26        is not necessarily in Eddie Spearritt's case, it is the
27        fact that, if it has happened there, it has happened
28        elsewhere.
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     That he has recovered?
30   MR JONES:     No, that he has been left lying unconscious ----
31   MR HICKS:     It is yet another example of someone not being
32        properly attended to.
33   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     The prospect of re-investigating
34        that at this stage is nil.
35   MR HICKS:     I do not think that we are necessarily saying
36        that you should re-investigate that.       If you take on
37        board the fact that there is an hour and a half of Eddie
38        Spearritt's life missing unaccounted for, then there is
39        certainly a question mark in the adequacy of the primary


                                     101
 1        response.
 2   MR BONE:    Someone obviously went up to Mr Spearritt at some
 3        stage before 5 o'clock and decided that this chap should
 4        be put into an ambulance and taken to hospital.
 5   MR HICKS:     Yes, but where was he?     You do not leave a body
 6        lying around for an hour and a half, be he dead, semi­
 7        conscious or anything else.
 8   MR HAMMOND:     There are no hospital or ambulance records.
 9        There are no witness statements.
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     There are only witness
11        statements, as I understand it, in the case of people
12        who are dead. The police did not chase these things
13        through. They did not think they were relevant.
14   MR HAMMOND:     I think that for the one who went to
15        intensive care there were witness statements from who
16        brought them in.
17   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     There would obviously be
18        ambulance records, if they were keeping them. I suspect
IS        that they probably were not, because they were so
20        stretched.
21   MR HAMMOND:     I am saying that at 5 o'clock when it was
22        all over and he is coming into hospital at 5 o'clock, it
23        had all died down then.        If you are bringing one person
24        in at 5 o'clock ----
25   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Was he the last person taken
26        to hospital?
27   MR HAMMOND:     I cannot be sure.     If you look at the ambulance
28        log, I think that they are saying in the ambulance log
29        that, after 4.10 and 4.15, they were just taking the
30        walking wounded in.
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     We will try to find out the
32        times.     I see the point you are making on that.
33               So far as Mr Edwards is concerned, what is the
34        significance, do you say, of Mr Edwards'       illness?   I am
35        not sure that I follow the point that you are making
36        about him.
37   MR JONES:     This evidence, without reading through all
38        three of the paragraphs --
39   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     The first point is that the


                                     102
 1         police did not seem to know what was going on.
 2   MR JONES:    Yes, and that the response was slow and
 3         inadequate.
 4   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        There was a good deal of
 5         evidence about that at the Taylor inquiry.
 6   MR JONES:    Again, but not at the inquest.
 7   MR   HICKS: We did not, perhaps, make the point forcibly
 8         early enough, that the coroner       almost did not want to
 9         know Taylor, he       wanted to re-run it and he made that
10         point in one of the transcripts.
11   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I would expect,   I do not know,
12         that he would have said that Taylor        is not the    last
13         word, he has to       conduct his inquest and some of the
14         ground that he goes over will be the same as the ground
15         that Lord Justice Taylor went over.
16   MR   JONES: Yes, but, we say, when he is confronted           by
17         ground that Lord Justice Taylor did traverse,           such as
18         the bits which lead open the question of causes of
19         individual deaths and after 3.15, in spite of the
20        benefit and the advantage that he has in reading it, he
21         then says,   "I am not going to go into that after 3.15,
22        because I have already concluded that death was
23         inevitable in all these cases, contrary to what Lord
24         Justice Taylor says, and I am not going to let the jury
25         investigate i t " .    We still have not a signed statement
26         from Edwards, but that is what the evidence of Edwards,
27         Flack and         will go to.      I think that I can
28         summarise it in that way.
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       At some stage I am going to have
30         to find out who gave evidence at the inquest and who
31         gave evidence at the Taylor inquiry.
32   MR BONE:    We have complete lists of both.
33   MR HICKS:    Edwards is, in fact, the ambulance driver who
34         took me and Victoria to the Northern General.
35   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       You say that as far as Flack
36         is concerned that his evidence supports the conclusion
37         that there was total confusion in the rescue operation.
38          I am not sure that I really picked that up.            In his
39         first statement he deals with a number of people and in


                                        103
 1        his second statement he identifies who they are.             Am I
 2        right in that?
 3   MR KNOWLES:     I think that it is probably my mistake.      I
 4        apologise, there is, in fact, an initial statement.
 5   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        It does say,   "Further to my
 6        statement of 5th M a y " .
 7   MR KNOWLES:     I apologise it is the initial one.
 8   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Perhaps you could let me have
 9        that.
10                Now 103 onwards is really dealing with the Kevin
11        Williams case, is it not?
12   MR JONES:     Which is well documented.
13   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        What I wonder about this is
14        what     is there fresh which was not before the Divisional
15        Court?
16   MR JONES:      I think the answer to that is very little.         In
17        fact,     I think that that is the position of all the six
18        families in the 1993 judicial review.          By itself I
19        accept that there would be no cause ----
20   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I shall probably be seeing
21        Bruda and Deborah Martin.
22   MR JONES:     The significance of their evidence we can
23        say in a word.     They are not regular South Yorkshire
24        officers and they do appear to have given a different
25        account and then been persuaded to change it.          If I may
26        say so, Mrs Ann Williams - and I got to know her in 1993
27        - is so upset about it that she rings me probably about
28        every three or four w e e k s .
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I hope that she will not ring
30        me every three to four w e e k s !
31   MR JONES:     No, but she will make her point of view very
32        clear.
33   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I understand that.    I absolutely
34        understand the desire of the families to know the last
35        moments of people's lives.          I can fully understand that.
36        The difficulty is as to whether or not that is actually
37        relevant to any of the ----
38   MR HICKS:     I think that we are conceding that point.
39        Mrs Williams would not be very pleased to hear me say


                                        104
 1        it, probably, but we see little point in you spending
 2        time going over old ground.
 3   MR JONES:   It is part of the background.
 4   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I think that this is one of the
 5        things that has been troubling me. There is a great many
 6        complaints that bereaved people have about this, that
 7        and the other.     Some may be capable of being dealt with
 8        but a great many are clearly not.
 9   MR HICKS:   We have approached this from the point of view
10        that you have a limited time scale and there are
11        individual issues which need to be looked at, but above
12        that there are procedural or umbrella-type level issues.
13        It is really not your remit to be looking into all the
14        individual cases. We have openly conceded that we do not
15        believe in Mrs Williams'    case there is anything new.
16   MR KNOWLES: Can I just qualify that to this extent?         I
17        think that the new material relates to Dr Slater.          He
18        was the pathologist who gave evidence about Kevin
19        Williams' death.     I do not know if you saw the
20        documentary, but there was a dramatic reconstruction of
21        the telephone call between he and PC Bruda. I think that
22        we have included in the appendix some correspondence
23        between Dr Slater and Dr Walker, who, coincidentally,
24        reviewed that programme for the B M J . Dr Slater has
25        supplied more details about that telephone call, which
26        he clearly does not deny making, although he justifies
27        it on a number of different bases, none of which, we
28        say, alter the fact that he was talking to another
29        witness who was in the middle of giving his evidence
30        under oath.   There is new material that has come to
31        light about that.     That whole issue, I understand, was
32        not canvassed before the Divisional Court in 1993, but
33        it does go, we say, to a procedural irregularity, the
34        discussion of evidence between two witnesses.
35   MR HICKS:   You have already said, sir, that you were going
36        to talk to Bruda.
37   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Yes.   I shall obviously have
38        to see Mr Taylor, who says that he was threatened by
39                           At the moment,   I do not see why


                                     105
 1                      should threaten him.
 2   MR HICKS:     This is one of the issues that      my family will
 3          bring up with you next week.
 4   LORD   JUSTICE STUART-SMITH: Shall we leave it until then?
 5   MR HICKS:     I am happy to do that.
 6   LORD   JUSTICE STUART-SMITH: Can you indicate        the passages
 7          that you are referring to on Flack?         Do I need to read
 8          the whole thing?
 9   MR KNOWLES:     It is page 4 of the statement, paragraph 8.
10          "I spoke to an inspector and asked where our casualty
11          clearing point was and where our senior officer was.          He
12          did not know. At this stage I did not realise the
13          casualty clearing point was in the gym.        I was not aware
14          of any Hillsborough plan prior to this emergency".           He
15          refers later on in that statement to all of the vehicles
16          being sent back to base, sent to a bus depot.
17   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       The bus depot was part of the
18          plan, as I understand it.        The bus depot was where they
19          were meant to assemble.     Is that not right?
20   MR HAMMOND:    Was it not the depot where the ambulances on
21          call for Sheffield went every Saturday no matter ----
22   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I see.     I think that the
23          emergency plan was that they were to, as it were, stack
24          up there.   Am I wrong about that?
25   MR HAMMOND:    I have not seen that.       All I know is that
26          for every football game they have ambulances on standby
27          and that is where that ambulance for Sheffield Wednesday
28          Football Club goes.
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       At the bottom of page 92, “Match
30          Tickets and Gate C “ .   You say,    "A consistent pattern of
31          evidence has emerged showing West Midlands police
32          officers went to great lengths to produce evidence to
33          show that as many fans as possible went through gate C
34          rather than the turnstiles, so that attention was
35          focused on the behaviour of the fans rather than on the
36          behaviour of the police.     Evidence presented to the
37          inquest placed Paul Carlisle outside the ground...          The
38          photograph produced was taken by a police photographer."
39   MR JONES:     I accept that it must seem to you unsatisfactory


                                       106
 1        to deal with this without witness statements.        I fully
 2        understand that.     I wonder if I could make this
 3        observation on it.    Obviously,    since June there have
 4        been formidable administrative arrangements to be made
 5        about the collecting and the assembling of evidence and,
 6        if this appears, as I know that this part of it does, to
 7        be a little amateurish,    I hope that you can attribute
 8        that to the difficulties under which people are having
 9        to work in a hurry and, particularly, where information
10        is coming through piecemeal week in week out from the
11        South Yorkshire authorities.       I agree that, if we are
12        going to take this farther, we will have to justify it
13        by witness statements.
14   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     At the moment I am not quite
15        following the significance of the point that is being
16        made here.   My comment I think on this was why does this
17        matter?   We know that a large number of fans went
18        through gate C and we know that quite a considerable
19        number of those who were killed went through gate C.
20        There is no evidence that those who went through gate C
21        did so without tickets.
22   MR JONES:   No, but that was always the suggestion that was
23        being put in the early stages, that an awful lot of
24        people might have got in and caused overcrowding, and
25        that was certainly something that occupied a high
26        profile in the press at the time.      In fact, Lord Justice
27        Taylor referred to it as the “conspiracy theory".
28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     He was not satisfied, was he?
29   MR JONES:   No, he was not satisfied about it. The point
30        that is being made here is that, if there is this
31        pattern established by evidence, then it does tend to
32        support a theory that it was convenient to those
33        policemen who wanted to argue the conspiracy theory to
34        argue that as few as possible of people did have,
35        indeed, tickets.
36   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     They cannot possibly argue that
37        on the basis that a large number of people went through
38        gate C.
39   MR JONES:   No, they cannot, but ----


                                     107
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     All they can say is,   "We don't
 2        know whether they had tickets or not, because they were
 3        not asked to show t h e m" .
 4   MR JONES:   That is true, but, nevertheless, it does
 5        remain, as we have asserted here, that it has appeared
 6        that there have been great lengths gone to to show that
 7        people went through gate C rather than the turnstiles.
 8        It appeared to be part of the focus of the attack upon
 9        the Liverpool fans; it seemed to be all part and parcel
10        of the drunken hooligan element who burst through the
11        gate and then poured through causing overcrowding.       Had
12        there not been so many people pouring through, there
13        would not have been the overcrowding.     It all seemed to
14        be part of that attempt by the South Yorkshire Police,
15        going right from the moment it happened, to say that
16        this is drunken Liverpool fans' behaviour. That is the
17        relevance of the point.
18   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Of going through gage C?
19   MR JONES:   No, it seemed to be part of the suggestion that
20        a large number of people went in without tickets.
21   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Lord Justice Taylor found that
22        a number went through without tickets. There was clearly
23        evidence of that before him.
24   MR HICKS:   "A significant minority" was the phrase he used.
25   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     There was plenty of evidence from
26        the turnstile operators that sometimes there were people
27        going through two at a time and sometimes over the top
28        and so on.     I have the impression that when gate C
29        opened the first time, when they were ejecting somebody,
30        that there were actually a number of people on the wrong
31        side of that rail, who quite possibly did not have
32        tickets.     When they went through, there was a mad rush
33        with them.     I think that only about 100 people went
34        through.     But, when the gate was actually opened, these
35        were all people who had been queuing up at the
36        turnstiles who would have had their tickets checked.         I
37        have not spotted anything which suggests that anybody
38        has tried to put a different complexion on it.
39   MR JONES:   Certainly, this point by itself is not in the


                                     108
 1        scheme of things one of great significance.
 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Someone makes the point that
 3        a Mrs Stringer was visited by officers and so on.
 4   MR HICKS:       This is the real issue.     If you went through the
 5        turnstiles, as you will appreciate, your ticket was torn
 6        in half and you were given the stub back.          If you went
 7        in through gate C, you still had the whole ticket on
 8        your body.       I think that this was the point that she was
 9        making.       I think that it was the same in the Glovers'
10        case, where the two Glover brothers went through the
11        turnstiles together.       Because one of them lived,
12        obviously there was a witness to the fact that they had
13        gone through, but they were taking a full ticket back.
14        The inference being that the other Glover brother had
15        gone through gate C, but his ticket had not been torn in
16        half.
17   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I do not think that it matters
18        tuppence whether people went through gate C or not.
19   MR HICKS:     I think the significance, to be pedantic, is
20        that there is an element of skulduggery in terms of the
21        way in which the evidence was being pulled together on
22        the people who died.       In other words, if they should
23        have only had half a ticket, where did the full ticket
24        come from?
25   MR HAMMOND:      If you go through the turnstile, you are
26        counted as one body going in, so all the people who are
27        given full tickets back, although they have been through
28        the turnstiles and been counted, you are looking at a
29        full ticket, so the result is that you are going to get
30        counted again for going in.          It just makes the numbers
31        more and more.
32   MR HICKS:     What I think Mrs Stringer means is that the
33        full ticket, to use emotive terms, was "planted on the
34        bod y" .
35   MR HAMMOND:      Why give full tickets? What reason could there
36        be?
37   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I am afraid that I do not see
38        the point of this at the moment.         If there is something
39        sinister, then obviously I will look into it, but


                                       109
     1        everybody knows that it was the late influx of fans
 2            through gate C who, as it were, added to the difficult
 3            situation.     They all went through the tunnel. Apart from
 4            the misinformation at the time, which was quite
 5            disgraceful, everybody knew that the gate had been
 6            opened by the police.
 7       MR HICKS:    I am sorry, sir, I have explained it badly.
 8            If you can imagine a body that is inside the ground that
 9            has gone through the turnstiles with half a ticket, if,
10            when the person's belongings are brought back, he has
11            the full ticket, then the inference is that he did not
12            come through the turnstiles, he came in with the influx
13            through gate C.
14       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       So what?
15       MR HICKS:    It is the fact that the body that should have had
16            half a ticket comes back with a full ticket.         There has
17            been a deliberate attempt, if you like, to return a
18            different ticket. That is the point that Sandra is
19            making.
20       MS ADLINGTON:     It increases the number of victims that
21            were said to have come through gate C.
22       MR HICKS:    It is the fact that something wrong has been
23            done    in terms of personal effects.
24       MR BONE:    Is   part of the argument that, if    someone with
25            a full ticket has come through gate C rather than having
26            to wait outside the ground until 3.10 or whenever, he
27            would have got in anyway, but being let through gate C
28            in that way, effectively caused his death, because, if
29            he was not in the ground ----
30       MR HICKS:   No, I think that this is aimed at the West
31            Midlands police evidence gathering and it is seen as
32            tinkering with the evidence, to be pretty brutal about
33            it.    I think that that is the intention.
34       LORD JUSTICE     STUART-SMITH:   I do not think that   I agree.
35       MR JONES:    I   am beginning to get the impression that I
36            think that probably we have helped you on the individual
37            cases as much as we can today. We know what more we have
38            to do and you will be seeing yourself next week.         I also
39            feel that we have a clear idea now of what we have to


                                           110
                    /
 1        submit I n writing to you about the general matters that
 2        we have/ beeb discussing.
 3   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       What I particularly want on the
 4        first point, the video point, is evidence particularly
 5        of Duckenfield and Murray and anybody else to the effect
 6        that the reason why they did not appreciate what was
 7        going on in pens three and four was because the video
 8        was not working properly. That seems to me to be crucial
 9        to the first primary submission.        If that was the
10        evidence that they gave, that is quite contrary to what
11        they said at the Taylor inquiry.        I hope that you have a
12        note of the others.
13   MR JONES:   We have, indeed, yes.       What I want to consider is
14        also the more general point that you put to us first of
15        all this morning about the type of inquiry.        I will
16        revisit the question of striking down the verdict
17        without a new inquest and I will also consider the
18        argument that there should be a new limited opening of
19        an inquiry such as that which Lord Justice Taylor
20        conducted. We have a number of questions to answer.
21   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Thank you very much indeed.       I
22        do not think that I have any more points.        Thank you
23        very much indeed. It has been very helpful.
24               Is there anything that anybody wants to ask me
25        before we go?
26   MR HICKS:   We already have an arrangement whereby, if we have
27        any queries, we can come and ask.
28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Yes, of course.
29   MR JONES:   Obviously, we will talk about what has happened
30        today and make fresh representations in the light of
31        what we have discussed.
32   MR HICKS:    Is it opportune to say that it would be beneficial
33        if we got more statements from the South Yorkshire
34        Police.       One of our difficulties in answering some of
35        these specific points is that we do not have the
36        statements.
37   MR ADLINGTON:       I have to say that in the last couple of
38        weeks Inspector Hepworth has been particularly helpful.
39   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I was told that they were


                                       111
 1        suPPlying everything which had been put before the
 2        coroner, except --
 3   MR BONE:    Except pictures which show bodies of persons
 4        other than the persons being inquired about.
 5   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     And statements which were
 6        not in evidence, but which had been given to the coroner
 7        when the witnesses gave evidence, where the witness has
 8        nt agreed to it being given.     I think that applies to a
 9        lot of it.
10               I may have to see Dr Wardrope and clarify some
11        matters with him.    As I say, I have seen the full video
12        of the mortuary.     I do not think that it is of any
13        benefit.     It is pretty gruesome. There is a relevant
14        shot of Deborah Martin in that, but that is about all.
15        As I say, I have also seen all the body files which I
16        will obviously look at in relation to the specific cases
17        that you have raised.     I think that the Sinclair and
18        Best reports on Roberts should be clarified.
19   MR HICKS:   Will you be seeing any of the West Midlands
20        police officers, McCombie and people like that?
21   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    Possibly, yes.
22   MR HICKS:    This is a point again that will come out
23        next week.    I am giving you a bit of advance notice.
24   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    I may do, I do not know.
25        It depends whether I think that there is any substance
26        in the criticism.
27               Thank you.

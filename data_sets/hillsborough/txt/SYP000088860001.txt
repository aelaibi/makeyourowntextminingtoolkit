                On Saturday 15th April               1989 (150489),         I attended the FA Cup Semi final

                to be played between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at the

                Hillsborough ground, Sheffield.
                        C A T             So
                 1 am a season t icket holder for Anfield,^ and obtained my ticket for

                this match using that paying £6 for a Leppings Ln Standing area.

                 I travelled to the match by van with a group* of friends and we left

                Liverpool at about           10 pm (SHOO) on Friday              14th April    1989 <140489) and

                we slept overnight on the S n akes Pass                     in a layby.

                     i our party were my brother

                                   d o n ’t know where they live,                                he   ves    on

                where he lives.

         T h e r a w e r e s o m e o t h srs       in t he v a n 'b u t t h e ywere         f r iends    of

         d o n 81 k n o w t h e m .

         At -about 6 am         (0600)        we    carried on into S h e f f i e l d getting                  there about

         6,30 am      (0630)     when we went              to a cafe for             breakfast       and a wash,

         s t a y i.n g t h e r e f o r about        1 hour .

         We then drove         further          into      town,        and stopped for            petrol   near      the

         ground.       Whilst         refueling we were a p p r o a c h e d                by some Police Officers,

         they searched for alcohol                      on the van and they told us where                         to park

         the van and warned us about                       our     conduct         later    on outside and           inside

         the ground.

         We then drove up to                  aS u p e r m a r k e t    near the        garage and bought some               food

         there and       later had            a game of football               there.       We    stayed until about

         midday     C1EQ0)     then drove               to where        the officers         had earlier         told us to

         park.    We then went           to     look for a pub to have a drink                          but tney were all

         shut.      We talked to a Police                    officer and a P o l i c e w o m a n having a laugh

         and a joke.         They told us where                   there was a pub open                  it was    called the

         Fox.     They told us where                    it was and we wal k e d up there.

         We got there about              1 pm (1300)             and I had          1 pint only because              it was       so

         packed.       It was full            of Liverpool              fans all      drinking       but there was           no

         drunkeness.         We sat        outside         drinking        our drinks            and decided to walk

         clown to tr>e ground at about 2 pm                            ( 1400) .

         On our way to the ground we                       received no Police D i r e c t i o n or escort.

         There was       no violence            or disorder             that    1 saw,      everyone was         quite

         jovial.We arri v e d at              the       ground at about            2.15     pm    (1415)      There was       no
S.o.£.
 f |f    organisation         of the       queues         everyone was             left standing a r o u n d outside

         the    ground and few           people were             trying        to get      in.

         "hera were a few officers                       on foot and others                on horseback        but    they

         last    years    semi        final,       so    I knew which turnstiles                   to use and had no

         d ifficulty finding             them.
                                                                                                               PAGE.
                                                                                                               S3312

          I i mmediately joined               the queue and met                           Aiho'ci come by coach

O n       We had no diffi c u l t y getting                 in the    ground.      The    lad in front         of me

          had 'no ticket- and ne gave a £3 note to the                          xad   in the turnstile,           but

          he   let him through and gave                    him his money      back.

          I handed my ticket              in and      retained the stub.

          Once    in the ground           I decided         to go down the       tunnel     to the      terracing.

          I knew you       can go to the wings                round the sides         of the stand?        but    I

          w a n t e d to go where         the   better atmo s p h e r e would h e .

          There were       no Police O f f icers            or Stewards       controlling        the    tunnel    and
K/<L5-r
          we had free        passage along            it.     At the end of the           tunnel    we went      right

          onto the t err a c in g this would ha v e been about 2.20 pm ( 1420),
s o t     I have     indicated on          the attac h e d        plan    rny first   viewing position this

fesi a    being    point F5.         At    that      time    I was    stood with most        of the      people       from

          the van.

          In my opinion         it was      very      crowded even then so much so that                   I feit

          uncornfortab1e .         You     could still move about               but there was a lot of

          j os 1 1 i n g a nd swa y i n g »

          As time went        on it got more               and more      packed, it was      like      being   in a

          sea you. just went where you                     were   pushed,    you had no real           control    of

          where    you went.         I began to            become    s e p arated from the others          and    was

          pushed more and more              to the         right.

          As the kick off          came       the    crush became        intense so much so you            c o u l d n ’t

          move at all.          I had      to   put my head up to gasp for air.

          I have     indicated on          the a t t a c h e d    plan where      I had been pushed to,               this

          being    po i nt ^.B2.

          People were        crying out ar o u n d ,rne people were a l r e a d y being                  passed out

          of the     pen at the front.

          T h e n there was a little                surge    forward.       1 think      this was about -J.Q3

          pm   (1503).       I was    just      pinned there.            I c o u l d n ’t move   or do anything.

          As far as       I am aware all             the    people ar o u n d me were alive,             I did    not

Eventually            the    pressure          eased    off     from      behind,         and     I was a b l e       to w a l k

I saw                                                                  at    the      oack      of   tne    terrace,             We

talked about what was                       happening,         We tried to see our friends,                               i saw

my brother                    ana                              on the       pitch        crying.          I si g n a l l e d to

               was    pulled up into Wesi S t a n d by                                                         and      I then

went      i nt o Pen 4 and             climbed out          through         the front           fence,      well                 did

an d    I was        told to get            back   by a Police Officer.                      I waited until               he

went and then climbed out myself,

       ooked for my brother and friends.                               It was only then that                      1 realised

th-^t people           had died,              l could see           people     lying       on the         floor    covered

     i others         still     pressed up against                   the front           fence,

People were            being       carried up the              pitch on boards and others                         being

DU .led out of the pens,

Ihftre were some Police Officers                            both male and female                     wan d e r i n g ar o u n d

no      knowing what            to do and some              crying,

    ventually         I found my friends,                   I did not          carry any bodies away and

could not describe any of the deceased,

       stayed on the            pitch for some              considerable time                   as we thought

         had bee n k i11e d ,

We     left     the ground at about 4.45                       pm    (1643)      to      look for                 and

We     e v e n t u a 1 1y found                    and we       returned home and                    it was     later        that

       h t w e fo u nd t ha t                   was alive.

                              I only recsived sIight tenderness around the                                          ribs as a result        of the

                              crush,                     I have     not sought medical             treatment       for that.

                              In my opinion there was a great                                   difference        between the P o l i c i n g    in

                              1988 and that this year,                                 L-C*S Kt year    it was    better   organised,     outside

                              in that                    everyone was          formed     into queues and no one was a l l o w e d to wait

                             around                     the g r o u n d .

                              I did not see                       the       barrier    break    in my     pen but     I think    I was   just     to

                             the         right              of   it and       behind    it when        it broke.      I think thats what

b f& u e L                    caused the surge                          forward at 3.05          pm     (1305).

FAST-TRACK PUBLISHING

Further to my letter of 7 February, I attach the draft of a
minute which I propose to put to the Lord President, which in
turn covers one for the Lord President to send the Prime Minister
about the fast-track publishing of Government reports.   I should
be grateful for any comments which you and John Gilbert in the
Home Office, to whom I am copying this letter, may have on these
drafts.

I should also be particularly grateful for your comments on the/
following points arising from your letter to me of 6 February:

       i.   Am I right in thinking that in the statement of the
       proposed performance standard in paragraph 7 of your letter,
       the figures for printing need to be added to those for
       typesetting to make up the total production time for a
       report?

       ii.  What difference,     if it h a d existed, w o u l d the
       performance standard which you propose have made to the
       publication of Lord Justice Taylor's report?

       iii.       What is the justification for not passing on to
       pu rch a s e r s the a ddi ti ona l cost of producing a report
       rapidly?         Why should Departments be asked to pick up the
       extra cost?        (Paragraph 8. of your letter refers.)

I should be graceful for              your     early      comments,    so that   I   can
minute the Lord President.

FAST-TRACK PUBLISHING OF GOVERNMENT REPORTS

Following the concern expressed by the Prime Minister about the

time taken to print Lord Justice T a y l o r 1s ,final report into the

Hillsborough      Stadium   disaster,       the   Lord    President     asked     me   to

enquire of HMSO what steps would be needed to establish a fast-

track arrangement for the future publication of such reports.                           I

have now had helpful responses from the Chief Executive of HMSO,

Dr Freeman, and from the Home Office.



2.      Dr   Freeman   proposes    that   HMSO     commit      themselves   to a jteW'

performance standard for the production of' important reports like

Lord Justice      Taylor’s.       Where   fast-track treatment of a report

was requested by the responsible Minister,                     HMSO would guarantee

the   following    production      times,    subject      to    three   working    days

notice of firm dates for delivery of final copy -and/or clearance

of proofs:



                          Typesetting                    Printing



      Up to 48pp              12 hrs                      2 days

      48pp-144pp              24 hrs                      3 days

      Over 144pp              36 hrs                      4 days
3.        D r .Freeman points out that the key to the fast publication

of reports          is    forward planning and                 subsequent adherence to the

agreed timetable by all                       concerned.          Obviously it would make no

economic          sense       for    HMSO      to maintain         permanently          idle   printing

capacity in case of an urgent requirement which might arise only

occasionally.             They therefore have to rely on buying the services

of       private     sector         printers, which            can    bie secured         to   meet    the

performance             standard       outlined        provided       that       sufficient     advance

notice         is    given.            Adequate         advance       notice       is     particularly

important where reports are to include maps, photographs, etc.



4.        Departments may have difficulty                         in setting a timetable for

the       printing        of    a     report         sufficiently          far    ahead    because      of

uncertainty about when its final text will be available.                                        Further

problems          can    arise       if      final    proof .stage         is used      not    just    for

checking typographical errors but as an opportunity to revise the

text.         This problem can be much reduced if the report is prepared

on word processing equipment which can output tape or disk in a

format        suitable         for    direct         input   to    the     printer’s typesetting

equipment.                But       th i s    too      requires           collaboration         between

Departments             and    HMSO jin -a d ^ l^ G G^ in         order      to    ensure      that    the

necessary technical requirements are met.



5.        The costs associated with the fast-track arrangements which

HMSr                                            •     ^ially      exceed     normal       print-buying

m    e    t   h   „ j.u iiab        xuny      uccn     che   accepted        practice      that   those

purchasing reports should not have to pay higher prices for them

because of the urgency or security required in a particular case.

Sponsor           Departments          could         therefore       on    occasion       be   asked    to
contr ibu te              to    any        exceptional                         costs          involved      in           fast-track

publishing.                What these costs might be could only be determined

in      discussion             between            HMSO               and    Departments              in   each particular

case.



6.       The        primary           lesson              of          all       this          is   the    need           for    close

collaboration and advance planning between Departments and HMSO.

Departments must                   identify well                           in advance the possible need for

fast handling of a particular report and consult HMSO at an earlv

stage about this and other aspects

I f this is done, photographs and illustrations can,                                                                for example,

be processed in advance of receipt of the rest of the text,                                                                         and

word     processing              can       be      used to                  speed         up production              of written

text.        For          its part,           and provided that the requisite notice is

given,        HMSO         is    prepared                 to          commit          itself        to    the        performance

standards outlined above.



7.       As -to           the      circumstances                           surrounding              publication                of   the

Taylor Report,                  I do not see advantage in post morteming them too

deeply.           Suffice it to say that HMSO did not receive the complete

copy of the report until mid-afternoon on Monday 22 January.                                                                        Had

HMSO   and we       can    usefully       take     advantage         of    the opportunity         to

remind    them      of    the    importance        of   planning          the    publication       of

reports      well    in    advance j and      of     close         collaboration      throughout

with HMSO.       A draft minute for this purpose is attached.

DRAFT MINUTE TO THE PRIME MINISTER




FAST-TRACK PUBLISHING OF GOVERNMENT REPORTS


In the wake of the problems we encountered over the publication

of Lord Justice Taylor's final report on the Hillsborough Stadium

disaster,      I have looked into the steps which would be needed to

establish ^ fast-track arrangement for the publication of similar

reports in future.



■2-.'   The   primary     lesson     underlined      by    our   experience        over     the

Taylor    report     is   the   need   for      close     collaboration      and advance

planning      between     the   Department        sponsoring      a   report      and   HMSO.

Departments must identify well                  in advance the- possible need for

the rapid publication of a report and consult HMSO at an early

stage     about     this    and      any    other       aspects       of   the     r e p o r t 's

publication j       If €his is done,            full advantage can be taken,                for

example,      of word processing           to   speed the production of written-

text.     Plans can be made for photographs and other illustrations

to be processed in advance of receipt of the rest of the text of

a report.



3.      Departments       may   of    course      have    difficulty       in     setting      a

timetable      for the production of a report sufficiently far ahead

because       of   uncer tai nt y     about      when     the    final     text    will      be

available.         Further problems        can arise if final proof stage                     is

used not just to correct typographical errors but to change the

actual text.        Again, this problem can be much reduced if a report
is prepared on word processing equipment which can output tape or

disk     in     a   format   suitable     for   direct     input    to   the    printer's

typesetting          equipment.       But     this   too    requires       collaboration

between Departments and HMSO in advance to ensure that"necessary

technical i^qtrrrenreirfcs- are met.            Advance planning and subsequent

adherence to the agreed timetable by all concerned emerge as the

key factors in achieving fast publication of reports.



4.      It would clearly make no economic sense for HMSO to maintain

a    permanently        idle    printing      capacity     in   case     of    an   urgent

requirement which might arise only occasionally.                         HMSO therefore

have to rely on buying the services of private sector printers, sl
Wa-wALtf! «&.
whi-en - can be secured 4**»rtime , provided sufficient advance notice

is    given.         HMSO    have,    however,       reviewed      their      performance

standard for the production of important reports like the Taylor

report,       and propose that where fast-track treatment is requested

by the responsible Minister,                 they would guarantee the following

production times,            subject to      three working days notice of firm

dates for delivery of final copy and/or clearance of proofs:



                               Typesetting                 Printing



      Up to 48pp                 12 hrs ’                   2 days

       48pp-144pp                24 hrs...                  3 days

      Over 144pp                 36 hrs                     4 days



If simultaneous publication of a report was required at several

locations in addition to London,                then an extra day would need to
5.     The costs associated with such fast-track arrangements could

substantially                 exceed normal          print-buying methods.               It has   long

been the accepted practice that those buying reports should not

have   to      pay            higher cover       prices        to   reflect     the urgency         or

security       required             in   a    particular      case.       Sponsor        Departments

could therefore on occasion find themselves asked to contribute

towards any exceptional costs involved in fast-track publishing.

6.     Colleagues               will     wish    to    be   aware   of    the   new      performance

standard        proposed            by       HMSO,    which    represents       a     considerable

improvement            on      existing       arrangements.         They will       also wish to

have   in     mind            the   other       lessons     Ihave   set   out   which       can    be

derived from our experiences over the Taylor report.

Departments,             the     Economic Secretary to              the Treasury,          Sir Robin

Butler and the Chief Executive of HMSO.

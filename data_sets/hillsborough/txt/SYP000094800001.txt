               I travelled           to S h e f f i e l d      by car and         left Liverpool        at    11.00 am     <1100)

               We went         via the Snake Pass and e x p e r i e n c e d a short                     delay on the

               m o t o r w a y due     to a crash.             We a r r i v e d    in S h e f f i e l d at   1.00   pm   (1300).

               I did not go to the m a t c h                    in 1988     (000088).          I had a terrace           ticket

              and my f riend               had a West S t a n d ticket.

              As we a p p r o a c h e d S h e f f i e l d we saw signs                   stating    "Parking 3 minutes

               f rom Ground. 5              The   signs        prove-d to be wrong.             There were L i verpool

               coaches         on the other             side   of the     road facing          out of town so we           parked

               up.      We ate       some     food       in the     car and       then w a l k e d down to the ground.

We sat        on the    grass     verge/£)y some           f a c t o r y units and the a t m o s p h e r e was

very friendly.               At abat^g        pm    (14QQ)       police       on horses irmvpd p v p r . w ne

o f f towards         the    gi^rund.

The    side     roads Were        all     cordoned off          py   the      police.       At   the shops         by

the ground           I a s k ed a police        officer taereN’B Section"                   was and he sent

me back up L e pp in gs Lane.                 As    I w a lk ed    back up L e p p i n g s Lane           I saw a

fri e n d who        told me     1 was     going     the wrong way.

I joined the queue               for    the terraces w h i c h was              s tretching         beyond the

perimeter         gates.       By this      time     there were          lots of       people       coming    down

Le p p in gs Lane and          if they had tickets                for    either       the North or West

Stands        they     tried to get       through the queues w hich a dded                       to the

confusion.             We    then heard a roar w h i c h          indicated the             teams were       on     the

pitch.         The     queue just       d i sa pp ea re d and     it became a mass               of people.

There were 3 police               on horses and            one of them spun his                  horse around

w hi ch    caused      people     to panic.          He    shouted       ’close       the gates S e r g e a n t . ’

I was      stuck      by his     horse and was w o r r i e d            I w o u l d get kicked.             Whe n fans

came      thro u g h the outer          pe rimeter        gates    there was a crush and                  I was

f orced up a ga i n s t        the     barrier at         the    side    of the turnstiles.                 Fans

could hear           roars    from     inside      the    ground and          the   crowd just        pressed

forward.         Lads were        climbing         up to get       out     of the way and others were

lifted up.             For a few minutes            it was      really scarey with               people      crying

and older men moaning.                   Police      officers        came      out and tried to             rescue

fans      by pulling         them out and trying                to get     people      to move       back.

S ome o n e    shou t e d    ’they've      opened a gate*            and      loads    of    lads    ran around.

After     a while       the    pressure       eased off.           There was a small                space    by the

wall      because      people     had     climbed up and           I found myself at                the   turnstile.

I just        t hrew my ticket at           the tur n s t i l e      operator and            he let me       in.        1

saw a p o l ic e m a n and told him the ground and the o r g a n i s a t i o n were                                crap.

I said to him           ’you want        to sort         something       out    outside.’

I tried to find a toilet                       but    couldn't         so    I had to use a wall             like

everyone          else,          I tried to find a s t e w a r d so               I could buy a programme

but      I c o u l d n ’t find one.

I got w o r r i e d        because        I thought            I ne e d e d a ticket       to    proceed     into     the

ground        itself,        rather       like they have at Wembley.                       I looked for         someone

to ask        but    couldn't          find anyone an d there were                  no     proper    signposts

either.           I saw the           tunnel and the             top of the goal and              I could see the

match      had started.                There was a big                rush down p e        tunnel.      It was        l ike

going      down to the M e rs ey               ferry - I tried               to/s 1ow myself        down because            I

was w al k i n g       so fast         but    the tunnel          gradient, was       so great.

W he n    I came out             of the      tunnel            tapj< 3 left turn and was             blas t e d o u t

onto      the     t e r r a ce.       I tried to move             to the side       but the        people      in front

were      crushed up a ga i n s t a barrier.                          I then tried to move away                but there

was      anot her      surge an d         I m an a g e d to duck            under a barrier.          The      people

behind me got              trapped.           There was a big tall                lad with a beard and

tra c k s u i t     top w i t h a gree n sash acr o s s                     it and a small guy         with a red
                   Kfi t                                                       V / / J10-
pullover who were being                       badly       cruffied.          I had hold of his         hand and

b lood was          t ri ck l i n g    from his ears and bile                   from his        nose and mouth.             I

t ried to         push them back              but    I c o u l d n ’tj all       I could do was         hold his

hand.

Two      police      offic e r s were          looking          down from the West S t a n d and               I tried

to    catch their           a t tention.            The    tall       lad had blood        coming    from his ears

and was         saying,          'Help me,      help m e . ’           I just    c o u l d n ’t do anything         except

wave      at the       police         officers.           I thought         the crush      w o u l d ease    but    it

d i d n ’t.       A no t h e r    surge      pushed       me away.          One of the      police    spoke      into

his      radio and         then w a lk ed away.                 The   other     officer     stayed and         looked

down.         I could see             to his    right          lads    clambering     up    into    the stands.             I

realised          I had to get out.                  At the       front      people were        climbing       over      the

fence.          There was          now just a             slow,       forward, quiet crush and              1 c o u l d n ’t

move      either       left or         right.        I was       lucky      not to be      caught    on a barrier

in front          of me-           A m i d d l e - a g e d man                     fell   by me but           I managed            to hold

onto       his    hand.           I kept        thinking                    the     pitch access            gates w o u l d open but

it was         just a blue              barrier             in front                of us.       The gate            then opened a n d we

he l p ed      people        get       up to        it.          The          next    thing      I found myself                    right up

a g ai n s t     the       fence.        There         was a young                    lad who       had a bad arm and we

managed          to get       him out.                Whe n he got                    out we       cheered.

At       the front          there were metal                          barrier         s u p ports     sticking               out    and people

were       falling          over       them.         There was a lot of screaming.                                           People were

climbing          over       to get           out     and             I remember            thinking         how disg u s t i n g           it     was

people         should        climb over               others                 to get       out.

Fans were          jammed           in the gate                  opening and                people were               piled up agai n s t

it.        I tried to get                to the gate                         but    the   pressure was so great rny sides

were       hurting          and     thance were                 sipots in my eyes.

were       dragging          people           out — they                     both did a great               job.          Ihen all           of a

was       impo ssible         because you just                               c o u l d n ’t move.           I was      holding             the

railings and                I could see              people                  dead by them.            I saw a young

p o l ic ew o m an trying               to     pull         out what                I think was a young                      girl who was

caught         in the        bodies           by the gate.

liy glasses            fell       off an d          I tried to get them.                            I was            hanging        onto         the

fence a n d        it took ages                 to      lift myself                   out    over     the        bodies.           The       bald,

se r g e a n t and          p ol i c e w o m a n helped me out.                             I was     behind the goal                       feeling

awful       w h e n they s ta rt ed                 laying                 bodies     out    beside me.

The       police were             trying        to do their                        best   for    those        fans a n d           I asked

them what they w an t e d me                         to do.                   A p o l i c e m a n told me to give a fan

heart massage.                    Wh i l s t    I did that                     he was       giving m o u t h - t o - m o u t h .                 There

was a L i verpool                 fan next           to me                 in a beany        hat    giving           heart massage                 to a

lad.

A fter a short w hile a pol i c e m a n took                                         over    the    heart mass a g e               from me and

I a s k ed the         lad     in the beany hat            if    I could help him.               He    then did

m o u t h - t o - m o u t h whilst        I did heart massage.                 Another      lad who was           doing

mouth-to-mouth               got    covered       in sick as the          injured        lad vomited.

I went         back    to the       lad    I was first          helping as       the     p o l iceman m o v e d

away.          I did heart mass a g e             but    I must    have       been doing        it wrong         as a

p o li c e m a n next        to me said          I had to a p p l y the         pressure       to the middle             of

the    chest.          He    then said,          " I t ’s no good - h e ’s d e a d . ”           I looked at the

l a d ’s face         but    I c o u l d n ’t leave       him.     A p o liceman w a l k e d          past and      I

g r ab be d his        leg an d a sk ed          him to help me.              He knelt down and felt                for a

pulse        in the        l a d ’s neck.        " Y o u ’ve done your         best    but h e ’s been dead              for

3 m in ut e s , "      he said.           I c o u l d n ’t believe       it?    I had gone         to the match

an d there was a fellah                    dead.        I carried on w i t h the heart massage                      just

hoping         for a flicker             and the guy      in front       of     me gave me encou r a g e m e n t

not    to give         up.      A bloke       came over         from    the terraces a n d said               could he

help and showed me a green                        card.     1 told       him what        had h a p pened and he

took over            the    heart massage.

I can remember               seeing a young             girl w ith      black    hair      lying      nearby.       Her

top was         ripped an d her            breast was       showing.           Her    b o y f r i e n d was   crying

over     her.         All    the    bodies were          just    lying    there with the              impressions         of

the wire m e sh fence                on their       faces.

The a m b u la nc e a r r i v e d and as                I tried to help a fan a pol i c e m a n shouted

for    help to         rip down the fences.                 As    I had no medical             exp e r t i s e    I went

over     to help.            I c o u l d n ’t u n d er st an d why some          police were          just       standing

a r ou n d     looking at          us?    even    if they had a t t e m p t e d to do s o mething                  it

w o u l d have        been a help.

We    pushed and            pulled at the          bottom of the          fence       to try and break             it.

The welds            broke a n d we w r ap pe d          it back       like a sardine          can and then we

s t ar t e d    to    pull    people       out.      I pulled an old man out and he said,

"Thanks         lad," an d         collapsed.           I took    him onto       the     pitch and shou t e d for

police         assistance.           One    came over.

I went      back a n d d ra g g e d out              a          tall man w i t h black           hair and a black

pullover.            He     c ol la p s e d and      Itook       him across          the   pitch and           called for

police       help.          I went      back a ga i n and got another                  lad out.          He wore

glasses       but     they fell           off.       1went       back       to get    them and         1 put them in

his    r ig h t - h a n d    pocket.        Just as          I did a policeman             looked at me.              I

w o r r y a bout      this        in case       they think          I was    dipping       his    pockets.

A group of           police        then    ripped down more             fencing an d m any more                  fans

were     now being           rescued.           I saw a f r i e n d     of mine who was worr i e d

because       he     c o u l d n ’t find his         dad or brother.

I went       back     by the goal           area an d help a fire m a n or St John's

A m b u l a n c e m a n w i t h an oxyg en tank.                It just       had a tube sticking                 from it

wit h no mask.               He was       going     round o f f e r i n g     oxygen.

The    police were             leaving      the     bodies      be h i n d the goal         for    checking        if they

were     dead.        Some        had   coats     covering          their     heads.       I then started             to

look at the           faces        just    to make       sure       people were a c t u a l l y         dead.         I

remember           seeing a young           girl     for      the    last    time,     she was         1/2    (half)       on

the    pitch and            1/2    (half)       on the track.           The    police       s t a r t e d to     load

bodies       into     the a m b u l a n c e      but the a m b u l a n c e m a n said        it was          for the

injured.            I h e l p ed a pol i c e m a n get an old man                 into      the ambulance.                 I

had his        legs an d          he had his arms.              The    officer a c c i d e n t a l l y        banged his

head     (the old man's)                as we got him           into the ambulance.                    Wit h another

ma n who was          the     old m a n ’s son,          I    then helped him           into      bed.        I made       sure

he was       talking         to me        and    I a sk e d him       for    his false      teeth       in case       he

s w al l o w e d    them.         His     son a l r e a d y had       them    in his hand.             I a sked the

other man wit h us to                     talk     to him and         not    let him fall asleep.

The    bodies were            being m ov ed to the              b o t to m   left-hand       corner          of the

ground.            I carr i e d the        chap     I'd tried to help across                     the    pitch,        A

pol i c e m a n helping            us took off his            helmet and        put     it on the            g u y ’s legs.

I threw his hat off an d said he was                                a human     being not a coathanger.                         I

was argu i n g w ith him but after we                         put     him down by          the    bottom        corner of
                                                                                                           PAGE             7
                                                                                                           S3906

the gro u n d         I said       I was    sorry.        He was    helping and here was me telling

him off.             He    said    it was alri g h t and         that     he understood.           He    ran back

ac r o s s     the    pitch to see what more                he    could do.

At the         b ottom      corner    of the       ground there was a mass                   of bodies wit h

people         crying       over    them.     A man wit h a green               blazer wit h an         I .D . badge

on it,         who    had a radio,          saw to the       fan we       brought across.             I checked

the    bodies         that were       unattended.

S o me o n e    said a body was             breathing;       it was a young             lad in denim gear and

red hair.             A p o li ce ma n and     I lifted him up.                 "Make way,       h e ’s alive," we

shou t e d and went               to the     gymnasium. There were 3 of us                     carrying     him        and

w h e n we got            to the    door     it was       like      a horror movie wit h all                the    bodie

an d g r i eving           people,     A doctor       s t o p p e d us and a sked            if he was dead or

alive;         I said he was alive             and    please       get    out       of the way and       let me        in.

He said         he w a n t ed      the dead to the          right a n d the           injured to the       left        - I

just     s c r e am ed at him to             let me       in, I went      into the gym          and     I felt

absolutely            shattered.           1 saw an official             in a green blazer and he asked

if he was dead.                   I told him he was alive.                    The    official    told us we were

in the wrong area,                  so we m o v e d him,          I /spoke to the            lad to get him to

wake     up and he s ta r t e d mu mbling.                  I was rrWde up that               he was alive.            He

said     he was           from Maghull.                                   ^

I then         reali s e d that all          the    people       laid out were          dead -    I just     cried.

An official               came    over and    put me a g a i n s t       the wall       and said      I must      be

strong         for    the    likes    of the kid.           I then told the             lad he would be

a lr i g h t and          I went    back outside.           It was       very quiet and          I heard

D al g l i s h say the m a t c h was abandoned.

We s ta r t e d our          jour n e y home.        At H u d d e r s f i e l d we tried to        phone    home

but the         lines wer e         engaged.       E v e n t u a l l y we got through           to my mother.

I told her            of the various          local       people    I had seen who were OK.

It was         great the way          people       came    out   of their           houses    to give    us tea,

cold water and to                  let us use       the    phone.        So m any      people    did so much.

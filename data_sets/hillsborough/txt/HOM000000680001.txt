 to        identify            officers           for        particular            duties.              I stressed               to    these

 officers             that         they      needed           to     be    fully        aware       of       the      emergency

 evacuation                  procedures            and        pointed           out     to    them       the       fact         that      the       upper

 fire        was      greatest              at    that        end.

perimeter              track.           There         was a     slow        build       up      of      crowd        from       that       time,

though        it       appeared          that        Nottingham             Forest             supporters            were       arriving

in     greater          numbers          than        the       Liverpool             supporters.                I made          comment         on

this     to       several          officers             as     I spoke          to    them       during         my      patrol.            I recall

sometime           before          2    pm        (1400) v i s i t i n g        the     room         under      the       South       Stand

was     made       by    someone             in     there       that       there       were          12,000        in     the    ground         at

that     time,          and       at    the       same       time     the       previous             year     there        had       been

20,000        m        the    ground.

Sometime           around          2. pm       (1400)          I noticed             problems           were       being        experienced

with     my       radio.           There          was     an    intermittent                   buzzing        type        noise       which         .

made      reception               very       poor       and     difficult             to       understand.                At    this       time         I

 had    an    earpiece             extension              in    use.        I took             this     off     but       it    made       no

 As     the    photographers                   were       moved       on       it would          be    about       3.05        pm    (1505)

  and    I was        about         to    take       my    place          just    inside          the       tunnel        when       I looked

  towards          the      Leppings           Lane       terracing             and    saw       what       appeared           to    be     some

 my     way    round          to    that       location,             Supt.       Greenwood             was       some     20    yards           in

  there       way     there.             When       I got       to    the       section          of    the       terrace        to    the

 South        side       of    the       centre          I could          see    there          were    people           crushed          up

 against           the      perimeter           fencing.              Some       were       obviously             unconscious,                  many

  others       clearly             could       not       move    at       all,    and       were       having          difficulty

  breathing.                The     gate       which       gave       access          to    this       pen       was.open           and     ,

       terrace,         through          the       gate       and     onto       the       pitch.       I alternated                between

       assisting            with       this    and       helping          others           who    were       climbing          over       the

        perimeter           fencing.           I    lost       all     track          of    time       as    this       continued          until

        the    central           section       of       the    terrace           had       been    cleared.              During       this

        time    I cannot              recall       having        heard         any     radio       messages-,            but    the       noise

        from    the     ground          was    deafening.                 When        the    terrace             was    clear       there,were

       many     of    the        fans    obviously             in a       very        distressed             state,          some    were

       ••crying      together           in    groups,          others          were        shouting          abuse       at    Police

        officers        -    some       abuse       was       directed           at    blaming          Police          Officers          for

        what- h a d     h a p p e n e d . / Thait scr i t i c i s m              was- a l w a y s       d-i r e c t e d i n t he          te rms

        ' I t ’s y o u r     fault,          you    should          have       given        us    more       tickets’.

        I became        aware          that    a    police          cordon        had       been       formed          towards       the    Spion

        Kop    end    preventing              Liverpool             supporters              going       to       that    end.        As    order

        Legsri to 's 1 o r l y ' - V ^ s W r e ;/ a n d             the     pitch          cleared          of    bodies       I tried.to

     ‘ ’ assemble       a    s e r i a I of        officers           together.              Those          I assembled             were

        officers        mainly          from       serial        H.       We     then       assisted             in    slowly       clearing

        the    pitch        after       it    was       announced           that       the       match       had       been    cancelled;.

        After     the       pitch       was    cleared           I did         not     assist          in a n y        particular          duty.

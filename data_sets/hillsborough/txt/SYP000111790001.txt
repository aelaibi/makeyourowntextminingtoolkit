       . Glenville IUKE
         Detective Constable 735
  '      F2 CUD

Onsaturday 15th April 19^9 I commenced duty at F2 CID at Jam.
I attended a briefing at Hilssborough football ground at 9»^5sun.and wasthoroughly
breifed on my personal duties by D.I. Scaife upon completion of the general breifing
which was also clearly given, by other senior officers, in relation to the semi final#

My personal duties were as follows: I was to be on mobile patrol in an un marked car
in company with D.C. 1600 Jones and D.I. Scaife. We were casually dressed and had
responsibility for the prevention/detection of thefts of/from/damage to vehicles attending
the semi final over a wide range of local streets and thoroughfares.on the Foxhill
Middlewood Hoad side of the football ground.

The mobile patrol was also to be used to ferry foot patrol officers toany    area requiring
 their attention with vehicle security in mind.

 Due to volume of traffic and density of footpassengers near to ,and around the "'round
 progress in the vehicle became increasingly slower as attempts were made to reach
 known areas of high risk crime wise.

 At 1.30pm in company with DI Scaife and D.C. Jones I attended S.W.F.C. and received
 a meal which was taken in the gymnasium and at 2pm in company with the same officers I
 resumed patrol. Traffic was now very congested and progress was slow. The same brief
 applied and particular attention was given toWisewood,Foxhill,Mi§f|lewood ,IIerries Road
 and Halifax road together with adjoining side streets which were by now thronged with
 parked vehicles and largg crowds of people could be seen drinking in groups outside
 public houses in the area. I can remember seeing not only loud men,and women drinking out
 of glasses but also drinking out of bottles and cans (cider,beer lager)It was apparent
 that the public houses were full and the people outside were the ’overspill’.
 This continued right up to kick off time. The radios were constantly in use however our
 two personal radios suffered from poor reception beleived due to the geographical aspects
 of the city (many hills and large buildings). A message was received at 3P1-1 ish to attend
 the ground. To clarify the position D.I Scaife ,D.C. Jones   end I attended Foxhill police
 box in order to use the telephone there. D.I Scaife managed to contact F2 control from
 this location and as a result of that we were instructed to get to the ground.

 This was attempted immediately however due to volume of traffic the vehicle we were in had.
 to be left in Halifax Koad and together with the same officers I continued to the ground on
 foot. Upon arrival there we entered the ground by the rear of the north stand off Pen&stofae
 Hoad. I there' can remember seeing uniformed officers and CID officers together with members
 of the general public. Many looked shocked and dismayed. Ambulances were present at that
 location and injured persons were being treated. D.I scaife had a conversation with a
 police officer (unknown to me although he was wearing a uniform ) in my prsen.ee and the
 officer was crying. Together with DI Scaife and D.C. Jones I walked to the pitch and
  I recall the horrific    sight of seeing dead and injured supporters being assisted by police
 officers from the pitch area towards the Gym area. Ma .y were crying and there was
  confusion with so many people wandering and rushing in all directions. Many police officer
 WBBe stru gling to carry injured and as it turned, out ,dead, persons from the field and
  we tried to assist where we could in this respect although, I presume due to our casual
  mode of dress, we were not immediately recognised as police officers . Although I gave
  assistance I left the bodies with the officers who already had possession, and I did not
  see the Le pings Lane gate opened or even know at that stage what had happened*

 I beleived there had been a pitch invasion by Liverpool fans at this stage and thought
 that possibly fighting had caused the injuries although this was later to be clarified
 as not so. I t was a    scenewhich is difficult to describe since some matters remain
 clear in the mind andothers become fogged   . I feel that unless you were there then the
 scene cannot oe imrnagined. DI Scaife obviously saw the need to work in an organised
  manner and   together with D.C. Jones    I left the field with him to attend the Gym.
  Once there it was apparent that the     situation was grotesque, and the problems enormous.

„ Det Sup£ McKay was in attendance at the gym. DI Scaife approached him and as he did so
   I looked around me and saw about two dozen bodies lying on the floor with police
    officers in attendance*     D.I Scaife concluded his brief with D. Supt McKay and as a
    result I, and D.C. Jones a.companied him to Foxhill Police box to assertain by land line
    the number of spare mortuary places which were available in the force area.
  Shocked and dismayed people were attending the police box and assistance was given to them
  to allow them to contact their relatives who would obviously be   concerned .
  DI Scaife, D.C. JQnes and I returned to the Ground and passed the appropriate information
  to Detective Superintendent McKay.    That done the three of us were instructed to attend
  Hammerton Road Police station-where relatives of the deceased persons were being cared for.
  The journey to Hammerton Road took some 40 minutes due to traffic congestion.
  Upon arrival at that location, D I Scaife and I were instructed to visit the local
   hospitals with a view to instructing the officers at those locations regarding the details
   required by the Casualty Bureau at Ecclesfield Training centre. It was apparent upon
   arrival at those locations that the officers in attendance already had the situation well
   in hand.

  DI Scaife and I returned to the gymnasium at S.V/.F.C. and were then instructed to
  take Professor Usher to a fatal house fire which had occused in F2 division and had
  suspicious circumstances surrounding it.

  I then transported Prof Usher to the incident and from there back to the Hil&sborough
  incident. At that tine a further matter had occured at Ecclesfield requiring my assistance
  involving firearms and H liras recalled to my division to asist with that.


  I was not present at Leppings lane at any time. I have previous experience of policeing the
  ground but not for many years and not in this manner.

  My feelings at the time were of disbelief and a long lasting memory of what appeared to
  be an unreal situation*

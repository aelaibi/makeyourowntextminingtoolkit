           talaphoned, Three members of tha Executive
"Committee’were appointed by council this morning, We
agreed that was very good news indeed. There was some

by the response on the            Ilatter. Surely someone must
have filad it somewhere, At least it ought to have been
acknowledged, She said that was the case but it was likely

it, ’Glven would be sending us a draft tomorrow morning in
order that we could have a look at it before the afternoon
-.nesting.

Engaged 10 minutes including dictation

                there were P o l i c e m e n           dotted about,              I saw some         fans    drinking      from

                forming any sort                of quei^es to go through tJhe turnstiles.

                There were          two m o u n t e d ^ o l i c e m e n     inside    the        perimeter     gates who were

                trying        to get them         into some          sort of queue.

                The    four       of us went       through the standing                   turnstiles.          Once we got

                through the t ur n s t i l e s           there was about             ten P o l i c e m e n who were

                sea r c h i n g    the fans.           I ’ve been to this            ground         before and have

                p r evious ly used the             tunnel          to the    standing area and               I know     i t ’s ma r k e d

^    q          There was a constant                   flow of people             through the tunnel               but we w e r e n ’t

                and we went             to the    right       of    it.     The four       grf    us stood together              in

                position ma r k e d H3 on the grid.                         The    tirrij^ we took        up position was

                There was a lot of                people       in this Pen but you                  could move about.

                At this        time      it was    no more          packed than usual.               There was a constant

                flow     of    people      coming       in.

            The    gate was        closed almost            immediately.

            people were           shouting at          them to        let ys out.

            I saw various           people       trying       to cliri/b over             the    perimeter        fence and were

            There was also              twenty P o l i ce me n just           standing aboi/t by the goal                      mouth.

            saw some fans           run onto         the    pitch and         started? to appeal                 to the    players.

I had been s ep ar a t e d            from my three mates at this                       time and I knew

things were           serious        so I star t e d to          look    for a phone to phone my mum.

I. saw no bodies              in the        tunnel      except    for one       lad who was     in the m outh

of the       entrance         being    carried by three                or four    others who laid          him on

the     floor       in the y a r d by the toilet.

I saw him later               being    carried to an ambulance.

He was about               16/17 years        of age,      short       black    hair.

He was wear i n g           blue     denim jeans and a dark                   coloured top.

I m a na ge d to           phone my Mum and went             back       to find my friends.           I first

left the         ground at          1520 hours and          returned about             1535 hours.     1 found

At about         1600 hours,          we went        back to the         coach but no one was          there.

We    e ve n t u a l l y    found             at   1645 hours.

We    left     by    c o a c h at    about     1 80 0    hours    to    come    home    and   I arrived     home

at a b out 2 10 0 h ou r s .

Whe n     I went       into    the    tunnel       before    the match,          I saw a stew a r d by the

entrance.            This was about            1400 hours.

There were           no P o l i c e m e n    checking      tickets       before we went         through the

outer      perimeter          gates.

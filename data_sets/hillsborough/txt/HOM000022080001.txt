                   Dear Mr. Sweet,

                                                     re                              The Hillsborough Enquiry.

                         I confirm our telephone conversation and that a Consortium of Firms of
                   Solicitors instructed on behalf of the dependants of those who died and on behalf
                   of those who were injured at Hillsborough has been formed.   A Steering
                   Committee under my Chairmanship was elected last night, and our clients will
                   be represented by Counsel, Mr. Tim King at the opening of the Enquiry on
                   Friday.

                                 I am very much obliged for your help and will be in touch later.




                                 Yours sincerely,                                                                                       I            \

Dear Nick,

Ee: CASE NUMBERS 82-94 inclusive.


I believe that these cases include all the deceased (apart from
Lee ETicol; who we know died in hospital) who were moved to
one or other of the hospitals whether alive or dead from
the ground on the 15th of April.

I realise the pressure which you are under, particularly
because of the need to service the Public Inquiry, and
I also realise that you may not yet have all the information
together on these cases, but it would be very helpful if
you could please let me have whatever information is
available at the present time relating to the movement of
these bodies, from the ground, their reception or otherwise
at the hospitals and the death certification there or
elsewhere, insofar as you have been able to establish^it.

The reason why I need this information is to brief
the pathologists with any additional information which
may have come to light regarding these people, so that they
can re-consider and let me have any supplemental reports
which they may feel are appropriate or necessary.

Dear Sir

RE CASE NUMBERS 82-94 INCLUSIVE

With reference to your letter dated 8 June 1989 concerning the above, enquiries
are currently being made at the two hospitals concerned to establish the
details of treatment given to the deceased.  The full facts have not yet been
established but the details known to date are as follows:

Case numbers 82-84 and 86-94
Northern General Hospital.

All of the patients were taken to the hospital by ambulance and were initially
admitted to the resuscitation room.  A number of medical staff were engaged
with the patients and arrangements are in hand for all the staff to be
interviewed and details of treatment obtained.

An initial statement has been obtained from James WARDROPE, Consultant who was
in charge of the Accident and Emergency Department.  A copy of his statement is
attached for your information.

It is known that when resuscitation attempts failed the bodies were taken to a
nearby plaster room which was designated as a temporary mortuary.

The bodies were in the charge of a team of   five police officers and mortuary
attendants from the hospital.

DR DOORE certified death of each body in the plaster room, however we are
pursuing this further as we believe there may be an earlier certification by
the Doctor actually treating the patient.

The deceased were transported by ambulance, with a police officer, to            the
gymnasium at Hillsborough on the evening of      15 April 1989.

                                                                    Co nt i nu e d...




    PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE A T
                                          2.


Case number 85
Royal Hallamshire Hospital

The patient   was transported from the football ground by ambulance.    A statement
is attached   from DR GERRISH who outlines the treatment given.    Arrangements are
in hand for   DR McHUGH to be seen as the doctor was w it h the patient in the
ambulance.    DR LUMB certified death at 1740 hours at the hospital.



The enquiries outlined are being carried out as a matter of urgency and the
further details will be supplied to you as soon as possible.

Yours faithfully

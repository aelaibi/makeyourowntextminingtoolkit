EARLY. ABOUT 1450 HRS I REMA RKE D THAT THE STAND BEHIND THE GOALPOSTS AT THE
LEPPINGS LANE END WAS BY NO MEANS FULL BUT THE CENTRAL SECTION WAS EXTREMELY
FULL. JUST AS THE MATCH WAS STARTING MORE PEOPLE FLOODED IN THERE BUT THE SID!
SECTIONS REMAINED RELATIVELY EMPTY. I WISH TO KNOW WHY THIS HAPPENED, WHY
THERE WAS NO STEWARDING.

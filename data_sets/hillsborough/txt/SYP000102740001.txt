I am a Constable in the South Yorkshire Police.

At 10.0a.m. on Saturday 15th April, 1989* I commenced duty, in uniform,

 at the Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground on the occasion of the Semi-

Final of the F.A. Cup between Nottingham Forest and Liverpool Football

Clubs.

My duties on that day were to assist Police Constable 3071 Stephens at

the Directors Entrance at the rear of the South Stand.

At 1.0p.m. I left that location to take my meal in the Gymnasium and

returned to the Directors Entrance about 1.20p.m.

From conversations that I overheard from time to time over my personal

radio, about Kick-off Time, I realised that an emergency situation

was arising, and about 3»0p*m. ^ire Engines started to arrive at the

rear of the South Stand, followed by a number of ambulances, so for

quite some time I was engaged in the directing of the appliances as

           they arrived.

           I do not remember how long T actually did this duty but it was

           early evening when I returned to the gymnasium for further instructions.

           I was in the gymnasium about 8.0p.m. the same evening when I was

           instructed to attend the Northern General Hospital, Sheffield, and

           on arrival I was directed to the Mortuary where I was shown the

           body of a deceased girl,

           I travelled in an ambulance with the body as it was conveyed to the

           gymnasium of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

           On arrival the body was pronounced dead by Professor Usher, and in

           view of this I completed the sudden death report using details handed

           to me at the Hospital Mortuary.

          The following property was with the body at that time:

          Pair of woolen socks.

                       Bra.

                       Briefs.

          Brown Boots.

          White 'T' Shirt.

          Later the same evening I was present when Mr and Mrs HICKS, of

                                                                                        identified the

          body as being that of their youngest daughter Victoria Jane HICKS.

          All the property mentioned in this statement was then handed to

          Mrs HICKS against signature, together with other items sent directly

          from the Northern General Hospital,

          About 10.30p.m. that evening I accompanied the body by ambulance to

          the Mortuary, Watery Street, Sheffield, where she was handed over

          against my signature.

          At the timo nf ViawHmwj mror there was no property with the body.

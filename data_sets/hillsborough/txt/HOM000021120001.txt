FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL:    APPEALS AGAINST REQUIREMENTS      OF THE
FOOTBALL LICENSING AUTHORITY ON SAFETY

I attach a draft letter to DoE setting out our case on appeals.
Mr Goddard told me that he was not enthusiastic about the need
for an avenue of appeal by the police, and I have toned down that
part of the letter since speaking to him.

If there are no comments on the draft I would like to send it to
DoE as soon as possible.

FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL:               PART I - APPEALS AGAINST FLA DECISIONS
ON SAFETY


We    had   a word        on the telephone when we discussed Parliamentary
Counsel's          letter   of   21   September   to   Richard   Clayton   about   the
question of appeals under               section 5 of Safety of Sports Grounds
Act    1975    (the 1975 Act)         in the   light of clause       13 of the Bill.
Clearly       we    now   need   to resolve    our policy    quickly    in order to
give instructions to Counsel.

that not only should the Football Licensing Authority be under an
obligation to consult before issuing requirements relating to the
terms       and     conditions            of   a     safety    certificate,        but     that    the
certificate issued in consequence of those requirements should be
subject to appeal in the same way as if it were any other safety
certificate.                   — o                                        v               >k-' H) nardiaffi

m     our view too high a hurdle for what may in practice require a

We    also     have       in mind    that     .he purpose          of giving         an    avenue   of
appeal to the police and to                   .he fire authority,               is that they are
the      services          which     in     practice                        make          operational

changes       to the       terms    and    conditions        of the       safety      certificate.
There should,             in our view,       k e an appropriate avenue for -them to
challenge requirements which they consider unworkable even if in

made -by-.the .FLA,.


You     asked        whether     in practice        there     were   many       appeals       against
terms        and conditions of safety certificates.                         I am told that in
the ten years             or so when appeals were made to the                         Secretary of
State,       some 6 or 7 were started,                but all of them were withdrawn
following local agreement before any deliberation was necessary.
We     have     no      information       about     the   number     of     appeals        since    the
system was changed by our 1937 Act,


I do not think that we should be concerned that the existence of
an avenue of appeal will water down the authority of the FLA.                                        It
may      however          serve     to     ensure      that    the        FLA     does       not    act
unreasonably               or     ride      r oug hsho d      over        p o ints        raised     in
consultation.              If that       is the case,       actual resort to the appeal
procedure will continue to be minimal,                         but the reputation of the
FLA     will      be      higher    than     if     there     are    unresolved            grievances
against arbitrary decisions.

Nowhere has this been seen more than in looking at brigades

reviews of fire risk categorisation.



Whilst many Chief Fire Officers have taken bold,   imaginative and

far-sighted action to put into effect their recommendations, we

are also aware that there have been a number of instances where

fire authorities have been reluctant to take steps to eliminate

over-provision of fire cover.

CONTRIBUTION TO DCO LETTER
DCOL *7 /89 ITEM



NOTIFICATION        TO        FIRE   AUTHORITIES OF CHANGES                  TO   THE   FACTORY
R    E    G          I          S     T    E    R   '                             ~~      :


Chief Fire Officers will be aware that since 1 January 1981 the
Factory Inspectorate have no longer been able to forward to Fire
Authorities amendments to the factory register.


2.      This    lack     of    information was           brought   to    light     by the two
fires which occurred in late 1983 - the first on 2 6 October when
five women died, and two more were injured,                        in a clothing factory
at Mile End Road, East London; the second on 6 November 1983 when
7 members of a family in Gravesend died when a fire broke out in
the terraced house where they lived - the fire occurring in the
basement and ground floor which were used as a shoe factory.


3.      The Mile       End Road      fire occurred          in premises which had not
been registered as a factory under section 137 of the Factories
Act 1961 and concern was expressed by the media and in Parliament
that     there      could       be   quite       large     numbers      of    similar     small
factories        ("sweatshops")        in    which        fire   precautions        and   other
safety measures were less than adequate.


4.      Even    though        there was     no    simple    answer      to    the problem of
identifying small             factories,     it was clear that fire authorities
needed the information, previously supplied on a form 1 0 2 , to be
restored       to   them,      the   need    for    information      being        strengthened
because    of the change to the Fire Precautions Act                              1971 brought
about by the Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987,
and the effect of these changes on small factories.

    I understand your reluctanc i to                   fetter the FLA and that appeal
    provisions here might draw Attention to their absence elsewhere
    in    the     Bill.        However     tli«; difference      is   that        clause       13    is
    tampering with the workings of present legislation which already
    provides for an appeal systea.                 The need to retain appeal rights
    for all involved seems to us even more relevant if we are to now
    introduce          yet   another    safety    agencyt empowered         to    amend    safety
    certificates.


    Perhaps       we    should meet      agai     to   clear    the   air    on    all    of    this
    before we start putting subm Lssions to our respective Ministers?
m   If    you     agree      perhaps    you^ £ ecretary      could    contact       mine       for   a
    convenient          date   so   that   we    can   get   together       and    settle       this
    issue.

                                                               Yours sincerely

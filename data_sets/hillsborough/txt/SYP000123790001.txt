 TELLING PEOPLE TO GET BACK & NOT TO CLIMB ONTO THE PITCH.

 DID YOU ASSIST ANYONE WHO WAS DEAD OR INJURED T IF SO, BRIEFLY EXPLAIN.

 YES, WE GOT I   IlHE GIRL OUT BECAUSE AT ONE STAGE SHE WAS NEARLY SUFFOCATED

 AND WE GOT HER OUT AT ABOUT QUARTER PAST 3 PM <i515).        AT ABOUT 2 3 PAST 3 PH

 (1525) THE CRUSH HAD EASED OFF AND I SAW A PILE OF UNCONSCIOUS AND DEAD

 BODIES UP AGAINST THE FRONT FENCE ABOUT 3 FEET HIGH,      8 FEET WIDE AND 8 FEET

 DEEP.   I HELPED TO GET THESE BODIES OUT ONTO THE PITCH TO THE PEOPLE WHO WERE

 DOING MOUTH TO MOUTH AND HEART MASSAGE.


Q 17

 049

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR       IN THE DEATHS,    OR THE

 Juries   to any person?

 YES THE RAILINGS THAT RUN FROM THE PITCH TO THE REAR, THE SIDE RAILINGS,

 PREVENTED YOU FROM SPREADING OUT.    AT THE HOP AT ANFI ELD THERE ARE NO SIDE

 RAILINGS SO THE CROWD SPREADS OUT. PEOPLE CLIMBED OVER THE RAILINGS ONTO THE

 PITCH AND I SAW THE FRONT GATE OPENED AND PEOPLE THROWN BACK IN BY POLICE

 JUST AFTER THE KICK OFF.   THIS WAS BEFORE THE MATCH WAS S T O P P E D »

 OF OUR OWN ACCORD


Q 18

 Q3H
 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO,

 Q53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,
                                                                                 PAGE   9

AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED ,

THE LOUD SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT AT 3=45       (1545) WAS VERY UNCARING BECAUSE PEOPLE

WERE STILL CARRYING DEAD AND INJURED OUT OF THE PENS AND SOMEONE SAID OVER

THE LOUD SPEAKER FOR THE FANS TO GET OFF THE PITCH.

ALSO THE POLICE SEEMED TO HAVE GONE T H E R E , POSSIBLY EXPECTING TROUBLE, SO

WHEN THE INCIDENT OCCURRED THEY REACTED TO IT AS THOUGH IT WAS HOOLIGANISM

INITIALLY AND AUTOMATICALLY RATHER THAN TO WHAT WAS ACTUALLY OCCURRING,,             IT

TOOK A WHILE FOR THEM TO REALISE.

I PULLED TWO PEOPLE    OUT OF THE PILE OF DEAD BODIES AND HANDED          THEM OUT', IWAS

CONVINCED THAT THEY    WERE GOING TO BE OKAY AND THAT THEY WOULD          BE ABLE         TO

^ p^ IVE THEM,   HOWEVER , THE THIRD ONE WAS TOTALLY LIFELESS, H E ’D BEEN SICK AND

WET HIMSELF AND HIS    FACE WAS BLUE AND I KNEW THAT HE WAS DEAD          AND I "M        AFRAI

I WENT TO PIECES AS    I HELD HIM AND I JUST CLIMBED OUT OF THE PEN OVER THE

FENCE AND COLLAPSED    CRYING ONTO THE PITCH,

Q54

IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

PEOPLE WERE DYING AT THE LEPPINGS LN END AMD THE POLICE WERE ACROSS THE

PITCH MORE CONCERNED WITH SEGREGATING THE FANS WHO WERE NOT CONCERNED WITH

ANY TROUBLE, RATHER THAN HELPING PEOPLE.

^Pfeo THE PHOTOGRAPHERS WERE BAD BECAUSE A LOT OF THEM WERE MORE CONCERNED

WITH TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS THAN WITH HELPING THE INJURED, BUT SOME DID DROP THEIR

EQUIPMENT AND HELP.

SOME OF THE FOREST FANS STARTED CHANTING AT THE LIVERPOOL FANS AFTER

EVERYTHING HAD HAPPENED AND THAT UPSET A LOT OF PEOPLE,

IT WAS BETTER ORGANISED LAST YEAR,       NO ONE COULD GET CLOSE TO THE TURNSTILES

WITHOUT A TICKET BUT THIS YEAR IT WAS A FREE FOR ALL.

ROUND TO THE W I N G S .   I'VE NEVER BEEN THERE BEFORE SO I JUST D I D N ’T KNOW WHICH

WAY TO GO.      THE LOUDSPEAKERS WERE INADEQUATE.       I DID N ’T GO LAST YEAR SUT I

 I ARRIVED OUTSIDE THE LEPPINGS LANE GATES AT A80UT 2.25.                THERE WERE A LOT OF

 PEOPLE TRYING TO GET IN.          THERE WERE TWO POLICE HORSES TRYING TO GET US IN

 SOME KIND OF ORDER.          (IT WAS JUST A MASS OF PEOPLE TRYING TO GET INTO 4 (I

 THINK) TURNSTILES.)          I GOT IN WITHOUT TOO MUCH TROUBLE.       I HAD A TICKET THAT

SOME HAD BEEN        DRINKING BUT IT MEANT MERRIMENT,

I WENT UNDER THE TUNNEL TOWARDS THE TERRACING AND WENT ONTO THE LEFT HAND

SIDE,    I POSITIONED MYSELF ABOUT HALFWAY BACK TO THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE

GOALS„

BUT BECAUSE OF A COUPLE OF SURGES           (NORMAL HATCH DAY PRACTICE)      AMD THE FACT I

COULD ONLY SEE THE GOALS ON THE OPPOSITE END THROUGH THE F E N C E S , I MOVED BACK

TO POSITION 8.

I READ HY PROGRAMME AND EVERYTHING WAS AS USUAL AT A HATCH,

WHEN THE PLAYERS CAME ONTO THE PITCH I NOTICED THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT '10 CL.AH

BECAUSE WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER.            IT WAS THEN I THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS

GOING TO BE A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE,            I D I D N ’T NOTICE THE MATCH STARTING,

IT WAS VERY TIGHT AND YOU C O U L D N ’T MOVE WHERE YOU WANTED.           A ’L A D Y 5 NOT FAR

FROM ME ON MY        RIGHT SAID TO HER BOYFRIEND,     ’THIS IS NOT MUCH F U N . ’ PEOPLE

WERE SHOUTING        AT THE POLICE WHO WERE WALKING PAST FROM LEFT TO RIGHT,           ’GET      US

OUT OF H E R E . ’   I THINK   I SHOUTED THAT AS WELL,     ALL THE POLICE JUST WALKED

PAST - THEN A POLICEWOMAN NOTICED AND A LAD STARTED CLIMBING OVER THE FRONT

FENCE.    A POLICEMAN STARTED RADIOING AND SOME OTHER PEOPLE STARTED CLIMBING

OVER THE FENCE,        AT FIRST THE POLICE WERE TELLING PEOPLE TO GET BACK IN.                I

NOTICED THE POLICEWOMAN HELPING SOMEONE WHOSE SHOE BECAME STUCK.                   I REALISED

    HAD TO GET OUT.         I THOUGHT I W A S N ’T GOING TO GET OU1 ,

IT GOT VERY HOT.        WE WERE SLOWLY GETTING PUSHED TOWARDS THE FRONT AND CORNER

DIAGONALLY,

A BLOKE ON HY RIGHT - A COUPLE AWAY WAS SHOUTING AT ANOTHER BLOKE TO GET HIS

ELBOW AWAY FROM HIS FACE - BUT HE C O U L D N ’T HELP      IT,    IT WAS VERY TIGHT,,

EVENTUALLY WE CAME TO A CRUSH BARRIER.            I WAS PARTLY LEANING ON A GUY ON THE

CRUSH BARRIER ON MY LEFT - I COULDN’T HELP IT. A GUY NEXT TO ME SAID D O N ’T

MOVE, Y O U ’RE ON MY LEG.        I SAID I WASN’T AND I DIDN’T MOVE.        THE GUY BEHIND

ME SAID WHEN YOU GET THE CHANCE GET UNDER THE BARRIER,                  (THIS WAS TO GET

CLOSER TO THE FRONT TO GET OUT.)
                                                                              PAGE

 WE COULDN’T SEE HOW BAD IT WAS IN FRONT OF US.      PEOPLE WERE SHOUTING TO GET-

 OUT,     EVERYBODY WAS GETTING UNDER THE BARRIER AND TRYING TO GET TO THE FRONT

 IN ORDER TO GET OUT.     I TRIED TO GET UNDER - I COULDN’T, TOO MANY PEOPLE IN

 FRONT.     I GOT BACK UP - THE GUY ON MY LEFT HAD GONE UNDER I THINK.     I WAS

 NOW NEXT TO THE DOUBLE FENCE,      I SAW MY CHANCE TO GET OUT.   I CLIMBED OUT

 WITH THE HELP OF A MAN WHO WAS HELPING PEOPLE OUT.      I WENT ONTO THE PITCH.

 THE POLICE TOLD ME TO GO INTO THE WING TERRACE WHICH WAS RELATIVELY EMPTY,,

 I DIDN’T LOOK BACK.     I DIDN’T KNOW THE EXTENT OF HOW BAD IT WAS - ONLY THAT

 I'D WANTED TO GET OUT AND IT WASN’T UNTIL I GOT BACK ON THE COACH I REALISED

 THE EXTENT OF THE DISASTER,      THE RUMOURS SAID 20 PEOPLE DEAD,

 I^GOT OUT JUST AFTER THE PLAYERS LEFT THE PITCH - I REMEMBER THEMATCH

STOPPING.

 I COULDN'T SEE THE PEOPLE AT THE FRONT,.     PEOPLE WERE SAYING GO BACK   - BUT YOU

COULDN'T.     DID N’T REALISE PEOPLE WERE DYING.   NO STEWARDS.

•
    Q53

    DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

    AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

    I SAW FANS RIP AWAY MESH ON THE FRONT FENCE WITH THEIR BARE HANDS SO THAT

    PEOPLE COULD GET OUT OF THE CRUSH ONTO THE PITCH.             POLICEMEN REPLACED THE

    FENCING AND STOPPED T H A T .   I D O N ’T KNOW W H Y .   IT SEEMED THAT THE FANS WERE

    DOING ALL THE FIRST AID AND THE EMERGENCY SERVICES WERE SLOW TO REACT *                ALSO

    THE LINE OF POLICEMEN PUT ACROSS THE HALFWAY LIME WAS A POINTLESS EXERCISE,

    J g . LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS SHOULD HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED THE SPION KOP END,,              IT WAS

    OBVIOUS LIVERPOOL WOULD HAVE A LARGER NUMBER OF FANS AT THE GROUND.


Q 16

    <354

    IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

    JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

    I THINK    IT WAS A CORRECT DECISION TO OPEN THE GATES TO ALLEVIATE THE CRUSH

    OUTSIDE,    BUT ACCESS TO THE STANDS AND TERRACES SHOULD HAVE           BEEN BLOCKED

    AND THEN SOME CONTROL APPLIED,       IE CHECKING FOR TICKETS BEFORE LETTING FANS

    HAVE FURTHER ACCESS TO WATCH THE MATCH .          ALSO THERE SHOULD BE SOME FORM OF
                                                                              PAGE    9

 TUNNEL.


Q i7

 Q54

 ^ T H E R E ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THE VENUE WAS WRONG IT COULD NOT COPE WITH THE NUMBER OF FANS WHO WANTED

 TO GO.    HAVING PICKED THE VENUE THE LIVERPOOL FANS SHOULD HAVE BEEN

 ALLOCATED THE SPION HOP END AS THEY HAVE A HIGHER NUMBER OF FANS.

 THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A POLICE FILTER SYSTEM ALLOWING ONLY FANS WITH

 TICKETS TO GO TO THE GROUND.          ACCESS SHOULD HAVE BEEN BLOCKED OFF AT THE

 TUNNEL WHEN PENS 3 AND 4 WERE F U L L ,REMAINING FANS SHOULD HAVE BEEN DIRECTED

 TO AREAS WHERE THERE WAS ROOM FOR THEM.

 "T^p TERRACED AREA SHOULD NOT BE PENNED OFF        IT   SHOULD BE LEFT CLEAR FOR   FREE

 ACCESS ACROSS THE TERRACED AREA FROM ONE SIDE           TO ANOTHER.

 THE GATES IN THE FENCING LEADING TO THE PITCH           AREA FROM THE TERRACED AREA

 WERE TOO SMALL AND NOT ENOUGH OF THEM.

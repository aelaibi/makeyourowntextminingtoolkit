              I was        on duty      in this    capacity on S a t u r d a y        15 April     1989     (154089)       in

              the m a t c h between L i v erpool            and N o t t i n g h a m Forrest       football        teams.




              I a r r i v e d at work at          11.00am     (1100)     and after        b r ie f i nq I took      up my

              position at about             11, 15    (1115)    on the Kop entJK^            y M v ^ J o b was    t o k eep

                                                                                                              S2871

a l t h o u g h to the      right        hand side,         p a r t i t i o n e d off were    perhaps 200

L i verpoo l       supporters.                All    the supp o r t e r s     in this area were well

behaved.



The m at ch kicked off                   at    the usual      time 3 . 0 0 p m (1500).          However

s ho r t l y a ft e r w a r d s    I     saw Liverpool            suppo r t e r s climbing     over the

fencing          onto the     pitch,          police      officers      then went        to where      this was

happening.            My first           impressions were             that     the barrier had broke

al l o w i n g    them onto        the     pitch,        Liverpool      supporters were          then       running

on to the          pitch verge and the                   players     stop p e d    play and went        off.          I

still      thought      it was           a pitch         invasion and         the police were        going     to

clear      the supporters                to a llow the m a t c h         to    proceed.        The     police       line

the middle          of the        field,       again      I thought      it was to stop L i verpool

s u pporters        running        towards          the Notts Forr e s t          end.     After a few

m i nu te s more      I saw the a d v e rt is in g             boards       being    ripped off        by the

s upporters        being     carried           out,      I then    realised something            serious       had

happened.            I joined           o t her     stewards who were also down at                   t h e West

terraces         behind the goal,                 when    I got there         I saw suppo r t e r s     trying        to

put others         onto boards,               8t Johns a m b u l a n c e men were          trying      to    revive

people.           Police were a ss is t i n g a l t h o u g h they still                   had a     line     of

p ol ic e m e n this was           needed as the N o t t i n g h a m Forrest               s u p p o r t e r s were

jeering as L i v erpool                 supp o r t e r s were      being      carried out,       I don't       think

they     realised what was                 happening.             In my opin i o n there was            enough

police      to section            off    the      pitch and help w i t h the             injured.



I a sk e d Liverpool              suppo r t e r s what       I c,0uld do,          they a s k e d me    to help t

move    the      injured.           I ripped a b o a / d           ofjf Jknd used this as a stretcher

               kno w l e d g e were     dead at this         time.      As   there was enough helping            this

               end     I made my way         back    to the Kop       end there was     nothing else          I could

               do,     by this       time   it was 4 . 0 0 p m   (1600).       I went   to the stewards          offic

               where       I was     stood down.           By this    time all   the eme r g e n c y teams were

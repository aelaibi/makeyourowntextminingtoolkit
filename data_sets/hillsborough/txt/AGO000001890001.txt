    FOOTBALL MEMBERSHIP SCHEME
    1 have seen your letter of 26 January to David Waddington
    suggesting that a reference to continued work on the type of
    Membership Scheme envisaged in the invitation to tender should be
    included in his statement on the Taylor Report.
    2    The intention was that the Football Membership Scheme would
    be run by the football industry itself and be self financing. The
    costs to the clubs would have been met by the members themselves
    through a membership fee.    I am concerned     to know how the
    continued work to develop suitable technology for possible future
    use would be financed when the scheme itself is not to be
    implemented.   It seems to me unlikely that either the companies
    who responded to the invitation to tender, or the football
    authorities, would be prepared to meet these development costs.
    In these circumstances further work would not take place unless
    supported by public funds. I could accept the reference to this
    further exploration of the technology only on the understanding
    that any such funding will be met from within existing provision.

    3    I am sending copies of this letter to the Prime Minister,
    Geoffrey Howe, Douglas Hurd, David Waddington, Malcolm Rifkind,
    Patrick Mayhew, the Lord Privy Seal, Timothy Renton and to Sir
    Robin Butler.

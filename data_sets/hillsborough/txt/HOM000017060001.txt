Pastor                  of          Baptist
Church. Lord Justice Taylor has read the

            Dear Mr Whalley,

                            Hillsborough Disaster Inquiry

            I enclose a copy of a letter I have received from Pastor
                            of           Baptist Church.

            In it he draws attention to the influence of drink at
            over-crowded football matches, and relates his own experience
            at another match involving Liverpool Football Club.

            I feel that his letter may be of some background interest
            to the Inquiry, and I have told Mr       ^ that I am putting
            it forward.

                                    Yours sincerely,




                                              h A zSvl                        4

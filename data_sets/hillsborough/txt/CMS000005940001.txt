                   NATIONAL PLAN FOR STADIA: THE TAYLOR REPORT
      You will see from Charles Hughes' letter of 18 October that we are
      invited to a presentation, presumably to be given by the consultants
      to the FA, on 25 November. The FLA, Football Trust and the FSADC are
      also invited.
      SARD will be represented at this meeting although I very much doubt
      that I will be able to spare the entire day as proposed. In view of
      the importance of encouraging the FA to work with the FLA and in
      particular of exploring how this national plan can feed through into
      club business plans put forward to the FLA, I intend to be present for
      the afternoon session only. I have asked Tony Baden here to prepare a
      preliminary list of points which we need to get clarification on
      taking account of what little we learnt from the FA when we saw them
      on 25 September. I will send this list of points to you in advance of
      the meeting in order that you can consider whether we can draw up
      between us a consolidated list of the main questions which we would
      want to see answered.
      In the meantime I would be grateful if you could let me know whether
      you and/or other representatives from your Division will be attending
      in order so that I can inform the FA.

We would be very pleased if you and your colleagues could join us on

to let us know the names of those persons, from the Department of

delighted for the Minister to join us, if that were possible.

May 1 take it that you will liaise with Mr. Roger Miles, from the Home
Office, as to whether he, together with his colleagues,         will be
attending and, if so, it would be helpful to know their names also.

For your information, we are issuing invitations to Mr. John de Quidt
and his colleagues, from the Football Licensing Authority, Mr. Richard
Faulkner and Mr. Peter Lee, from the Football Trust and, also, Mr.
Gwilym Roberts and Ms. Christine Gausden, from the Football Stadia
Advisory Design Council.

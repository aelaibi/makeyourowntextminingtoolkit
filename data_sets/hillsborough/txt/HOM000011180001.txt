TAYLOR: FIRST REACTIONS FROM TO 20                  •                 ' p

I spoke today with Ch Supt Kinloch of Met Police TO 2<T Branch
(Public Order - including football) about initial reaction to
Lord Justice Taylor's recommendations. This followed a meeting
yesterday at TO 20 involving match commanders from each of the
grounds in the MPD.


2. The Met are as we would hope going to do their best to get on
with implementing the recommendations. Understandably
individuals have questioned whether everything should or must be
complied with and have highlighted particular difficulties for
their own ground.            for dxaJBpl^ happen to have
particularly wide escape gates and identify that policing these
when open will be more difficult and expensive than other
gp:©M!Kis. But in general TO 20 have been putting over the message
very positively. I emphasised that the presumption must be to
implement all the recommendations speedily, but that some common
sense flexibility over precise timing was right.


3. The football season begins in earnest on Saturday 19 August.
An anxiety that TO 20 have - as yet only hypothetical - is that
some clubs may be reluctant to co-operate sufficiently with the
police. If that were serious enough the Met would have to
consider declining to police the match - in effect stopping the
match from being played.


4.   The possibility may never arise: Graham Kelly of the FA has
endorsed the recommendations and the football authorities will
doubtless press reluctant clubs firmly. In many ways Taylor will
strengthen the police's hand in effecting action at football
grounds even though urgent work is required by everyone.
5. I will keep in touch with TO 20 and check again before I go
on leave (from 17 August to 4 September). Since you will also be
away we may need to brief Mr Boys Smith about any problems that
may arise.

Safety of Sports Grounds? Mi11wall Football club. Cold Blow lane

5)   The scheme proposed by the Club for improving the gates. Increasing th e ir
     number and ’ramping' properly access from the terraces will in my view
     provide an increased fa c to r of safety over smaller number of smaller gates
     l e f t open, but only provided th a t the gates, though l e f t in the main plane
     of the perimeter fence are:
     a) not locked
     b) not fastened in any way
     c> both policed and stewarded by a trained steward
6)   To leave gates ju s t as they are but merely in the open position would not
     be acceptable to me and I would be unable to allow matters to continue on
     th a t b asis.
7)    I f gates were to be l e f t open, the proposals fo r The Den would r e s u lt in
     *(my estimate) 30 to 40% of the perimeter fence open, which could
      p ra c tic a lly n u llify the e ffe c t of having such a fence. {I understand th a t
      Tottenham Hotspurs are in s ta llin g a French-type fence a ll of which opens a t
      the touch of a button - I f th is recommendation were to be followed then a ll
      of i t would have to be l e f t open - c lea rly a nonsense).
In terms of achieving the desired objective, ie quick and simple evacuation of
spectators in the event of an untoward incident, I r e ite r a te my view th a t the
proposal discussed yesterday gives increased safety*
The proposed works will s t a r t within days I understand, but will not be
complete for several weeks. Until th a t time, I w ill i n s i s t on a fu rth e r 5$
reduction in permitted number for the terraces so served.
Yours sincerely

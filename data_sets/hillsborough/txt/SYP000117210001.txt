Dated                      £80489                                                                                                               Signed


             On Saturday,             15th April          1989,        I went          on       duty    at E .1 at            8.30        am

             transport          had    been    arranged           to       to    take       us    to H i l l s b o r o u g h a n d             we

             arrived        in g o o d     time     for    the       briefing              which       b e g a n at      10.00 am              I was

             attached        to    serial      5,    under        the       supervision                of P S H o d g e t t s .            After

             the m a i n     briefing,         we    had a        packed          lunch meal                and    the       serial        was

             briefed        by P S H o d g e t t s    as     to      the        specific          duties          we    would        be

             undertaking.             These        duties       were        to    control          supporters                entering           the

             South Stand           through         gates     19-26 and                to    patrol          the a r e a       where        the       TV

             vans    w e re .

             We went        round     to    this     side       of     the       ground          and    I was          detailed           to

             control       gates       1 9-2 2 ,    Entrance           E    in    c o m p a n y w i t h PC             3131    Lewis           and a

             PC    from E.2 who            I think        was     called Davies.                       We    were       on    d u t y at        this

             point    about        1 1 , 1 0 am.

             These    gates were            the     last     entrance             for       the N o t t i n g h a m F o r e s t

             supporters           along     this     si de      of     the       g r o u n d , being          adjacent              to    the

             Leppings        Lane     end     stand.         Because             of    this       and       due    to    the        fact       that       no

             Liverpool          supporters          had    been a l l ow e d               to    pass       towards          th e    South Stand

             area    from       the L e p p i ngs L a n e         end       comparatively                   few su pp or te rs             c ame      by

             this    entrance.             Nottingham Forest                     supporters             who       did    not        have       tickets

             for    this     entrance         had    been       screened              out       by a    check          point,        just       at    the
                                                                                                                                    PAGE
                                                                                                                                    R 82

end    of    the       rear       of    the    South S t a n d .

Consequently              there         was     only      good     humoured             talk with          the     few

Nottingham Forest                      supporters          who     c ame      our       way    and       directing           people

who    weren't           s ur e    where        they      should        go.        On    two       occasions        definitely

some Liverpool                 supporters             came    from       the L e p p i ngs L a n e              end.         One     two

who    produced           steward            cards     but    did       not    have          tickets       claimed           t hat      t hey

had    been       told      that        they     could       collect          "complimentary"                   tickets           from

somewhere           behind         the       So uth Stand.              They were             informed          that        there       was

no    chance        of    entry         without        tickets          and    1 think             PC L e w i s    took        them       to

have    a word           wi th PS Hbdgetts.                   The       second          o c c a s i o n a m a n who            had a

ticket       for       the L e p p i n g s       Lane      End     came       from       that       direction           and       tried

to    gain       entry      thorugh Entrance                  E    into       the       area       beyond.         This       was       just

prior       to    kick-off?             2.40     pm a n d     he    claimed             that       it m a d e     good       sense        to

enter       at    t his     entrance            because       the       crowds          were       so    big at     the L e p p i n g s

Lane    end.           After       a few minutes              talking          PC       Lewis       escorted        this          man

back    to       the L e p p i n g s         Lane     end.        About       this       time       I was       aware        of

mounted          officers          rushing          towards        the     Leppings            Lane       end     from       somewhere

behind       the       south       stand.           Shortly        after       this          the    barrier        fence          was

moved       to a       position          on     the L e p p i n g s      Lane       s ide      of       entrance        E    from       the

end    of    the       South       Stand.

During       all       t his      time,       -apart      from m en t io ne d            above,          there     were        no

problems          on the          entrance          and    the m a j o r i t y          of    the       fans    were        in g o o d

humour       enjoying             the    day     out.

From    the       cheering             inside       the    stadium         it was            obvious       that     the       match

was    beginning            and        the    g a t e m a n who     was       minding          my       anorak     t o l d me        he

was    closing           and      gave       me m i n e    and     PC    Lewis          anorak          before     he w e n t .           As

I was       putting         my     anorak        on    I s a w PC        Lewis          returning          from     the       Leppings

Lane    end and           as      I was       giving       her     the a n o r a k           I was       told     that       fans       had

invaded          the     pitch and            we w e r e     required          ins i d e .

Immediately              1 was         with     other      officers           at    th e      l a rge     gate     of       t his
                                                                                                                                             PAGE;           3
                                                                                                                                             RS'E

entrance         and when              this    o p e n e d we         went       quickly             through            a    tunnel,,         down

some     steps        through           the    seats        and       over       a    small          wall        onto        the       p i t c h area.

At    t his    stage         I was       not       aware     of       the    stadium                or    the      pitch          but as       1

l o o k e d at     the L e p p i n g s         Lane       end     I saw          that         there           were      supporters             on

the     pitch area            behind          the     goals       as    I went             over          I told         one       fan    to    get

b ack    on the         terraces,              I saw        from       his       expression                   and attitude               t hat       he

was     not    looking            to    cause        trouble          and    t hat         he w a s           distressed.                He    told

me    that     people         were       being        crushed          in th e            terraces             and      he     had      to    get

out.

I now       began       to    realise          that        it w a s     not          just       a    pitch         invasion and                 it

may     be m o r e      serious.              As     I walked          to    behind             the       goals         I was          aware        of

people        moving         about       but       I was     unsure          where            to     go.         I looked              into    one

area     of    the      terrace          arid s a w a n          open       gate          in the          fen c e .          As    I followed

the     fence      towards             the    North        Stand       I saw          supporters                 trying           to    help

people        o ver     a    fence       which        ran    perpendicular                      to       the     perimeter              fence

and     they     seemed           disorganised              but       I think             short          of    p ani c .          On    the
                                                         &
other       side      of     the       terrace        diving          fence          1 saw          t hat      people          were      bei n g

pushed        up a g a i n s t         the    fences        by    the       weight            of     the       crowd         inside .          As        I

looked        along         the    perimeter              fence       I saw          t ha t     s ome         people         were       splashed

with     what      I think             was    vomit        from       other          people          inside          the       crowd.          At

this     point        I knew           that    people        would          be       seriously                injured.

I could        see      that       there       were        distraught                supporters                around          the

perimeter          fence          on    the    pitch        side       I began             to       tell       them         to m o v e       onto

the     pitch      to       help       people        as    they were             brought             out.          It w a s        obvious           to

me    that     they were               hindering           the    rescue             of    people*            ins i d e .

When     the     immediate              area around              me w a s        relatively                   c l ear       I turned          back

to    the     fence         and    saw       th at    some       of    the       people             at    the      front          of    the

saw     that     people           inside       were       trying        to       scale          the       perimeter               fence       and

were     struggling               to    get    over        the    top       due       to      it     being        angled           i n wards.

At       this           point           I climbed                onto            a    concrete          wall      which          is    just       before         the

perimeter                       fence        and       helped               to       pull    people          o ver     the       top    of    the     fence.

I can                remember               pulling           about              three       people          over      the       top    of    the     fence

and         passing                them          to    officers                  stood       on    the       floor       b e h i n d me,.          I c a n ’t

remember                   what         these          people               looked          like       but    1 think            they were          all

young                men.          One       was       practically                     exhausted             at    the      t o p of     the       fence         and

1 had                to d r a g         him       down and                  l o wer        him    to    another          officer.

1 could                 see        that          people          at         the       front       of    the       fence         were    dying       a n d at

this           point             I made           an attempt                     to    pull       the    mesh away               from    the       f e n c e -sm

could                not        do t h i s       though.              During               this    period         I      was     aware        of    other

officers                   doing            similar            things                around       me    and       there         was    a senior

officer                 to m y          right          an      Inspector                   I think       who       had a l s o         been       pulling

peo p 1 e o v e r t he                       fenc e .

I then                sa w        that       the        officer              immediately                to m y        right       was    leaning          over

the         t o p of              the       fence          trying            to       reach       people          in the         crowd and          pull

them            up.             I. s a w     that          he wa s           in d a n g e r        of    falling            into       the    terrace            in

hi-s e f f o r t s                 to       reach          so as            I stood          on    the       concrete            wall    I held          his

legs           so        t ha t          he      could           reachfurther                    without          any danger            to    himself.,               I

think                i t w as          PC    142.

1 now                had        the     opportunity                    to        look       round .          I saw        the     size       of    the    crowd

in the                whole            stadium             and       could            see    people          on    the      pitch       tending          to

As       I looked                  into          the       terrace               I could          see    that         people          were    obviously

dead and                   the         crush          at      the      front           was       developing            into       a tangle          of    dead

and         injured                people             as      the      pressure              of    the       crowd        subsided.               1 c o uld

see         officers                   were       now         inside             the       terrace       area         having          climbed       the

dividing                   fences.

They           had         begun            to    pull         bodies                and    injured          people         from       the    tangle          in

front                of me.             They          were       obviously                  upset       by w h a t       was      happening            but

carried          on.        I thought            that    all       officers           seemed          to    have      worked

together          despite           there        being       no a p p a r e n t       direction.

1 s a w a d ar k            haired        girl     in a       ligh t         blue     jog       s uit      she     was     laid

against          the     fence       in f r o n t       of me.           She        was    trapped          by     her     legs      by

other      people           but     she     was    trying          to    ho 1 d the         upper          h alf    of     her      body

off     a young          lad      be 1o w    her       she    said           she w a s     o k a y but       could^ get             up.         I

thi nk     the        lad     be low her          was    dead.

I don't          know       how     long     1 held          o n to          the o f f i c e r s legs         or      if   he       managed

to    lift       anyone        from       the     crowd       but       it     became       obvious           to me        that      he

would      not        foe a b l e    to     reach anyone                else        and    I pulled           him     back       onto       the

co n c r e t e    w a 11.

By    t his      time       the     injured were              being          passed        o ve r     the     dividing           fence

and     through          the      perimeter            gate     onto         the     pitch.           1 saw        the     dark      haired

girl     lifted          free,       her     feet       had     been         trapped        against          a     support          for     the

perimeter             fence.

I then went              to    the    gate        where       the       injured were                being        passed        o nto      the

unconscious              and      I could         not    find any              pulse.           Together           with     PC 3 2 4 6          I

tried      to     resuscitate               the    man.         PC      3246        gave    mouth          to m o u t h     whilst          I

helped         carry        him was         a friend,           wh o     called           the    unconscious               m a n Eric.

After      s ome       time       with      no    success,           a man who             said       ha w a s      a Doctor-

him     for      I «D . pur p o s e s »           We    then       had       to m o v e     the       deceased           f u r t h e r onto

t his     time        I saw       people          taking      the       n ets      off     the      goal      posts.         At    first

I thought             t hat      they were             vandalising            them        but     then     realised          t hat      they

were      moving           them       to    help access,

I think          at    t his      time       supporters            at    the       Nottingham             Forest       end       began      to

their      direction,                  I immediately               ran       over        telling        people        to    go    b a ck    to

their      end        of    the       pitch       to    try   to    help          th e    injured.            Some     of    the       fans

were      helping           in t h e i r         o w n way,     others            were      angry and          frustrated

others       had       obviously             been       drinking         and       some         were    crying        other

s h o u t i ng    o b s c e n i t i e s at         N o 1 1 i n g h a m F o r eat          fa ns     and    police          and    some

just      shouting.               Some       were       claiming         that        they        should       have     had       the    other

end.       I looked              at    the       Nottingham         Forest           end and           to me     it    looked          full

I couldn't             u nd e rs ta n d what             difference               it w o u l d      have      made.

I became          aware           that      a     cordon was            being       formed         a c r o s s the p i t c h a n d          I

moved      down        the        pitch         ushering        Liverpool                fans    down      to the L e p p i n g s

line      I think           it    became          apparent         that       the L i v e r p o o l        supporters             on    the

After      this        I can          remember          talking         to    fans        on     the    pitch and           trying         to

calm      them        down        or       reassure       them      but       I was        very        upset and d isturbed

myself       at       this        stage.           I became         aware          of     people        bringing water             out

and     I had a            few    drinks          from    them.          I was           very     dased       and     numb.        I can

remember        Ron       helping           rne by      talking         and       myself          a n d PC      Lewis       crying

supporter           asked       if     1 was       okay     and        then asked             how E v e r t o n         had      gone           on.

Around        this    t im e      the       decision        was        announced             t hat    the       game       would        not

go     ahead and          the     ground          began     to        empty.           We    started         to m o v e       people

o ff    the    pitch .          There        were       different            attitudes              from     the      supporters                 I

remember        three        in       particular           who        shook       my    hand        and    thanked          me     for          all

t he    efforts       of     the       emergency           services           saying          that        w e *d d one

everything           we    co u l d .        This       attitude            was    by       far     the    minority           that          I

saw.      Most       were       angry,        some        abusive,           some       frustrated,               s ome     dazed

others        were    drunk           and    just       shouting            for    the       sake     of     it.

When     the     pitch       had       been       practically               cleared          I s a w Sgt.          Hodgetts             with

Gill     Lewis       and     Ron       Kraig       and     we     looked          for       the     rest     of    the      serial.

After     looking           inside          the    ptieh         we    went       to    the       entrance         EL' w h e r e    we

were     originally             and     there        met    most        of    the       other        members          of    our

serial.         Some       of     the       caterers         had m a d e          a big        pot    of     coffee         and     I

drank     about       3 or        4    cups.         My    hands        were       shaking.               All     officers          looked

devastated           and     exhausted             no     one     was       talking          very m u c h .

I d o n ’t k n o w        how m u c h        later        it w a s      when       we w e n t        back       into       the     ground

for     the    debrief          and     after        we    had        given a          b r ie f     summary        of      what     we          did

we     were    stood       down        to C l a y w h e e l s         for    transport              to E . 1

As     well    as    the     above          I can       remember            seeing          the     SOCG     being         attacked              by

a    group     of L i v e r p o o l         fans     near        the    perimeter             fen c e .         I only        saw     the

group     from a distance                    a n d as      I approached                 the       disorder         I saw         officers

escorting           the    SOCO        out    whilst        the        groups          shouted abuse               at      him.         I

thought        at    the     time       th at      he     h ad    been       taking          pictures           and     the      f an s

thought        that       he w a s      p r ess      photographer                 and       t hat    they       did     not

understand.

I c a n't      place       this        incident           chronologically                    but     as    X looked           up    the

pitch     I can       remember              seeing        the S O C O        go    to       behind        the     cordon across

  supporters           were           helpful.                I spoke      with a               nurse       who     had     come        from       the

  crowd     to    help       and           a doctor.            With       that          in m i n d ,         I was        also        aware       of a

  abusive        and    unhelpful,                  s ome      of w h o m        were           sober      and      others         obviously

  drunk.

Dear Friend

Hillsborough
I have been asked by the North West Group of the Parliamentary Labour
Party to write to you in my capacity as the Group's Secretary.

Since the publication of the Stuart-Smith report, North West MPs have
had many meetings and discussions on the issues raised by the report
and by our constituents in response to it. The latest of these was a
meeting held with the Home Secretary, Jack Straw, on 4 March.

Summary of Meeting

1.   We are agreed that a full debate in Parliament should be sought,
     allowing each MP time to speak for his or her constituents'
     concerns.  This is currently being negotiated.

2.   The manner in which Coroner's Courts deal with such tragedies is
     already being re-assessed by the Home Secretary.

3.   Police disciplinary procedures    (including the use of early
     retirement as an 'escape hatch') are also being reviewed and
     require detailed debate and consultation.

Hillsborough Families and MPs

North   West    MPs,   particularly   those  representing    Merseyside
Constituencies,    are   receiving  a   wide range   of   demands   and
interpretations from families in our Constituencies - sometimes
conflicting demands.

To structure and inform the debates in Parliament, I am asked by the
North West Group to request of you, in writing, a list of the specific
issues you would like to see Parliament consider.

Clearly if it were possible for a consensus list to be put together by
all or most of the families, that would greatly help us and would avoid
a situation in which MPs who have received conflicting approaches from
those they represent, cancel each other out in the debate.

When we have read and digested the information we would like to meet


                                                                                                     continued



                 WORKING FOR A BETTER FUTURE IN WEST LANCASHIRE

                Parliamentary A ssistant: Frank McKenna Parliamentary Secretary : Pauline Roughley
                          Contact a t : 127 Burscough Street, Ormskirk, Lancashire L39 2EP
                                        Telephone\Fax : 01695 570094
and discuss it with representatives of the Hillsborough families.

North West MPs (and MPs from Nottingham and Sheffield with whom we have
discussed the report) are acutely aware of the continuing distress
amongst the bereaved, and the anger caused by anomalies and delays
throughout the intervening years.

We strongly supported Jack Straw when he set up the Stuart Smith Review
and we fully understand his response to the results of the Review. Our
major concern is to ensure that the outrageous inefficiencies and
neglect that led to the disaster and exacerbated it are co:flf!tected so
that they do not happen again, and that as far as is legally and
morally possible the continuing concerns of the families are heeded.

Your role in that is crucial and we are most grateful for your co­
operation in the process.

Please address responses to me at the House of Commons. I will be
responsible for collating them and communicating them to every MP
concerned.

Best wishes.

Your§ sincerely




Colin Pickthall MP

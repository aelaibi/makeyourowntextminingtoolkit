                                                                                                         PAGE

were    strewn         about.

I checked these to ensure                they were dead then a s s i s t e d w i t h the

injured people some of who were also                         lying    in this area*               I then,

after     seeing the arrival            of amb u l a n c e    crews,      ran through the tunnel

to the terraces where               I was met     by a wall          of L i v e r p o o l   fans,    looking

over     them       I could see the      pitch had been invaded,                   people around me           in

the tunnel           began moaning,      I a s s i s t e d to escort           these people out of

the tunnel where             if they were      injured,        d i r e c t e d am b u l a n c e   crews to

them.

Mys e l f and Police Co n s t a b l e 809         carried the body of a y o u n g fair

hai r e d boy        in a L i verpool    shirt a n d light           trousers       in the        lane

running adjac e n t          to the River      don,       we then went onto the pitch.

Pe o p l e were       being carr i e d a w a y but no bodies w ere on the pitch.

Attention           called for L e p p i n g s Ln terraces where Liverpool                        fans were

a t ta ck in g a no t h e r Liverpool       fan whi they say was                 picking up

L i verpool         fans   leave,   then i nstructed to go to N o r t h S t a n d for d e ­

brief.

T hr ou gh ou t      these events     I felt nothing,           I just he l p e d where             I could.

It seemed as though nobody really knew what                             to do but help w i t h the

dead and        injured.

             of the g ro u n d there was ,a Serial                 of Police O f f icers at that                    gate an d
                                                                                                   PAGE
                                                                                                   R54

I saw that           the gate was       being f o r c i b l y m o v e d from the outside,



The gate w hi ch was of a f o l d i n g / s l i d i n g type was             being forced side to

side an d          inwards at the same time a n d            looked to be      in the process         of

b r e aking down. An official               g a te ma n was holding onto the bolts w h i c h

kept    the gate secured.               He was having         to keep the bolts pushed         up.    I

looked t hr o u g h a glass             o b se rv at io n hole in the gate and saw a           mass       of

supporters          all    pushing      towards     the gate and those that were in direct

contact wer e the             culprits a tt e m p t i n g to     force    it open*



As a result           I contacted G r ou nd Control an d a s k e d that M o u n t e d

S e c t i o n be directed to this               p o s ition to ease the melee outside*



Whilst        this was      taking    place supporters were            climbing over the wall

into the ground at this point.                     Supporters      coming    into the ground via

the t u rnstiles were argu i n g w i t h Officers                  in this v i c i n i t y re the

trouble           outside and all were saying             that someone was going to be

ki l l e d    in the      crush.



I continued to assist                the g at em an at the gate and at this                point

a Po l i c e S e r geant       (not known)        stated that G r o u n d Control      had ordered

the gate to be opened*                The   gate m a n ar g u e d that they had no such

orders an d at first               refused to open the gate.             T h e y were over    ruled

by the S e r g e a n t and at this time                I a d v i s e d the g a t e m a n to stand near

to the wall a n d that              I w ou ld   pull    open the door as       I feared he

would        be    crushed.



The g at e m a n then pulled down the bolts s e c uring the gate and I opened

the    right hand gate an d so meone else op e n e d the                    left   side.   The crowd

su r g e d    into the ground and all              I could do was to assist them in

            keeping on there feet as they m o v e d forward.



             I stayed   in this   position until   I was orde r e d to the   pitch.

              On Saturday,           15th April      1989,    I p e r formed duty           in conne c t i o n w i t h the

              F * A C u p Semi Final          tie betw e e n Liverpool           and Notts*        Forest     played at

              Hi 1 lsborough.

              I commen ced duty at B a rn sl ey at 9 am and drove a P o l i c e                            personnel

              carrier       full    of officers        from B a rn sl ey to the ground,               a r r i v i n g at

              9 * 3 0 am.      We all a t t e nd ed at the briefing                in the N o r t h S t a n d before

              taking up our              points   in the ground.          I,   together wit h other offices

              f rom B1 sub d i v i s i o n was on Serial               14 under       the direct s u p e r v i s i o n of

              PS    1341 Crawford,           our duty before         the game being to search persons

              e n t ering    the ground via t u r n s t i l e s A to G w h i c h are s i t u a t e d at the

              rear of Leppi n g s Lane.             Our brief was           to search persons              for things

              such as weapons,              bottles,    cans and       large flags and banners etc.

              Following        the m a i n briefing we were             brie f e d    in detail       by    our Sector

              Inspector,          Inspector White*           This briefing took                 place just before          11
                                                                                                       PAGE       2

am on the terracing at                the L e p pings Lane end of the ground.

F o l l ow in g this we took up our               positions at the t urnstiles at around

11.13 am.            Two turnstiles        were open early,            these two being the two to

the extreme           right w h en    looking towards L e p pings Lane.

As well as my duties at                  the turnstiles          I was als o depu t e d to pay

visits        to the     refreshment       bar are a w h i c h      is s i t u a t e d at the S o u t h end

of the        rear of the Leppi n g s Lane             terrace.        This was         to ensure the

sa f e t y and s e c u r i t y of the          persons work i n g there and was deemed

ne ce ss ar y because at           the    corre s p o n d i n g m a t c h    in 1988 a robbery had

taken        place.      My a t t e n t io n to the      refreshment bar area at first                  took

the form of frequent               checks wit h the staff,                  then returning to m y

se a r c h duties,        as trade at the           refreshment        bar was slow.

Persons        began entering the ground via the two a v a i l a b l e                      turnstiles

more    or less as soon as they opened.                        These        persons were s e a r c h e d as

they entered           in spite of the fact             that they had a l r e a d y been s e a rched

by other        officers outside           the ground.           The moo d of the          people who

a rr i v e d early was f r i e n d l y a n d none,           to my knowledge,             o b j e c t e d to being

searched.            I had o c c a s i o n to    remove     property from persons on

entering,        but     the objects       taken were made up only of one                     large

banner,        two    cans of pop and a small m i ni at ur e                  bottle of      ’Bells*

w hi s k y    in the shape of a bell.                These     items were a p p r o p r i a t e l y m a r k e d

w i th a label and placed in the                    property store - no one o b j ected to

their        prope r t y being taken from them.

F r o m the time w h e n the turns t i l e s opened                 persons ente r e d the ground

at   such a rate that             it was       possible     to carry out a good search of

each.         There was no rush to get               in and the m o od and a tmosphere

remained friendly,              a s si st ed    perhaps     by the fact          that    it was a fine day.

At a p pr ox im at el y      1.30 pm,      I cannot be sure of the time,                     I was

in structed by the             Inspector        to remain at        the      refreshment      bar to

ensure safety and s e c urity as o u t l i n e d above.                        I took up a position
                                                                                                   PAGE         3
                                                                                                   SS46

in the     centre of the bar,            on the outside,         effectively         causing     persons

to form two queues,             one on either side of me*                  Trade    had picked up

c o n s i d e r a b l y but still    no crowd d e v e l o p e d wait i n g     to be served.

A l t h o u g h not many people a c t u a l l y spoke            to me the m o o d remained

friendly-         No one was a bu s i v e       to the staff a n d no           one tried to            ob t a i n

goods wi th o u t     paying*        F r o m my position      I could see across the

e n closure      to where my colleagues were e n g a g e d on searching                     duties an d

as time        passed,   as    is always       the   case,   persons began a r r i v i n g and

entering at a faster             rate,    but    intially        the crowd did not seem                 to be

a ny t hi ng    out of the o r d i n a r y for such a match*

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y S . 30 pm it began to get          busy a n d     I saw

t h r o u g h the t u rnstiles w hi ch were approx 3 0 - 4 0 yards away

that a crowd was building up outside-                        Pers o n s    outside the gr o u n d

wer e    being forced to wait            and    it did not appear to me that they were

waiting        in set queues.         It seemed more         like a large          crowd w h i c h had

d e v e l o p e d as oppo s e d to    large numbers of          people queuing          in an orde r l y

manner-        T here was a great         deal of shouting a n d chanting an d a kind

of    'hum'     that one sometime s gets             in a large     crowd*         I left the

refreshment        bar are a to return to the turnstiles                     to assist my

colleagues*        It continued to become more and more                      busy and the

s e arching of persons entering                 ceased   in order         to a l l o w persons     to

enter     the ground with o u t        causing further          delay or i n c o nvenience or

causing a crowd to build up in the enc l o s u r e                    inside the turnstiles.

The     crowd outside         had now become a crush,            a sea of       people w h i c h

s t r e t c h e d as far as L e p p i n g s L ane     itself.     P e r s o n s who were e n t ering

were    becoming more and more aggre s s i v e               in their a t t itude        towards        us.

The y were       complaining        that the crush outside was               not only unbea r a b l e

but dangerous.           There were       persons of both sexes an d all ages who were

in danger        of being      crushed.        Their moo d was      such that        I feared that

one of us may be assaulted*                    It is quite      possible       that this feeling
                                                                                                 PAGE
                                                                                                 S846

amongst     the   fans was     brought about        by the    conditions       outside     the

gro u n d and brought        on by genuine        fear of being       crushed*       Several

persons     told us this a n d they were a s s u r e d that P o l i c e Officers,

including m ou n t e d officers were on duty outside the gr o u n d d e p u t e d to

control     the    crowd.     I saw several        people    climb into the groun d over

the wall     above t u rnstiles A - G*            They were      leaning over the fencing

on top of the wall and see med to be passing their tickets                            down to

persons     in the    crowd outside,        who    presu m a b l y could not have had

tickets     of their own but had come to the m a t c h a n y w a y an d were                     intent

on getting        in somehow*     Several      persons who were entering were saying

that    someone w o u l d be s er io u s l y   injured or crushed to d e a t h unless

s o m ethin g was done to relieve the              pressure outside.           The turn s t i l e s

could not      cope w i t h such a crush*          The a r e a betw e e n the turnstiles

and the     rear of the stand filled w i t h persons who made their way

towards     the Lepings Lane          terrace a n d stand.         It was    not possible          for

me to do anything about the              persons who entered over the wall                    due to

the numbers who wer e          present,     they simply j u m p e d down and d i s a p p e a r e d

into the the        crowd*

M a n y of the     people who    ent e r e d at this time had been drinking*                     This

in my opin i o n tended to inflame             their anger a n d mad e them more

ag gr es iv e and    I gen u i n e l y feared that sooner or later one of us w o u l d

be assau lted.        The sheer       number of persons mad e          it impossible to

consider a r r esting or ejec ting the              persons who were drunk.              My

i m pression was      that    these    persons had in the m a i n a r r i v e d late at the

ground,     having been in local           licensed     premises drinking but this by

no means a pp l i e d to all.          The m o o d had changed from being good

n a tu r e d earlier to one of hostility,              perhaps anger brought on by fear

in the    crowd outside.         The    si t u a t i o n c o n tinued an d s u d d e n l y the    large

metal    concertina gate C w h i c h was beside us opened*                     A large,

chanting     crowd of       people surged      in through this gate and made                  their

way towards           the terracing.            There was noise       coming from       inside the

gr o u n d as the m a t c h a p p a r en tl y kicked off,            f o l l o w e d shortly afte r w a r d s

by a loud roar as,                I presumed one of the teams had t h r e a t e n e d the

other      teams goal*            The area outside         the ground       cleared of people wit h

the e x c e p t i o n of the odd one or two who were                      left outside.

T h r o u gh o u t   the time w h e n the        crowd was       crushed outside the gr o u n d         I

heard m e s s a g e s     passed over the tannoy asking                   persons wait i n g outside

to be      patient and that there was                 room inside the ground.              These had

little effect,            if an y at all.          Persons       entering    the gr o u n d were,      on

o c c a s i o n s stru g g l i n g    for breath,     p a r t i c u l a r l y the older ones

amongst       them.

S h o r t l y after kick          off time      I went with other o f f i c e r s      into the

ground where we were told to a tt e n d on the track                          in front of the

L e p p i n g s Lane terrace.             We e n t e r e d via the first gang w a y of the S o u t h

Stand.        On emerging            I saw a    large number of persons on the pitch.                       It

was obvious that              something        had occurred.        The    chants that gree t e d us

on entering were              critical        of the con d i t i o n of the ground.          It se e m e d

that     the whole        of the Liverpool           end was      chanting    *shitty ground,

shitty ground,           shitty g r o u n d ’ to the tune of              ’here we go,     here we go,

here we go *as          is chanted my most football                 crowds.     My first

i m pression was         that        the supporters      entering     late had become so

a gi t a t e d that they had invaded the                  pitch.     I was soon to        learn that

was    not    the     case.       I was    gree t e d by a scene that         I can ony descr i b e

as one of horror              .      I went    i mmediately w i t h my      colleagues to the

track at        the L e p pings L ane end of the g r o u n d w here we tried to assist

persons       out of the terrace area via the gates                        in the   perimeter

fencing.        I was    p ri nc ip a l l y enga g e d    in the two s o u t h e r n most      pens,

marked       ’S ’ and     ’CS*       on the ground       plan.     Man y people were       crushed up

against       the fencing and I could see that a great m a n y were struggling

for their very            lives.        More officers a rr i v e d and we all           tried
                                                                                                          PAG E
                                                                                                          S646

d e s p e ra te ly to rescue these               people.      Man y were shout i n g for help-

Other     people who m a na ge d to get through the fencing were wan d e r i n g

about     on the         pitch in a state of shock,                 many   in tears, m a n y were           very

an g r y and a g i ta te d         perhaps      in the    c i r c umstances u n d e r s t a n d a b l y   so.

To their         credit         others   were helping evacuate             the pens.         We were all

ha m p e r e d by the           fact that      the gates were narrow,             so m u c h so that

there     is only width for one                  person to get        t h r o u g h at a time.

P r e s su re     continued to come from behind.                     All   I can imagine          is that

people at the back were so concerned at                             being able       to see that          no-one

r e a lised what was happening at the front.

Officers         were ma k i n g frantic          signals     for    persons      to stop pushing an d

to move         back.          Several   persons were helped out of gate no,2 onto the

track-          Some were         injured but none         seriously-         The greatest          problem

was a r o u nd gate no,3 and along the                     length of the          perimeter fence,                I

saw one y ou th who for some                    inexplicable        reason was       swinging from a

girder      under        the     roof of the West Stand,                Stome     of the     persons on

the pitch were a gg r e s s i v e towards                us, we became          the butt of their

anger.          P er s o n s    of all ages and both sexes were                brought from the             pens

a nd   laid on the              pitch-        I could see that       in the     *CS*    pen persons         in

front of the fence on the terrace were                            piled on top of one another,

crushing         the u nfortunate             ones who had fallen or been forced to the

g r o u nd by sheer weight of pressure from behind.                               Oth e r s were s q u a s h e d

up against           the fence-          As    persons were freed from the pen it became

clear     that there had been a great                     loss of      life a l t h o u g h at this stage

I thought          it w ou ld be in the region of 20-

Many officers were trying to                      rescue     persons trap p e d and my personal

feelings were of helplessness as                         I saw persons         crushed up against               the

fence     or under             persons who were trying to get out.                     Helplessness

because         in spite of being so close,                  close en o u g h to touch it was

impossible           to help them out because of the narrow gates*                              Pers o n s who

were only a ma t t e r           of feet from the gates were unable to get out.

The     casualties         were being         treated by St.        Johns a m bulance        staffand

m a n y persons       came a n d         i d entified themselves as doctors a n d nurses.

T hese    persons undertook a lot of first aid treatment.                                 I brought 3

persons       from the terrace who were u nconscious a m o n g s t                       others who were

able     to walk,       a l t h o ug h    injured.     All 3 who      required e m e rgency

treatment were dealt w i th my                   persons who told me that they were

trai n e d medical         staff and         I r e t urned to see      if I could help the

t rap p e d persons        still         in the terracing.         R e c o v e r y of the victims was

now so slow,         or rather            it see m e d slow because        it was hampered by the

narrow exit         gates.        The      pressure on the fence began to ease a nd                      it

b ecame easier to recover                   casu a l t i e s and it must      be said,      also       recover

the dead.         The    resce effort was he l p e d by a senior                   officer.        I

b elieve Chief Supt.              Nesbit w h o tried to co-ord i n a t e Po l i c e           efforts          by

using a m e g a p h o n e      to get us to work as a team as o p p o s e d to a g roup

of    individuals.           I saw,        initially,      only one a m b u l a n c e and    I believe

that was        one o p e r at ed by St. John's a l t h o u g h a m b u l a n c e s        did attend,

as did the Fire Brig a d e to assist                       in the operation.            The need was for

oxygen to revive             persons a n d to help those who wer e unconscious.

O x y g e n was    in short sup p l y a n d really only a r r i v e d w h e n fire service

personnel a t te nd ed w i t h rescue equipment.                     Advertising          boards were

u sed as stret c h e r s         for the d ead an d injured.               Bo d i e s   lay on the turf

w ith    clothing       covering their           faces.      The w hole scene was one of

a b s olute     horror,      one w h i c h no-one w h a tever         their     professional

training        or b a c k g r o u n d could possibly be t r a i n e d to deal with.

As the t e r racing began to clear                    I saw one of the barriers              in *CS*          pen

had been bent           c o mpletely over a n d broken.              The    pressure on the

persons at the           front must          have been t r e m e n d o u s an d     I experienced

great     so rrow for the victims.                   All   the victims wer e finally           removed

to find friends a n d relativeds,                   many,     in fact      nea r l y all      seemed

unable to believe what had happened.                          M any blamed the police,                   m any

blamed the gr o u n d a n d the manner                of ticket a llocation,              m a n y bl a m e d

both.          M any were a ngry and were abusive towards me and my

colleagues.            To some extent          I u n d e r s t a n d the   reason for this.               By

that     I do not m e an that            I feel    the Police w ere to blame but                    I do

u n d er st an d what        the persons must         have felt a n d u n d e r s t a n d that            they

had to take           it out on someone.             E v e n t u a l l y the a n n o u n c e m e n t was made

that     the m a t c h itself had been abandoned.                     The gr o u n d began to clear

a n d we went w i th the s u pporters                into L e p p i n g s Lane      towards        their

transport          before     returning to the N or t h Stand.                 It was while speaking

to a colleague there that                    I realised the e n o r m i t y of the tragedy.                          I

learned that           there were 74 bodies             laid in the gymnasium.

Wh i l s t     in the N or t h S t a n d     I was able to reflect on what                   had

occurred.           What     I have w ri t t e n before was my a c c o u n t of the                 incident

as     it developed.           To sum up I feel,           with o u t w a n t i n g to lay blame at

a n y o n e ’s door,        that    I should make m y own personal                feelings         known.

I,     like m any others,            have    been a football         s u p porter all my           life.         I

have been w a t c h i n g          football at H i l l s b o r o u g h since before          1960 - in

fact my         mot h e r   informs me that         I went to my first m a t c h at 3                y ears of

a ge - some 33 years ago now.                     I am a P o l i c e O f f i c e r of      13 1/2 years

service and           I have wo r k e d m any football matches,                 four or five of

wh i c h have been semi              finals,    including the          corre s p o n d i n g m a t c h

b e tw e e n    the same teams          last year - a l t h o u g h on that o c c a s i o n          I was on

duty     in     the refreshment           concourse      in the West Stand.               I have also

a t te nd ed m a n y matches,           m a i n ly at Hillsborough,          m a n y wit h    large gates

an d    I have always          felt safe there -           indeed my wife,            12 year old

daughter and 9 year old son regularly at t e n d w i t h me.                              None of us

have ever had cause to feel                    unsafe at the ground.                In view of the

f o regoing        p a r agraph     I feel    in some ways q u a l i f i e d to pass an

’informed*         opinion.         I keep abre a s t        of football matt e r s a n d am

conscious        of the safety aspect                from both sides of the fence,              as    it

were.

I know that          the    capacity for this m a t c h was 5 4 , 0 0 0           I also know that

S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y F.C    is a club w h i c h has st a g e d     important matches

for a number             of years,        including semi       finals an d st a g e d last year's

semi    final      between L i v erpool a n d Motts Forest.                 T hese matc h e s are all

ticket affa i r s w i t h one ticket                 being sold for each seat or

c orre s p o n d i n g    place on a terrace.               The capacity    is g o v e r n e d by local

authority,         fire     regulations and police and I am sure that the ground

can hold more             than this        figure,    but    it is kept at       the figure for

safety      reasons.         I do not w i s h to enter           into the a r g ument       over     ticket

allocations         but     I a m c o n vinced that          if only these       persons with

tickets      had gone        to the game          then this trag e d y w o u l d not have

occurred.          I cannot        put a figure        on how m a n y a t t e n d e d without      tickets

but    it was a large             number,     it must have       been for such a crowd to form

outside the ground.                 The     crush outside was        such that      perons who M/ere

entering were             injured and in genuine              fear of their       lives.     I feel

that    if the pressure had not been released then someone w o u l d have

been s er io u s l y       injured or indeed killed outside                 the ground.

U n f o r t u n a t e l y the effect of opening Gat e C a l l o w e d             persons    to enter

at a fast        rate,      as opposed to a steady flow thro u g h the turnstiles.

The    crowd flooded across                 the e n closure towards        the tunnel       in the

centre of the stand - it is traditional                          that the    crowd is at        its most

dense     in the a r e a behind the goal.                    I can recall,       w h e n first making

my way towards the track that w h e n                       I passed the entrance          to the     'S'

pen it looked full and                    people were       craning their    necks to see w h e n 1

got onto the track that                    pen,   although     crowded,    was    not full    to

capacity.         The      'CS*    pen on the        contrary was     ja m m e d full.      It is quite

possible that the surge of people                       into the terrace          via the tunnel

                                                                                                     S846

put     pressure on the people a lr e a d y                inside,    who w ere fo r c e d to sway

f o r w a r d putting        pressure on the barrier and the                    persons at the

front.       Perh a p s      if the terracing had not              been d i v i d e d    into pens     then

the     crowd could have spread out more                       laterally,       fill i n g spaces     in

pens     'S’ and       *N' w hi ch a lt h o u g h    crowded were         not    full.     Unfortunately

the     pen fencing          prevents    lateral movement.

I also feel           that   drink had a       large       part to play.          It is traditional

to    'have a couple           of drinks'      before a game but some                persons a t t e n d e d

at    the game,        o b v io u s l y the worse for drink,            making     it a day out and

a n excuse       or a 'booze u p ’ .         These       persons seemed          intent on getting

in, w h a t e v e r    the    cost.     The y were       not    prepared to wait a n d seemed to

have     no regard for the saf ety of their fellow supporters.                                  Drinks

affect     people         in different      ways     but    people tend to become more

aggressive,           p a r t i cularly w h e n in large groups            or gangs,       more    excited

an d a g i t a t e d an d     less tolerant an d more             prepared to e x e rcise their

animal      instincts        to get what they want - in this                     case e ntry to the

match     regardless         of the safety of themselves                 or others.

As for the        police side,          I feel      that we were        conf r o n t e d by a sit u a t i o n

w h i c h got out         of hand an d we found ourselves                unable      to cope wit h the

change     in conditions a l t h o u g h perhaps no c o n t i n g e n c y               plans   could have

a l l o w e d for what       happened.       It w o u l d seem that more             people a t t e n d e d

by private        transport,          coach or by mini           bus so that they w o u l d have

m ore    freedom than they w o u l d           if they had t r a v e l l e d by train when they

w o u l d have    been e s c o r t e d to the gr o u n d by police               officers.

F r o m the grounds          point    of v i e w    it   is a s s u m e d that all a r r a n g e m e n t s

for the m a t c h met w i t h the approval                  of the     local     authority.       F r o m my

own e x p e r i e n c e    I know that      the     club is conscious            of the needs of

s a f e t y a n d public       order and w o u l d presume that the ground complies

w i t h sa f e t y regulations - oth e r w i s e            it w o u l d not have been chosen as

a venue.         It certainly seemed to cope w i t h the                     c o r r esponding m a t c h

             last year*

             Ha v in g   r e flected on the whole    incident there   is not one sole factor

             w h i c h can be blamed*     Perhaps    it h a p pened as a result of several

             ingredients       for disaster all     coming together at once.         One thing that

             I do know is that        the seeds for the tragedy were sow n outside the

             t u rnstiles at the L e p p in gs Lane end.     The deaths o c c u r r e d   inside      the

             gr o u n d but these     came about as a direct    result   of what went        off    in

             the S O or 30 m in ut es     prior to kick off.     If that    concl u s i o n lays the

             blame at      the feet   of some of the supporters who a t t e n d e d on that day

             then so be       it.

A call        from the        control     box to be d e p l o y e d at the turnstiles Pe n i s t o n e

Rd„          I paired w i t h Police C o n s t a b l e John T r e w i c k at turnstiles

al l o wi ng Motts Forest              fans    into the Kop.            As    in the     past fans are         in

the m a i n f r i e nd ly and well             beha v e d w i t h the odd exception.



A number of fans had cans of beer an d were a s k e d to finish                                   it before

entering        the ground.              I a s s i st ed Police C o n s t a b l e A n d y West to eject

a L iv er p o o l     fan for jumping the turnstile.                         He was taken to the

Po l i c e    room,    his details          o b t ained and then he was             ejected.



Time     1 4 , 15pm    (1415)       crowds     building      now but a g a i n apart           from the odd

drunk all         quiet and well            behaved.       I returned to John Trewick on the

turnstiles.                Police C on st a b l e B r o u g h a m   (E2> had duties at the P e l i c a n

crossing        in front of us.                Dick a r r e s t e d a very d r u n k e n fan,         I

a s s is te d him to the Police                room w hi c h now       is t h r o n g e d wit h officers

and their         prisoners.             I returned to the t u rnstiles                passing a number

of my colleagues               carrying two or three prisoners who were                          throwing

t he m s e l v e s about       shouting and swearing.



I went        outside         the ground again.              By now very busy m a n y people

as k i n g about       tickets,        'Where     can we buy tickets*,              both N o t t s and

L i v erpoo l     fans.



It mus t have          bean 2 . 5 5 p m     <1435) we were          called     into the ground and

sent a l o n g       the    perimeter       track.        I was at or near the front of the

unit.          I remember          looking down the front of the N o r t h Stand,                         it

seemed        like    chaos.         A line of bobbies were               facing the crowd as we

a p p r o a c h e d the L e p pings Ln end of the stand,                     people were all          over the

track.          I saw a Special            C on st a b l e and P o l i c e C o n s t a b l e   1785

s truggling wit h a fan              I went     to their a s s i s t a n c e an d got the fan in

an arm lock and m a rc he d him back to the                    charge      room,        rushed him

t h r o u g h the office a r e a w h i c h was        full a n d straight              into the    cell

This was also full           of drunken,        b lood covered fans and about five

officers        just   to keep the peace              The a t m o s p h e r e was very volatile

T here were about          12 prisoners,        all    but two or three were s c reaming and

shout i n g about       they w a n t e d to watch the game



I remained        in the    charge    room for a couple of m i n u t e s because                    I

thought        it was going to errupt an y second                     Absolute          chaos     A fan

w i t h a beard wit h cut          lips and blood all            over his face was going

berserk          I tried to calm          him an d sit him down              He sprayed blood                in

my face as he shouted and                 swore     The match,         the m a t c h



I decided        to leave the charge          room an d get         back outside,            there were

enough officers          there       On   leaving      X wa l k e d towards            the mai n track

gates          I saw a line of Pol i c e dogs and handlers                       from near the gym

door     right    round to the ground gates,                where     they were          i n t e r mingled

w ith horses and bobbies                  I began to run my m i n d work i n g fast                     I

thou g h t     it's    really blown       now the crowd was          very noisy             I am on the

perimeter        track now running towards                the Leppings           Ln,    people and some

On arrival        at the other end,          very strange         scene      people sat down by the

fence w a t c hi ng the game wh i l s t others frantic                   looking         in towards the

fence          I pushed through to the fence near to the gate                             far   right        The

all    over    by fans        rushing       past towards          the open gate            I forced m y way

to the gate and climbed above the escaping fans forcing m y way through

I reached Po l i c e Con s t a b l e Just i c e                 We broke a w a y the fencing w ith

other Police          outside and fans                 inside      E v e r y t h i n g was so

chaotic,       the fans just              kept    pulling at the fence after                 it was broken

I forced them off and we got the body out                                  Pol i c e C o n s t a b l e Justice

and    I m o v e d towards the centre of the pen,                         we saw anot h e r       two bodies

right down at the front under the fencing                                  Blue,     dead eyes open

Bot h of us went            to them and each started m o u t h to m o u t h and                        cardiac

                I was   to join part of Serial               15 w h i c h was       c o m manded by Police S e r g e a n t

                from the S ec t i o n       Inspector,     Mr WHITE*

               Whilst     standing on the terracing,                 Mr W H I T E pointed out the                 layout of

                the terracing*             He made   reference        to the fact that for normal matches

However,        in a nt ic ip at io n of the size of the              crowd,      the gates were

locked      in the O P E N      position*

Mr W H I T E briefed the serial                and instr u c t e d that we should be

p osi t i o n e d    inside the ground,             alongside    t u rnstiles 9-16*           The duties

were    to s u p ervise        entry,    search people for alcohol                and other

cont r a b a n d     (flags etc)*        On c om p l e t i o n of entry the serial were                   then

to enter       the L e p p i n g s Ln t errace at the rear,               and s u p ervise       crowd

behaviour*            O n c om p l e t i o n of the game,       we went    to assist          in the

clearing of the ground*                  Mr W H I T E   in closing said that                in an ideal

s i t u a t io n he w ould have used our two Seri a l s                 in the terracing             to

help    locate and d i stribute               the    crowds w i t h i n the enclosures*

The serial           took up posit i o n       in front     of the Gate        ’8* a n d t u rnstiles 9 —

16 at ar o u n d       1100 hrs.        The    t u r n s t i l e s at this stage were not open and

the time was used to f a m i l iarise ourselves w i t h the C l u b Officials,

an d other          f acilities    that were         present    in the area,        snack bars,

programme           sellers,    etc*

The turn s t i l e s opened at a bout                noon and from this time onw a r d there

was a steady trickle of fans entering                          the ground*        The great m a j o r i t y

at this time had alre a d y been s e a r c h e d                prior to entry          into the ground*

However,       there was        no a n i m o s i t y an d the second se a r c h a f f o r d e d a

c e rt a i n amount of rapport w i t h the fans.                   It was notic e a b l e that all

the    people entering            the gr o u n d at this time were honest,                   decent

people,      well      dres s e d and well          behaved*    One or two        came thro u g h wit h

cans of       'pop*     but they q ui c k l y d i s p o s e d of this        in a proper manner

                                                                                                      S1357

F r o m the opening of the turnstiles at                        1200 hrs,      noon,      until   sometime

after    1400 hours,           the e ntr y flow to the gr o u n d g r a d u a l l y          increased,

without     problem,         like an y other football match.

At some stage,         t u rnstiles 9 and              10 were b a r r i e r e d off to the Lappi n g s

L n end an d used for the entry to the N o r t h Stand.                            This     reduced,       by

two,    the number          of turns t i l e s available.

As the time        progressed,             I became g ra du a l l y a w a r e of a b u i l d - u p of

supporters       outside        the ground,          though my view of the               proceedings was

limited to what             I could see t hr o u g h the turnstile.                     As the    crowds

built    up I became           conscious of          people having d i f f i c u l t y      in entering

thro u g h the turnstile.                  The    crush outside was         such that the

turnstiles,        on occasions,             were unable        to f u n c t i o n properly and       people

were    being    injured        in the turnstile             passage.       M ore than one man

e me r g e d from the turnstile                  bent double and        I saw one man physically

sick.

F r om these     people entering                 the ground,     I began to u n d e r s t a n d that

there were dif f i c u l t i e s           outside the ground,           and   it was about         this    time

that    I became aware of people banging and shouting outside and man y

a p p ea re d to be kicking and banging on the                        conce r t i n a gate.       G i v e n all

this    inf orm a t i o n      I formed the opin i o n that there were                     great masses         of

people outside,             a l th ou gh    I was not aware of an y specific difficulty.

It was about this time that a y o u th a p p e a r e d on top of the wall                               above

the turnstiles.              He was        told to get down,          but he was         shouting that

people were        in diff i c u l t i e s        outside    the gates.        He a t t e m p t e d to gain

entry to the ground,               but      I took hold of him a n d e j e c t e d him through

Gate    *C’.     I did not use Gate                 * B ’ because     I was aware of a vast number

of   people outside.              On my return to position,                 I saw that the

roof    and s u r r o unding wall were               literally       covered w i t h s u pporters who

had climbed        into the ground.                 Some were e n d e a v o u r i n g    to enter the

ground,     some were          c omplain ing of the           crush outside,            and others were
                                                                                                       PAGE            4
                                                                                                       91357

br a n d i s h i n g    valid entry tickets.             It was about       this      time that we were

j o i n ed by an Inspector and other Officers.                          I do not know his name,                   he

was    not our S e c t i o n Inspector.

He    climbed on to the              roof of the turnstile and b e c k o n e d other O f f i c e r ©

to do so,          but    none did.         This    Inspector     began helping         people       into the

ground,        and at one stage the turnstile                    roof was     l i terally covered w ith

spectators.              At this     stage    I received an instruction,                from who        I know

not,     that      provided these spec t a t o r s had tickets,                then we should admit

them.        The       persons    on the     roof began to enter the ground.                    The

m a j o r i t y of      people had tickets           but many did not.           The    persons who         had

gained acc e s s          then began to pass the u n c h e c k e d tickets                back over        the

roof and over             the wall.

At one stage,             one    person who was a t t e m p t i n g     to gain access          came     into

my grasp,          he began saying,           " I ’ve got a ticket,         I've got a ticket."

He also sho w e d me a M e r s e ys id e Police W a r r a n t Card,                   the name on it,             I

believe,                   ~~| or similar.          I made    comment    to him a bout having mor e

sense,       and he became quite angry                  c omplaining about the things that

were     going         on outside,     a n d the     lack of p r o f e s s i o n a l i s m on the     part of

S o u t h Yor k s h i r e Police.           As he    passed into the ground,              I made      comment

to Po l i c e Sergeant B U R NS that                he was a Po l i c e Officer.

I became aware of a general                     upsurge      in a ct i v i t y both    inside and

outside the ground,                a n d that      people were still        climbing         in and     passing

u n us ed tickets backwards.                  The banging on the metal                gate    increased,

whe n I saw one of the Clu b Stewards                        on the gate go to the opening

mechanism.              I looked at him and he said,               "I'm open i n g this gate,              1*11

take     responsibility",             and    p r o ceeded to open the         c o ncertina gate.            I

did not see who a s s i s t e d             in the opening.          As the    crowds entered the

ground       I had to take           refuge a l on gs i d e t u rnstile       16.      Several       hund r e d

people e nt e r e d the ground and                  I was amazed that the             rush s t o p p e d and

there was only a few people outside.                           As the gates were             being    closed,
                                                                                                  PAGE          5

I looked outside a n d saw that                  the M o u n t e d S e c t i o n were holding a large

crowd back          in L e p p i n g s Ln*

A    large number of those a d m i tt ed through Gate                    * B ’ were hanging ar o u n d

the turnstile area*                I saw people a t t e m p t i n g     to throw unused tickets

over     the gates,        pass them under         the gates or thro u g h the gap in

b etw e e n the gates*              It became obvious          to me at this      stage     that

ticket     control        had     got out of hand,        and this seemed to be             reflected by

    the turnstile operators M/ho seemed to be a l l o w i n g a n y b o d y                in, w i t h or

w i t h o u t tickets*          I had no idea of the time but some time after                      the

gates     had been opened,            several minutes,          I h e a r d a cheer w i t h i n   the

ground,       and    I a ss u m e d this to be the kick off*               I c o n tinued to w a t c h

people enter through the turnstiles M>hen I saw the gate o pen a g a i n and

a number       of Police Officers              rushed    into the ground,         saying that there

was    trouble on the terracing*

A few m o m e n t s     later Police S e r g e a n t B URNS o r d e r e d us as a Serial            to

enter     the terraced a r e a at            the L e p pings     L n end* I ente r e d     through the

centre tunnel           under     the West Stand*            As I passed      dow n the tunnel,             I

was met       by various groups           of people     rushing up the tunnel            carrying

injured persons to                the rear of the st^nd*              Some of the spec t a t o r s were

very a n g r y a n d began s c reaming at Police O f f icers                  saying,     "There's

dead     people down there,            it's your fault*"

As    I was ma k i n g my way forw a r d to assist               in the    rescue an d removal of

the    injured,       I was      c onfron ted by angry fans w a v i n g        tickets,     and

saying,       "We've never         been checked,        these    tickets are unused,         y o u ’ve

let too m a n y        in here,     you're      responsible*"

I a s s i s t e d to the best of my a bi l i t y          in the      removing of some dead and

n u m erous    slightly         injured      persons to the      rear of the m a i n stand*             I

then went       thro u g h the      crowd a n d on to the         pitch in order to find other

m emb e r s of my serial*

W h i l s t making my way thro u g h the            crowd,      I was   c o nfronted by a range of

emotion from,          "You're     r esponsible - i t ’s all your fault" to                   " I t ’s not

your     fault      personally"*         M a n y s p ectators   remained     in position and were

asking,      "What time will          kick off be*"

W h i l st at the entrance to the tunnel,                   I saw fans     in the West S t a n d

begin to rip hoardings              from a b o v e the t e r r a c e d area*        The fans on the

terrace below          c o mplained that they were being s h o w e r e d w i t h debris,

but     I h e ard someone         say,    "Tell   the press w e " r e     not all     hooligans,

these are for stretchers*"

F r o m this     point       I coaxed people to leave the ground,                but man y were

refusing       to    leave without        refunds     for un u s e d tickets*

I later      reformed w ith my serial             a n d a t t e n d e d a debrief    in the N o r t h

Stand*       It was at this         point     I made my M>ay to a Se n i o r Offi c e r            that

G ate    'B* had been opened,             a p p a r e n t l y without Police    instruction*          I

W h i l s t w a l k i ng through the N o r t h S t a n d     I was s i c k e n e d by the number           of

empty beer          cans a n d spirit      bottles     that had been a p p a r e n t l y smugg l e d

into the ground*

In the     period that          I was enga g e d on s e a rching       persons,      I found no

alcohol at all           but as the time a p p r o a c h e d     1500 hours,        then cans a n d

bottles began to appear on the floor of the turnstile*                                W hen    I

returned to the scene              later     I was    confr o n t e d w i t h quite a q u a n t i t y of

e mpty and part empty             cans    in and a r o u n d the turnstile.

Prior     to a tt en d i n g the debrief we were standing as a serial a l o n g s i d e

the t u r n stile w hen         I saw a small        group of people,        very upset,        walking

towards      the exit*

A w o m a n said,      "Get    rid of him,        please,    I'm trying to find my husband*"

I saw a y ou n g i s h person ca rrying a notebook.

I said to him,           "Who are you?"

He said,       "I'm from the Star,            I'm only after a story*"

             I told him to     leave the w oman alone as she was o b v i o u s l y distressed*

            He went towards Police S e r geant BURNS,       who also told him to go away.

                 was     posted to A t t er cl if fe Division-                I remained there until October

                 it was a family day out and                  I spent        the whole of the m a t c h sat with

                 the s up p o r t e r s    in the N or th Stand.

                 In Octo b e r      1974    (001074)     I was      t r a n s f e r r e d to the H a c k e n t h o r p ©

100 plus       football matches-               I have w o r k ed about 3 or 4 semi                   final® at

Hi 1 lsborough.           The    last    being     in April       19SS    (000488)      betw e e n Liverpool

a nd N o t t i n g h a m Forest-         I w o r k ed on a static         point on P e n i s t o n e        Roa d

an d     I did not encounter any trouble.

I w o rk ed at H i l l s b o r o u g h on one occasion,                 which     I think was a semi

final     a number of years              ago w h e n a part of the wall                in front      of     the

Sp i o n Ho p collapsed-             I   do not know why            it did collapse but

together w i th other o f f icers the s i t u a t i o n was                     c o ntained a n d the

crowd was m ov ed a w a y from the wall a n d we then formed a cordon

ac r o s s the d am a g e d area.          We w o r k e d on the S p o i n Ho p side of the

wall     s a n d w ic he d between the damage and the                    crowd-       At no time was

there any violence              towards me or my fellow officers on this

occasion-           As   I ’ve said I think that              it was a semi           final    but    it

could have been another major                      football match.

Wh e n   I w o r k ed at H i l l s b o r o u g h   I have usually w o r k e d on the S p o i n Ho p

or the Pe n i s t o n e R o a d side of the ground,                     but    I have w o r k e d on

Leppings       Lan e a n d the s u r r o u n d i n g area,         but not at L e p pings

Lane     turnstiles.            I think    that     during my service              I have w o r k e d

every duty a u ni fo r m e d police                constable w o u l d work at a Football

on S at u r d a y    11 April      1989    (110489)        an d   I was       im m e d i a t e l y c o ntacted by

P S Payne who            informed me that          I was to work under               him on serial          16

on the Leppings            Lane turnstile.            He    informed me b a s i c a l l y my duties

a n d we were        then conveyed to the ground                   in a rented double decker

bus.      When      I c o mmenced my duties           I was       not    issued w i t h a      personal

radio     nor was         I given one      later that day.

W hen we arrived; at the ground we went to the N o r t h Stand,                                  on the

n u m bered seats a s s i g n e d our serial               awaiting a briefing w h i c h wa®

c o nducted on the the mai n by Ch- Supt-                         Duckenfield,          but w ith

a s s i s ta nc e   of other      officers.

After     this,    briefly    Insp P ur dy spoke to me about         the duties w hile we

c o n s u m e d breakfast    on the N o r t h Stand.      We also spoke about       our

personal     lives as we have known each other for a number of years an d

have     in fact w o r ke d at football matc h e s together.

A fter    this we went       to the L e p pings Lane side of the ground where all

our duties        for the full m a t c h were e x p l a i n e d to us.    I was    present

there w hen       Insp Sykes gave us a brief outline of the overall                  duties at

that     side of the ground.

I knew what my duties were for the full m a t c h and prior to my taking

position outside the t u rns tiles              I went   into the West S t a n d to look at

the lay out as           I was to go there and perform duties after the kick

off.     Ha ving    done this       I returned to behind the stand w here           I joined,

my   colleagues.

P rior    to us taking our duties up,             I went together w i t h PC 620 Yates

to the sweet        shop s i t uated on L e p p i n g s e Lane   betw e e n the entrances

and Vere Road.           After     purchasing    some sweets     I had a very short

c onv e r s a t i o n w i t h a girl   behind the counter who told me that some of

the L i ve rpool     fans had a r r i v e d outside      the gr o u n d about 7.4 5 am

alcohol.       She did say that they had not              caused any trouble.

Upon     returning to turnstiles A to G,              I took up my    position outside

turn s t i l e s D and E.

Obviously      I was aware that we were s e a r c h i n g s u p p o r t e r s for offensive

weap o n s an d also enforcing             the law relating to alcohol      in particular

persons a t t e m p t i n g to gain entry w i t h drink or         if they were drunk.

There was a dribble of people                 coming t h r o u g h the turnstiles about      12

through.       The m a j o r i t y of these early s u pporters were families,

fathers,     sons and the          like.

he a p p ro ac he d the entrance he was a c c o m p a n i e d by a small                       group of

Liverpool         supporters       of a similar          d e s c r i p t i o n as he,    but as they got

nearer t hey stood still and he w a l k e d thro u g h on his own.                                He was

challenged by anot h e r Police Offi c e r an d con s e n t e d to be searched.

B ec a u s e   there were very few people                 coming t h r o u g h he was s u b j e c t e d to

a t h o r o u g h search.        On compl e t i o n of this he did not attempt                        to go

t h r o u g h the turns t i l e s     but    returned to his friends and they all                             then

left the entrance an d stood on the bridge over the Don a n d began

drinking alcohol            from cans,        w h i c h they placed on the bridge wall.                            I

informed my fellow officers                   of what had o c c u r r e d a n d to be vigilant

if they all         tried to enter again.

N e a rl y all     the supporters who             came through           in this time were orde r l y

a n d did not appear           to have been drinking.                    S h o r t l y after starting to

search them         I s us ta i n e d 2 cuts to my fingers,                  w h i c h were m ore of a

result of my hard skin and then I went to the F irst Aid                                      room below

the N o r t h S t a n d where       I o b t a in ed some       plasters        from a St Johns

Am bu la nc e     nurse and      I then returned to my position.                         I was awa y from

my post for about 5 minutes.

In body searching             the supp o r t e r s a t t e m p t i n g    to enter the ground                 I

realised that          to search them c o rrectly                I w o u l d be able to smell                 their

br e at h for a lc oh o l / i n t o x i c a n t s .     As a result         I p e rformed a t h o r o u g h

seach on them a n d always               smel l e d their       breath.          I believe that           I

e nt er ed into a f r i e nd ly a tt it u d u e          towards     the suppo r t e r s to such a

degree that         I w ou ld make a fuss over an y child who                        I w o u l d perform a

cursory body search to the                   laughter of the             person a c c o m p a n y i n g   them.

In fact        in performing this kind of seaching                        I got my right trouser

knee dirty and was              light h ea rt e d l y told to clean it either Sgt Payne

or   Insp Purdy.

As the         crowds built up it was             not    possible to s e a r c h the s u pporters

in the same manner,               but     I did endeavour       to se a r c h as m a n y as        I

could.        In this       period I noti c e d that WPC H u c k s t e p p was a d v ising a

supporter           not to enter the ground as he M/as the w o r s e for drink,

an d a p pe ar ed to have fa l l e n in something wet                    because his trouser                legs

were wet.            A r o u n d this    point    it a p p e a r e d to me that    the m a j o r i t y of

male     suppo r t e r s had been drinking              intoxicants of some form as not

only could I smell               it on their        breath but     it was     in the air as well.

I did not sto p anyone entering                     the ground because         they were drunk,

but having said this a                   lot of them a pp e a r e d to have        been drinking*

About     1.40pm        (1340)    I was aware that P S P ayne had d e t a i n e d a m a n for-

a t t e m pt in g    to enter the gro u n d w i t h S cans of H e i n e k e n a n d I a s s i s t e d

him to the Po l i c e          room under         the N o r t h Stand.     I then returned to my

post.

I continued to body se a r c h people entering turn s t i l e s D and E.                                I

knew that there had been a problem w ith the a l l o c a t i o n of tickets                                 to

the Liv e r p o o l      s u pporters      in that some had been g iven tickets for the

S p i o n Ko p a n d they were            coming to the L e p pings Lane           to try an d get

in.      I was told by a u ni fo r m e d            Inspector     (he had a full         beard but           I

do not know his name)                   who was    behind the t u rnstiles         that a small

a m o un t of them could be               let through.       But having       said this          I did not

pers o n a l l y     let an y o n e     through an d    infact a fter a short time the

p er m i s s i o n had been w i t h d r a w n and the s u p p o r t e r s were        informed to

enter a small e n closure on the S p o i n Ki p s p e c i f i c a l l y for the

Li v erpool         fans.

I think that at this time                   I was w o r k i n g w i t h PC 6 2 0 and a bout 2 . 2 5 p m

(1425)       he told me that             he was going to leave me as              together g/ith

S t a n d Police Room.            At this time         I was aware that PC D u f f y was work i n g

                                                                                             PAGE              6

O f f i c e r s w or k i n g turnstile s A to C.        I cannot     recall   who these officers

we re .J us t     prior    to PC Yates      leaving me the     crowd had begun to start

building up*            It was a f r i endly    crowd but o b v i o u s l y a lot of them had

been drinking as            I could smell      it on their br e a t h and in the air.                    1'

was     still able to        by this    time   'frisk*    people e n t ering the ground.I

t hen became aware           of another      problem,    this of people trying to enter

the grou nd with o u t a ticket an d a t t m p t i n g        to pay a n e n t rance fee to the

t u r nstil e     operators,.      I did not    p ersonally see any of the turnstile

operators D an d E           take a n y m o n e y or   let a n y o n e thro u g h without a ticket,

they just refused            them entry and this         caused a problem in that            I had            to

pull     the person back out of the turnstiles a g a i n s t               the queue*         I cannot

recall         how many times      I did this but       it w o u l d have 3 or 4.        Beca u s e       of

this     I then began as k i n g       the fans    if they had tickets a n d refused

those w it h o u t to a c t u a l l y enter     the entrance       of the turnstiles.            On

a n ot h e r   o c c a s i o n a n old ma n got stuck    in t u r nstile D because at first

he    could not find his ticket an d then he had d i f f i c u l t y getting                    it out

of his         clothing*    A lot of the fans          told me that      they had tickets            but

wer e    not showing them to me,            they just produced them to the turnstile

operator,        and    I formed the opin i o n that this was            because    they were

f r i g h te ne d of the tickets        being stolen*

W h e n PC Yates        left me    (at this    time 4 of the serial were absent)                 I

was able to move to a position between the two turn s t i l e s entrances

w i t h m y back agai n s t a piece of w o o d running from ground to ceiling

divid i n g      the two entrances.          I think that     it was ar o u n d this time that

I saw Insp P u r dy to m y          left,   s tood on something a n d he a s k e d me haw                 I

w as to w hi ch        1 replied    I was alright.        I n itially    I was not being

rushed a n d       I held my arms       out across      the entrances      still a t t e m p t i n g

to stop s up p o r t e r s blocking the t u rnstiles           up.      It was at this        time        I

d e ci de d that       it was   impossible     to search an y o n e     coming thro u g h so         I

still     m o ni to re d   people entering the turnstiles.

At one stage        I was aware       that a n officer       from behind the turnstiles

told me that a ma n a t t e m pt i n g to enter            had   in fact been thrown out of

the ground-         My    immediate feelings were that             he w o u l d atte m p t    to jump

over the turnstile            into the ground so I physi c a l l y           pulled him back

a w a y from the entrance.            I think that this o c c u r r e d shortly a fter                   I

r e t u r n e d from the Police       room w h e n   I a s s i s t e d PS Payne,    but    I cannot

be sure.

The    next thing that happened was there was a pushing of the                             crowd

towards        the turnstiles a n d      I was    crushed a g a i n s t my    chest*      I thought

that    it was     someone at the        rear    pushing as the       crowd,    shortly

afterwards,        backed a w ay from me.

I was then aware that a m ou n t e d             police officer       (from another          force)

rode up to me,           bas i c a l l y betw e e n the queues    for turnstiles D a n d E

and F and G and told me to move                  out of the way.         I immediately m o v e d

a ga i n s t the wall      between turnstile E a n d F w h i c h was a small                 clear

area.      I was a g a i n aware that        Insp P u r dy a s k e d a bout my safety.               I

a g a i n told him I was a i r i g h t , in fact         I was    joking a n d laughing w i t h

the s up p o r t e r s as by this time          I was getting e x t r e m e l y w a r m and hot

a n d sweat was      pouring down my face*             Obviously      I was    face to face

w i t h them and I a ga i n       could smell        intoxicants on their          breaths,     not

everyone        but a lot of them.

I could see the same m ou nt ed officer who spoke to me,                        he was a bout 4

yards a w a y from me a n d he kept             pointing    to the crowd that was

a d ja ce nt    to him telling them to stop             pushing.      The    crush then became

worse a n d together wit h DC D u f fy            I deci d e d to try a n d get out.             I

also    think at some stage           I was told to get out by Insp Purdy.                     We

tried to fo l l o w the m ou n t e d officer           in the    ’w a k e ’ that he    left as he

made    his horse go backwards            but PC D uffy fell        to the floor.            He was

je e r e d by the    crowd but none a t t e m p t e d to hurt him*             He got to his                 feet

I told him that we w ou l d have to get out another way.                           He sug g e s t e d
                                                                                               PAGE             8

trying to go thro u g h the queue to t u rnstile F a n d G and under the metal

barrier*         I told him that        it was      impossible      because    of the number             of

s u pporters      there-      They were all         packed    in like sardines.          Pe o p l e were

s h o uting     becuase they were         getting       crushed.     (There were only a few

shouting)         PC D uf f y m an a g e d to get thro u g h tur n s t i l e E.       I could not

f o l lo w him I was being          crushed against the wall             between E and F,            I

could not move,           I could not m ove my arms.               T h e n a m a n in front    of me

s t ar t e d shouting,       'My wi f e ' s    pregnant,     stop pushing*.         He said this a

number of times and the crowd a p p e a r e d to pull                   back s l i ghtly a l l o w i n g

the    couple slight        breathing space*             I saw my chance       to help this girl

an d also       get   out of this      situation,        so I pushed m y s e l f    behind this              girl

a n d s ho u t e d for the     crowd to stop pushing              I held my arms against             the

entrance        to the turnstile w hile her husb a n d pushed his foot agai n s t                             the

wall,    therefore        pushing agai n s t the         crowd*     In this way the girl             got

thro u g h the turnstile an d           I followed.          Her h u s b a n d got stuck on the

outside of the turnstiles*                    W h e n I got to the     inside of the t u rnstile                I

could not see any of m y serial.                    I was out of breath an d ext r e m e l y

hot*     Before       I could do a n y t h i n g    I heard the sound of raised voices

from w i th in turnstile E an d               I immediately went        there where      I saw a

white male 35 arguing w ith the turnstile                      operator,      basically he was

d e m andin g    to be let     in as he had g iven his ticket               to the operator an d

he wasn't        being a l lo we d entry*          I spoke w i t h the turnstile         operator and

he said the ma n had not given him a ticket a n d he was                           lying.     I got

hold of this man and noticed that his breath smelt                            of alcohol      an d       I

pulled him from the turnstile a n d together w i t h a n o t h e r officer                       I

ejec t e d him out of a gate s i t u a t e d on the G side of the turnstile                              (the

one give n entry to           lane running         behind the south stand).             I then went

back    to behind the turnstiles*                  On   looking thro u g h them,      towards        the

queues    I could see that the s u pporters were                    being crushed agai n s t          the

entrance        to the turnstiles*             T hey were all      shouting and screaming and
                                                                                                    PAGE

it a p p e a r e d to me that they were only coming                        through the turnstiles

very slowly.          I then saw a supporter w i t h i n the turnstile attempt to

pay m o n e y to enter the ground.                  This was a g a i n       refused by the

operator      and I ejec t e d him.            At this time the s u p p o r t e r s outside were

screaming       that someone was            going to be crushed to d eath unless

s o m e t h i n g was done.      The next thing            I recall was a m a n entering             one

of the t u rnstiles an d he had a                 child on his shoulders*                 The man was

very    red in the face and was shouting for someone                             to take his child

an d   I saw a un i f o r m e d S e r g e a n t   (identity unknown)             take the       child from

the m a n and then the man                came t hr o u g h the turnstiles.             It was about

this    time that w hen the supporters m an a g e d to come thro u g h the

turnstiles       that some of them were falling to their knees,                              they were

obviously       in a d is t r e s s e d    c o ndition most were gasping for air.                    Some

of them were         shouting at us that something                       had got to be done,        as

they fea red someone w o u l d be killed.

At this      point    I deci d e d to find my serial                on the outside         of the

turnstiles       to see     if I could help get the people a w a y from the

turnstiles.          I went thro u g h the          large     concertina gate adjac e n t           to

turnstil e G.         The gate was          shut behind me.              Just   outside    the gate       I

saw a group of u n i f o r m e d officers              talking to a g roup of about 6 m e n

in civilian clothes.              One of the group of these me n were showing                            the

offic e r s a M e r s e y s i d e Police Warr a n t Card.                 I am sure that the

officers      were    telling them that they could not                       let them     in.     I only

h eard a small        part of this          c on v e r s a t i o n but    I fo r m e d the opin i o n that

the g r o u p of 6 me n were Po l i c e Officers                 from M e r s e y s i d e wanting entry

into the ground.

At this time         there were a lot of supp o r t e r s a r o u n d this gate,                   they

were    pleading w ith the o f f icers that                 something had got to be done as

people were being            crushed and they feared for                    their   lives.       I told

them that       I could not        let them t hr o u g h the gate.

A few second       later    I saw Insp P ur dy         coming thro u g h the        crowd of

su p p o rt er s from L e p p i n g s Lane.      He was     pointing      towards the gate          I

had just     come thro u g h a n d was        saying s o m e t h i n g   like,    ’O p e n the gates,

ope n the g a t e s ’ .    This was not directly said to me but a p p e a r e d to be

said to the officers             in general      that were      stood outside        the gate.           I

can recall      saying     to the officer,          ’We    carn't open the gates w e ’ll

have trouble       inside’.       The    Inspector        said that      they had got       to be

o p e ne d to save    life outside         the turnstiles.           The gates were opened,                  I

do not kno w what         time    it was    they were op e n e d an d u n l ocked from w i t h i n

after    an officer had s ho u t e d from the outside.                   After a short time

Insp P ur dy gave the order to close                 them.      I cannot     say how m a n y

people    e nt e r e d thro u g h this gate but           it was op e n e d for about 20- to

30 seconds.        It was      not op e n e d fully,       probably b e t w e e n 6 to      10 feet.

It was    impossible       to stop the suppo r t e r s         running through but having

said this w h e n the order was g iven to close the gates                          I could not          see

a ny   problems and they were            im m e d i a t e l y closed.

In my    previous at t e n d a n c e s at the football m at ch es            I have never k n o w n

a gate opened to let s u pporters enter                    in this manner.          Fro m my

experience,       w hen gates have         been broken down by fans               it is

impossible      in the     initial      stages to stop the flow into the ground due

to the numbers trying to enter.                     I have e x p e ri en ce d a gate        being

br o k e n down at Bramall Lane and              it does a l l ow a lot of          people to

enter quickly.

There was only a small             crowd of supp o r t e r s outside         the gate w h e n       it

was    closed but wit h i n a m a t te r of seconds             they were        coming to us,

pleading w i t h us to do something a gain as the s it ua t i o n had not been

solved d i r e c tl y outside       the e n t rance       to the turnstiles.          Some of them

were    showing me their         tickets and saying            let me     thro u g h the gates,          I ’ve

got a ticket.        A ga in     I did not want        to open this gate and              let those

w i t h tickets    enter as       I felt that because of the numbers of the                     crowd

that a surge         by them w ould force        the gates     compl e t e l y open and we

w o ul d not    be able to contain the situation*

At some stage shortly after              this    Insp P u r d y told me     that he w o u l d get

the m ou n t e d section to form a barrier against                 the entry to the gate

and filter       thro u g h those w i t h tickets*        W i t h i n seconds    there were a

number    of m ou nt ed officers outside            this gate an d the order was a gain

given for       it to be open from        inside*      It was op e n e d a n d there was a

s t e a dy st r e a m of supp o r t e r s moving    through-      I perso n a l l y did not

take a n y tickets       from those entering.

All those       entering at this time a p p e a r e d to be orde r l y and d i s t r e s s e d

from being       crushed*     A short     time after      the gates were opened I

n o t i c e d that the    crowd still     a p p e a r e d to be e n t e r i n g thro u g h the

gates    of Leppings Lane*          I shou t e d to Insp P u r d y that the gates                had

to be shut to stop people              coming    into the bottleneck.            I am not sure

if the    Inspector heard me*            I w a lk ed to the gates a n d         it a p p e a r e d

that there were a number            of officers,       including m o u n t e d officers

allowing       supporters     to enter by showing their tickets*                   I noti c e d at

this time there wase           still   a crush against         the entrance        to the

turnstiles,       but there was a        large are a behind the queues              that was

free of supporters.            I then noti c e d that some s u p p o r t e r s were

climbing onto a metal           dividing wall        between our      turnstiles a n d those

t ur n s t i l e s adjacent   to ours.     I shou t e d at them to get down.                  They

a p p e a r e d to be climbing    from the other side of the wall from me*                           The y

d i d n ’t a ppear     to take any notice of me and            then a P o l i c e w o m a n

(identity not known)           said to me       that there     was a n    Inspector on top of

the turn s t i l e ©    letting them gain entry          into the ground over the top

of the turnstiles*            I looked to the top of           the t urnstiles a n d saw

Insp B en n e t t stood there.         Beca u s e   of this    I a l l o w e d them to

continue-        I then saw a supporter walk i n g            towards me w i t h a can of

pop and    I told him not to take            it in and then        I h eard the sound of

a no t h e r gate      being opened-        I do not know what                 time this was*           I

think    that      it was Gate B adjacent              to t u rnstile A.              The     crowd then

e n te re d the ground thro u g h this gate*                     A very short          time    later    I can

recall     hearing over a personal                radio,        that all Pol i c e O f f i c e r s were

to go to the playing area*

I ran thro u g h to behind the West Stand,                        I did not go thro u g h the

turnstiles         but    I cannot for      the     life of me          remember w h i c h gate         I ran

through.          As    I ran to the e n c losure          I remember          running behind          Insp

Purdy-       We    ran a long the back of the West S t a n d u n d e r n e a t h the P o l i c e

Control Box,            in front of the s outh stand and onto the                        pitch.        I could

see a     lot of officers          on the    pitch an d some fans                climbing over the

p erimeter        fence    in front of the West Stand.                    My    immediate       thought

were    that      the fans were      invading the              pitch.

I then recalled            Insp P u r dy saying s o mething              like    'Form a line across

the pitch"         to face the crowd.             Be f o r e    I could do a n y t h i n g a

u n i f o r m e d Serge a n t    (Unknown but he had a full                    beard and       I think he

works    or has wor k e d at H a m m e r t o n Police Stati o n )                told me to a c c o m p a n y

him w i t h other officers           to behind the terraces and                       pull the fans a way

from the standing area.                I could see that there were sufficient

officers       on the      pitch so I ran w i t h this S e r g e a n t and a group of

other officers.             I did not    inform Insp P u r d y what               I was doing.              I saw

that    it was         important to get the          people a way from the               rear.     I ran

along    the same         route that    I had taken to get                to the       pitch.     I was       the

last officer           of this g roup and         I ran along the tunnel                 giving entry to

the terraces.             This   tunnel was       empty.         There was       no    injured persons

at the     rear of the stand w h e n          I ran into the tunnel.

As   I got to the exit of the tunel                    (onto the terrace)               I saw that          the

other o f f icers         ran down into the          crowd so        I stopped at the exit and

began pulling            people back off the terraces an d telling                          them to go

along the tunnel            to the rear of the stand.                    I was doing this for a
                                                                                                 PAGE         13

ma t t e r of minutes.          Some of the youths           I spoke to      in this manner

smelt    of drink.

The    next thing       I can recall was a supporter                backing thro u g h the exit

from the terraces           shouting      ’There's       people dead down t h e r e ’ .         I

c o u l d n ’t believe what       I heard so          I w a l k e d t h r o u g h the crowd stood at

the exit a n d        looked towards       the    perimeter       fence.     I could see a P W on

top of the fence trying to                pull a lifeless body over the fence.                       I

formed the opin i o n that this              person was        dead.     I m o v e d forward to help

but    in doing this         I could see       there was a large number of Police

O f f i c e r s at the material        point     so I d e c i d e d to pull    the     crowd a w a y from

the terraces.           I remained      pulling        people a way from the         centre stand

enclosure.          By this time some of the               crowd had been volatile an d were

s w e aring at me       calling me a murderer.               I con t i n u e d to pull     people away

a n d some of them had a r g um ents w i t h me about                  the d ead a n d dying        people.

In the most          diplomatic    terms     possible       I u r g e d them to go thro u g h the

tunnel.       The m a j o r i t y that a r g u e d wit h me face to face smelt of

intoxicants,          then Police O f f i c e r s b egan to bring          injured      people      through

the terraces an d along            the tunnel          I t ried to k e e p the entrances a n d

exits    free       in order    that they      could get t h r o u g h . W h e n all    the m o v e m e n t

began to stop from Police O f f icers an d s u pporters                      bringing      injured

t h r o u g h the    crowd a p p e a r e d to turn on the Police.             They p ersonally

s t a r t e d a c c u s i n g me of mu r d e r an d    likening    it to the Heysel         Stadium

d isaster.I         still   kept the exit free and then                I was told by Insp Walker

to go to the          rear of the tunnel an d stop the fans a t t e m p t i n g               to get

back    into the terraces.            When     I got there there was a number of

o fficers     stopping the supporters                 from r e-entering the terrace.                Some of

the y o u t h s and me n were o b v i o u s l y drunk and were argu i n g w i t h officers

to be a l l o w e d back because they had been parted from their friends.

I s t o p p e d in this      position for a considerable                period.      I then

i                b egan to leave the stadium and w h e n they did I went back onto the

                  playing a r e a where       I reported to PS Payne-             We were then i nstructed

                  by a Chief      Inspector     (identity not known)            to go onto the terraces and

^                the names       of supporters        still    there-     But   by this   time they had all

                  gone and     I didn't get any names*

                  I did not handle an y of the bodies*

                  I must say that w h e n the          people were being         crushed against     the

                  t u rnstiles    I did fear for the safety of them an d I have formed the

                  o p i n i o n that had the gates not been opened then life w o u l d have been

                  lost out side      the turnstiles.

                  I then r eturned to         the N or th S t a n d and after       being stood down       I

                  returned to El an d         went     off duty at 7 pm-

                  L ater    that night    I   e x a min ed my body and found that my legs were

                  c overed    in bruises      there was a large one on my right knee-                  I had

                  also     got some bruising      to my lower half of my body,               I cannot expl a i n

                  M/here or why      I sus t a i n e d these    injuries*

                b orn and bred in S h e f f i el d but            I have m o v e d about   the   country wit h

                my employment.

                I have       been a keen football           supporter       for m a n y years and used to be a

                season ticket             holder at H i l l s b o r o u g h along w i t h my wife.   I ceased

                going to live football matc h e s                 because of the     increased use of foul

                language a n d violence.

                O n S a tu rd ay    15th of April         1989 it was my       i n tention to meet a friend of

                mine                       , I don't know his addr e s s        for a game of golf at

                C o n c o r d m i n icipal     golf    course   in Sheffield.      Our     intension was to meet

                at the course at              1pm.

                Ha v i n g   knowledge that the FA Cu p semi                final was being      played at

                Hillsborough            I deci d e d to   leave my house e a r l y to a v o i d any traffic

                c o n g e s t i o n or delays.
                                                                                                  PAGE       2
                                                                                                  S1981

I left my house at about              11.45a m a n d drove      in my      car towards        the golf

course,      I was suprised how little traffic                 there was.           S a w one or two

supporters about           but   certainly no crowds at this time.

As    I was early    I decided to go for a quick drink once meeting

there.      I stopped at the SICEY,             at the top of S p i c e y A v e , F i r t h Park.

I parked my car on the             car park.      There were one or two cars parked

but    nothing out of the ordinary.

I went    into the     pub and orde r e d half a pint of                lager.      The    pub is

b as i c a l l y one big    room an d I chose a seat not            far from where 3 me n

were    sitting.     There were        perhaps     15 people     in the        pub at this time.

F r om where   I sat       I could i na dv er t e n t l y overhear       the    c o n v e rsation that

the 3 men were having.              It became a p p arent to me that 2 of the m e n

were L i ve rp ud li an s a n d 1 had a midla n d s accent,              more N o t t i n g h a m that

B irmingham,       I listened to there           c on v e r s a t i o n for about 7 or 8 minu t e s

an d during    this time         I heard them discuss         how they were going to get

into the gro u n d with o u t       tickets.      T h e y a p p e a r e d to know S h e f f i e l d well

as they said that           the place    to cause trouble w o u l d be outside L e p p i n g s

Lane    because of     its confined entrance            they said s o mething along the

lines of " W e *11 meet          the boys    in L e p p i n g s Lane,    if e n o u g h start

pushing then the Police will                open the gates".            T h e y m e n t i o n e d that

they had m an a g e d to do that before.               I also h e a r d them say we'll

create    havoc,     I also heard m e n t i o n then want i n g            to get behind the

goal.     T h ey each had a full         pint    infront of them,           although       I are unable

to say what      they drank before           I got there.

At some stage       I got the       impr e s s i o n that they r e a lised that            I was

listening.       I felt      rather    u nc om fo r t a b l e so drank up and         left,        I then

went an d    played golf.

I f i n i s h e d playing golf at about 4 ,3 0 p m and then I heard on the                           car

radio    the news at        the trag e d y at Hi 1 Isborough.            I m e n t i o n e d to

         my earlier encounter           in the     pub and he said that              really       I should

            go to the Police,

            I thought every t h i n g over and thought that my evidence                        seemed

            insignifi cant      until    I heard about           the trauma that S u p e r i n t e n d e n t

            Marshall       had s u f f e r e d as a result of the gates being opened.

            It is my opin i o n that the           creating of the crush outside the turnstiles

            and the s ubsequent         opening of the gates was o r c h e s t r a t e d by the

            L i v erpool    supporters or       I should say the minority*

            The 3 m e n in the pub were all white.                    The 2 L i v e r p u d l i a n s were     in

            their early 20* s an d the other ma n was a g e d a bout 35.                        I w o u l d not

            recognise       them again.

s hop on L e p p i n g s Lane and we all           sat on a grass bank eating them at

this    time there were a lot of fans,                   both Li v e r p o o l a n d Notts Forest

m i l l i n g a bout on L e p pings Lane and on the grass bank where we were

about 3 0 0 - 4 0 0 fans      sitting a n d drinking from cans they were                     singing

an d shou t e d      it was all very good humou r e d at this time*                       The grass

bank was       by the river don          a n d close to L e p p i n g s Lane.        At   about      1.00pm

I went back          into L e p pings    Lane and stood by the gates                the ground           on

the    corner of Leppings Lane a young                   p o l iceman    came a n d pulled me a w a y

from my m ates         put me again st a wall and s e a r c h e d me,              he took my

wallet,       I by this time were getting quite                   irate about       this a n d they

t h r e a t e n e d to arrest me at one stage but e v e n t u a l l y after about                    13

minutes       he gave me my wallet          back a n d told me to either go in or                        leave

the ground.           So   I went t h r o u g h the turnstile           in the    larger of the

two    lota of turnstiles a n d           into the ground          I had s u r r e n d e r e d my

ticket,       behind me there were about                10-15 me n who o b v i o u s l y hadn't got

tickets a n d        I saw the one       i m m e d i a t e l y behind me pay to get         in.      I

believe       he gave the ma n on the turn s t i l e s a ten pound note and w a l k e d

t h r o u g h as    I had got thro u g h the       turnstiles.          I sat    a n d w a i t e d for

about     10 minu t e s this w o u l d be a bout          1.30pm.       There had been quite                  a

few people wait i n g         to get     in there were o r d e r l y queues a n d           it had

taken about 5 - 1 0 minutes             to get    in.     Once    I had rested I made my                 way

towards       the tunnel      of the     West Stand,        as   I a p p r o a c h e d the tunnel        I

could see          it was quite    con gested      in the tunnel,          and as I entered the

tunnel       it became tigh t l y       cramped    and     I felt    Ihad to move w i t h the

crowd an d was         unable to control where             I want and       I emerged from the

tunnel       into P e n 4 a n d   it seemed quite free to move at that time                          I

could not find my mates             in Pe n 4 so         I made my way back into the

m o u t h of the tunnel a n d then           into P e n 3.        I had to push thro u g h to

achi e v e    this as the terraces          became more          crowded,       I found m y mates

                                                                                                S2374

in P e n 3, a n d we stood tog ether            this was about            1.50pm the     conditions

were    very cramped and          I saw one      chap,     an old bloke 50         ish who had

passed out       behind us a n d he was         carried or pushed o v e r h e a d to the

front and onto the           pitch.       There seemed to be a strong a t m o s p h e r e

everyone       seemed subdued for a few minu t e s a n d the                  pressure of people

coming    in behind continued to build up,                   I looked behind me to the

tunnel and       it was     literall y heaving wit h people.                 On   looking a r o u n d

Icould see that          it was v ir t u a l l y empty      in P e n 2 or that there          it was

a lot more       room in there.           By about 2 . 4 5 p m    I could see a        lot of

people all       aro u n d me    passing out and fainting and                 it seemed that

people were       beginning       to panic there was a lot of                 pushing going on,

and    I was    pushed onto a crush barrier and there was another                           lad next

to me,    he was about                tall                       hai r

w e ar in g a Liverpool         shirt.     I was    crying and s c r e a m i n g     in pain as the

barrier       pushed    into my ribs a n d each time             I b r e athed there      came more

pressure       it was unbearable,          I looked to my         left an d saw the lad I had

d es cr i b e d his head was forced onto the bar a n d                    it a p p e a r e d to me as

his head twis t e d that his neck broke and he a p p e a r e d                    lifeless his body

was    convulsing and his          com p l e x i o n was   turning       bluer.    I heard someone

shout to get him up,            and as     people tried,         they just fell        on top of

him.     At    this    point my head was        forced onto the barrier a n d              I was

paverless       to do anything        to prevent myself going and                 I remember

collasping onto someone.                 My next    recollection          is of being on the

pitch or on the gravel             at the side of the            pitch an d I was trying to

get my breath but felt as though                   1 was    choking       I can recall     being

carried ar o u n d the       pitch and sat on a hoarding                  boards by the N o r t h

S t a n d a n d I was a t t e n d e d by a P o l i c e m a n who a s s i s t e d me to get my

bre a t h back,       w h e n I had recovered enough I w a l k e d back              round to the

L e p pings L ane end a n d       I was    s c reaming out for my mates a n d they ju m p e d

over    the fence to me two of them tried to help get others out-

                                                                                                           S2374

             As    I had been        looking for m y mates         I recall       seeing a            lad about

                   yrs w ith                  hair he was wear i n g a                     top and            he

             a p p e a r e d to be impaled on the spikes                of the    perimeter    fence,    he was

             shaking and vomiting and he a p p e a r e d dead,                   as   I continued to walk       I

             saw a n o t h e r   lad trying to get over            the fence he w o u l d be about 2 0 yrs

             old and        I saw a P o l i c e m a n   push him back      into P e n off the fence..         After

             I found m y mates we c o n tinued to walk                   round the gr o u n d a n d a r o u n d by

             the S o u t h S t a n d    I saw a P o l i c e m a n sitting on the a d v e r t i s i n g   hoarding

             d r i nking from plastic            cup,   I saw a bloke go up to him a n d scream at

             the P o l i c e m a n to help and do s o m ething and he k n o c k e d the              cup out of

             his h and a he a t e d a r g u m e n t     ensu r e d ending up w i t h the Po l i c e      putting

             the man s arm up his back and e s c o r t i n g him off towards the                      players

             tunnel,        as we f o l l o w e d up towards      the    players      tunnel   I could see a

             line of about 300 P o l i c e m a n          in a cordon across the           pitch and there

             were only about 2 0 - 3 0 helping at the Leppings Lane                        end.     It seemed to

             take ages for the a m b u l a n c e s to get thro u g h the Po l i c e               should have

             h elped get them through easier.

             I believe we          left the gro u n d after 5.00pm,              after   being told to     leave

             by the Police.            We w a l k e d back to the car a n d e v e n t u a l l y got home.

                  I a m a student         studying                                                                 at

                  When   I am not at the Hall,                I would       reside at my parents home address

                  at                                                          Wolverh a m p t o n .

                  O n the   15th April         1989 Liverpool           F-C.     were    to play N o t t i n g h a m Forest

                  F.C.   in the semi          final     of the F A Cu p at the H i l l s b o r o u g h ground,          in

                  Sheffield.

                  O n this occasion,           this event was sch e d u l e d to be an all                 ticket game.

                  Unfortunately          I was not       in posse s s i o n of a ticket.

__________________________ S h e f f i e l d is also a Liverpool                      follower.

He too was not the holder of a m a t c h day ticket                            for this semi           final

event.      However,      knowing that         ticket      touts w o u l d probably be in the

v i c i n i t y of the ground,       we deci d e d to go the gr o u n d                w ith the intention

of     p u rchasing a ticket from them.

A l t h o u g h we obv i o u s l y w a n t ed to be w i t h Liverpool             supporters,          we w o u l d

have     p u r chased a ticket wit h the N o t t i n g h a m s upporters                   if the need

arose.

On     the day ofthis event,           S a t ur da y    15th April       1989,         together w ith

__________________ we        left our P o l y t e c h n i c     addr e s s    in S h e f f i e l d   at about

12.30pm.

We   caught a public bus from our                 residence         into S h e f f i e l d C i t y Centre,

a n d then got on a no t h e r       bus     in the city,         to the g r o u n d at Hillsborough.

U n k n o w n to us,    if we had stayed on the first bus,                        it w o u l d have taken

us near to the gr o u n d         in a n y    case.

The bus drove          us to a point         in M id d l e w o o d Road,       next to Hi 1 l s borough ,

Park.

We a l i gh te d from the bus at this                  location,     and I believe the time wa i

a bout    1.15pm.
                                                                                                                 !

Together,        we then w a l k ed along C a t c h b a r Lane           crossroads and              into

L e p pings Lane,      a r ri vi ng d i r e c t l y outside the m a i n L e p p i n g s Lane

entrance      some ten or fifteen m in u t e s             later,      at about         1.30pm.

Whilst walk i n g      from our a l ig ht in g          point    to the g r o u n d w h i c h        is a

distance      of only about 40 0 to 500                 <four to five hundred) m e t r e s , I

w i t n e s s e d numerous    s upporters      drinking         intoxicants           (beer a n d lager)

from glasses,          bottles and cans up to 2 litres                       in volume,       in the street
                                                                                                                 j
a n d outside a pub in the a r e a of L e p p i n g s Lane a n d C a t c h b a r Lane.

A l t h o u g h the supporters,        who to my knowledge were L i verpool

supporters,        were drinking,          there was       no a b u s i v e n e s s   or drunk e n e s s at

this     time.
                                                                                                   PAGE       3
                                                                                                   S2610

I did      in fact see P o l i ce O f f i c e r s a d v i s i n g      the supporters      not to drink

heavily,          otherwise     they w ou l d not get         into the ground*

On a r r i v i n g outside       the m ai n Leppings Lane              entrance,    a l t h o u g h there

were     supp o r t e r s   in the area,        it was a lot less than             I originally

a n t i c i p a t e d for the fixture.

S u p p o r t e r s were forming or de r l y queues for the                purpose of entering the

turnstiles,          at this     point without a n y problem.

I remained w i t h                                 in this     immediate are a for about             ten to

fifteen minutes,             hoping to obtain tickets.

We had a lr e a d y decided that we w o u l d not pay any more than fift e e n to

t wenty        pounds    for a six        pound standing ticket,           and   in view of the fact

that touts were asking an average                       price of a bout thirty pounds,              we

deci d e d to walk a r ou nd the gr o u n d to see what other                      tickets were

ava i l a b l e    for the match.           The suppo r t e r s at the L e p p i n g s Lane

entrance,         M/as   still about        the same numbers           in volume as the ten

m i n u te s    previous.

We w a l ke d along L e p p i n g s Lane         in a n o r thern d i r e c t i o n towards Herr i e s

R o a d /P e n i s t o n e R o ad traffic     island against           the flow of supporters who

were     going towards the ground.

The volume          of suppo r t e r s was not great,            but    it was a continual         flow,

who were walk i n g on both sides                  of the     road.

Although,         a ga in I saw Li v e r p o o l     suppo r t e r s   consuming    intoxicants,

there was          no a b u si ve ne ss   or d r unkeness      to m y knowledge.

On    reaching        this traffic         island,    we turned right        into P e n i s t o n e R o a d

towards         the mai n entrance of the ground,                 which    is the    rear of the

S p i o n Hop.

The    number of supp o r t e r s          in this area was a lot less than in L e p pings

Lane area.

B e t w e e n the traffic        island at Pen i s t o n e R o a d / H e r r i e s Roa d and the

ground there are two or three side streets.                              I did   in fact see
                                                                                                      PAGE            4

barriers across           the e n t r a n c e    to these streets an d Pol i c e Officers were

a lso at these        locations.

T here were no problems from suppo r t e r s along P e n i s t o n e R o a d at this

time.

We   continued to walk along P e n i s t o n e Roa d and wh i l s t we did this,                            we

were a p p r o a c h e d by supporte rs a n d a s k e d            if we had tickets           to sell.          To

m y surprise       I did not see anyone                  selling tickets        in this area,         which       I

w ould have e x p e c t e d       at a big fixture              like this semi     final.

W h e n we    reached the         end of the ground and the m a i n               g r o u n d entrance,          we

t urned right        into the e n t r ance w h i c h a l l o w e d us acc e s s          to rear of the

stand,       I now know to be the S o u t h Stand*                   We w a l k e d along the        rear of

this area,        under a covered a r e a by the club reception,                         a n d went    to a

point w h i c h was bloc k e d off by safety barriers and the tele v i s i o n

camera vehicles.

We w a l k e d back along the             rear of the S o u t h Stand,           an d past the

reception a n d the players entry                      point.

At this time,         which       I believe was about 2.00pm,                 about    three m o u n t e d

Pol i c e Officers,        ente r e d t hro u g h a heavy c rowd o f             supporters who had

g a t h e r e d ar o u n d the    players entrance.               I could see     that    immediately

behind them was the               Li v e r p o o l   team coach.

The L i v er pool     players and staff a l i g h t e d from the                 coach,     and entered

the ground.

I m m e d i a t e l y after the players entered the ground,                      myself and

left this are a and              continu ed walking           back    into P e n i s t o n e Road.     On

reaching P e n i s t o n e Road,          the N o t t i n g h a m team coach a r r i v e d at the

ground,      a n d went    to the rear of the S o u t h stand.

We   c o n tinued to walk ar o u n d w i t h our o b jective still                    to try and obtain

a ticket.

We w a l k e d   into a side         road at the S o u t h side of the ground w h i c h gave

us access        into P a r k s i d e Road,          a n d then   into C a t c h b a r Lane.     At a point
                                                                                                   PAGE    S
                                                                                                   SS610

at   this     location,       we    could see across      the river to the rear of the

S o u t h Stand.

At this time,             I saw a young    boy,    probably about        14 yrs old,        climb over

the river wall a n d gain access                in to the a r e a w here the t e l e v i s i o n

vehicles were             parked.

We stood at this point for about five m i n u t e s w a t c h i n g this boy

a tt em p t i n g    to evade Pol i c e who were       trying to catch him.               The   boy was

e v en tu a l l y caught by Police a n d he was            put   into an a rea behind the

S o u th S t a nd but outside the          perimeter of the ground.

We   c o n tin ued along C a t c h b a r Lane to       its j u n c t i o n w i t h L e p p i n g s Lane.

On reaching           this   location,    we sat down on a perimeter wall                  to a flower

bed and       remained there for about             fifteen minutes.

Whilst waiting at this                point,   I w i t n e s s e d hundreds   of Liv e r p o o l

suppo r t e r s walk i n g     towards the grounds.           A l t h o u g h they were quite well

behaved,       they were       rowdy,    chanting     football     songs,     a n d the

m a j o r i t y were      in p o ssessio n of some sort of intoxicant,                and they were

consuming           it as they w a l k e d a long the street.

We also heard a lot of                people asking for tickets and ticket touts were

being     pointed out to d i fferent            ticket seekers.

The one ticket tout was as king £40                   (forty pounds)          for a standing

ticket.

In v iew of what we had seen and heard wit h                     regards to the ticket

situation,          we d ec i d e d to retrace our footsteps a n d go back a r o u n d into

P e ni s t o n e Road.

We w a l ke d back along the entire               length of P a r k s i d e and turned          left

into P e n i st on e Road.

During this time we did see an                  increased number         of s u pporters        in the

vicinity,           but   there were no incidents         to my knowledge.           We    c o n tinued

to walk along P en is t o n e R o a d and reaching the turn s t i l e s at the end of

the S pi o n K o p w hi c h I believe          to be turnstiles 7 7 - 8 8        (as per the map)
                                                                                                         PAGE

we turned a ro u n d a n d s ta r t e d to walk back a l o n g the                     rear of the S p i o n

Kop.

On    reaching the mai n entra nce gate                    next to the         river,     with                , .1

remai n e d there for about                 five minutes whilst we tried to obtain

tickets.

One    p a rticular      person,          a West    Indian y o u t h was a p p a r e n t l y selling

standing      tickets       for £10         (ten pounds).           This y o u t h a c t u a l l y    passed us,

wh i l s t we stood by the                river and he was f o l l o w e d by a s e c o n d y o u t h who

stated that          the West        Indian y ou t h had tickets             to sell.

To g e t h e r w    i   t   h    [    I    tr ied to see this c o l o u r e d y o u t h but he

di s ap pe ar ed     in the     crowd w h i ch by this            time had s t a r t e d to          increase

very quickly,           w h i ch made       it d i fficult to walk           freely.

After     losing this y o u th             in the crowd,        we d e c i d e d to go finally back to

the L e p p in gs Lane         end of the ground.               This was about 2 . 3 0 p m to 2.33pm»

We w al k e d back       into P a r ks id e        into C a t chbar Lane,         a n d turned right           irfto

L e p p in gs Lane.

Once we a rr i v e d at the m o u th of the main gate at the L e p p i n g s Lane

entrance,          the volume of people              in this a r e a was e x t r e m e l y dense,             to

such a degree           that    it was v ir tu a l l y       impossible to move of your                  own

accord.

To g e t h e r w    i   t   h    I         stood on the        corner of the bridge,                 marked    (X)

on the m a p        (Exhibit Mo                    R e f e r e n c e No             ) for about         ten

m i n u te s just o b serving the              crowd.

During     this      period of time,            people w e r e      entering      the gr o u n d t h r o u g h

the t u r n s t i l e s but only at a very slow pace.                        It was also about this

time    I w i t n e s s e d supporters          climbing onto the top of the turnstiles

a n d d i s a p p e a r in g over the top,           p r esumably gaining access to the ground

Although      I cannot give a d e t a i l e d d e s c r i p t i o n of            individuals,          I would

say that a p pr ox im at el y fifty                people aged b e t w e e n 15 to 3 0 y ears old,

g ained access          by this means.

                                                                                                  S 2A 10

Whilst    obs e r v i n g the situation,           both mys e l f a n d                stood next      to a

video    cameraman,       who   I believe was a P o l i c e m a n         recording the situation.

I believe       this   is so,    because         the pictures        I have since seen on T.V,

show this particular a rea in question,                      and the      presenter on t e l e v i s i o n

a l l e g e d l y say the incident was            recorded by a P o l i c e      cameraman.

W h i l s t s t a nding next to the cameraman,               I did in fact see people

entering    the ground via a gate at the side of the turnstiles,                                  which I

believe to be gate            *C*.

I saw the gate open,            but    I could not say who             opened    it.     It was only

opened for about a min u t e at the most,                    an d    I w o u l d say that only about

t wenty or so people ente r e d at this time,                       before    the gate was        closed

again.     I did see two Po l i c e Offic e r s             on foot,      in the opening          to this

gate before       it was      closed.       I believe       these two O f f i c e r s    remained

inside    the gr o u n d side of the gate.

My    initial    thought to the gate being opened was that the supporters

who had climbed over            the turnstiles,          had possibly op e n e d the gate              from

the    inside.

At this    point,      we decided to go            into the     crowd and if the gate              (Gate

C) was    to be opened again,              we m a y possibly gain access               by this means.

We tried to get down the               right hand side of the                crowd,    but we were

pushed towards         the centre of the crowd a n d the m i d d l e of the railing

gates,    w hi c h at this time were              closed.

After about a minute or so,                 the railing gates were              pushed open by the

force of the crowds,            w hi c h   caused us to go beyond the                 railing gates

an d the turnstiles.

Immediately       prior      to this,      I saw Gate       * C ' a gain op e n e d and I w ould

estimate about         10Q    (one hundred)         supporters        ga i n e d access at this

point.

I believe that         it was Gate         *C*    being opened on this sec o n d occasion,

that    caused the crowd to surge forward an d cause my s e l f a                         n   d    t   o
                                                                                                PAGE     8

be forced forw a rd a n d made us be in front of the                      railing gates.

W h e n we had gained access              past the      railing gates,      the volume    of people

a p p e a r e d to become s li ghtly         less,     because we were a bl e to move

that     little more        easily.       As soon as we got past the            railing gate,

Gate     *C* was      closed.

At this point,           I could see supp or te rs         punching out at the m o un t ed

Pol i c e Offi c e r and his horse,             who at this time was         immedi at el y b eh in d

me»

The suppo r t e r s      started to strike            out at the Offi ce r w h e n they were

told to move          back and stop pushing forwards.                 The y r etaliated by

punching        the horses body and head and also                 punching the Officer.

Although        I didn't     see the Offi c e r d ra w his staff,           I did in fact        see

the Offi c e r       hit the s u ppor ters w i t h it,         in r e ta l ia t io n to their

act i o n s .

The a tm o s p h e r e at this time was o b vi ou sl y getting very tense w ith

supporters          swearing at the m o u n t e d Officer a nd he too was shouting

back *

The    physical       c o n f r o n t a ti on took   place for about 30 seconds         but the

verbal       c on f r o n t a t i o n took place for some minutes.

After       this,    myself and                 m a na g ed to move    towards the    right side

of the       crowd next to the river fencing.

At this time,          I did     in fact see three         people     leaning agai ns t this

fence a n d they a p p e a r e d to be in a d is tr e ss e d condition.

One of the          people was a lady who a pp ea r ed to be hysterical,                 crying and

I h ea r d her say s omething to the effect                    'someone's    going to die        in

he re * '

The other member of the group of three,                        was a boy a ged about ten y ears

old an d he had s uf fered g ra z ed arms and hands.

W h e n we got       near to these        three      people,   we also stood w it h our backs

to the fencing           for a few seconds,            discu ss in g whether    to enter the

The gate,      'Gate   'C**,    was a gain opened,      and had been op en ed for about

two minutes whe n we deci de d to enter              through this      point.

The b e haviour of the         people who ente re d the         ground            was orde rl y and

they w a l k e d   rather    than ran as    they entered thro ug h this op en ed gate.

The    reason we ente re d was because            no-one was    checking tickets,

a l t h ou g h stewards an d Po li ce Officers were o bv se r vi n g the                 people

We ente re d thro ug h the gate and i mmediately               w a lk e d         towards the tunnel

w h i ch was d ir ec tl y    in front    of us.

The time at this        point,    was    betw ee n 2 . 5 0 pm and 2.55pm.

We wa lk ed    into the tunnel an d        into the rear of P en            3 w h i ch    was to the

right,    as you w al k ed along        the tunnel.

A l t h o u g h the tunnel was    full    of people,    they m o v e d c on ti n uo u sl y a n d

the    passage     thro ug h it was unobstructed.

I was    still     in immediate    contact wit h               when    I e n te r ed P en 3 a nd

w© were     immedi at el y    pushed towards       the front of the Pen.

We    never a c t u al l y stopped from the time we e n te re d             the P e n until we

reached the bottom           left hand third of the terracing.

Whe n we ente re d the Pen,        we were     contin ua ll y m ov in g backwards and

fo rwards and       I found    it very humid.

People a ro u nd me were        behaving    in a way that      they panicked,              became

distr au gh t and some were        pleading       for help.

The s i tu at io n was very chaotic,          tense,   and g e ne ra ll y the spect ators

were    panic s tr ic ke n due to the       crush.

I felt     in my own mind,       that    the s i tu at io n was getting desperate,                w ith

people shout in g out the Police,            who were     looking     into the           crowd from

the other      side of the      perimeter     fence,   w hi ch s u r ro u nd e d the       playing

area and the terraces.

Pe o p l e were   shouting out to the effect            that they were       being     crushed,

s uf fo c at e d and that they were         in pain.

There was at this           time s up porters     shouting at     people    behind them to

move    back,     because    of the    crushing     situation.

At this    point,     I was    pushed further        down the t erracing a n d then I was

fo rc e d over to the        right.     I remained at this        point for about         two

minutes a n d this was         the first     time    I became static-        (I w o u ld call

this my first viewing           point w it h regards to Q u e s t i o n 36 on my

questionnaire)-

Whilst    I was at this        point,    I became     quite    breathless,      and star te d to

get    pains    in my chest.       I felt    I was being       crushed a nd I was trapped-

I could not move my arms.

I tried to shout out but              couldn't    because      of the lack of air      in my

lungs«

Pe o p l e were    contin ua ll y s ho uting at the Police         to open the gates at

the front       of the pens,     so that     people    could get out of the          crush-

It was at this time,           that    I became aware of a young boy aged about

twelve years,        who was wear in g what         I believe to be silver         rimmed

glasses and he had short              light brown hair.

He was s t a nding d ir ectly         in front    of me wit h a person I believe              to be

his father,       due to their similar           features and he too wear in g glasses.

The    crowd a r o u nd us was    still     very t i gh tl y packed together an d due to

the    continual m ov ement      of the     crowd,    Icould      see that the     boy was

getting    lower an d lower to the ground,                as th ou gh his   feet were       t r ap pe d

and he could not move           other than fall        forwards and sidewards.

The boy star t e d to wimper out            cries    of help an d his facial         e x pr e s s i o n

was that of sheer fright.

At the same time,           the boy's father was s creaming out to help his boy

and the people a r o u nd us-           He was directing        these   pleas    for help at

the    people and     indeed the Po li ce who were            standing behind the

perimeter       fencing    in front of him-

At this       point,    I was feeling          p hysically tired and helpless*

I was    obv i ou sl y c oncerned for my own safety,                    because the people           behind

were    c o n t i n uo us ly pushing down on us,             and the s i tu at io n was getting

very d e sperate        indeed-

The y ou ng boy was        p hysical ly forced down,               causing his       right side of

his body to come          into    contact w it h the terrace               floor-

At this       point,    due to the boy          falling      to the floor this         created       a

little gap i mmediately            in this area,           but a l t h o u g h   1 could not m ove m y

feet,    I was able to move my body*                    The b o y ’s father who was to our

immediately       left was       still    trap pe d and whe n he saw his boy fall                    to the

floor,    he became frantic,             sc re am in g out to help his boy.

The b o y ’s father       s cr eamed out        pleas    similar      to ’For G o d' s . s a k e   help

h i m ’ and    'Open the gates*'

W h e n the gap opened us,          w h ic h    a ll ow ed   me to move my upper         body,       I

de sp e ra t el y tried to grab the             boy who      at this     time, was     looking

d ir ec t l y at me*      Although       I touc he d him,        on his arm,        I was unable to

grab him s u f f i c ie n tl y to try and           pick him up-

Al mo st at the same time           I m ov ed my upper           body forward,        I felt       people

behind me       pushing m y back,         w h i ch caused me to fall              forward-     However,

w h e n this h ap pe ne d I felt that            if I was to fall            to the floor      I w ou ld

be unable       to get back up,          I felt     that     I was going to die,          so I

f r an t ic al l y fought for my own life,               and m a n a g e d to get upright again*

Once    I m a n a g e d to get upright          it was at this          point     I saw a safety

barrier       i mmediately behind me and about six or s even adult                           persons

lying over the barrier-

They a pp o e a re d to be d ou bl ed over the barrier,                    w h ic h I can recall         was

buckled forward.

I also    recall       that these    people were trap pe d b et we en the barrier and

the    crowd behind them,          w hi ch a m o u n t e d to a continuous           pressure on
                                                                                                   PAGE  12

their backs.

One of the trap pe d           persons a c t ua l ly spoke to me and told me to                    'Push

everyone back.'

I could see that these                people were        unable to mov e for them se lv es and

as a result         of this,       I a t t e m p t e d to push the people back by facing

them and         pushing them w i t h my hands and upper                   body.

This did not have a ny effect a n d I turned a r o u nd an d tried to push

back the         people w it h my back to them and push by using my                        legs as a

wedge    to the floor a nd leant               backwards.

I was     in effect        pushing ag ai ns t the             people and the barrier.

Although         I realise     now    it was a sit ua ti on           I could not help,         I felt    it

was the only thing             I could have done at the time.

All    the time      I was doing        this,     people       in general     were   in a d esperate

s i t u a t i o n crying out       in fright and          panic,      for assistance.

I believe         it was at     this time        I caused an          injury to my back w hi ch

a m o u n t e d to slight      cuts and abr as io ns            to my    lower spine area of my

back.      I believe        this    o cc ur r ed w he n I was         pushing against     the barrier.

Although         I believe     it felt      like m i nu te s      pushing the      people back      it was

probably only about             fift ee n to twenty seconds,                at w h i c h time    I felt

h elpess        because    I was o b vi ou sl y not going or getting anywhere w i t h my

act i o n s .

I stopped pushing and                I could see that there was still a slight gap                         in

front    of me,      and the boy who was              forced to the floor was still                there*

He was trying d e s p e r a t e l y to grab the trouser                    legs of people        by him,

but he a p p e a r e d to be d e s p e r a t el y tired.

When    I saw the boy still             lying there,            I then leant forward and tried

to grab him again,            but u n f o r t u n a t e l y   I was     pushed forM/ard from be hi nd

which     caused me to go            in front of him.

I can remember            forcing m ys el f      to the right of the boy             in order      to

a void tra m p l i n g on him.          The force of the              push from behind      caused my

upper      body to go before my        legs,   w h ic h resulted       in me going f o rw ar d at

an angle*        I e ve nt u al l y s tr u gg l ed to get my body upright again,              w h i ch

left me about 3 metres             from the front       of the perimeter         fencing,

d ir ec t ly   in front of the e ntry /e xi t gate          in P en 3*

The gate at          the front    of Pe n 3 was   I believe,        in the process        af being

op en ed by an official,           not a supporter and w he n          I saw this       being done

I felt a sudden psychologic al              boost w it h in me, a n d I could see that

people were          at last getting out of the tragic and d esperate                    situation*

U n f o r t u n a t e l y the supporters were only getting out             very slowly.

Po li ce were a ssisting          suppo rt er s out of the       pen and onto the track

are a of the ground.

At this time,          a l t h ou g h I could not see                           I felt that he

was      big an d strong enough to look after himself,                  a n d I was o b v i o u sl y

co ncerned      in getting myself       out of the situation*

I c on ce n tr a te d on the gate a nd due to the fact               I was d ir ec t ly in

front of       it,    I do not feel    I had problems         in getting      to the gate,

other      than being     lack of breath.

I w ould say         it took me about one minute           from the time        I saw the gate

open to the time          I m a n a g e d to get out    thro ug h it.

I did see       people     in the front of the         pen trap pe d against the perimeter

fencing who were o v bi ou sl y not able              to move,    a l t h o u g h I could not

describe any of them*

W he n    I got to the gate,        I was su pp or te d by a Police Offi ce r and             I was

a c t u a l l y e sc or te d to P en 2 w hi ch was     to m y r ig ht .A 1 th o ug h   I cannot

give a precise time at this              point,   I    can say that

the football          teams were    still   on the     playing area, a nd the Po li ce            were

trying to prevent supp or te rs entering that area*

Whilst      I was     being e sc or te d from P en 3 to P e n 2,        I g en u in e ly felt     that

by putting the supp or te rs          in this area,        the same s i t u a ti o n was     likely

to arise,      and     I didn't    like this   p o ss i bi li ty hap pe ni ng again.

However,        I went    into P en 2,     but only for about              two minutes.        The gate

wa s    left u na tt e nd e d for a short        period of time,            during w h i c h    I saw my

friend                         ]on the playing area             in the penalty box,            looking

in a d is tr e ss e d condition,         and    looking     into the terracing area of the

L ep pings Lane end.

The     players at this time were              in the     process of        leaving the        playing

area.

Due to the fact           I could see                   in this state,        I left P e n 2 and

gained access        to the are a w here                    was    standing.

I ran to him and a p p ro a ch e d him from his                 left hand side.

W h e n we met,     I st at ed that      I was okay,        and he flung his arms a r ou n d

me*     He was     in a very d is tr e ss e d condition,            crying and stating            "He had

seen the y oung boy w it h the glasses                  on on the floor a nd that              he could

not do a ny thing to assist           him*     and he kept         repeating that        it was

'Horrible,        that    people were      dying.*

We     remained    in the are a for a short while and                  it was evident           people

had been injured but             I still    didn't      think     it was a serious as we now

know*

We     looked    into the L ep pi n gs Lane area           in general and we          could see

people     being    lifted    into the seated area,               a bove    the terracing.

The area around the goal w as slowly                     increasing w i t h people and            I w ou ld

We both m o v ed to point          in front of the S o u th S t a nd about ten to

We sat at this           location for about fift ee n m i nu te s during w h i c h time                   I

We   later w a lk e d ar ou nd the           playing area,       and saw people who were

sit u a t i o n at this time as             co nf us io n and disbelief.

Together w          i     t   h    [    I t hen went to a point         in front of the S ou th

S t an d by the          players       staff dug out.      We both a s s i s t e d    in removing a n

advertisement             board,       and carried     it to the far side of the           pitch and

left    it by an          injured person.            We did not assist        in conveying the

injured,       because they all a p p e ar e d to be taken care of.

We then returned to our                   position by the dug out an d           remai ne d there

until     about 4. 3 0p m at w hi ch time we              then a ss is t ed    in clearing the

g round of        litter.

B y this time the m a j o r i t y of people               had left and gone home.

We e v e n t u a l l y    left the ground at about 5.00pm.

F i n a l l y may    I make       the f ollowing details known that              I feel are

important         to this     inquiry.

When     I was      in P e n 3 and        I tried to assist       the young      boy who was on the

floor,      may     I say that          I believe     X was e ve nt u al l y pushed past        the boy

at about the same time that Peter B ea r ds l ey hit the                         crossbar,       causing

a loud noise             to be made and a sudden surge forw ar d by the supporters.

I can only assume this was the time,                        due to the fact          I could not see

a n y of the        play at this          time.

I feel a c on tr ibutory factor                   in the number of deaths and injuries was
                                                                                                  PAGE    16
                                                                                                  S2610

             caused by the sheer volume             of people    in the West S t a n d a re a and the

             fact     that    people with ou t    t ickets were a ll o we d   in the ground,   w h ic h

             o bv io us l y   includes myself.

             H ow ev e r    there was no a pp ar ent     checking of ticket® made.       If it had of

             been done,        then perhaps      not so m an y people w ou ld have gone       into the

             ground.

             I also felt         that   the start of the game      could have been     dela ye d to

             assist        the entry    of spectators      in the ground.

             I also feel         that   the loudsp eaker   should have    been used    more

             effectively,         because to my knowledge,       people did not kno w what        was

             going on.

             Finally        I felt the a mb ul an ce s   should have gone d ir ec tl y to the     injured

             rather than a r o u n d the playing area.

                    on                         Sheffield.

                    O n occ a s i o n s w he n they are busy at the P ub                I will    go down and help

                    them out and on S a t u r d a y         15th April        1989    (150489)    this y e a r |

                   was by herself              in the Pub,      so   I wen t down to help her out.

                   We opened the             pub at about       11.30am   (1130),       and business was quiet.

                   At     12 m i d d a y about 3 or 4 Liv er po ol            s upporters    came    into the       pub,    they

                    o r d e r e d their drinks a nd s tood by the bar,                  talking to me they informed

                    me that they were Liverpool                  s up po rt er s and they all        had Liverpool

                   accents,       they were           dressed   casua ll y not       in the Liv er po ol     colours

                    although      I think one was w e ar i ng a Liverpool                  scarf.

                   Whilst     they were          in the pub they were well              behaved     in good humour a n d

                    could be d e sc ri be d as m er ry a l t h o u g h they were             not drunk.

                    T he y were      polite and talked to me on a number of occasions,                             in betw ee n
                                                                                                 PAGE
                                                                                                 S2537

serving     customers        from the    con ve rs at io n I had wit h them I a s c e r t a i n e d

that they t r av el le d on the train from L iverpool                    to Sheffield,          with

other Liv er po ol      supporters a nd a l t h o u g h some of them had tickets                    for

the semi       final m at ch     it was their       intention to go to the H i l l s b o r o u g h

ground an d gai n entry             into the stadium.

T he y even a sked me to go to the ground wit h them and I sai d that they

w o u l d not get    in without a ticket,             but a l t h o u g h I cannot exac tl y

remember       how they said that they were going to get                       in,    they said      it

w o u l d be easy as        they had done       it before,      a nd there were other

Liv er po ol    fans who had come d own w i t h them,               w i th o ut tickets who were

going to get        in the ground as well.

Also    in the     pub at the same time there were a small                      group of

N o tt i n g h a m Forest    fan,   but they did not have any             con ve rs at io n w it h

myself     or the Liverpool           fans and these         people   left the pub at about

1 -30pm    (1330).

At about       1.45pm    (1345)      I was a sked by the L iv erpool            s up po rt er s to call

them a taxi        to take them to the H i l l s b o r o u g h football              stadium,    the

first     two o ccasions       I tried to phone for a taxi               the    line was      engaged,

I e v e nt u al l y got thro ug h at about          1.55pm     (1355) a nd booked a taxi                 for

them wit h a company called C i t y Cars                   I think,   this taxi        e ve nt ua ll y

a r r i v e d at about 2 .3 0       (1430)   to 2 . 4 5    (1445)   and took the Liv er po ol

suppo rt er s to the ground.

Du ri ng their      stay at the        pub I am unable         to say e x ac tl y how m uc h they

consumed       in the w a y of a lc o ho l ic drinks,          but they were drinking

s te ad il y all    the time they were           there.

The g roup of Liverpool             sup po rt er s were a ge d      in their m id twenties,

well    presented       in casual      dress,    I had no doubt to believe that what

they told me about            not having      tickets was       not true.

I left the       pub at about 4. 3 0         (1630)       that day and mak e my w ay home.

                  general     the fans we e n co u n t e r e d were good natured a nd enthusiastic.

                  A quant i t y of        cans were    removed from several F or d Tran si t             vans*
                                                                                               PAGE          2

P O L PC R o g a n caused one van to stop and I spoke to the driver a n d his

three    passengers*            Onl y one of w ho m had a ticket*                   I brought this to

the a t t e n t i o n of the sergeant who spoke to the                     lads a nd was a s s u r e d by

them that they were             collecting their tickets from a friend at

Hills b o r o u g h*      I then      informed them that            if they did not       in fact     have

tickets they w ou ld d ef in i te l y not be seeing any football                         and one of

the    lads   replied,       'We're Liv er po ol           fans,   we   can get    in anywhere!*



I saw another          van pull up in the              layby and a lad got out and sold a

ticket     to a lad in a car w h i c h had pulled up behind                        it.



We noticed that from about                   1-1 *3 0p m    (1300-1330)      the traffic was     so

co ngested a lo ng the road that                 the   cars were at a standstill*              H ow e ve r

by about 2p m          (1400)   the    road was v i rt ua ll y empty*             At about 2 *3 0 pm

(1430)     we stop pe d two        coaches w h i ch were           trave ll in g together a nd fans

were    complaining that the drivers we re going to make                            them late for

the game*



At approx.       2 .4 5 pm   (1445)     we    left T a nk e r s l e y   Inte rs ec ti on en route to

Clay wh ee ls Ln for our meal*



As we    passed by H i l l s b o r o u g h     I saw that there were a lot of Liverpool

fans    still m i ll in g about at about 3 p m                (1500) a n d    I commented that        if

the fans didn't           hurry they w o u ld miss the start of the game*



At about 3 * 0 5 pm (1505) a call                came to us that we were             required at

Le pp i ng s Ln.        We a s su m ed fighting            had broke out*



On arrival at H i l l s b o r o u g h our         Inspector and Serge an t           told us to make
                                                                                               PAGE          3
                                                                                               S2585

sure that we stayed together as a serial*                         Once we got to the gate at

the L e p p i n g s Ln I saw several           hund re d L iverpool       fans s ta nding opposite

the gates w h i c h lead into the ground*



At first we were told to form a cordon and                       I thought       this must      be

b ecause the fans were going to storm the turnstiles*                               At this    time

rumours        began to circulate          that the game had been stop pe d and some

Liverpool          fans had spilled onto the            pitch*



A Liverpool          fan came up to me and asked why he was                   not being a l lo we d

in and showed me his ticket an d I e x pl ai ne d the sit ua ti on to him*                              As

we were        speaking an amb u l a n c e a r r i v ed and the         lad a sked why the

am b u l a n c e   had ar rived*        I said that      some one must? have been injured

in the       crush and he         replied,    "Oh good if they get some out t h e r e * 11 be

more     room for us'*



Just as the a m bulance was m a k i n g             its way   into the ground a call             came

over a tannoy system reques t i n n g              that the fans make no atte m pt             to gain

e ntry to the ground but as sist Police                   in bringing out the           injured*

Our    serial       was    then told to enter        the ground*          Once we passed thro ug h

the outer          gates    I lost    contact w i t h our S e r g e a n t and    Inspector and

didn't       see them a g a i n until a fter         the Liv e rp oo l    fans had left       the

stadium*



The first          person     I saw as we     passed thro u g h the gates was a m a n            in his

mid 20's who was sat w ith his head between his knees                            crying*       I then

saw a m a n        in his mi d 3 0 ' s laid on the ground w i t h a teenager k ne eling

at his       side*         The m a n was having dif f i c u l t i e s    b reathing an d a p p e a r e d

to have an injury to his ribs*
                                                                                           PAGE        4
                                                                                           S2385

I knelt beside           him and he lp ed him       into a more    comfortable       p os ition to

aid his breathing.



I then w a l k e d over         to an a mbulance w hi ch was      parked next to Gate         ’C ’ .

I could see two me n             lying on the floor who were o b vi ou sl y dead*

A m b u l a n c e m e n were   giving another m an oxygen.



I then he l p e d anot h er PC to move          these      corpse to one side        in order to

make a ©pace for a mb ul an ce s to get up and down the alley.



At this      stage     fans    began coming    through Gate       ’C ’ in greater      numbers

a nd more      bodies and        casualties were      brought from the         pitch area.

M an y of the fans who            came out were very hostile          towards     the Police,

passing      comments such as          ’I t ’s all your     bastards f a u l t ’ and ’Don't

just    fucking      stand there you b a s t a r d s ’ .



I saw one       fan say to several P o l i c e m e n who had fo rm ed a cordon ar ou nd

the bodies        of the dead,       ’You bastards are going to pay for this,                 some

of you will         die for w h a t ’s h ap pe ne d here today*.             Man y of the fans

were    quite drunk and some who w e r e             g e nu in el y trying    to help the P o l i ce

were    really      little more than a h inderance             due to the amount of alcohol

t h e y ’d consumed.



As the      injured were         brought out we      placed them to one side,          along a

walI a n d I went along this wall              giving adv ic e to the friends            of some

of those       injured and        placing   people    in the    recovery position and

a d m i ni s te r in g minor     first a i d etc.



Man y of the s ergeants seem ed to be in a state of shock,                        as we all were

an d I saw a Chief             Inspector take hold of one sergeant who was s ta nding
                                                                                           PAGE      5
                                                                                           S2S85

next    to me an d say to him          'Come on,      it's up to you sergeants           to take

control     of this!*         The s e r geant      simply looked awa y as if h e ’d not

h eard the Chief          Inspector.



A Doctor        then came over to me and e x pl ai ne d           he w o u l d like to help*

(I found out        later this was Mr Ashton).                I    d ir ec te d him to a m a n who

wa s    lying    face   down on the ground s ur ro u nd e d by his friends*                Whe n

the Doctor        knelt    down next    to the m an one of his friends            said    'What do

y ou want y o u bastard fuck off'.



I told him the m a n was a Doctor and had come to offer a ss is t an c e an d

he     replied,    'Well    he should get my mate to fucking              hospital',      I told

him to calm down an d do wha te v er               the Doctor     told him to.



I then joined another m a n who was                 lying on the    floor     and was    having

difficulties        breathing.         Howe ve r    he was   conscious a n d was talking.

I told his        friend to make       him more      comfortable.        I then w al k ed over

to where        fans were    leaving    by Gate      '8'.    M an y of the fans were openly

crying and man y were shouting ob sc en it ie s at myself and the other

p o licemen w it h me.



I then w a l k ed over to the opposite               side of the a lley where a m an was

lying on his        side.      This was     in fact the m a n      I had first seen as           I

entered the ground.             I was shoc ke d that         he was still     lying     in the

position because           it must   have been 3 0 minu te s or so since           I had first

sp ok e n to him and his companion.                  The young    lad w i t h him told me th®

Doctor     had seen his uncle a n d had said he must                go   in the next

ava i l a b l e ambulance.



At this time        I saw an a m bu la nc e     coming thro ug h the m a i n gate and
                                                                                                PAGE     6
                                                                                                S2585

heading      towards      us.         I went    over and spoke wit h the a mb u la n ce         driver

and was      then joined by a sergeant who was busy o rg an i si n g the

t r a n s p o r t a t i o n of the    injured.        I informed him of the s it u at i on a nd

then    returned to the              injured m a m



At    this stage a young man                came over     to me a nd told me he was a m edi ca l

student.          I told him to go along the wall at the                      far side of the

a l l e y w a y a n d examine        the   injured.



A few more m i n u te s         passed before         I was able to get the         injured ma n who

was    lying on the floor              into an ambulance.



W hile all      this was h ap peni ng           I kept     coming   in contact w it h some of the

o fficers who were           in my serial.              P a r t i c u l a r l y Pol PC 297 Barn es and

Pol PC      1629 R o g a m           However    I had    lost t ouch w i t h the    rest of my

serial.         At   this stage a sergeant               came a long a n d told us to go to the

m a i n gate and        I remained there as the West S ta nd was empt ie d of

L i v erpool    fans.



The a tm o s p h er e   at this time was very tense and the m a j o ri t y of the

fans were       very hostile a nd            I pers on al ly almost       ’expected*    to be

assaulted.



One y oung man came up and asked me                      if I knew where a particular            pub

was a n d    I said      1 did not.            He   replied    ’You bastards y ou d o n ’t know

fuck all*.



A n o t h e r Liverpool      fans a p p r o a c h e d myself and a PC who was standing

next    to me a n d said,            *Do y ou think the game will           be played today*.
                                                                                                                     PAGE
                                                                                                                     S2585

              I replied,          ’I very m uc h doubt           it**



              He    replied,       ’Why not,       they did at Heysel*.



              D uring      the time that          I was on duty at these gates                   I my se lf an d

              officers w it h me were s u bj ec te d to a constant flow of verbal                                 abuse.

             We     ignored the          comments      that were made because,                 first,    it seemed

              improper       to    react      in any other way as m any of the fans were g e n u in e ly

              d i s t r e s s e d an d upset      by what      they had experienced*                 But more

              im p o r t a n t l y for the second           reason that        it would,        in my opinion,         have

              been    ’very dangerous*             to have       reacted      in any other w ay other than to

              ignore the          comments and a c cu sa ti on s           levelled at us.



             At approx*           5 * 15pm    (1715)      we were joined by our S er ge an t a nd               Inspector

              and our serial was               reformed.           We then returned to our F ord Tran si t

              van a n d c o m menced mobile               patrol     on P e n i s t on e Rd*      We then returned to

              C l a y w h e e l s Ln.        F oo d was    provided and we were then t ra n sp o rt e d back

              to Thorne.



             At no time during this                  incident did          I myself      have access to a radio.

              I accept       that even         if I had had ac ce ss           to a radio        it w o u ld not have

              ser ve d any        real    purpose      in the      confusion that en su ed following                 the

              events w h i ch took            place.

We tra v e l l e d to West Bar P o li ce S t a t i o n by transit       van and    paraded

there for briefing at 9am*             (0900)    Chief    Inspector K ing     c on ducted the

briefing,      S u p e r i n t en d en t B at es was officer   in charge.     After   briefing,

personal      radios were      issued,    one   radio    betw ee n two officers,      but      it

was found that there w a s n ’t enough             radios to go round* So myself and

My serial       remained at the s t a t i o n all           the time,      not trave ll in g w i t h

an y of the football           fans    on the P S V ’s.

All    the fans who a r r i v ed at the stat io n were well                   beha ve d and

c oo p e r a t e d wit h our   requests.       All a p p e a r e d to be decent,         genuine

football      fans    from both teams*           There were excep ti on s whe n one or two

of the younger element fro m both Notts Forest a n d L iverpool                               tried to

get t h r o u g h the    cordon and        into the       city and using all          sorts of

reasons.      The snooker          tournament     being one of them.

E a c h of these were s e a r c h e d and w he n football               tickets were found on

them they were          sent   to their       respect P S V ’s without          putting up m uch

arguement*       This was the way           in w h i c h my serial        dealt w i t h the fans

filtering       the non-fans         thr o u g h the stat io n gates,         but the vast

m a j o r i t y did what they were          r e quested to do* There were no u npleasant

situations at         the station,        every t h i n g was good h um ou r ed having a

laugh and a joke wit h some of the fans from both sides.



At about 2 . 2 5 p m we were          i n f ormed by the B r i t i s h T ra nsport P ol ic e that

all    the e x p e c t e d football      fans who were         t r av el li ng by train had

g roups    of fans till        being     in the     rail system.



In view of this my serial a long w i t h other officers                          from other       serials

The    route        taken by the driver of the PS V in w h i ch we were trav e ll in g

took us along M i d dl e wo o d Rd Past H i l l s b o r o u g h Park and right              into

L ep p i n g s Lane*      I noticed that         there were    large     crowds of people

walk i n g along L ep pi ng s Lane             towards    the football     ground.     These    people

were walking           on the     pavements a n d       into the    road on both sides         of the

L e p p i n g s Lane.     As we neared the         corner of the       road where       the entrance

road is to the turnstiles at L ep pings Lane,                        the a r e a was   c ompletely

s w a m p e d w i t h football      fans.      I could only see       Inspector Sykes who was

standing       on the corner to the e nt rance a n d he was                 totally s ur ro u nd e d

w i t h Liverpool         fans.    It was      like a sea of faces        in that area

s tre t c h i n g    from half way a lo ng        the    pavement    from the j un ct i on w it h

Vere R oa d and well            past Gate C at the L ep pi ng s Lane           turnstile.       This

ar ea of the turnstiles was M/all to wall                     people who seemed to be packed

into     that area.         I could see several           fans climbing over the          top of the

gate*     I did not         see an y Po li ce O ff icers       in this area,      unless    they were

lost     in the sea of people.              I could see two m o u n t e d o ff icers who were

compl et el y s ur ro u nd e d a lso a n d were quite o b vi ou sl y struggling                 to

control       this     crowd of fans.          It w o u ld be fair to say that this a r e a at

this    time was         totally con ge st ed w it h fans trying           to get      into the

gr ou n d at these         turnstiles and still more               large numbers of fans were

converging           on L ep pings L ane fro m the d ir e ct i on of P en i st o ne R o a d a n d

several     o ccasions during my service            including a number of semi                finals,

but   I have never seen such a             large number of fans at           the L ep pi ng s Lane

end at that time of day,           the area was       totally over-run.           This w ould

have been at 2 * 50pm.

At about 2 . 5 5 p m we a r ri ve d outside        the gates to the N or th S ta nd            in

P e n i s t o n e R o a d and debused*   My serial went      straight       into the g ym n as i um

where we were          to be held on standy as a reserve serial.                  We m a n a g e d to

get a hot drink a n d were just about               to eat our    packed lunches,             having

only been seated for a matter               of a minute w he n S er ge a nt Swift told us

we had to leave because we were                required on the track             in front of the

West Stand.       We    i mmediately     left the g y mn as iu m and wen t        into the

playing a re a of the stadium.             This was before 3 p m because as we e n te re d

the   playing area        I saw players      from both teams on the football                  pitch

warm in g   up*

We w a lk e d a long the track         in front of the N o r th S t a n d towards the West

S t a n d and w h e n passing some fans         in the N o r th S t a nd    I h eard some of

the   "hissing"*       As we made our way along          the track,        there was     no

i ndi c a t i o n to us at this     time,    that a ny th i ng was w rong         in the West

S t a n d of the stadium*



My serial at this time,            including myself       consisted of PS Swift,               Pc

Tattershall,       Pc McKenzie,        Pc Akred,   Pc Taylor,     Pc Pac ke r an d Pc Cooper*

We    reached the       corner of the track between the N o r t h S tand and the

West S t a n d and without       looking too       carefully    I got      the i mpression that

the are a was       not as full as the West S ta nd a p p e a r e d to be. As we began

w alk i n g a lo n g the track     in front     of the West S t a nd the noise was

deafening.        The whole   stadi um seemed to be s ho uting             but    I didn't     take

any    particular      notice at   this time,       this sort of behaviour            not being

unusual     for a game of this           importance. Pc Pa ck er was         in front of me at

this   time*      As we made our way further along                the track towards          the

S o u t h Side     I began to sense something was not quite                 right.     I could see

at this     time that      there were a l re a d y three other P o l i c e m e n s ta nding on

the track         in front of us. As       I neared Gate 4 I realised that the

people     in the West S ta nd were           not shouting       but w ere screaming*

I realised then that somet hing was s e ri ou sl y wrong and                    I heard people

in the     crowd screaming         "Let us out,"        "Oh God help us*"       I looked at the

people     in the      crowd and     I could see by their faces and that                people

were    crushed up against           the fencing an d they were           clearly     in a

d es p e r a t e situation,    I immedi at el y grabbed the officer on the track

an d a sk e d him to get some a s si s ta n ce          to us*    I knew that    I had to open

the gate to get          people out e ven if it m eant getting a bollocking.                       I

can remember          thinking,    "If y o u ’re wrong Phil        lad,   y o u ’ll get a right

bollo c k i n g   for this."      I then went straight to gate 4 at the fence

b ehind the goal         posts and shou te d to Serge an t Swift who was a number

of yards a w a y from my posi tion to my right:                   "I'm opening the gate" and

I o p e n e d the gate. Pc 3 1 9 8 A k r e d was wit h me at this             time*

On opening        the gate,    the    crush was so great that the             people behind the

s afety fencing         in this    stand   could not m ove        to free themselves.          Wit h

Pc 3 1 9 8 A kr e d    I immedi at el y began pulling        people out from the             crowd

and through the gate an d on to the track*                   Most of the       people that w e

pulled out         i n itially were able to walk a nd did not have any a pp arent

serious     injuries.      Eac h an d every      person that we       pulled out       from P e n 4

took a great deal          of physical        effort,    not one of them came out easy.

E a c h one was trapped in one way or anot h er                  by various    parts of their

body.

A fter a short while at Gate 4 we were joined by S er ge a nt Swift and we

c ontinued to pull         these     people    free* On more       than several       occasions

jackets,      pullovers,      shirts    etc were    ripped on peoples          backs    in the

effort    to free them*

There was no doubt that             the people       in the s tand w er e d es perate      for

their    lives.      The best d es c ri p ti o n w o u ld be to say that people were

drowning     in a sea of people.              All    the faces that       I saw at the front

were    pale,      grey,    white or blue all wit h panic and pain w r i t t e n all

over them.           The people at the front           c o u l d n ’t s cr e am for help only

stare,    scr e a m i ng at you w i t h their eyes.            There wer e m an y whose        eyes

were    closed.

Wh i l s t we were     standing at the gate,           I could see two men on the floor

at    the gate opening,         we were     fr an ti ca ll y pulling     people out as fast as

we    could to try and get to the             people at the front,          but as soon as one

was    pulled free the space was filled with a no th er a n d pressure was

©till    being      pushed forward         from    the back of the stand.

I got down on my hands and knees                   and g r ab be d hold of one     of the m e n

who was on the floor            face down,        hanging out of the gate         into the

track,    I put my a r m under his armpits and tried pulling him out/

whilst    I was doing this          people who wer e being         pulled free a bove me

were standing         art my back to get to the track,             other officers       present

grab b e d hold of me and other             parts of the m an and w i t h a great deal               of

physical     effort we m a n a g e d to pull         him free.      We    carried him to the

grass area behind the goal              nets,      put him down,    e st a bl i sh e d that he was

breathing an d alive,           he m u t t e r e d some words a n d we     left him and

immedi a t e l y    returned to the gate and           continued    pulling      people fro m the

pen.      I became a wa re that         the m a n we had pulled out from the floor

was    in fact being a tt en d ed to by another             officer.

It is difficult            to say how man y we phys ic al ly       pulled from the pen but

it must have been            in the hundreds,        most of w h o m were walking,       some

unconscious,         some dead,     some    collapsed.       The ones who wer e brought

out u nc o n s c i ou s were tende d to i mmediately by whoe ve r             pulled them out.

They were       brought      round by slaps        across   the face or     if they were

col la ps ed m o ut h to m ou th r e su s ci ta ti on where necessary.              I d i d n ’t
                                                                                           PAGE         8

count how m an y times           I did this,    I c o u l d n ’t guess.     As time was

passing more and more             offi cers were a rr iving at the scene,           this was

quite o b v i o u sl y w it h in minutes      of opening the gates even though we

s e e m e d to have been there a hell           of a long time        before anyone a c t u al l y

came,    but    it was only minutes.

The m a i n problem was that          no matter     how man y were        pulled from the

front,    the    crush was       so great    from the back we      couldn't     relieve an y

pressure       to get to the       people at the very front           or sides who were       in

serious    trouble.

It became       obvious that       pressure    needed to be released from the rear

M/here there was         now space appearing.           O ff ic er s were    telling or

shouting       to people to move       back from the front         but    they wouldn't      so

the s i t u a t i o n continued.

I made a request          to one    Inspector who was standing            on the grass      to get

a serial       in through the back to pull           the people out.           Whet he r   he did

or not    I don't     know,      he seemed a little      non plussed and wa lk ed away.

I can remember        pulling a boy of about          16 years     from the     crowd who had

a broken arm.            By that    I mean    I could clearly see that          the bone     in

his    right    fore a r m was    broken.      He had some ho w m a na g e d to pull       himself

above    the    people    in the    crowd and shouted to us t hat he had br o k e n his

arm,    wit h a n o t h er officer we m a na g ed to gra b him a n d pull him through

the gate and on to the track.                  He just than ke d us and w a lk e d off.

Most    of the ones who were          pulled out,     who were a ble than ke d us a n d

were    crying,     thanking God that they had got             out.

As more and more officers a r ri v e d at the scene,                  they began to tear

d own the fencing w i th their bare hands,               trying    to get to the       people      in

the pen.         S ome even tried to kick          it down.       Some officers were

hanging over        the fencing and pulling          people over quite         clearly     in some

people      laid down on the, grass,                I cannot    remember     how m an y were     laid on

the grass at            this time but my e st im at io n w o u l d be in the             region of

about 30 to 40.                O ther Police Offic e r s were enga ge d          in a tt em pt s      to

revive      people.

I made      several       a tt empts    to    revive    people w it h a rtificial        r es us ci ta ti on

and w h e n e v e r     I thought      I felt a pulse        I w o u ld shout a ny medical

personnel who were               near at hand,           I seemed to have       found more dead

than alive.

The s i t u a t i o n    in this area was quite             chaotic,    bodies all       over   the

place,      people w a n de r in g about         crying,     screaming,      shouting,     Pol ice

O ff i c e r s and what         few medical      personnel were there          trying f r an t ic al l y

to revive        people.

After     some time at checking bodies and m ak i ng several                       h op eless

attem p t s    to revive         people      it became obvious       to me that     there was

nothing more            that    I could do,            I was feeling a b s ol u te l y    physically

shattered.              By this time all         the people      in Pe n 4 had been pulled out

and there only             remained the dead bodies             in P en 3,    a large number          of

w h i c h had been taken out a nd placed on the field.

During     the most         frantic mom e nt s      of trying     to revive     the people on the

grass     there were           no medical      personnel     to speak of an d the St John's

young     boy of about           12 - 14 years who was tota ll y o ve r wh e lm e d by the

situation.              A l t h o u g h on saying   that,    once they had g at he re d their

senses     they got stuck             in and w or k ed very hard.

W i t h regard to the behaviour                 of the fans      I can say that the ones who

were    seated above            the   pens were shouting a nd scr ea mi ng abuse,               but the

ones who were            on the groun d got o r ga ni se d        into groups and help ed us

w i t h the    injured etc by carrying them on advert                      boards an d were a

credit     to themselves.

                   I am a P ol ic e S er geant        serv ing    in the M e t r o p o l i t a n Police.    I have

                   been an ardent          football    fan for most of my          life and regularly at te nd

                   football matches          both off duty an d on duty w hen             posted*      I have     been

                   on duty at C up Final matc he s at W e mb l ey             involving such teams as

                  Liverpool,        M an ch e st e r United,     Arsenal,    Notts Forest,       West H a m etc.

                   O n numerous      occasions whilst          on duty I have       been enga ge d policing

                   su pporters at         turnstile entrances*

                   For several years          I have been aware of a m e th o d use d by some football

                   su pporters      to gain entry to the stadiums without                  tickets.        This m e t h o d

                   is used ma in ly        by s up po rt er s of more successful          teams and its use

                   results     in the      build up of supporters           outside    turnstiles as was          seen

                   at Hillsborough*

                   A large mass of suppo rt er s w ou ld a p p r oa c h a block of turnstiles*

                                                                                                           PAGE           2
                                                                                                           S 14-21

        offer the torn off stub of an a l re a d y used ticket                          or w ou ld offer no

        ticket at all.           This    can occur      as regularly as e very minute                   or so.       I

        have seen         it done    by single s upporters           v i rt ua ll y    in a single stream,

        The turnstile          operator,      correctly      refuses the supporter admission*

        n or m a l l y the s u pporter then argues w it h the operator-                         This    results      in

        other    s upporters        being unable to enter t h ro ug h that turnstile                      and this

        leads to the a p p r o a c h to the turnstile                becoming         congested.

        The original         supporter who has tried to gain a d m i s s io n u nl aw f u l l y then

        claims     quite     correctly,       that he cannot         retreat     because of the force of

        the   crowd behind him.             The    t u rnstile operator         g en e ra l ly has to a ll ow

        the supporter a d m i s s i o n oth e r wi se the turnstile                   becomes    useless-        Many

        suppo r t e r s    can gain a d m is s i o n by this m e th o d even at t urnstiles w here

        police are         posted*      It is difficult           for officers         to remove       these

        suppo r t e r s as it is difficult,             once the crowd has become                 c on gested to

        even get      to them.        O b v i o u s l y as well    police    can be reluctant            to go

        right    into the thick of the              crowd to remove the supporter.                      M an y more

        s upporters        can obv i o u s l y enter    by this m e t h o d at t u rnstiles w hi c h

        aren't     policed.

        This m e t h o d    is used s u c c e s s f u l l y by s up p o r te rs of particular            teams and

        explains w h y so m a n y fans            travel    to such matches without               tickets*

        It's success         is based on the         inability to          remove such a supporter               from

        the t u rnstile entrance*

        T here   is a great need to k eep a sterile area betw ee n the bulk of the

        supporters an d the turnstil e entrance or for the turnstiles                                   to be

        r e designed       providing an exit         route for a person at the entrance to a

        t u rnstile who has not got a ticket,                     or who    is not a l l o w e d into the

        g r o u n d for any other        reason.

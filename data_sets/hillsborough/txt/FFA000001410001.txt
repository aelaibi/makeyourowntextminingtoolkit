                            THE FOOTBALL LEAGUE LIMITED


                        New Measures to combat hooliganism




        At the meeting held on 23rd February, 1987, with Messrs Tracey and

Hogg, a new eight-point plan was agreed between the Government and the

football authorities.    In the intervening period much has been achieved.



        Clubs were notified of the action required in a letter dated 5th

March, 1987, and the following report is a summary of the progress made:-



Local Plans


        To date, detailed local plans have been submitted by 7^ clubs.

These vary in quality and quantity, but in the main the returns from clubs

are extremely comprehensive and thorough.     Steps are being taken to ensure

that the outstanding local plans are submitted before the start of the new

season and clubs who fail to comply will be fined under new powers vested in

the Management Committee.    It should be noted, however, that Scarborough, as

a new member to the League, are still in the process of developing their

local plan in consultation with the police.



        The League has commissioned the services of Mr Jack Crawford, until

recently an Assistant Chief Constable with Merseyside Police.     Mr Crawford

will act as security consultant to the League and one of his primary functions

will be to scrutinise    the returns from clubs.   He will endeavour to find any

anomalies in the current procedures and also compare the security operations

at the different grounds to ascertain if any lessons can be learned.     As a

result of this exercise it is anticipated that a standard form of questionnaire

will be developed for use in future years.
Membership Schemes


        The response from clubs to the League's request to introduce schemes

covering 505 of spectator accommodation for home supporters has been extremely

encouraging.   At the present time, 41 clubs have achieved the 50% target,

compared with only one (Luton Town) last season.     Many more clubs are within

a few points of 505 (a further 21 clubs are between 4055 and 5055) and a

breakdown of the     position for the forthcoming season is provided at the back

of this report.



         During the close season, advisory committees, consisting of one

representative of The Football League, two representatives of The Football

League Executive Staffs' Association, one independent representative nominated

by the League, together with one independent representative nominated by the

Department of the Environment, made visits to 50 clubs.       A further 7 clubs

(Everton, Blackburn Rovers, Bradford City, Ipswich Town, Middlesbrough,

Northampton Town and Southend United) had submitted proposals marginally below

50% but were not visited.      The committees were well received at the majority

of clubs despite the obvious difficulties of implementation at many grounds.

The one major factor which influenced the findings of the committees was the

attitude of the local police.      In many instances, the   police gave a cool

reception to the idea that membership schemes would assist in the management

and   control of spectators.     In many cases, there was also opposition to the

designation of areas usually occupied by the younger, more vociferous

supporters.    This inevitably placed constraints on the advisory committees,

who, at clubs like Aston Villa, Cardiff City, Huddersfield Town, Liverpool,

                                                                   Contd./3
Sheffield Wednesday and Swansea City realised there was no prospect of

achieving the 5055 target.   This was because in each case a single area of

terracing considered to be unsuitable made up more than half the spectator

accommodation for home supporters.     The League are, at present, seeking

confirmation in writing of the local     position from the police authorities.

In the interests of law and order, many police forces also reserved the right

to override the membership schemes if it transpired that large numbers of non­

members would otherwise be locked out.



        Only three clubs, Arsenal, Southampton and Barnsley, have indicated

that they do   not intend following the advisory committee's recommendations,

although Barnsley are the only club who have no proposals at all for

segregated membership areas.   In the main, the committees’ recommendations

have been adopted or the clubs' proposals have been accepted. Five or six-

clubs require particular attention and several clubs will have their proposals

reviewed in due course.   The system of servicing this procedure will need to

be maintained, although it should be stressed that all membership schemes will

inevitably be under continuous review.    Again, Mr Crawford will assist in this

area.



        Two clubs, Colchester United and Torquay United, have indicated

that they intend operating a 'home only1 scheme for League matches.    However,

the League remains opposed to this   principle and would prefer clubs who are

intent on introducing a fully-comprehensive scheme to provide a reciprocal

arrangement for visiting fans. Grimsby Town and Scunthorpe United will

operate such an arrangement in the coming season.



                                                 Contd./4
           Cup ties present additional problems because they often feature high

profile games attracing near capacity gates.      As a result, some clubs, with

the agreement of their local police, have excluded cup ties from their

membership arrangements which is in line with the normal conditions for season

tickets.



           It has become clear during recent months that the response from the

clubs has been better than originally anticipated because although more than

half   of the clubs have not reached the 50£ target, they have, without

exception, made tremendous efforts to co-operate in the introduction of

feasible schemes.     The League see this exercise as the first stage in an

ongoing situation and other facets of the membership concept now have to be

examined, including reciprocal arrangements.      But above all, the effects of

the schemes already introduced need to be carefully monitored.



           It is also worth mentioning that the cost to the League of the visits

to clubs will be in the region of £2 5 ,0 0 0 .



Reciprocal Membership Study


           Peat Marwick McLintock were commissioned to undertake the feasibility

study agreed on 23rd February, 1987.

        The Final report was received on the evening on Friday, 31st July,

1987, and this will be discussed by The Football League Management Committee

on 28th August, 1987.



        The cost of the    report will be in the region of £52,000, with the

Football Trust contributing £25,000.



                                                     Contd./5
Closed Circuit Television

         All First and Second Division clubs have C.C.T.V. systems except A.F.C.

Bournemouth, Sheffield United and Swindon Town.    Their applications are

currently being   processed by the Football Trust and they should have systems

installed in the near future.

         Eighteen Third and Fourth Division clubs will have installations by

the start of the season, whilst a further seventeen applications are currently

being processed by the Football Trust.    Three other clubs (Bury, Newport

County   and Torquay United) have been advised by the Football Trust to utilise

police-owned mobile C.C.T.V. equipment.



All-Ticket Matches


         A discriminating policy will continue with regard to all-ticket

matches in consultation with the local police.


         The Football Association have agained ruled that Leeds United's away

matches should be all-ticket, although clubs can apply for special

dispensation for members.

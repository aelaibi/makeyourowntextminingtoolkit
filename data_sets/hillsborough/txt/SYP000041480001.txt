 QUESTIONNAIRE COMPLETED BY            I

 With reference to your letter dated 27 September 1989 relative to the above,
 Superintendent Carlisle of the Greater Manchester Police has now seen
       and another witness I   I     1

 I have carefully read the statements taken and I do not consider that the
 contents constitute a complaint against the police within the terms of the
 Police & Criminal Evidence Act 1984.

 In the circumstances I should be grateful if you would investigate the
 incident as part of your criminal enquiry.

 Yours sincerely

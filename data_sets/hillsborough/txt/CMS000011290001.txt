      DRAFT REPLY TO OUTSTANDING MINISTER'S CASES HELD BY THE HOME
      OFFICE

      I am sorry that you have had to wait so long for a reply to your
      letter of [date] to [Minister] enclosing this one from
      [constituent] about the implementation of the recommendations
      contained in Lord Justice Taylor's Final Report on the
      Hillsborough Stadium Disaster. [I am replying because
      responsibility for safety at sports grounds matters has recently
      been transferred from the Home Office to this Department.]

      As you know, among 76 recommendations covering all aspects of
      safety, Lord Justice Taylor recommended the elimination of
      standing accommodation at Football League matches, by 1994 in the
      case of 1st and 2nd Division clubs, and by 1999 for those in the
      3rd and 4th Divisions. This has been accepted as Government
      policy.

      However, in the light of the numerous representations received
      from the world of football in favour of retaining some standing
      accommodation, [I] announced on 4 June that the Government was
      prepared to look again at the all-seater requirement for certain
      categories of ground.

       We have decided that it would be wrong to review either the
       principle or the timetable for all-seating at First Division
       grounds in the Football League (the new Premier League). It is
     , essential that our top clubs meet the standards necessary to
       compete in Europe and make full use of the resources available to
       them to provide grounds of which we can all be proud as we enter
       the 21st Century.

      In addition, the Government continues to support the principle of
      all-seating for the great majority of Second Division clubs.

      Nevertheless, representations have been invited from a number of
      interested organisation as to whether there are any circumstances
      in which standing accommodation can be retained at any Third and
      Fourth Division clubs in the Football League. In doing so we
      shall ensure that as few anomalies as possible are created.
      Particular attention will be given to Second Division clubs with
      very low average attendances.

      It would be wrong to attempt to predict the outcome of this
      exercise the result  of which will, in any case, be announced
      shortly. I can say,   however, that we remain firmly committed to
Xl    ensuring that those  who wish to watch football matches should do
      so safely, and we continue to support the principles of spectator
      safety set out in Lord Justice Taylor's Final Report.

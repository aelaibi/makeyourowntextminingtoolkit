    Dear Sir

    Hillsborough Disaster

    Further to my letter of the 17th May, I have been informed by
    the Club that it is their intention to remove the remaining
    barriers  and safety fence to the Leppings       Lane   terrace
    immediately before the start of the forthcoming season.

    The Club have already agreed to the removal of a further
    barrier from the ground for testing in accordance with the
    agreement reached between the experts in the litigation at
    their meeting on the 5th April.  It is anticipated by the end
    of July/beginning of August, that these experts will have
    completed their enquiries for the purposes of preparing a
    report, and therefore from that point of view, there is no
    need for the Leppings Lane terrace to remain in its present
    state as the parties to the litigation will not be prejudiced
    by such works being undertaken.  I have informed the parties'
    Solicitors of the Club's intentions in this regard, and have
    said quite clearly that the whole matter should be reviewed
    once again at the end of July when we have a much clearer
    picture of any potential problems that may be caused by these
    intended w o r k s .

    However, I am of course extremely conscious of any continuing
    interest your investigation team may have in the terrace
    remaining in its present state, together with that of H.M.
    Coroner and the Crown Prosecution Service.  I would ask you to
    confirm whether there is any objection to these works being
    carried out.    As stated above,   the position needs to be
    reviewed at the end of July, but at this stage I would be
    grateful if you would indicate whether there is any continuing
    interest in the terrace.



                                                                                                                                                        Contd../..

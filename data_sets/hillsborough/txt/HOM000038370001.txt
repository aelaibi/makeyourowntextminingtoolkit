                        QUESTION                 EIGHT

Why was no public address announcement made - either informing
the fans as to what was happening, asking for their help or for any
medical personnel at the ground to help - until 3.30 pm?

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield South Yorkshire Police indicates that instructions
were given for tannoy messages be transmitted for fans to ease back in the pens in
the Leppings Lane terraces, also for fans to clear the playing area, the latter because
they were hampering the rescue attempts. His impression is that he had asked for all
doctors and medical staff to got to the Leppings Lane end of the ground, and that as
a result of this request the perceptive fans in the crowd must realise there was a
difficult situation.

The reason the announcement to inform the fans that the game had been abandoned
was delayed due to the need to keep the routes clear which was one of the duties of
the site commander. The likelihood of the fans leaving the ground once a tannoy
message had been transmitted was a serious consideration for him and their leaving
the ground may hamper the rescue. There was also the fear of an adverse reaction
by the fans.

Lord Justice Taylor - Interim Report

Medical

89. At 3.13 pm a St John's ambulance came onto the pitch at the north-east comer
and drove to the perimeter fence close to gate 3. There was no call for doctors and
nurses on the public address system until nearly 3.30 pm. Nevertheless, as the
minutes ticked past, some of them came onto the pitch to help of their own accord
when they saw the casualties and the ambulance and realised the gravity of the
situation. Many fans also worked prodigiously in attempts to revive the dead and the
dying, in some cases their own relatives and friends. Artificial respiration, mouth to
mouth respiration and cardiac massage were applied by the skilled and the unskilled
but usually in vain. Those capable of survival mostly came round of their own accord.
The rest were mostly doomed before they could be brought out and treated.

Fans

97. Apart from the message to clear the pitch and the belated call for medical
assistance about 3.30 pm, no information or advice was broadcast on the public
address system. Mr Duckenfield feared that the crowd might turn hostile or might all
attempt to leave together thereby hampering the emergency services if they were
given information about what had happened. The result was that apart from those
close enough at the west end to see the terrible truth for themselves, the majority of
the crowd were left in ignorance. Many, especially Nottingham supporters in the Kop,
still thought there had been a pitch invasion or other misbehaviour by Liverpool fans.
They continued singing and chanting incongruously. This infuriated some Liverpool
fans who were already distraught. A few began to run towards the Kop end.
The police feared violence might result on top of the existing disaster. Accordingly,
they deployed a large number of officers to form a line across the width of the pitch at
the Kop end and advance up to the halfway line sweeping any Liverpool fans back as
they moved. There the line stood as an insurance against disorder but doing nothing.
Other officers were posted to the perimeter track facing the north stand for the same
purpose. To those distressed and distraught who wanted urgent action, this large
contingent of passive officers was seen as an affront. Feelings against the police
intensified.


Lord Justice Taylor - Recommendation 57

Within the control room, there should be a public address system to communicate with
individual areas outside and inside the ground, with groups of areas or with the whole
ground. Important announcements should be preceded by a loud signal to catch the
attention of the crowd despite a high level of noise in the ground. This arrangement
should be prominently advertised on every programme sold for every match.

                     Q.   Did you feel then that he had the responsibility        and not you
                          to take the lead, as it were, on the pitch, and to     sort out
                          the situation? - A. He was the senior Officer on       the pitch,
                          sir, and he in my view was taking command of the       situation
                          there, until Mr. Nesbitt arrived.

                     Q. The sad fact is that he did not achieve very much, did he, Mr.
               B        Duckenfield.   It was not until Superintendent Nesbitt arrived
                        on the scene that anything was achieved? - A. In fairness to
                        Mr. Jackson, he came back at one point to see me when I
                        implemented the major incident plan, and he then returned, but
                        Mr. Nesbitt obviously was in uniform.

                     Q.   Yes, I see.   Now, what about use of the Tannoy? - a . Use was
                          made of the Tannoy by P.O. Ryan to ask people to move back, in
                          addition to the Officers indicating for people to push back in
                          the p e n s .

                     O. What message was sent over? - A. I don't know, sir.

                     Q. Did you not give instructions? - A. Sir, in the crisis
                        situation I was issuing instructions for all manner of things
                        to be done, and that was one instruction which I expected to
                D       be carried out.

                     G.   Yes, out what was your instruction? - A. My instruction was to
                          give Tannoy messages for people to ease back.

                     Q.   To ease back where? - A. Towards the tunnel.   I did not say
                          scecifically the tunnel.  I said, "Ease back".

                     G. We have heard some evidence that a Tannoy message at some
                        stage was also given for people to clear off the pitch.   Do
                        you know anything about that? - A. No, sir.

                     Q.. What about the possibility of the game going ahead? Were you
                         thinking- in terms :of whether the game should; be postponed
                         altogether ;   .xDr..-.whether it might be possible to start- it .again
                         a f t e r -a-period?      A. At that stage, sir..     .
                 F
                     Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Forgive me, at which stage are you
                          telling us?  You say "at that stage” . Which stage are you
                          referring to? - A. May I ask for guidance as to what time you
                          are asking me about?

                     G.       - MR. COLLINS:      At what stage was it you were getting or
                          you instructed Mr. Ryan to broadcast that the fans should go
                          back in the terraces? - A. I c a n ’t be specific, sir.   About
                          the time that we have appreciated the people on the pitch, but
                          I c a n ’t be specific.   There were many instructions given very
                          quickly.

                      Q. You say that you can't recall now instructions to clear the
                         pitch.  Can I ask you to look at page 13 of your statement,
                 H       Chief Superintendent? - A. Yes, sir.

     support.   - A. Yes.

Q. For instructions to implement the major disaster plan. - A.
   Yes.

G. To warn hospitals, etc, which of course was at a fairly early
   stage that you did this.  You reacted quicKly, you told us.,
   and you sent these messages out.  You say this:

           "Whilst all this was taking place I asked Police
           Constable Ryan to continue broadcasting for calm among
           the supporters and for them to clear the pitch so we
           could determine what people were injured and where
           because the fans were milling around and obstructing the
           vi e w ” .

     - A. Yes, sir.

Q. So it appears you did give instructions for a broadcast to
   clear the pitch? - A. I misunderstood what you said.        The
   situation was one of the difficulties in the situation you
   describe is that with so many people coming on the pitch, and
   this could link in with the suggestion you have raised that
   people did not know what they were doing, there were fans on
   the pitch who were hampering rescue attempts because you just
   c o u l d n ’t see who was injured or who was not injured who might
   want attention, because the pitch was filling up. and we
   wanted people to move away so we could see who required
   attention.        ,

G.    Where were they supposed to move to? - A.      To the sides.

q   .. which, sides and where? - A. Either side,    the North Standside
      and the South Stand side.

G. There., was a public order problem if they moved to the South
   Stand-side,.was .not there, because they-would be brought'-up— '
   against..;.Nottingh.am Forest fans in that -stand? - A'. S i r - i n a -•
   situation such as that I would- have hoped that a public order
   problem may not have developed, although it is a possibility.
   My c o n c e r n . ...

G. Well, it did develop. - A. Yes.   My concern was for the
   injured and for those who required attention, and I could not
   and I don't think anybody else could, deal with the injured,
   which was of prime importance, until people who could walk
   could walk away from the situation.

q   . It did not occur to you there might be    anumber in    shock?    - A,
      Very much so.

G. And they would not be likely to respond, would they, to
   requests to clear the pitch? - A. No, but there were a number
   of Police Officers in a state of shock also.

G. I know.      Were you aware of that at the time? - A. No, I was
   not.                                                     -^

                    Q. As the situation developed there was a problem from the
                       Nottingham.Forest end, the Kop, because fans were clearly
                       annoyed by what they perceived to be Liverpool fans coming on
                       the pitch and effectively, as they thought, doing a Heysel all
                       over again? - A. I d o n ’t know of that, sir.

              g|    G. Did not you hear   it? - A. No, I can't comment on that.  I was
                       engrossed in the   events that were taking place, andthat was
                       at the other end   of the ground.

                    0. But you were aware, were not you told by anyone, that there
                       were problems with the Nottingham Forest end because they
                       believed that the Liverpool fans were disrupting the game? -
                       A. I was not told that, sir.

                    0. Was not it obvious that might arise? - A. The obvious problems
                       before my eyes, sir, was dealing with the situation as I saw
                       it.

                    Q. I am not suggesting this is something you should have
                       necessarily done immediately, but did there not come a time
                       when you should have used the Tannoy to appeal for calm, to
               D       explain what was happening? - A. What would you suggest I
                       explain to people?

                    Q. Explain that there were injuries, people had been hurt, and
                       that that was what it was all about, and would people please
                       remain calm and enable the injured to be treated and ce
                       attended to? - A. I took the view, sir. that on that occasion
                       we said nothing.  We would use the Tannoy to try and clear the
              •E       pitch and we would say nothing to the crowd because it might
                       cause a reaction.

                    Q. Saying, nothing did cause a reaction, did it not?      It caused
                       the Nottingham Forest fans to shout and yell and taunt
                       Liverpool?:.--:-A. - I..disagree, sir. That might have beer, the •
                       initial reaction from your perception.       My view is that my
                       •decision -to-tell no-one was the .correct decision to- ensure -
                       that .the emergency services could get in and out, that the
                       routes were clear, and that was a correct operational decision
                       on the day.

                    0. Well, when was it you were first aware you might have some
                       deaths on your hands? - A. I think at the time I went to see
                       the FA in the board room at Sheffield Wednesday.

                    Q. When was that? - A. It is difficult to be accurate, sir.

                    0. At what stage? - A. I would suggest possibly half-past-3,
                       shortly after, when all the major incident and operation was
                       running.

                     O. Was it at this stage you agreed the game should be postponed?
                H       - A. Yes, sir.

                     0. I think Mr. Jackson was with you? - A. Yes.
                                                                                    140

0. But you decided that the announcement should .not be made that
   .there had been postponement, and the reason as I understand it -
   was you did not want people leaving until all the ambulances
   had been able to get- there and get away and ferry the injured
   out? - A. There are two aspects to it, sic.   The first one, as
   you suggest, was that to announce that to the fans it was
   going to be postponed, some of them, even if we requested them
   to stay, might leave immediately, and that could cause a
   problem.   Furthermore, if the 54,000 fans or thereabouts in
   the stadium decided to create a public order situation because
   of the postponement of the game, because of their anger, then
    I had not got the resources to deal with it, and I was playing
   for time.

Q. Eventually we know that Kenny Dalglish made an appeal for
   calm, and this was, I think, if I remember rightly, at 3.45? -
   A. I am not sure of the time, sir.  I had returned from the
   board room, and Mr. Clough and Mr. Dalglish came to the Police
   control box.  They asked what they could do to assist, and Mr.
   Dalglish very kindly offered to pass a message to the
   Liverpool fans, appealing for assistance and calm, and that
   was appreciated.

Q. The effect of your decision - I am not now saying whether it
   was right or wrong - the effect of your decision on giving no
   information was that for 40 minutes or thereabouts, between
   about 5-past-3 and about 3.45, no-one in that stadium, none of
   the fans knew what was happening? - A. Yes. sir.

0. Apart from what they could see happening on the pitch? - k .
     Yes. sir.       I correct you.   I have an impression that I asked
  . for medical attention, and all doctors who were in the stadium
     or medical staff to go to the Leppings Lane goal to assist.
     Now.. I made a decision not to tell the crowd about the kick-
     off, being postponed, but those who were watching and those who
 ' ' were. ;p.er-cept-iye must have realised there was a 'diff i c u l t -
-     situation because ,T had asked for medical staff and- d o c t o r s '

0. But there was still noise and shouting going on, certainly in
   the earlier stages of the disaster after the game was stopped,
   was not there? - A. I d o n ’t know, sir. The reason I say that
   is the control box is to some extent sound proof, and the
   Nottingham fans are at the furthest end of the g ro und.

O.    Anyway, you say you think the decision not to tell was on
     balance a better decision than one to tell? - A. I d o n ’t
     think, sir.   I know.

Q.    Very well.  In fact, when you did make the announcement in due
     course, some time around shortly after 4, the reaction of the
     fans was wholly co-operative, was not it? - A . It was
     excellent, sir.   They applauded.

O. Once they were told the full circumstances, not only as you
   say did they applaud but they sat quietly or stood quietly for
   about 10 minutes before the dispersed in an orderly fashion? -
                                                                     14.1

   A. I c a n ’t recall exactly what they did. I was relieved that
   there had not been an adverse reaction, and they then left the
   ground.

Q. I am not going to ask you about what went on later in the
   evening, because that really is not material to this Inquiry.

   happened once the incident had blown up.   Have you been able
   to identify any deficiencies as far as you can see it in the
   arrangements that were made either by the Police or by anyone
   else for that matter, for coping with the problem when it
   arose? -A. I think one of the big problems is in relation to
   an incident like this is the human element, and certainly the
   people that I saw on that day were extremely stressed, were
   extremely concerned.   When I went on to the pitch we talked
   about fans being on the pitch and the possibility of the
   Police taking them off.   That really was not an option,
   because the people I saw there were extremely concerned and
   did not know what they were doing.   So really, the human
   element is the .thing that causes most concerned in a rescue
   attempt like that.

        In terras of deficiencies I would say in hindsight we
   should look at the improvements you can make such, as: I have
   suggested, the combined control room, different types of
   fences, perhaps in the control room we could have some sort
   of system where you press the button and it goes straight
   through to the Ambulance Service, straight through to the
   Fire Brigade.   So those are issues I feel we could
   consider, but in terms of on the day my view is that
   everybody was doing what they possibly could under
   tremendous stress, under tremendous strain, under a great
   deal of confusion.

G. Can I ask you this.  It has been suggested that the Tannoy
   ought to have been used in a more positive fashion than it
   was? - A . Y e s .

G. What do you say about that? - A. I listened to Mr. Duckenfield
   regarding that, and I do agree with him it is a very, very ...
   difficult one, .because if you start a n n o w c i n g over'-the-Tannoy,
   you have injuries or fatalities, e t c . , then you could very
   likely cause-a problem and people may panic,, and. therefore,
   it. is a case of trying to do it as calmly and as
   professionally as possible, and I agree with that
   decision.

G, In fact,   nothing was said, was it, at least nothing to explain
   what was   happening or why it was happening? - A. No.

G. The result is. .that certainly: the Nottingham Forest fans: at the
   other end, some of them anyway, were getting rather impatient
   with the Liverpool fans, because caused its own problems? - A.
   Y e s , but I think that probably would be nothing like the
   problems that may have been caused if he did go over the air
   and he did say, "We have fatalities, injuries", we may have
   caused panic.     So I think that option was probably the most
   preferable one.

Q. Did you think of it yourself as to whether or not you s h o u M
   use the Tannoy more, or was that something that was just left
   to Mr. Duckenfield? - A. The Tannoy was being used ;asking
   people to keep calm.


                                                                     144

Q.       Yes, but that was at a   rather later stage, was not it, when
         Mr. Dalglish was asked   or did send out a message, and that was
         about 3.56, I think? -   A. I had a feeling the Tannoy was being
         used at some stage  to   tell people to keep calm.

q   .         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Mr. Jackson, I am not doubting
         what you say about that, but I just d o n ’t quite follow why
         there would be panic.    Obviously if you said there was a bomb
         scare or something of that sort I can see that people might
         panic, but to tell the people at the other end of the ground
         or other parts of the ground that there had been some injuries
         at the terracing at the west end, some quite serious injuries,
         why would that cause people to panic do you think at the other
         end? - A. I think basically at the time, my Lord, we did what
         we thought was appropriate, and certainly in relation to that
         that was not thought about.

Q. You did just say you thought it might cause people to panic.
   I a m wondering whether an announcement to. that effect would-
   for any reason make people panic? -A. I d o n ’t know. In'"
   hindsight it may not have done.

q    .          MR. COLLINS:       Surely it is more likely to cause trouble
         if you say nothing, and as indeed happened let the Nottingham
         Forest fans continue in the belief that the Liverpool fans
         w e r e misbehaving themselves? - A. I think a bit later on when
         I went down to the pitch and spoke to Mr. Nesbit we then
         decided to make an announcement, but certainly during the
         rescue attempt we:certainly did not think in doing that, and
         p e r h a p s in hindsight in a wash up situation, it may have been
         advisable to do i t .

Q.   Now, in fairness I should say this.    Many of my clients
     initially have put that down to indifference on the part of
     the Police, but it now seems that two causes operated, and I
     put this in the form of a question to you.    Firstly, was there
     not some inactivity by Police Officers due to lack of
     leadership until Mr. Nesbit came on the scene, and secondly,
     was not some of it due to younger Police Officers freezing
     from shock? - A. All of our Police Officers are trained to act
     either individually or collectively in terms of saving life.
     In terms of the efforts going round the gates, the gates are
     narrow.    I have said already Police Officers were coming down
     the back in Leppings Lane.    Police Officers were round the
     gate.   There were Police Officers hanging about in the
     background, as it were, who couldn't get themselves‘involved.

G.   D o y o u accept the evidence given by a number of people that a
     lot of Police; Officers suffered from shock? -A. Yeff, I would1
     accept t h a t .

Q. And froze.  In other words, their inactivity was simply due to
   being frozen with shock? - A. I think if I could make a
   broader statement in relation to that, I think probably most
   people in the stadium were shocked at some stage.

Q. The only reason I am putting this to you is that a large
   number "of my clients, now that they appreciate rather more
   clearly what did happen, have expressed surprise, and I have
   to say a little anger, that Police Officers were frozen when
   fans were taking initiatives.   In other words, when-fans were-
   a little more active, and they have asked and I ask as a
   result whether Police Officers are given any or if so adequate
   training to enable them to overcome the-horrors that occurred
   o n this occasion? - A. I think as much training as is
   practicable is given to Police Officers.

Q. I d o n ’t think I can take that further.’ The other thing
   obviously which I am instructed to ask you, which I do, is why
   Police O f f i c e r s , and I am not now dealing with the situation
   that arose after some Liverpool fans very foolishly advanced
   on the Nottingham Forest end, when we know a cordon was put
   across the pitch, but why, before that, a-cordon of Police was
   drawn up parallel to the terraces instead of those Police
   Officers being utilised in rescue? -A. I.think as I have
   already mentioned to you only a certain number of Police
   Officers could.be used in the rescue situation.          You could not
   use all of the Police Officers.

G. That is a fair answer.     I have asked you and that is your
   answer.     Coming to the Tannoy, nobody so far as I know has
   suggested that the Tannoy could have been used or should
   h a v e been used to announce that there had~been a .disaster >
   but I want to take the questions of Lord Justice Taylor &
   little further.     The Tannoy could have been used not onif
   to pacify the Nottingham Forest fans by explaining there
   had been overcrowding and some injuries, and .would they
   please be patient, but also to give the vital message^ to
   the Liverpool fans at the back oif pens 3 and 4 to ®ove         -    n

     back, to go back through the tunnel, because that is what
     a number of Police Officers in the second stage as it were
     of the emergency were attempting to do from the front of
     the perimeter fence? - A. Well, certainly Mr. Greenwood
     who was down there was trying to achieve that at close
     level.

Q. That is the problem,      because he was doing it from the pitch? -
   A. He was.

Q. And he was trying to get people, to push back, but of .course
   people at the. front were not the people to be talking to
   because they .could not push back, because o f t h e .'-pressure at
   the back ^ - Ih©v Tannoy could have been used^ef fectively .to, get
   the people at-the back of the pens to move-out of the tunnel
   a n d ,thus .relieve the pressure an.;.those»at the.:;front who were ,
   probably -not only being crushed but were;also probablyv
   panicking? - A. I think at that stage there was a lot of
   people on the ground and the pressure certainly in that
   respect had been released.

Q. I am also asked to make some enquiries into the alleged
   c o n f u s i o n , because my clients allege a great deal of
   c o n f u s i o n , in.the situation after the bodies had been taken to
   the gymnasium,- but do I take it you are not really the person
   to as-k about that? - A. No, that would be Detective C h i e f       -
   Superintendent Addis.

                     Cross-Examined by MR. JACKSON:........           . . —.

G.   Mr. Jackson, m ay I adopt most of the matters put by my learned
     friend, Mr. H y t n e r , to you about the events of the day.      May I
     g o .b a c k , and I hope not to be personal, t o t h i s ridiculous -•
     suggestion that fans should be expected to level themselves
     o u t . May I say: that is against the s p irit. . . .         -

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    You are not making a speech, Mr..
     Jackson.  Would you ask questions, please.

 Q. .         MR. JACKSON:      Is that not against the spirit of
: ' everything you thought when you planned your operation for the
    day? - A. I said it twofold.          I said, (1) you would expect the
    fans, or hopefully the fans would find, their own level, and -
    s e c o n d l y , the stewards have the responsibility in that
    respect.

Q. May "I take the second part first. May I suggest that rightly
   or wrongly the Police have in this case given the stewards of
   Sheffield Wednesday the task of planning the packing of the
   ground? - A. I am not quite sure what you mean there.

 Q. May I suggest it is quite clear that everyone knew-and has
    known for years that it is proper that someone should oversee
    the packing and loading of the ground? May I suggest in this
    case that rightly or wrongly the Police gave that task to the
    Sheffield Wednesday stewards? - A. Yes, I would accept that.

                                                                      148

              I am a single man living at the above address and I am currently doing

              an Employmen'                                    H    During my spare time I work

              as a Steward for Sheffield Wednesday Football Club which had had their

              ground at Hillsborough Sheffield.         My duties are to act as an Official

              Steward and I do the same thing every match day.              This is my first

              year with the Cluby^nd my job is to keep the gangway one clear

              in the Spion Kop^/ which I do by moving          people on

             who stand in the Gangways from where            I work in the Spion Kop.         I have

             a good view of the playing area.

             At about    11.15 am <1100)   on Saturday 15 April         1989/(150489).    I

              reported for duty at the Hillsborough Football Gj^ound, and took up my

              place   in the Spion Kop.    After about 30 minulj^ey, the Nottingham Forest

             supporters started to come into the Stand and from then on it
                                                                               PAGE        2
                                                                               S1879

started to fill up.      The whole of my stand,           the Spion Kop had been

allocated for the Nottingham Forest f a n s .

At about 3.QQ pm (15QQ)      later that same day, the players were out on

the football    pitch and ready to kick off.         My work as far as the fans

coming   in to the Spion Kop, was almost done, as there was very few

coming into my part of the ground at this time.                Everyone had settled

down and all were well behaved.          There was no one at my end causing

any trouble.     As the match kicked off I could see that the ground was

vertually full of both clubs fans.           I was situated about halfway up in

the Spion Kop stand on %.he         left hand side facing the playing area.

After a few minutes y n e    Liverpool Team hit the Nottingham Forest Goals

bar with the bal-yl./    I then saw their supporters          in the standing area

of the West Stand all surge forward and some               spilled j/ver the barrier

fencing on to the area       behind the goal mouth         at ^he/Liverpool end       of

the ground.     This group then got larger and the match was s t o p p e d , but

you co ul dn ’t really see what was causing         it.     I then saw a number of

Police Off ice rs running across the playing area towards the end where

all these people were still          coming on to the field.       I saw people

attempting to j:limb over fyfie fencing / n to the playing area and other

climbing on to the West Jstand above them.            I d i d n ’t know what was

happening at that t i m e ^ b u t   I guessed there was some trouble of some

sort and I decided to move down towards the playing area and the front

of the Spion Kop which       is the area directly         between the Spion Kop and

the North Stand.      This   is the area where all         the Ambulancemen are

and leads on to the main Penistone Rd.                                  j
On reaching that area between the Spion Kop and the North/Stand I saw

a good few Police Officers making their way on to the fij£ld and the

good few of the Nottingham Forest fans leaving the g r o u n d .            There was

alot of people moving about         in that area.     I then made/my way on to

the playing field by which time all the players had l^ft.                   I saw a

               small    boy of the St Johns Ambulancemen carrying^^/4tretc)rter which I

               took off him and took down to the area behind the Live/pool                                                                 goalmouth

               where all the injured were lying.                                                            I then helped a young man,       together

               with others, who was being carried on one of the advertising

               boards.     I think he had a broken ankle as I steadied it whilst others

               carried him on the board.                                         We took him to the gymnasium area and I

               left and went back onto the field.                                                                1^ saw a Police Officer pull a

           _ «imall boy from out of the terracing/who appeared to be dead.                                                                    They

HpCi           gave him the kiss of life,                                        but it/was no good and they l^gft him lying

               on the g r o u n d .          I then helped t</ carry one of the dead persons,                                                      a man

                hoes.     His face was coveredy/so I never saw him enough to be able to

               recongnise him, only his clothing.                                                                I c a n ’t remember what he was

               wearing on the top part of his body.                                                                I think the small   10 yrs old boy

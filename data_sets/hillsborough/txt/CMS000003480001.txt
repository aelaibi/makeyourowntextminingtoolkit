D ear Professor Scraton

Thank you for your letter o f 9 M arch, enclosing copies o f your submission to L ord Justice Stuart-
Smith's enquiry, your unpublished article on the H illsborough Disaster, and y o u r recent briefing
paper for M erseyside M P's w hich I have read w ith interest.

As the H om e Secretary explained in the H ouse, one o f our first concerns on taking office last year
was to ensure that there should be a thorough and independent investigation o f any m aterial w hich
cast dou b t on earlier findings about the Disaster, and it was to this end that L ord Justice Stuart-
Sm ith was asked to conduct his scrutiny.

His report is com prehensive and sets out clearly the m atters he has considered and the reasons for
his conclusions. H e has considered all the material allegations about missing o r concealed videotape
evidence, the alleged interference w ith witnesses and witness statem ents and concerns about the
use o f th e 3.15pm cu t-o ff tim e at the Inquest.

As far as the legal processes following the Disaster are concerned, the H om e Secretary has indicated
that he shares the sentiments expressed by the Lord Justice Stuart-Sm ith in C hapter 7 o f his R ep o rt
w hen he says:

        "J understand the dismay that they (the families) have that no individual has personally
        been held to account either in a criminal court, disciplinary proceedings, or even to the extent
        o f losing their job. "




                        U K PRESIDENCY OF THE EUROPEAN U N IO N
T h ere are profound shortcom ings in the present police discipline system w hich w e in ten d to
address. In January, die H om e Affairs Select C om m ittee published some im portant
recom mendations about the police complaints and discipline procedures. T h e H om e Secretary has
recently announced his response to th e H A C recom m endations including his intention to reduce
th e stan d ard o f p ro o f to the civil standard in discipline procedures and to rem ove th e existing
double jeopardy provision w hich restricts crim inal disciplinary action on the same facts. H e has
also endorsed the C om m ittee's recom m endation that police forces should show greater
com m itm ent to their pow ers to verify claims o f sickness and disability and, w here appropriate, to
postpone a request to retire on ill health grounds until th e com pletion o f disciplinary proceedings.

T he H om e Secretary has also indicated his support for L ord Justice Stuart-Sm ith's endorsem ent o f
th e findings o f a H om e Office W orking Party, published in M arch 1997, that the role o f the
coroner after a public inquiry should be limited. T he m ain change proposed by the W orking Party
was to relieve coroners o f the need to resum e their inquest after an inquiry has been com pleted.
If this had been in place at the tim e o f the H illsborough Disaster, it w ould have spared the families
o f those w ho died unnecessary distress w hen die Taylor Inquiry had covered substantially the same
g ro un d as the Inquest.

W ith regard to th e changes w hich w ere m ade to police statem ents, L ord Justice Stuart-Sm ith
explains the reasons for his conclusions in some detail in his report. H e says:

        "J am quite satisfied that Lord Taylor's Inquiry was not in any way inhibited or impeded
        by what happened." (p.106, para 23)

        "J am also satisfied that the exclusion o f these comments did not affect the outcome o f the
        Inquests, or the decision by the Director o f Public Prosecutions not to bring criminal
        charges...I do not consider that there is any question o f misconduct either by the solicitor who
        gave the police advice upon the statements or by the police officers who suggested alterations
        to the statements unthout referring the statement to the solicitors." (p l0 7 , para 24)

T h e H om e Secretary indicated on 18 February that he was placing in the H ouse o f C om m ons
Library statements made by police officers about the events o f the day. I understand that copies o f
all original and am ended police statements have also been sent to the H illsborough Family Support
G roup.

Y ours sincerely

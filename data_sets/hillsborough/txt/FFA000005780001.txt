     recommendations about the Jneeds of                                                     crowd control and safety at
     sports grounds,       pending cpnpletion of the Final Report of the
     inquiry.     Other parties will no doubt be making detailed
     sutnissions to the Inquiry as                                                       to the events on^lS _ Ap^Ll 198&

     submissions on such mtters                                                    are    limited to thoae relevant to
     general     interim recommendations.



     2.       The FA   (and the Football League)                                                 are concerned that        the
    public can be reassured that during the next football season
     (which begins on /Ip August                                                  1989)     spectators can attend football
    matches      in reasonable safety in spite of the horrific breakdown
          crwi    safety which occurred at Hillsborough both inside,                                                       and
          a   lesser extent outside,                                                   the ground on the day of the
    tragedy.     It is assumed that the                                                    Inquiry will wish to mate
    interim reoaisaendations necessary for that purpose.                                                       Thsne are
    however many important general                                                      issues such as the retention or
    appropriate design of perimeter fencing,                                                      the appropriate design or
    division of terracing,                            the desirability and practicability of all-
    seater stadia,      the relevance of                                                  Identity cards under a national
    memltership scheme and difficulties caused by alcohol abuse and
    late arrival of spectators,                                               on which vataafala: and ■gelnvgint*

             t        next football         seasonf


                  4. As the disaster occurred at one of the big football events
                 of the         year and involved a failure to control a large and                  eager
                 crcwa,     it may be of assistance to the Inquiry to knew the big
                 matches which are          likely to occur prior toJanuary            1 1990. A
                 list of such matches,            based on expectation     of an attendance         of
d   1a<m #       75% capacity afe°°«*«~gfrainri,.uaf j oane       than 30,000 spectators,      appears

                                                                  ^    txJ9& * W S ?
                 [ Appendix 2        sets out relevant references to the evidence
                 supporting the prepositions in each paragraph below ]



             15. The        cause of the disaster was          the failure to close off the
                 mouth of the        tunnel by about 2.45 pm when Pens          3 and 4          of the
                 Leppings Lane       terraces were up to or           near safe capacity. Bad
                 that been done,        fans could not      have crowded down the tunnel
                 causing gross       overcrowding ofPens      3     and 4 and the deaths of
      0 im m y        of those already in the pens                and sane of those crcwding
         * down,          if the tunnel had been closed             off in proper     time,   the
             many other events which have given rise to criticism                        would      have
             taken place without disaster and indeed without                   significant
             overcrowding,         since the evidence      indicates that the numbers of
             spectators which entered the Leppings Lane End,                   including these
         who entered through the gates or got in illicitly without
         tickets,, did not or did not significantly exceed tha capacity of
         the west and north sides of the ground.                Pat another way,      tha
         tragedy occurred because of         crcwS distribution within the west end
         of the ground,     not because      of excessive nutters
  t&t*' ground.



         6.    The evidence is overwhelming that the            responsibility for
         preventing overcrowding of the central pens had been tmderfeatert by
■ Wk    tha police,     and that the cause of the disaster was acxxjrfingly a
  Mk    failure in     policing.    Tha police/        including the South YorteMr©
        Police,    in general do a magnificent job in managing                football
        crwds      week in and weeK out throughout the season at a very
        considerable ccmmitinent of officers ’ time and police »»ou»ses                   in

 P      general.    Everyone concerned with football must be grateful to them
        for their willingness        (and,   despite Hillsborough,      their continued
        willingness)   to police      football matches and allow spectators to
        enjoy themselves     in passionate support of their team.             Moat of the
        officers of all     ranks of the South Yorkshire Police who have
       ^given evidence have shewn         impressive character and professionalism.



        7. !There is general agreement             that the decision    of Stapt Marshall
        to demand the opening of the               gates at LappingsL a m   End was
        correct in view of the risk               of   injury outside   the ground. Only
                         appeared     (wrongly)    to blame .himself     for that
        decision. The actions       to be taken inside the ground           if the gates
        were to be opened were not supt Marshall’s responsibility,                  but
        that of the Police Conmander.



       8.     The police have      led ntuch evidence of misbehaviour by Liverpool
  I    fans ♦ Clearly much beer was drunk before the match and it was a
       hot spring day.     There     is no doubt that the situation outside the
       Leppings Lane Turnstiles by 2.40 was being made move difficult




                                                  3
  for the police b% a       fair mater      of fans who w®r© unruly and
 imreasonable fran having drunk too much,           and a mrnnbsr who had
 no    tickets and were making iuore or less active          attempts to gain
 entry or assist fellow non-ticketholders to do so,[[as                wall     as
 fans confused, toy the inconsistent ticket and turnstile codingsTJ
 The position was made worse by crowd hysteria (in a £om which
 this esqserifiiiaad. police force had not previously experienced) m
 the tiro      for Kick off   approached.    Nevertheless the     fans who
 misbehaved were      to be nattered in       hundreds,not thousand© i       perhaps
 5% at most of        Liverpool fans who      attended, while there    is     no
 evidence that the other 95% misbehaved in any my,                 other than
 verbally expressing      frustration at the crushing and         lad? of
 progress outside or their confusion at the ticket markings. Tha
 real cause of difficulty for   the police was not hooliganism or
 misconduct bat a problem    of numbers of supporters, with^ tlcfc&fca,
 flooding into the Lappings Lane         area in the half hair before
 kick off      in orderto see the game which they          had    paid to see
 and   the inability of     the turnstiles to cope with such numbers.

 9. ^The video of the 1980 said          final shews a similar but smaller
crowd Mild      up between about    2,40     and 2.50pm,   diminishing
thereafter.) Given the      lade of Liverpool supporters visible in
their seats, or on the flank terraces at the tappings Lane End
toy 2.30 pm in    1989, a      greaterbuild up in the final half              hair

(
ms   almost inevitable.        ^       &*•«»<          <■*>



10.    The Police caranander did       not consider delaying the kick off
(until far too late)      because of    a police preconception that the
kick off should       not be delayed if       fans had no excuse for         late
arrival,    The conversation between the Police taraander and
           at about   2.30 reflected this.    A decision    to delay the
Mdc     off for fifteen minutes announced at 2.30 mild             probably
have    relieved the frustration of     the crowd which m s         building vp,
prevented the hysteria to get       in which developed,          and enabled
            tha turnstiles to work faster.           It is to fact likely that the
           kick off would have had to be delayed by up to half an hour
           to allow the whole crowd in.



           11.    The division of tbs Leppings Lane Terrace by radial fences
           was a system appropriate for use by opposing fans of different
           parts of the terrace or convenient management of a limited crowd
           by filling one or more pens on             the terrace. In such situations
           it promoted the safety of         the spectators by preventing groups of
           fans having excessive space to run in or possibly preventing
1   3
           horizontal surges     in the crowd.. it almost certainly enabled the
           police     to reduce their manpower camnitrnent at the Lepplngs Lane
           End for league matches.



           12. For the three serai-finals of 1987-9, however, which were
           known in advance to be all ticket sell-outs at     least at that
           end of     the ground,     the police formed the view that the fans
           would find their      own level on the terraces.       Incontrast to
           league games they made no provision in their operations orders
           for specific      responsibility in checking the level        of the known
           favourite pens     (3 and 4),     for      directing the crawl away from
        Jfcthem or       closing the tunnel entrance before they became too
    ^«t*^£ull, or for cocsnunication between officers charged with these
     '-^auties.  instead they tailed on general monitoring by officers in
          the vicinity including the Police           Control Box.   In retrospect      it
           can   be   seen   that it was essential to have express          provision     in
         / the   operation orders     to cover these matters.     Fans    were not   in
          fact able to find a          comfortable   level in all areas of Pens         3
          and 4 because tha lack of gates             in the radial fences     (save at
                 top) prevented lateral escape.        The situation in local areas
          of the terraces appears         (can the evidence now available)      to have
          been uncomfortable     in    1987 and 1988 (although   the      1988 blade and
          white photograph of the terrace during the match (Exhibit 68J
          ahow3 a tight but not obviously uncomfortable crowd). There may
        have been    wescmwding     in Pena    3 and 4 in 1989 before Gate C
        ws^®^op«ed     for the first timet at        2,47 pm:       at any          they
       would have become gradually        overcrowded even without the two m s s
       entries of     fans   through Gate C,      while Pens    5 and 6 remained
       carparatively empty,



       13-    2ha configuration of    the West      stand and Terrace presents an
       obvious problem of ciiowd management. crowding on a terrace cannot
       be observed, f r m    the top or back       of     that terrace, let alone
       through a concrete stand:       Pens   3    and    4 could ally be     observed
       ft®      the West stand, the perimeter track or the Police Control
       Box    (or indeed,    as the photograph exhibited late in the Inquiry
       shows,     fete top of the North Stand). closure of entrances could
       only be achieved from behind the West Stand, where obviously
       officers were out of sight of the observers, Despite the views
       expressed in evidence by the Police Commander,                it was
       hazardous to    leave such a matter         to    the initiative of    local
  %/^f£icars.



       14,                              who was         in charge of the donoo«rser
      behind the Wtest Stand and the turnstiles,              was    concerned to
      enquire at the Police control Box            on the morning of the match
Ipl   as     to the method of filling of          the terraces which was to be
      employed,    toeing told by '                  that the fans would be left
      to find their own level.                             , aware that the tunnel
      had had to be closM         the previous year, The                       which he
      expected to be        informed that the pens were full and ^the tunnel
      needed to be     closed were however haphazard. It is submitted that
      it was     for the Police control Box or other officers to ensure
                        v>' ■    ; was informed when the tunnel required to
      be closed,     not his responsibility to seek such information,
      particularly when      he had taken care to enquire as to the iwathod
      to be used.
              15,   It will be       recalled that'                !gave evidence that frctn
              his position          in the West    Stand above Pens 3 and    4 at    about 3
              pa         ha saw a   "river of people"   flowing down Pen 3.     It   is
              submitted that this evidence         assists    in assessing the result of
              the opening ofGate 3 for             the second tism at 2,53 with tbs
              entrance to the        tunnel uncontrolled.    The entry m    masse fron
              above of a      large number of      eager spectators would obviously have
§€>5^“        created intolerable       crushing   in that Pen, $hile the    absence of
0 pitf       |»rHieter fencing would have  allwad the crowd to spill out onto
              the pitch and notremain crushed in the pens,  it is suggested
 ■ jjjj|     that even in tiae       absence of perimeter fencing there mild     vary

              16.   In the event,      as everyone knows*     the spectators were crushed
             together and against        the perimeter wire     for a considerable time.
             Casualties must        have been very greatly reduced had the perimeter
             gates teen      larger or/the radial fences been absent or hrdten by
             gates or gaps at         the bottom comer       of the pans.



             Particular Issues.



             ■Serraces


              17. ttere is obviously increased danger of crushing in a narrow
             pen such as Leppings Lane Pens 3 said 4 which has its sole or
           s-jn&in entrance at the top with lateral fences with nobottcm
           . gates, and with spectators miking down to the entrance at the
             top of the terrace rather than having to climb (as for instance
             they do at the Keg> end). Terraces of course vary in their
             configuration and the position of their entrances. Itesmiendatians
    appropriate for a            terrace such as Leppings Lane may for instance
    be different to those appropriate for the Kcp.



    18.     It must be         rendered that          for many years police officers or
    stewards have monitored the crowding in a terrace by eye or by
   walking through the terrace and have acted accordingly to control
   overcrowding.          Granted that spectators may have accepted &                 leved. of
   crcwding which an outsider would consider uncomfortable                      (probably a
   tighter level of crowding thirty years ago than they do today) ,
   this system seems to have been generally                         successful in
   preventing crushing.



   19.      The Sbotball Association consider that it is                  necessary     ponding
   the      Final Report of the inquiry to recommend an overall reduction
   in the numbers of spectators allowed on terraces. We                        stress that
   we have not been able to consult League Clubs and there m y
   turn out to be             terraces at manyLeague grounds which are                  plainly
   safe and the permitted capacities of which are not                        in any way
   excessive. The evidence in Phase                    I of the Inquiry     (which is of
   course    particular to Hillsborough)                   does however indicate that the
   permitted capacity of the Leppings Lane Terraces was not                           reduced
          accordance with the Green Guide                   to allow for changes in the

  20.         T or       these reasons we        invite the Inquiry to make an
  interim recommendation that Licensing Authorities consider a                         20%
  reduction in permitted terrace capacities subject to local
  conditions. Wte say "subject to                  local conditions" because there are
  probably many Licensing Authorities who have proceeded in a
  different way to the Licensing Authority for Hillsborough. For /

           instance, where lower densities have already been applied to a
           terrace   in the safety certificate, or very wide gates have been
           required      in     any perimeter fencing,    it seems likely that the
          Licensing Authority lias already applied its mind to                 particular
          problems       of     that terrace and that no further reduction         (or     less
          than the standard recormended 20%)              is necessary^ reassure spectators
     /    of their reasonable safety.



     (    21.     Fk    Rule    24(1) (b) makes clubs   responsible for ensuring inter
          alia that no spectator ispermitted to encroach onto the                        pitch
          and Rule 24 (ii) makes any failure to discharge its responsibility
 <7 I^ cot:3& 1ct subject to the defence of no control and all due
     . diligence.         Clause D2 of the 1985 Memorandum            (Carmen Bundle page
          296)    is an extension of this.         The FA will make clear to all
          clubs that no disciplinary action will be taken if spectators are
          temporarily allowed          onto the pitch because of fear        of overcrowding
          (which might taken           literally be a breach of       Rule   24(i)(b))    and
          will    consider whether the Rule should formally be amended. This
          will    of course leave open tha possibility of disciplinary
         proceedings       for having allowed any overcrowding to develop in the
     ■j^first place.           There is evidence that     in spite of the wording of
         clause        I 1 of    the   1985 memorandum no club has in        fact been
0^       disciplined merely for failure to              inplement a precaution in the
         Memorandum and the FA will take the opportunity of clarifying
f        this to clubs.



         Perimeter Fencing


         22,     Tfoere have been moments         during the course of the Inquiry
         when one or other party appears            to have treated crowd safety and
         crowd    control as       two separate matters     and has    suggested that
         perimeter fencing is concerned with control and not safety,                     in
         fact safety and control of spectators are not divisible in the
         context of football matches. Perimeter fences have not been
     erected (and often Insisted upon by the m)               in o«3er to keep
     the            l^utiful, They are there to prevent overexcited or
     malevolent fans     frcm proceeding onto the pitch to challenge rival
     fans    (an invitation to tattle which        is likely to be accepted)        or
     to       attack players or officials. Experience lias shown that if
     fans     get onto the wide expanse o£       the pitch -in order to indulge
     in violence it      is very difficult for the          police to control than
     and     that   (as with any crowd)     the violence     can be contagious.    In
     extreroe cases this can lead to very serious incidents such as
     the pitched battle at Birmingham in           1985 ’            ; Final report)




                                                                                         & 6

     occurred at     the Cup Final

                                                "benign"    crowd invasion,
                                      in 1989, may only require one or two
                                                                              such as


     fights to be picked for general violence to develop,               particularly
    when drink has teen taken.            It will be    recalled that the
     requirement for a barrier to protect the playing area frcm
     invasion is not     just a   requirement of       the SS,,tat is stressed by
    UEFA.



    23.     For these   reasons the FA believes        that perimeter fencing will
    continue to be necessary at many grounds. The appropriate desi^i
    £or such fencing will be         an    important     matter for Phase II of

*   the     Inquiry and the EA has
    in France*
                                          already inspected a collapsible system




    24.    The Inquiry will be aware in general terns of the National
    ^tembership Scheme provided in the Football            Spectators Bill 1989.
    It    is generally assumed that any such scheme will have to
    involve the presentation at       the turnstile by a spectator to a
    computerised machine of an identification card.            Such a procedure
    is bound to      increase delay at      turnstiles and argments     have been
               raised that such a                    schema would have      increased the problems at
              Hillsborough.                   In view of thepolitical        issues involved# it        is
              respectfully suggested that                     it should      be made clear    in the
              Interim Report (if it is the                         inquiry's intention) that these
              matters, will be considered in                       Phase II and that none Of the
              interim recarmnendations are to                      be read as favouring       (or
              dismissing)              the scheme.

          ^pployed by Manchester United FC at the Liverpool v Nottingham
          i^rest BA Cup semi-final replay on 7 May at                               Old Trafford     (whicfF*            f
          has similar fencing                       to Hillsborough all       round the perimeter)      in
          order to allay                        fears of spectators      in the aftermath of the                       *J
      „ disaster.                 (The match appears to have gone well although attendance
      *       was below full capacity)                                                        ^     ^


          (iii)          the police must clearly stress                   in their operation orders
          for matches                  thenecessity for awareness            of possible crowd      distress
          and response                  in       opening perimeter gates if overcrwding is
          anticipated.                It        is essential that there is a       sufficient police or
          steward presence                       on the perimeter track for this purpose.           We have
         already oomented        (paragraph 12 above) on the need for specific
         provision in operations orders to ensure proper casraunication
         between those monitoring crowding and those inposition                        toclose
         the relevant entrances.



         (iv)    to allay any instinctive fears o£ spectators as a result of
         the milstorough tragepy,          it should be a requireaaent for any club
         where perirneter fencirjg is in use to ke&p at least one pair of
         bolt cutters       (adequate to    cut that fencing)      at the ground at a
         location known to th l        police* The argument that             if you need bolt
         cutters you should npt have perimeter fencing is logical,                        but
         this reccasnendation ils        not based on any view          that    the bolt
         cutters will in facJ be needed.



         (v)    it is apparent that        improvements are needed in the medical *~1*~
         care available to spectators. While the EA are not experts in
         the detail of equipment needed,             it is submitted that the
        following would,       In general       tents,   be appropriates

& ***
             (a) every club should have a designated first aid room with a
        sink,    a work top,     preferably two beds with curtains,               a stocked
        cabinet,   power,     light,   water,     a direct telephone^ Ibd reasonably
 »      close access for emergency vehicles.              Stretchers,    a     carrying chair
        and oxygen should be available during matches.                  One person at the
        dub     should expressly be made          responsible for upkeep of the first
        aid room and facilities.


             (b) a doctor should be present fran a reasonable time before
        all matches.    There is no        reason Why the doctor should not,                at
        typical League matches          with    small crcw2sf bethereas        cover        for
        both spectators and players,            since players are far more likely to
        be   injured than spectators. He           stiould however be        located so as
        to be available for both.          At matches with larger attendances,                   it
       will be ag$>ropriafce to have two doctors available,                         or & separata <
       doctor specifically available for spectators.                                                      f
        (c) for all matches with an anticipated attendance of ever 5,000
       spectators^ at         least one fully         equipped, antoalance should          be in
      attendance, For big matches two ambulances                        and a foot team         of
      airtoulare|ten should b* available                                   '_~L{


           (d) the above        is intended to be             in addition to,         and not to
      be     in substitution for,          the services presently supplied by the
      St.     John's Ambulance Brigade or the                 like      at snatches.



e>    (vi)       On© m y       have sp^athy with          the general police approach and
      apparent prior agreement of Supt Murray and the Police Ccranander,
      evidenced in their conversation at about 2.30 pm,                            to the effect
      that     if fans    choose to drink in puts                and tom       up late at the
      ground    in large nutters they should expect to irdas part of the
      match    and not     to have the kick off delayed for their benefit to
      the    inconvenience of those fans who                  have taken the trouble to
      turn    up early,       it m y   well be        that     that principle could have
     teen     applied    at    the Penistone Road end without earning a                     crush
     situation,     since there        is no      bottleneck at that end of              tha
^i^ground.       *. Nevertheless,,     as                               : observed,    the safety
fj|:; the        cnowa has to be the              criterion for delaying kick-offs, and
     it is      regrettable that the Police              Ccmnander never considered this
     option     until    it was too late.        It     is     submitted        that the Md c
     off should be delayed if the police                      anticipate a         eomlderabla
     accumulation of          fans at turnstiles        shortly before         kick- off for
     whatever    cause, If       the police           consider that there say be
     consequent difficulty in crowd                   control.        The addition of    the'        ’*
     proviso    is necessary to             prevent    late fans having any confidence
     that the match will be delayed for their convenience,

29.                   nd^understanding     the Fh and consequent failure
to- proVJSe pre-match entertainment is regretted,        but the Inquiry
will have noted that the tie was          advertised in Liverpool as
having pre-match entertainment.     The                       therefore
have influenced the time        of arrival of Liverpool fans,    although
same fans who arrived early may havebeen disappointed.          No such
evidence has been given        and the view     at Watford PC that pre-
atatch entertainment does      not materially    influence time of arrival
may well be correct.

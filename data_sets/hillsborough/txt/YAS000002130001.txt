                              states:-


1.   Date of birth is over 21


2.   My occupation is a Qualified Ambulanceman SYMAS.


3.   I    started    in     the    Ambulance     Service     with     Sheffield       at
      Corporation Street 1966.


4.   During my service I have attended a six week block course on
      ambulance aid at Cleckheaton Training School and thereafter
      various refresher courses.               I have attended the Markfield
^    Training Centre in Leicester on about three occasions.                         From
      attending the courses I am qualified to Miller standards.                            I
     am stationed at Longley Ambulance Station at Sheffield 5.


5.   In   addition     to   the     ordinary     ambulance      training,     part    of
     which    covers      major     incidents,    there    is    also   a manual       on
     station giving procedures for such incidents.                      To the rear
     of each SYMAS identity card there is a brief check list for
      "First on scene vehicles"             at such incidents.              SYMAS    also
     holds    "Dry     run"       mock   incidents   which      are   not    disclosed
     beforehand to test response.    I have been involved in one
                                                    To
      which was about two years ago.   I was      duty and provided
                                             A A.     I
^    back up cover for admissions and emergency calls whilst
^    other crews were on the "Dry run".


6.   On Saturday 15th April 1989 I arrived for duty and booked in
     at Longley Station.             The vehicle allocated was Sierra 407.
     I was on duty that day with Qualified Ambulance woman
     ______ who was my            attendant.      We did the usual checks on
     the vehicle       itself and its equipment and then waited                      for
     calls.    On Saturday we were using the non-emergency channel
     for Sheffield and Doncaster on vehicle radio.


7.   As far as I can recall we were asked to do an admission to
       St. Luke, a discharge from Hallamshire and King Edwards non­
       urgent                         work.     We were busy with non-emergency
      calls until about 1300 hours when we returned to station.
      After       lunch we      dropped       off    a    discharge      patient     from    the
      Royal Hallamshire and then confirmed to Control that we were
      clear.          We were told to return to station.


8.    At        the   junction       of   Longley        Lane           Herries      Drive    we
      received a call from Control..                           _    _                       "^he   aa

      This was a red call so we had to proceed at speed and put on
      the liqhts and sirens.                 fcaCjeare-_»a— sgteg i w e r e - ^ t 5 l d



      I     drove      via    Herries       Drive,       Herries      Road   and    came    down
      Leppings Lane, turning left into the ground.                            On arrival at
      the ground entrance/there was a cordon of ltrt5t>u~fci«-fahrGO deep
      Police Officersya^ I recall there were about                             four mounted
      Officers in addition.


10.   I drove         towards   the Leppings         Lane entrance to the ground
      where       there was         a temporary barrier ,across , the               entrance.
™     The crowd/'appeared normal for a Saturday match.                             I informed
      the Police Officers that I had been told to attend and asked
      them what the incident was.                    I did not actually receive a
      reply but the Officers at the barrier moved it enough for me
      to get the ambulance into/^the ground.                           I did not see any
      other ambulances              there and presumed we were the                   first on
      site.


11.   As we entered the ground there did not appear to be anything
      out of the ordinary.                  In the immediate area (3eo plan arsa—
      A60       it was    fairly quiet and it appeared to me                        that most
       people were actually in the ground.                           As I recall              got
       out of the left side of the vehicle and was walking to the
       rear.       I got out of the vehicle and asked people what was
       happening.          There was a girl holding her chest and abdomen
       supported by a young man.                   I assisted her into the ambulance
       and at that time I noticed a sudden wave of people coming
       from the direction of the ground.                            I do not know exactly
       where they came from but
                             byt they appeared to come from the left

12.    The casualties appeared/^-hoaded for open space.                              Some were
      put on the floor.                   There was a large male casualty who was
       loaded into the vehicle.                   The man was revived and he left of
      his own accord.             I realised at this time that there were far
      more seriously injured than those around us.

      this location which appeared to be the requirement at that
      time.


?4.   I took the cots out of the rear of the vehicle.                            A number of
      people including a uniformed police officer brought a young
      male casualty and placed him on one cot.                               I carried out a
      quick check and he appeared not to be breathing.                               I grabbed
       in airway from the vehicle and inserted this and gave him a
        ew prngwmr with the bag and mask which revived him.                             He was
      put on the vehicle with the bag and mask and the police
      officer as escort.                  The next thing I recall was that a small
      child      casualty        of       about   10   was    brought    out    to   me.      He
      appeared        to    be   worth       giving    treatment       to.      An   off   duty
      doctor appeared and he dealt with a number of casualties
       evaluating whether they were dead or worth treating.

15.    The child was placed on the second cot and placed in the
      vehicle and I continued to work on him.                                             I then asked the
      police where my attendant was.

      straight away.                The casualty department was already busy at
      that time.          The medical team needed an anaesthetist but he
      was not available at that moment.                                                         and I loaded
      the teams equipment into the vehicle.                                         There was a short
      delay       waiting           for      the        a^a.^^^t^etist^ ^nci^ ^ ^ t p j O the

South and up Penistone Roac^esu'vnA/t^^k>CLoh_nJ~


Ambulances for casualties were lined up and I saw Station
Officer Eason who I knew from Longley Station.                                  He directed
me to the gym entrance.


The    doctors          who    we    carried    got       out    just    inside       the     gym
entrance to the ground.                   They made their way onto the pitch.
I left the vehicle and followed them carrying the equipment
from the ambulance.


I   saw   a   fire        officer        on   the    pitch       and    left    the    box    of
equipment on the pitch nearby so that I could return to my
vehicle.           On    the    pitch        I saw   a     line of       police       officers
across and I could not see beyond them.                               At our side of the
line of police (the Spion Kop) there were hundreds of fans
stood around.             I returned to my vehicle near the Penistone
Road     entrance.             I was     approached         by    a    number    of    police
officers      and       a man       in   a    grey    track       suit   who     identified
himself       as    a     Nottinghamshire            Ambulanceman          acting        as    a
steward for the Nottingham Forrest supporters.


The    police       said       they      wanted      an     ambulance      on the        pitch
straight away.            The man in the grey track suit said he would
show me the way onto the pitch.                           He sat in the front,
           was in the back and I was driving and drove onto the
pitch.


I had difficulty in driving through the entrance and caught
the rubbing strip on the side of the vehicle on the railing.
The nearside mirror was pushed out                          of line.           I then drove
onto the pitch.               We parked a short way onto the pitch by a
casualty       who       was        already     on    a     trolley       and had        been
intubated.
He was picked up by people nearby and we off loaded one
trolley from the vehicle to make room for him and he was
loaded in with a doctor.               There were also two people with
him.     I then left the pitch via Penistone Road.                      On leaving
I was checked out by an Ambulance Officer who took details
of call sign, patient numbers and destinat^n^^^fe, left
ground     heading     for    the    Northern      General^        At   this    time
traffic was a bit heavy with supporters leaving.                        On arrival
at Northern General we transferred him to a hospital trolley
and the doctor stayed with him. We returned to the ground
and gave a lift back to two people who had accompanied the
casualty    and   also       two    other    people   who    had    been   in   the
casualty department at the hospital.


We were told by Control to return to Penistone Road and were
directed to the front of the queue and told to keep to the
left side by Station Officer Eason.                   Because of an oncoming
vehicle I ended up in the way of the other vehicle on the
road and was ushered into the main entrance.                        We unloaded
the    trolleys   and               took    them   towards   the    ground.       I
stayed with the vehicle.             I waited for 20 minutes inside the
Penistone Road entrance.              I received a message from Control
asking my location.           I told them my location and that I was
without trolleys.            They said it was a request from Sierra
403 asking my location.


At this time I was single handed.                   Control relayed that to
my Attendant                          who was now on vehicle 403.                 I
informed the incident officer of my position and he produced
an off duty o f f i c e r w h o                     became my attendant.


I   went   back   to     my    vehicle       with                  and     shortly
afterwards Deputy Chief Ambulance Officer Hopkins and David
Jones requested all vehicles to form a fleet near to the
rear of the gym.         As far as I can recall the time would be
after 1730 hours.
    Jones asked everyone in the group what shifts they were on.
    We     were    told   that    the      Coroner      wanted   all   bodies    at   one
    location, which was the gym.


    We took a further break and then were told that there were
    about twelve bodies at the Northern General and one at the
    Royal Hallamshire.            He sent four vehicles for the twelve and
    he instructed                     and I to go to the Hallamshire where
    we were to contact a police sergeant and to convey one body
    back to the gym with the sergeant.



4   On arrival at the Hallamshire there was a delay.
    informed of this by the Police Sergeant from Rotherham.
    took the opportunity to clean the suction equipment and my
                                                                                We were
                                                                                        I


    airway equipment.            After about 20 minutes the body was ready
    for collection.            We loaded the body onto the vehicle and
    returned to the ground informing Control we were leaving.


    On arrival at the Penistone Road entrance we were informed
    that the press were in adjacent buildings with cameras and
    that    to avoid      them we       should     reverse       in under   the North
    Stand.        The body was then off loaded and taken into the gym.



&   I was then informed by an Officer that there were two more
    deceased at Hallamshire and to attend and bring them back.
    Control was informed and we left for the Hallamshire with
    two Police Officers for each body.                    On arriving at the Royal
    Hallamshire for the second occasion it turned out that the
    two    in     question     were   in    fact     on   intensive    care     and   not
    deceased.        We told Control who told us to return to station
    and    on     route   we   dropped      the    two    police   officers      at   the
    Hillsborugh ground.


    On arrival at the station we refueled the vehicle and noted
    in the log that it need rekitting.                      I then signed off at

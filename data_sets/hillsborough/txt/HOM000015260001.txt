                                 FOOTBALL AUTHORITIES



         Mr Michael F o rsy th MP, Scotland's Sports M inister, today met
 re p re se n ta tiv e s of the Scottish Football Association and the Scottish
 Football League to discuss c u rre n t p ractice on sp o rts ground safety , and
 the question of a ll-se a te r stadia in Scotland.


      In a m eeting in E dinburgh with Mr Ernie Walker, SFA S ecretary ,
 Mr James F a rry , SFL S e c re tary , and Mr David McLaren, SFA Security
 A dviser, Mr F o rsy th sought assu ran ces th at the v o lu n tary code set out in
 the Governm ent's Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (th e Green Guide)
 was being fully o b serv ed. He asked fo r th e ir views on how the Guide -
 which deals among o th er th in g s with c ru sh b a rrie rs , fire safety , and
 crowd control - might be im proved.


       Mr F o rsy th s a id :-

       "I have been encouraged to h e a r what m easures a re being taken b y
       the football au th o rities to review sa fety provisions a t grounds in
       Scotland, including the review of firs t aid b eing carried out b y the
       SFA medical committee.

       "I fully recognise th a t the clubs them selves are b e st placed to
       e n su re th a t all n e ce ssa ry ste p s are tak en to provide fo r the safety
       of sp e c ta to rs. T hat is why I w anted to h e a r from th e governing
       bodies of football th e ir suggestions about what needs to be done to
       help b rin g about improvem ents.
     "I also raised the issue of a ll-se a te r stad ia.                   In view of the
     p ro g re ss alread y made in Scotland, and confirmation today from the
     football au th o rities th a t th is is the rig h t way to go, I wanted to
     explore what advantages th ere might be in in creasin g the num bers of
     a ll-se a te r g ro u n d s, in th e in te re sts p a rticu la rly of crowd sa fety and
     se c u rity .


     "I have th ere fo re ask ed th e football au th o rities to come back with
     th e ir ideas on the b e st way forw ard, tak in g into account safety
     considerations. T hey have u n d ertak en to do th a t.


     "In addition, we discussed the need for- effective- liaison between the
     clubs, and th e em ergency services (including firs t aid) a t big
     m atches."

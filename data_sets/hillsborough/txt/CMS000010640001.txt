HOC 11/90   -   FINAL REPORT ON THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER


Further to Mr Bilbe's recent note, I am writing to advise that
it is likely that the circular will not be available to R & D
until the early part of next week.

In the meantime I have attached Annexes A and B in order that
copies may be made in advance of the circular. The annexes
will in due course require stapling to the circular.

As you can see from the Instructions sheet, there are 490
copies for circulation.  I have attached the address lists for
those not contained on galleys. However I would be grateful
if you could provide 650 copies of the circular and annexes,
the remaining 160 being returned to me for our own use.

I will arrange for 490 copies of the report to be delivered to
R & D on Monday 5 February.

Your assistance in this matter is greatly appreciated.

HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY ! PINAL REPORT



As you are probably aware the Final report of the Hillsborough
Inquiry has now been published. Within the next few days we will
be requesting a speedy issue of a Home Office Circular to local
authorities, police etc on action to be taken in response to the
Report.   I would be grateful if you could prepare arrangements
geared to 1/2 February for the issue of the circular. Please let
me know if you anticipate any difficulty.

The circulation will be in similar numbers to HOC 68/1989 issued
on 4 August.   It would be helpful if you could kindly confirm
the number of copies of the circular distributed on that occasion
and provide a copy of the present list of galley numbers.

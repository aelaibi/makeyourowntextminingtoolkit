 048

 D^YOU   ASSIST ANYONE WHO WAS DEAD OR INJURED,    IF SO, BRIEFLY EXPLAIN.

NO


G17

G49

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR IN THE DEATHS, OR

THE INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 IT WAS A SHAMBLES FROM THE WORD GO.     THE POLICE WERE EVERYWHERE AROUND THE

 CITY BUT ONCE YOU GOT TO THE GROUND THERE WAS NO ONE AROywD.       THERE WERE

 NO SIGNS ANYWHERE TO TELL YOU WHERE TO GO, AND NOBODY JO DIRECT US.

G «

 SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

DID Y5U WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

I THINK SOME OF THE POLICE WERE ACTING LIKE CRIMINALS WHEN THEY PUSHED

THE FANS BACK INTO THE PENS

Q53

DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

AFTER THE MATCH WAS      STOPPED?

THERE WAS A PC WITH      A BEARD AND A YOUNG POLICEWOMAN WHO    WERE MARVELOUS,

BUT THE REST OF THE POLICE DIDNT SEEM TO BE DOING ANYTHING. / E V E N HALF AN

HOUR LATER MOST OF THE POLICE WERE WALKING AROUND DOING NOTHING.          THE

LIVERPOOL FANS WERE      DOING EVERYTHING TO HELP, THEY WERE    GETTING THE INJURED

F ^ p OUT AND GIVING     THEM FIRST AID. THERE WERE NO STEWARDS AROUND NO

ORGANISATION AT ALL INITIALLY THE POLICE WERE STANDING ON THE FENCE THROWING

PEOPLE BACK INTO THE PEN FROM WHERE THEY WERE STANDING THEY MUST HAVE SEEN

WHAT WAS HAPPENING.       THE TANNOY WASNT USED PROPERLY TO TELL PEOPLE WHAT

WAS GOING ON, IT COULD HAVE BEEN USED TO MORE EFFECT.

054

IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

I DIDNT SEE ANYBODY WHO WAS DRUNK AT ALL.          ALL THE PUBS WERE CLOSED.     THE

ATMOSPHERE WAS GREAT.          IT TOOK US AGES TO WALK DOWN TO THE GROUND, AND

T^PRE WERE COACH LOADS OF PEOPLE ARRIVING ALL THE TIME.          WE SHOULD HAVE HAD

THE BIGGER END OF THE GROUND.         THE GAME COULD ALSO HAVE BEEN DELAYED.

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR IN THE DEATHS,

 OR THE INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 THERE WAS A MAJOR CROWD PROBLEM WE WERE PACKED IN LIKE SARDINES I SAW

 POLICE AND PEOPLE ON THE PERIMETER FENCE FRANTICALLY URGING FANS AT THE BACK

 TO MOVE BACK.      BUT YOU COULDN’T IT WAS A BRICK WALL THERE THE BACK OF THE

 TERRACING.      I NOTICED RAILINGS GOING DOWN THE TERRACING TO THE PERIMETER

 FENCE.     THE ONLY GAP THROUGH IT WAS AT THE BACK.        AT THE HEIGHT OF THE

 CRUSH I SAW A POLICEMAN ASKING FANS TO COME THROUGH IT BUT IT WAS ONLY 3 ’
                                                                                 PAGE

WIDE, BUT THOUSANDS OF FANS COULDN’T GET THROUGH THAT.        IT WAS LIKE A CATTLE

PEN AT THAT END OF THE GROUND.        I NOTICED GREAT BIG GAPS AT THE KOP END OF

THE GROUND.     THE CHAP WHO WAS NEXT TO ME SAW EMPTY AREAS IN THE TWO END WINGS

OF THE LEPPINGS LANE END.       I AM NOW MORE CONVINCED THAN EVER THAT IF THOSE

RAILINGS GOING DOWN THE TERRACING TO THE FENCING AT THE TOUCHLINE HAD NOT

BEEN THERE OR HAD BEEN REMOVED ALTOGETHER THE CROWD WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO

SPREAD OUT A BIT MORE.       I ’M NOT SAYING IT WOULD HAVE STOPPED PEOPLE BEING

KILLED BUT IT WAS A MAJOR CONTRIBUTION TO THE DISASTER.        PERHAPS IT WOULDN’T

HAVE BEEN 95 DEAD.       THE PERIMETER FENCE AND THE RAILINGS GAVE IT A PEN

LIKE FEATURE AND IT BECAME LIKE A CAGE IN THE END.

G52

       YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

NO.

G53
DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

THE SERVICES WERE QUITE STRETCHED AND WERE TOTALLY INADEQUATE.          IT WAS

A TOKEN EFFORT, THEY DID N’T HAVE THE FACILITIES TO HANDLE THE SITUATION

THAT OCCURRED.       IT WAS ALSO CLEAR THE STADIUM DIDN ’T HAVE THE FACILITIES

TO HANDLE IT, A DISASTER OF THIS MAGNITUDE.        HAD IT NOT BEEN A TREMENDOUS

EFFORT OF THE FANS THE NUMBER OF DEAD WOULD HAVE BEEN HIGHER.        THE AMBULANCES

GOT INTO THE STADIUM BUT AT MOST ONLY THREE.        THE FIRE SERVICE,   I ASSUME,
                                                                                 PAGE    9

 MUST HAVE SUPPLIED WATER FOR FANS TO DRINK BECAUSE OF THE QUANTITY AVAILABLE.

 THE EMERGENCY SERVICES (ALL) WERE UNABLE TO COPE.         THEY WERE FRUSTRATED AND

 UPSET AT NOT BEING UNABLE TO DO MORE FOR THE FANS AND VICTIMS.        I SAW

 POLICE WITH THEIR TUNICS DISHEVELLED AND LOOKING SHATTERED.         THESE OFFICERS
                                                                       /
 THOUGH I SAY ONLY SOME, HAD PULLED THEIR TRIPE OUT IN HELPING THE FANS AND
                                                 C/°rT~
 VICTIMS.     BUT I ALSO SAW POLICE STANDING AROUND DOING NOTHLKiG.        I SAW POLICE

LINING THE NORTH STAND.       I ALSO SAW A HUGE LINE OF POLICE FORM ON THE CENTRE

LINE OF THE PITCH.   I STILL THINK MORE SHOULD AND COULD HAVE BEEN DONE BY
                                                         C o M
THESE OFFICERS THOUGH I'M NOT BLAMING THEM I ’M BLAMING THOSE IN POLICE

 AUTHORITY WHO COULD HAVE DEPLOYED THEM MORE IN THE RESCUE OF THE SUPPORTERS

T^pfRE WAS ENOUGH OF THEM IN THE STADIUM AT THAT TIME WHICH WAS /BOUT 3.35PM

 (1535),    IT WAS LEFT UP TO THE ORDINARY SUPPORTERS TO LEND A HAND.

054

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THERE WAS GOOD BEHAVIOUR ON THE COACH AND THERE WAS GOOD BEHAVIOUR AND GOOD

HUMOUR ALL AROUND.       I SAW NO VIOLENCE EVEN AFTER A TICKET TOUT HAD ASKED

 £30 FOR A £6 GROUND TICKET.     HE WASN'T    BEATEN UP BUT I SAW NO POLICEMEN

AROUND TO ARREST HIM EITHER.       I SAW NO FANS URINATING OVER THE POLICE.        I

SAW NO VIOLENCE AGAINST THE POLICE.          I SAW NO EVIDENCE OF DEAD FANS BEING

R^BED.       THE ONLY ISOLATED   INCIDENT      I SAW WAS A PHOTOTGRAPHER BEING

CHASED BY FANS HAVING BEEN FOUND TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS OF FANS BELONGINGS

STREWN ABOUT THE TERRACING.       I SAW ANGER AND FRUSTRATION POINTED/AIMED

 TOWARDS THE POLICE.     THE FANS WERE ANGRY AND FRUSTRATED.       THE WAY THE

 FOOTBALL AUTHORITIES AND THE OTHER AUTHORITIES ORGANISED US FOR THE

LEPPINGS LANE END.       I ALSO FEEL FRUSTRATION AT THE SOUTH YORKSHIRE

POLICE FOR NOT ORGANISING EVENTS PROPERLY.

Q20

 WE ARRIVED AT SHEFFIELD AT 1 O'CLOCK (1300).          ONE THING I NOTICED WAS ON

 THE ROAD LEADING TO THE GROUND THERE WAS MORE POLICE PERSONNEL DEPLOYED

 THAN WHAT THERE WAS OUTSIDE THE STADIUM.          THE POLICE WERE REGARDING THE

 FANS WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF EMNITY.         AS SOON AS YOU ARRIVED IN THE

 dfclNITY OF THE GROUND THEY CAME ON THE COACH AND ASKED PEOPLE TO LEAVE

CANS OF BEER BEHIND ON THE COACH AND NOT TAKE THEM TO THE GROUND, BUT THE

CANS OF BEER HAD ALREADY BEEN CONFISCATED BY THE LIVERPOOL POLICE BEFORE

LEAVING FOR SHEFFIELD.          THEY ALSO ASKED THE FANS TO LEAVE BANNERS AND

 FLAGS ON THE COACH.        THE ATTITUDE WAS CLEARLY THE SUPPORTERS COULD NOT BE

 TRUSTED WE WERE ALL VILLAINS AND CRIMINALS AS IT WERE.          THEY WERE MAKING

 SURE WE DIDN ’T MIX WITH THE SHEFFIELD PEOPLE A LOT AS WE GOT TO THE STADIUM

THERE WAS ONLY 4 POLICE OUTSIDE THE TURNSTILES OF B SECTION.           AS WE

 WERE ALSO SEARCHED BY OFFICERS, WE WERE ALSO SEARCHED ON THE OTHER SIDE

 O^pfHE TURNSTILES, AGAIN THERE WERE ONLY 4 OFFICERS ON INSIDE OF THE

TURNSTILES, THE TIME WAS 1.45PM (1345) WHEN WE WENT THROUGH THE TUNNEL OF

LEPPINGS LANE TERRACING.           I GOT INTO THE CROWD THERE WAS RAILINGS GOING

 DOWN THE TERRACING.          IT WAS FENCING RUNNING FROM THE GOAL STAND TO THE

 TOUCHLINE THE ONLY GAP THROUGH THESE RAILINGS WAS AT THE BACK WERE THERE

WAS A 3FT GAP.          HAD THOSE RAILINGS NOT BEEN THERE 95 PEOPLE WOULD NOT

HAVE DIED.           I’M CONVINCED THIS FENCING WAS A MAJOR CONTRIBUTION TO

 THE DISASTER.         AS PEOPLE CAME IN EVERY PLACE WAS BEING TAKEN UP IT WAS

 A CASE OF 2 PEOPLE ON THE ONE STEP AS KICK OFF APPROACHED I COULD SEE

 STEWARDS AT THE TOUCHLINE WAVING TO PEOPLE TO MOVE BACK AND IT WAS GETTING

 QUITE ALARMING IN THERE BY NOW AS THE TEAMS KICKED OFF I SAW POLICEMEN
                                                                             PAGE 11
                                                                             GSL152S

AND WOMEN AND STEWARDS ALL ON THE PERIMETER FENCE FRANTICALLY WAVING

TO THE CROWD TO MOVE BACK, BUT THE SAD FACT IS WE COULDN’T MOVE BACK

BECAUSE OF THE WALL OF THE GOAL STAND.      IT WAS GETTING TO THE STAGE

WHERE I FELT HOT AND FIGHTING TO KEEP MY FOOTING AND I COULD FEEL

SOMETHING WRONG, THE POLICEMEN RUNNING ONTO THE PITCH MADE ME REALISE

THERE WAS A MAJOR CROWD PROBLEM.      WORD CAME OVER THE P.A. SYSTEM FOR

THE CROWD TO MOVE BACK BUT THIS WAS AFTER THE GAME HAD BEEN STOPPED

PEOPLE JUST COULDN’T MOVE BACK THERE WAS A POLICEMAN AT THE BACK URGING

PEOPLE TO MOVE INTO THE NEXT BLOCK THROUGH THE SAME GAP THAT I HAD

MENTIONED BEFORE BUT AGAIN I STRESS THE CROWD COULD HAVE SPREAD OUT

T^ppAFETY IF THESE FENCES HAD NOT BEEN THERE.      THEY MADE THE TERRACING

INTO A CAGE AND FANS WERE JUST SHOVED AND PUSHED AGAINST THEM.      PEOPLE

WERE BEING LIFTED UP IN THE GOAL STAND WE AT THE BACK DIDN’T KNOW

WHAT WAS HAPPENING AT THE VERY FRONT WE DIDN'T KNOW PEOPLE WERE ALREADY

KILLED, BUT WHEN THE CROWD CLEARED A BIT ON THE TERRACING I SAW FANS

LAYING IN A HEAP.      I AND SOME OTHER FAN WENT TO THE FRONT TO LEND

ASSISTANCE.     THERE WAS A NUMBER OF POLICEMEN HELPING WITH THE INJURED

WHO WERE CARRIED OUT TO THE GATE,    I FELT A SENSE OF LOSS BECAUSE I

DIDN’T KNOW HOW TO GIVE THE KISS OF LIFE, BUT I ALSO NOTICED POLICEMEN

STANDING AROUND AND THEN THEY CAME INTO THE TERRACING IN FORCE TO STOP

T ^ FANS FROM GOING ONTO THE PITCH.      THEY SAID IT WAS TO HELP THE

EMERGENCY SERVICES BUT THE SERVICES WERE INADEQUATE, THEY WERE CALLED

ON LATE,   I SAW POLICE IN FORCE ALONG THE NORTH STAND AND ON THE CENTRE

CIRCLE.      I'M STILL CONVINCED THEY COULD HAVE DONE A LOT MORE AS FAR

AS FIRST AID WAS CONCERNED.      THERE WERE SUPPORTERS GIVING FIRST AID TO

PEOPLE, THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO.      I SAW 2 YOUNG LADS LAYING ON THE

TERRACE WHO GOT CARRIED AWAY.        I SAW ANOTHER FAN PUMPING ANOTHER
                                 £ _ ^ c O G r r s ) iTlON/             /
FAN.      I SAW POLICEMEN WITH THEIR TUNICS DISHEVELLED SOME HAD WORKED/

REALLY HARD AND LOOKED SHATTERED, SOME HAD PULLED THEIR TRIPE OUT/ THEY

REALLY SHOULD HAVE HAD AND NEEDED MORE HELP.      THEY WERE STRETCHED
                                                                                 PAGE 12
                                                                                 GSL1528

 VERY HARD.        I CERTAINLY DIDN'T SEE ANY EVIDENCE OF VIOLENCE AGAINST

 THE POLICE.       NO POLICEMAN WAS BEATEN UP BY FANS.      I SAW FANS SHOUT

AT POLICE IN THEIR FRUSTRATION AND STRESS AT THE SCENES THEY HAD SEEN

AND WITNESSED.        THERE WAS NO STEALING OR ROBBING FROM THE BODIES

OF PEOPLE.         I SAW NO EVIDENCE OF THIS,   I SAW A PHOTOGRAPHER TRYING TO

 TAKE PICTURES OF THE BELONGINGS, THE DISCARDED TRAINERS OR SCARF OR

HATS, HE WAS CHASED.         I SAW FANS BEING ABSOLUTELY MAGNIFICIENT IN

 THEIR EFFORTS TO HELP VICTIMS.        THE EFFORTS OF THE EMERGENCY SERVICES

WERE AND INDEED EVERYONE WAS HAMPERED BY THE PERIMETER FENCING AND

BY THE TOTAL LACK OF FACILITIES OR ANY COVER FOR A DISASTER OF THIS

M ^i l T U D E .   IT WAS A TOKEN EFFORT, THE PERIMETER FENCING HAD ONE

SMALL GATE THROUGH WHICH PEOPLE WERE BEING BROUGHT OUT OF ANOTHER

GAP HAD TO BE CUT.         I SAW FAN BEING PASSED OVER THE TOP OF THE

PERIMETER FENCING, SOME CLIMBED OVER TO ESCAPE I SAW PARTS OF THE

TERRACING EMPTY 'CEPT FOR A FEW HUNDRED FANS.          THE OUTSIDE WING

SECTIONS WERE HALF EMPTY IN THE ROLE OF THE STEWARDING OF THE GROUND

 IT WAS CHAOS.       THERE WAS NO ORGANISATION AT ANFIELD THERE ARE

STEWARDS ALL OVER THE GROUND,       I SAW VERY FEW AT HILLSBOROUGH.

 YES,   %THE POLICE WERE NOT AWARE OF THE SITUATION.    IT WOULD APPEAR THEY

INITIALLY THOUGHT THERE WAS CROWD TROUBLE AND FAILED TO REACT QUICKLY

ENOUGH TO ASSIST THE FANS. hEDICAL FACILITIES WERE POOR, WITH LACK OF

EQUIPMENT AND SLOW RESPONSE OF THE MEDICAL SERVICES. THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN

ADEQUATE MEDICAL FACILITIES INSIDE THE GROUND ALREADY.           ALSO POOR

COMMUNICATIONS FROM OFFICIALS, FANS SHOULD HAVE BEEN TOLD ON THE LOUD SPEAKER

ANNOUNCEMENT TO GET BACK FROM THE FRONT OF THE TERRACES TO RELIEVE THE

PRESSURE.

(334

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

J ^ I C I A L INQUIRY?

THE LACK OF POLICE COMMUNICATION AT THE MATCH,BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE

G0MND.    THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE POLICE AND STEWARDS INSIDE AND OUTSIDE

 THE GROUND TO DIRECT AND CONTROL THE FANS. AND THERE SHOULD BE IMPROVED

MEDICAL FACILITIES INSIDE THE GROUNDS TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND QUICKLY TO

 INCIDENTS. ALTHOUGH PERIMETER FENCES ARE NEEDED.      I THINK    THEY SHOULD BE OF

COLLAPSIBLE TYPE SO IF THERE IB ANY EXTREME PRESSURE, THEY WOULD BE

RELEASED, CR THE POLICE COULD RELEASE THEM MORE QUICKLY.

 COMFORTABLY TOWARDS THE TURNSTILES. DUE TO THE POSITION OF BARRIERS

        SERV ICE TO ARRIVE.


Q19

 G54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER CROWD ORGANISATION OUTSIDE THE

 TURNSTILES. THE ACTUAL LAYOUT OF THE BUILDING, THE ’FUNNEL EFFECT'

 TOWARDS THE TURNSTILES IS VERY POOR AND THE CROWD SHOULD HAVE

 BEEN MADE TO QUEUE MORE ORDERLY.

 THERE. THE CROWD COULD NOT SPREAD TO THE SIDES.

G18

 NO, EXCEPT ONE REPORTER WAS ASSAULTED BY ABOUT 4 LIVERPOOL FANS. THEY WERE

 DISPERSED BY 4 POLICE. NO ONE WAS ARRESTED. THE FANS WERE ANGRY BECAUSE PEOPLE

 WERE INJURED AND DYING, AND THIS REPORTER WAS TRYING TO INTERVIEW PEOPLE ON

 THE PITCH.

 Q53

 D ^ ' O U HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE

 INCIDENT WAS HANDLED, AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 I FELT THE EMPHASIS BY THE POLICE WAS TO KEEP SUPPORTERS IN THE PEN.    THEY

 THOUGHT IT WAS HOOLIGANISM. THERE WAS A GINGER HEADED     WPC AT THE FRONT   FENCE,

 SHE WAS THE FIRST TO HELP. SHE KNOCKED A POLICEMAN OUT OF THE WAY, CLIMBED ON

 TO THE FRONT FENCE AND STARTED PULLING PEOPLE OUT OF THE CRUSH.


Q19

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 NOBODY KNEW WHAT WAS HAPPENING. THE FOREST FANS DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS

 HAPPENING. UNTIL THE FIRE BRIGADE ARRIVED, NOBODY TOOK CONTROL OF THE

 SITUATION. THEY AND THE FANS TOOK INITIATIVE.        THERE WERE NO STRETCHERS.

Q20

 I THINK THE POLICE RELAXED COMPARED TO 1988 (000088). THIS DISASTER DID NOT

 0 # R    IN 1988 <000088, BY PURE CHANCE. ,T WAS CROWDED LAST YEAR TOO.
                                   C O m P I                          “

 THERE WERE NOT ENOUGH POLICE OUTSIDE THE GROUND, COMPARED TO THE NUMBERS

 INSIDE THE GROUND.

 THERE SEEMED TO BE A LOT OF TOP BRASS OF THE POLICE ON THE PITCH DOING NOTHING

 TO HELP THE INJURED FANS. THEY WERE TALKING ON THEIR RADIOS.

 ALSO THE LINE OF POLICE IN THE CENTRE OF THE PITCH, PERHAPS 200 IN NUMBER,

 SEEMED TO BE FOLLOWING ORDERS. THEY STAYED ON THE CENTRE LINE. THEY COULD HAVE

 BEEN USED BETTER TO HELP THE INJURED.

 I THINK IT HAS BEEN UNFAIR OF THE PRESS TO ACCUSE THE POLICEMAN WHO OPENED

         GATE.   HE MADE A DECISION.   I HAVE NOT MET A LIVERPOOL FAN WHO WISHES TO

 CRITICISE HIM.      IT WAS A TERRIBLE DILEMMA FOR HIM.

 DID YOU ASSIST ANYONE WHO WAS DEAD OR INJURED? IF S O ,

 BRIEFLY EXPLAIN.

 NO.




 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR

 IN THE DEATHS, OR THE INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 THERE WAS A CONSTANT STREAM OF PEOPLE EMERGING FROM THE TUNNEL ONTO THE

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER,

 A STEWARD, A LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

Q 18



 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO.

 353

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS   ON THE WAY THE

 INCIDENT WAS HANDLED , AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THE FIRST PEOPLE THAT SCALED THE PERIMETER FENCE WERE PUSHED BACK INTO THE

 TERRACES BY THE POLICE WHO I ASSUME WERE NOT AWARE OF WHA1 WAS HAPPENING.

 WHEN IT BECAME APPARENT THAT PEOPLE WERE INJURED, THE POLICE WERE DOING WHAT

 THEY COULD TO HELP THEM OVER THE FENCE AND THROUGH THE SAFETY GATES.



 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?
 I BELIEVE THE POLICE MADE A FUNDAMENTAL MISTAKE IN OPENING THE GATE ALLOWING

 ANOTHER ACCESS INTO THE GROUND.   I ATTENDED LAST YEAR’S SEMI-FINAL AND THE FANS

 HAD TO SHOW THEIR TICKETS BEFORE APPROACHING THE TURNSTILES. THIS DID NOT

 HAPPEN THIS YEAR. THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN STEWARDS INSIDE THE GROUND, DIRECTING

 THE FANS, WHO WERE ENTERING THROUGH THE TURNSTILES.   I WAS IMPRESSED BY THE WAY

 THE POLICE HANDLED ENQUIRIES FROM THE FANS ABOUT MISSING RELATIVES AND FRIENDS

 THEY ALSO SHOWED REMARKABLE RESTRAINT OUTSIDE THE GROUND AFTER THE MATCH HAD

 SHOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE POLICE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE

 I'D LIKE TO SAY SOME DID TRY AND HELP BUT AS I SAY OTHERS DID NOTHING.

Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT    YOU WIStfTO ADD WHICH    YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?              ^                  . i ,
                                      0 3 3           I
 I WENT LAST YEAR AND THE REASON I DIDN'T GO DOWN THE TUNNEL IS BECAUSE

WHENEVER I'VE BEEN IN THOSE MIDDLE TWO PENS ITS ALWAYS BEEN BAD.         LAST YEAR

 T ^ p E WERE MANY POLICE AND STEWARDS IN THE AREA IMMEDIATELY BEYOND THE

TURNSTILES CHECKING TICKETS AND DIRECTING PEOPLE.        THIS YEAR I DIDNT SEE ANY.

THE MATCH SHOULD HAVE BEEN DELAYED FANS OUTSIDE WERE SHOUTING FOR THAT
                                                                    COH M
TO HAPPEN.      THE TUNNEL SHOULD HAVE BEEN BLOCKED OFF WHEN THE MIDDLE TWO PENS

WERE FULL AND THE FANS     DIRECTED AWAY FROM IT.    THE GATE I WENT   THROUGH WHEN

 I WENT THROUGH IT THERE WAS NO GREAT SURGE I JUST WALKED THROUGH I HAD         NO

PROBLEM.     IN MY OPINION THE OFFICER WHO OPENED THAT GATE ACTED CORRECTLY IN

ORDER TO SAVE LIVES OUTSIDE.       PEOPLE WEREN’T AWARE WHERE TO GO AND THAT THEY

WERE ABLE TO GET TO THE TERRACES FROM THE SIDES.         SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY GROUND

 IS IN MY EXPERIENCE PARTICULARLY BAD AS REGARDS STANDING ACCOMMODATION

 I^fc NOT THINK THERE IS ANY NEED FOR THE VERTICAL PARTITIONS IN THE PENS.

 Q::>2

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEt»§ OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE

 INCIDENT WAS HANDLED A fY k^ THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 INITIALLY THE POLICE FAILEENifa REALIZE THE SEVERITY OF THE

 SITUATION, THEY ADOPTED AN ATTITUDE OF "ITS ANOTHER FOOTBALL

 PITCH INVASION". PC        ICE FAILED TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE FANS

 IN THE PENS 3 & 4, WHE!$“THEY EVENTUALLY REALIZED THE




 SERIOUSNfc;     OF THE SITUATION THEY FAILED TO REACT TO IT. THERE

WAS NO ORGANlbfrJIQIJ ON THE PITCH IN RESPECT OF MEDICAL ASSISTANCE

 TO THE    INJURED AND DYING.     IT WAS TOTAL CHAOS. THE AMBULANCES WERE

UNABLE     TO GET ONTO THE PITCH, ONLY TWO     FINALLY MANAGED TO GET

 ONTO IT.

 THE LOUDSPEAKER SYSTEM WAS VERY POOR AND INAUDIBLE MOST OF THE TIME,

 I HEARD ONE CALL COME OVER THE SYSTEM REQUESTING THE ASSISTANCE FOR

 ANY DOCTORS AND NURSES I K THE GROUND TO ASSIST THE INJURED - THIS

CALL WAS FAR TOO LATE THE ASSISTANCE WAS NEEDED IMMEDIATELY.            IT IS

^Ul.Y MY OF2INION BUT I FEEL THATN*i LPT OF DEATHS WERE CAUSED BETWEEN 3.06PM

 H 506) AND 3.30PM <1530) BECAUSE fiH6? TERRACES WERE NEVER CLEARED BY

 THE POLICE. IT IS COMMONSENSE THAT IF SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED MOVE
 THE CROWD AWAY FROM IT IMMEDIATELY, THIS WOULD HAVE RELIEVED THE CRUSH

 ON THE    INJURED AND DYING.      WHEN I LEFT THE GROUND I AH SURPRISED THAT

 A FURTHER CATASTROPHE DID        NOT OCCUR AS THE CRUSH WAS JUST AS BAD IN

 THE AREA BEHIND THE WEST STAND, THE CROWD WERE BEING HERDED THROUGH

 IS THlERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISHvTO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IB

 1. pDTAL DISORGANISATION OF THE TICKE>-4 l L0CATI0N TO LIVERPOOL FC

 2. LACK OF TUN'STILE FACILITIES TO                    WEST STAND TERRACES - TOO MANY

 PEOPLE HAVING TO TRY AND GET INTO THE GROUND IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.

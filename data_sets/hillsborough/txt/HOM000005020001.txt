Thank   you   for    c opying   me   your   letter   of   13    June    to   Peter
Lee.

We are content with your proposals to form a steering group
consisting of representatives from the Home Of fice and DOE
as a forum for di s c us s i o n with the football authorities.  I
think you may well have had tax in mind when you suggested
that some de partments would be responsible for issues which
were so speci a l i s ed that they would be of little interest to
the group and would not therefore need to be members.            I
certainly  agree       with    that  insofar  as  the  Revenue  is
concerned and we would not wish to bid for membership.

Nor do I think it would be appropriate to discuss tax issues
within the steering group.   The existing arrangements un^er
which the foot ball authorities deal direct with the Revenue
on tax matters seem to be working very well and indeed the
authorities' professional advisers have told us that the
recent d i scussions we have had on the Chancellor's Budget
proposals have been most helpful.   As you will know from the
correspondence on tax relief for safety expenditure, we aim
to keep other Departments informed of any matters in which
they have an interest.

I am copying this to the recipients of yours.

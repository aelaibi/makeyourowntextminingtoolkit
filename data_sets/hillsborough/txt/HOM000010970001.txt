    I enclose a copy of Lord Justice Taylor's interim report
and recommendations on the disaster at Hillsborough.

    The Home Secretary expects to publish it on Friday.  He
will be chairing a meeting of colleagues most closely involved
tomorrow to consider the report's recommendations.

    The report is especially critical of the South Yorkshire
Police, in particular of their leadership on the day.

    Following his meeting, the Home Secretary intends to
minute the Prime Minister and H Committee colleagues with a
draft statement which he would propose to issue on publication
of the report.  His minute will also deal with the
consequences for the police.

    I am copying this (with copies of the report) to the
Private Secretaries to the Secretaries of State for
Environment, Scotland, Wales and Health and to Sir Robin
Butler.




                                                                    MISS C J BANNISTER

Private Secretary

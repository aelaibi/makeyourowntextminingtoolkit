       HILLSBOROUGH INQUEST


       T hank you fo r y o u r le tte r of 22nd A pril 1990 to th e A tto rn ey G eneral.        I have
       been asked to rep ly .


       The A tto rn ey G eneral's ju risd ictio n concerning in q u e sts is limited to th e situation
       se t out in section 13 of th e C oroners' Act 1988. T his provision enables him to
       ap p ly to, o r give his a u th o rity fo r an application to , the High C ourt fo r an o rd e r
       th a t an in q u est o r, a fre s h in q u e s t, as the case may b e , is held into a p erso n s
       d eath . The ju risd ictio n to make such an o rd e r is e x p re ss ly re s e rv e d to th e High
       C ourt, and the A tto rn ey G eneral's role is confined to deciding w h eth er o r not an
       application to th e High C ourt should be made u n d e r th a t section.


       The A tto rn ey General does not have a n y ju risd ictio n to control the actions of
       c o ro n e rs. T h ey a re in d ep en d en t judicial officers and a re solely responsible fo r
       th e ir decisions, sub ject to th e rig h t of th e High C ourt to review th e decisions
       which th e y make. It would be an unco n stitu tio n al in te rfe re n c e in the co ro n er's
       functions if th e A tto rn ey General were to p u rp o rt to make the ty p e of direction
       which you re q u e st.


       With re g a rd to y o u r points about th e powers of coroners to a d jo u rn , the A tto rn ey
       General wishes me to sta te th a t a co ro n er's pow er in th is re g a rd deriv es not only
       from the C oroners' Act 1988 b u t from The C oroner's Rules 1984 and from common
       law. He does not tak e the view th a t a co ro n er's pow er to ad jou rn an in q u est is
limited e ith e r to the circum stances envisaged in section 16 of th e Act o r to those
in which th e C oroner's Rules stip u late th a t an adjournm ent shall be m andatory.
A d isc retio n ary power e x ists to ad jou rn an in q u e st w henever a coroner th in k s
th a t such a course is p ro p e r and th a t th e re is an ad equ ate c a u se .

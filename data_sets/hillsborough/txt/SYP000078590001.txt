            At about         '11. 113 am      (1115)    my self and PC Sykes                 took    up our dies i gnated

            position at the J u n ction of Southey G^/en Rd and Halifax Rci,                                                 At    this

            j u n c t i o n is the White Horse                 puibl i e/no use and at about                   11.30 am       (1130)

            I saw a PS V           pull    up at      this jun/xion and the full                     compliment          of

            passengers a l i g h t e d and made                 straight      for the         public          house.     I walked

            over     to the front             door and spoke with the                licensee whom               I have       known

            for    15 years.            Hr Cl ewes       initially       informed, these             supporters,             who all

            spoke with Liverpool                  accents,       that    they     could not          corne in as a group

            because       of      possible      trouble.         However,       after        they had pleaded w ith him

            for several minutes                  he   c apitulated and they all                 entered w ith a token

            warning       by the        licensee        not to cause trouble.

            This     senario was           repeated as many more                fans    tried to enter                 the    public

            house and only a short                    time     later    the doors were              closed and a

            ’d o o r m a n 5 who was a pp ar e n t l y just a. regular                  customer was e m p loyed                    to

            let out a number               of    customers       before      letting         the same          number    in.

            During       the      course      of the     next 3 hours or so myself and PC Sykes were

            called upon to              prevent Liverpool              fans from urinating

            I was asked            on     many many occasions where another                          public house was               and

            sudden swing            of mood w h i c h        I can only describe as                  panic.        it was as

I   was    instructed to wait                      until about 2.55             pm     (1435)      when our        serial

were      to walk         down to Clay w h e e l s Ln traffic                       office     for our sch e d u l e d

This      was actually what                    h a p pened but at about 3 pm                    (1500)     just as we

were      turning         into C la y w h e e l s Ln our serial                     was stopped by an officer

in a police             transit            van who       informed us that all available manpower

were      required          immediately at, the Leppings Ln end of the ground.

For    several          minutes            prior   to this        I was aware            via Sergeant K e e n a n             (who

was    in possession of a personal                            radio)      that       something was happening

outside        the ground              but we were under              the    impression            that    fighting           had

b ro k e n o u t *

We were        transp o r t e d the short                  distance       to Leppings Ln and on debusing

I saw a large number                        of L iverpool         supporters ar o u n d the metal                      gates at

this      location.               In the mai n they were               being         *he 1 d faack8 by mourrlsd

officers and              I saw several                 officers asking             them not to push.                  The

atmosphere           at this           time was          ’frightening*.              There were         large      numbers

of fans who were                   shouting,            using abusive        language and who were                      venting

their anger at                police          officers.        What    came shining              through         to me was

that      they were           going         to get       into the     ground and            it m a t t e r e d    not what

was    said to them.                    I was asked on numerous                     occasions        if the kick             off

time was         to be delayed but                      by this    time     I was        separated t f om if’

               about 5..30 pm            (1730)    assisting        with the dispersal            of the    crowd.      I dici

               not      enter      the ground except after               the events and did not handle any

           wtiat do you put in section 31      I am going to

           a number of suggestions but these are simply

     K&tionS'     You don*t have to accept these.     These

           r   intended to give you some idea that if I were

     lug in, say, a road traffic incident - well, I will

 give you that as an example.     If I were dealing with a

 road traffic incident and I was writing that section, I

 would say the person died on the 15th of April, 1989, as

.a result of a collision between two private motor

 vehicles in such-and-such a road in Sheffield.

 Sometimes I might say a private vehicle and a heavy goods

vehicle, if that happened to be the case.        In other

words a relatively brief account, but I look at it and

say, "Oh, yes, that was a road traffic accident.”           It

tells me the place.      It tells me when.     It tells me

whether it was a motor bike, a car, a heavy goods vehicle

and so on."     That is the way I normally do it.

     On that basis I am going to give you one or two

examples of what you might like to think, but you

tied to this.     With regard to the deceased all

died on the 15th April, 1989, except for Lee Nichol,

died on the 17th of April, but I am just

15th» but you must remember that when you

          .practice is not to put a tin®
  difficult in most cases to know exactly when a

«©n died and we have had plenty of examples in these

pests.           You know, when did this person die?      If you

amber Dr. Gumpert came along and gave us a very

 t.te lecture on death on the last day, I think the 4th

   » and         Dr.   Slater, who we saw a few days ago, also

a, jolly         good job at explaining to us what the word

tft" means.            It is not quite as easy as some of us

:t think, so I tend to pick the date rather than the



 On the other hand this section does not actually ask

-.'time they died*          It says, "Time, place and

   ttnees at or in which injury was sustained."

    Ms    it-.a trifle easier in fact because with Lee

                               Now, I turn to the verdicts and 1 remind you of what

                          I have already said,- that there are~4;h^e._b^asically which
                          1 am go|ng"''to leave with you:    (1) unlawfully killed, C2>

                          accidental death or misadventure, and 1 will tell you now

                          that as a matter of law there is no difference between"

                          these two terms - we will deal with this a little later

                          when 'I"^get on to actually explaining it but as......far "as you

                          are concerned these are the same - and then the third

                          option that you have is what is known as an open verdict

                          and again I will cone to that.

                               Before you are able to reach any verdict at all upon

                          the evidence you have got to be satisfied on the evidence

                           that is appropriate and therefore you have to know what

                           standard of proof has to be applied.      In considering the

                           evidence you obviously will have to be satisfied that the

                          necessary standard of proof has been achieved, in order

                           enable you to reach one or other of the verdicts which %■

                           have mentioned.'

                           In respect of accidental death or misadventure

 go- along we may find this is not quite as relevant as you

 otherwise might think®

      I now turn to the other verdicts.     If you come to the

 conclusion that unlawfully killed is inappropriate, then you

 may go on to decide whether the verdict of accidental death

 or misadventure is the right one.     In this case the burden

 of proof is entirely different.     You may bring in such a

 verdict if you are satisfied'on'the balance of

 probabilities.     In other words, if you are satisfied it is

 more likely than not that the deceased’s death was due to       ,

 accident or misadventure.                                           \

      There is no difference, as I have already told you, in         |

 these two words.    You may choose whichever one you prefer.            I-;;

 If you cannot make up your mind which one you prefer, and if

 this is the verdict you have in mind, then choose the word

 ’•accidental", but it is a matter entirely for you.    What I

. am trying to say to you is do not spend hours arguing whi

 of these two words is better.

 There are different overtones, o

 perceive them^ifferently, but t

                                                   ..

                                                                      j

 Satisfied there has been careles

make, for instance, compensation payments In civil

litigation.                     It straddles a whole range of events and the

fact that the Jury brings in a verdict of accidental death

does not mean to say that nothing has not gone wrong.                        In

other words, bringing in this verdict does not mean that you
           .   . everv party from all and every measure from
absolve each and every party

are not a l l o w e d to determine aspects of civil liability,

 not saying, "I have decided that everything is perfect.

 example, both of what you might                   consider   to be an accident

              You may, for instance, be washing up glasses and whilst

  you do so you drop one and it breaks.                       It is an accident.

  How whether or not there is any culpability will depend on

  all the circumstances.                     For example, supposing you were

  washing up these glasses as carefully as you could and

  because of the soapy water one slipped out of your >•—

  you might well say, "I have broken it but it is not

   my fault.                     Maddening, but not my fault.”     1

   blame yourself and you would be a bit annoyed
     THE CORONER:     You will be pleased to hear that I am

not going on with all that legal stuff now, we are moving

on to something else.    It is very, very important but a

bit heavy going in places,

        I have already told you that you have to deal with

each case on its own.    That is because they are all

individual people, but there are one or two things which

do make life a little bit easier for you and 1 have

-indicated one already, that everybody in fact died on 15th

April, 1989, apart from Lee Nicol who died on the 17th.          I

will remind you with regard to Lee, this was the young lad

who donated his organs,who had signed a donor card, do^

you remember          He was certified as having been brain

dead on the 17th, and his organs were taken, those which/

were,used, on the 18th.      So although, of course, it war"

 very, very sad that his life should have been lost,-it was

 good that he had signed a card and it w a s ^ v i n better of

 his, mum, in the agony of that decision, to have said...yes,

 that they would do whafc-''li'e wanted, and for all I know

 there is somebody walking round happy today because of

 him.

         The second way which will help you is becas

 were two pens you can split people between ttt|s

 In fact, there were only at the most nine

 in Pen 4.     There is Stephen O'Neill where
                                                 ■VPs
     It may not be terribly relevant except when you fill

in this form.   If you want to put the pen, then the ones

where you are doubtful you have to think whether that is

sufficient or whether in those cases you merely want to

say Hillsborough Stadium or Lappings Lane Terraces,     That

is the way to deal with that.   So Stephen O'Neill probably

Pen 4; Alan Johnston and David Thomas and Francis

McAllister probably Pen 3, but with the doubts which I      •

have told you about.

     I have already told you that you can have different

verdicts for different people, both between pens and even,

if you think the evidence were to show it, within a pen.

The only reservation 1 would make is that if you were to

decide, say on an accidental/misadventure verdict, try and

use one of those words rather than both.   Although they,

mean the same if you use different words - if you say

accidental here and misadventure there - it is an

unanswerable question but it merely raises a question

whigJv need not be raised.

     You will of course have noticed that on the wh©;i€r- :n

we took evidence from November to March - we did not take

much evidence after 3.15, in fact hardly any, and that was

a deliberate decision of mine, because 1 took the view

that we had to have a cut off point somewhere.   In the

light of the pathological evidence in particular which we

had had, and you remember we heard from about eight
                                                              '   ' '        •'




    pathologists, quite a lot, and although they differed in

    minor detail as to whether it was ten seconds or five

    seconds or fifteen seconds that people lost consciousness,
B   it was clear that people lost consciousness within a

    relatively short period of time according to their view,

    and what was much more important was that irretrievable

    damage had been done, with somebody who was asphyxiated,

    between four and six minutes.    1 think six minutes was the

    longest period stated by anyone and 1 think it was Prof.

    Usher who said that.    He said that actually in Alan

    Johnson's inquest,     He said that once the chest had been

    fixed so that the person could not breathe then

    irretrievable brain damage was caused.

         If that is right, and as I say it was the unanimous

    view and it is a matter for you whether you accept it, but

     if you accept that as being correct then whether or not

     somebody subsequently breathed..for a period or was

     resuscitated, like Stephen O'Neill, he was resuscitated

     for a period, in fact for two days he appeared to be

     breathing and his heart was beating, and yet the datti

     had been done.   It is very interesting -

    ..-Stephen because.Dr. Holt actually dealt with this

     may not remember the detail but she said that

     examined the brain she was satisfied that the

     the brain had been done at the time of the in:                     mm

     I have also got to say, and in fact it is '

         y Part of that was actually spent

 severely damaged as to be irretrievably harmed.        That, if you

 like, is the beauty of the body, that you can       assault itlike

 that and retrieve it before it is too late and the people
 themselves just recover.

       1 am not denying that.   As a fact that is obviously a

 possibility but we also have to face the fact that that is

 precisely what did not happen and so I, as I say, took the

 view that the cut off was right.    We had to have some limit

 at some point.   The other way I went quite a long way back

 but even there we tended to start in Sheffield.       We did not

 start in Liverpool.   We could have done but we did not

because we have to have some limit somewhere.

       In passing I wifi just say this;    of the 95 people who

aiefl >Tt>r so actually got to hospital.     One g o t 'to' tl|eX\

pillamsfaire and that was Carl Lewis.     One, Lee Nicol, go^-fon

to a ward and stayed on a ward.     One, Adam Spearritt, appears

t° have got on to the ITU ward but for some reason they Mad

no notes and the evidence we heard was that he did not

■survive.   We know that he did not survive.    All the" rest got

into the Building/- if -you-XiJ££^&udb.’didr' not get beyond either

the resuscitation room or the mortuary which they had set up.

       Of these 14 people the majority had no hospital notes.

That was perhaps unfortunate but we did not investigate it

any further.    1 merely mention it because obviously if you

have notes it makes it much easier to know what actually

happened if one wants to do it but in most cases there, were

not.   In most cases you have to remember, if you. say,...’"They

only had 13 in and so why on earth did they not ...have.. notes?"
 centre), was that if you had come down the tunnel, you

 exit on to the terracing a little bit proud of the back

 wall| the radial gates are right at the back; if you do

 not know that they are there they will not immediately

 spring to your attention; and that the fuller the terrace
 gets the more obscured they become.

      So whatever the legal theory might be about it being

an open terrace, in practice the pens became self

contained.    I think there is certainly quite a lot of

justice in that argument.     What 1 am not so convinced

about is whether the remedy which had been proposed by the

Fire Service, for instance, or indeed the other people who

said that the gates had to be manned, would actually have

remedied that situation because whilst a Police Officer

with his helmet is perhaps a little bit more visible than

the gate, he may not be that visible, that is the first
thing.

     Secondly, all the evidence which we have had from

people along that back wall - we heard seyeral.....people from

that back wall,    1 think it was Mr. Twydale and Mr. Qjitci''-

  either Mr. Oyitch or Mr. Goodman -_,.,i..t._d.oes not natter

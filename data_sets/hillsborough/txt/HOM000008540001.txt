     (ii)   Administration cost. A 5% administration charge may be

     non-operational work such as managerial, clerical, and general
     office and administration tasks.   (In very large mutual aid cases
     it may have been necessary to hire extra office staff; but their
     costs should be regarded as covered by the 5% charge.)

            Dear Mr Addison
            HILLSBOROUGH : COST OF INVESTIGATION BY WEST MIDLANDS POLICE
           I enclose a copy of a letter that Sir John Layden has written in response to
           Lord F e r re rs ’ letter of 27 June following the meeting at the Home Office on
           20 June.

           In order to enable the Authority to take in to account the latest situation when
           it meets on 11 August will you please let me know
           (a)          to what extent West Midlands Police are undertaking work other than for
                         Lord Justice T a y l o r ’s enquiry and for what purposes; and
           (b)          whether any expenditure on such activities which is legitimately
                         chargeable to South Yorkshire Police Authority would be covered by the
                         terms of Lord Ferrers letter of 27 June.

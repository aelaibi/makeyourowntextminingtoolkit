U1HEELHQUS E , I a t t e nd e d the M i dl an d R a il wa y S t at io n to supervise

Liverpool       fans    onto    the buses.        As more and more          of the L iverpool           fans

al lighted from trains and made                 their way to the buses             it was      quite

apparent        that a large      number    of them had been drinking.



After    the main bulk          of fans    had got onto         the buses       for    the match,       my

serial    then     commenced a mobile            patrol    in a police van.



At about 3.1 5 pm          (1515),. a message           came over       personal      radio    from West

Bar Control       Roo m to at te nd H i l l s b o ro u gh S t ad iu m because           of    crowd

probiems.



We made    our way to the ground and a s se mb le d at                    the   corner       of the    Kop

and the N orth Stand,            near    to the gymnasium.          1     was   not aware of what

had taken place.              We were    then ordered to enter             the ground and         line up

a l o ngside    the North S t a n d .



On entering        I could see that         some       incident was taking            place at the

Leppings Lane          end,    but what    I was       still   not awares       that    there were

dead and        injured    people at that end of the ground.



We were    then told to          clear    the    pitch w hich we a t te mp te d to do but with

little    success.



A fter a few minutes,            we were     ordered to form a            cordon at the K o p e n g

of the ground,          along    the w idth of the         pitch, walking        towards        the

centre    line to       prevent Liverpool          fans    creating a public            order

situation at the Notts Forest                   end.     I then became aware            that    people
                                                                                                           PAGE
                                                                                                           S3750

            were    dead and     injured at the Leppi ng s Lane end,


                                                                                                     /v//I lo9 I
            I was    standing      in the     cordon next                            and PC 3312 ALLEN.

            Together w ith them            I went   forward/to    the Leppings Lane        end.         We were

            a p p r o a c h e d by three    or four men/who were         carrying a man between t h e m ,

S   S   ?   I stopped some men             carrying an a d ve rt is in g   board and we      placed the

^*7^AjS35^Jbody onto       it and      i nstructed the men to take the body towards                     the North

            S t a n d where    casualties a pp ea r ed to be going.



            I continued forward to the Leppings Lane                     end but,   because      of the        large

            number    of people a lr e ad y there,         we just    c o u l d n ’t do a ny thing      practical

            to help.



            PS COL T O N then      called us over and         instructed us to keep          clear a

            stairway at the         corner     of the S ou th Stand to give access            for the fire

            a n d a m bulance    services       onto the    pitch.   This we did for a while                 until

            we were no        longer    needed.      At this time most       of my serial        had become

            s ep a r a t e d and we were      instructed by PS 812 S T U CH F IE L D to       leave the

            ground.      We went       to the bridge       on L ep pings Lane where we        remained

            until    the ground was          cleared.



            As the fans        left the ground we were           subject    to strong abuse           from

            Liverpool      fanss    it was a very tense          time.



            E v e n t u a l l y the gr ou nd did    clear and    I made my way back        to West Bar

DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR       IN THE DEATHS OR THE

INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

IT WAS OBVIOUS TO ME, AT 1430,       THERE WERE TOO MANY PEOPLE IN PENS 3 & 4 AND

THIS HAS GOT TO BE A FACTOR.     THERE WERE JUST TOO MANY PEOPLE.

AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

THE POLICE WHO WERE THERE I THOUGHT WERE VERY GOOD AND THE ST JOHNS BUT THERE

WAS NO COMMUNICATION OVER THE SYSTEM.        THE PEOPLE WHO HAD RECOVERED WERE

WANDERING IN A DAZE.    THERE WAS NO-ONE APPARENTLY IN OVERALL COMMAND OR TO

T0p   CHARGE OF THE RECOVERED PEOPLE.       THERE WAS A LOT OF PEOPLE OBVIOUSLY

SHOCKED BUT GETTING IN THE WAY OF THE MORE SERIOUSLY INJURED.

Q34

IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICAL INQUIRY?

AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED THERE WAS NOT ANY OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENTS OVER THE

TANNOY.   PEOPLE IN OTHER PARTS OF THE GROUND DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

I THINK THERE COULD HAVE BEEN SOMEONE WITH MEGAPHONE TO INSTRUCT THE RECOVERED

PEOPLE WHERE TO GO.

 Yes about 2 minutes after kick off initially to my left but then behind me

 and to my right.          Behind me and a barr ier .    I was stood in front of there

 After about 3 or 5 minutes a PC opened the gate let about               10 people out and

 then told people on the terraces to go b a c k .          No one could so eventually he

 let others out.     I got onto the pitciy'and after a few minutes saw people

 injured.      I got a perimeter hoarding and carried a person to the far end of

 the ground.                         \ /

 G49 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR             IN THE DEATHS,

 OR THE INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 The main factor    is the fact that the section I was in seemed to be a lot more

 crowded than the section to my right        (Section 2).       If there was no segregation

 on the terraces at the end it w o u l d n ’t have happened.       Also there was only one

 gate to let fans out in Section 3.         There should be more.

HANDLED,    AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?           /        ^

 I think it took the Police too long to redfise exactly what was happening
                                                                 happe     -

                                            lnvasion - they put a line of
 they thought that the problem was a pit)&r invasion

 officers across the pitch.       The first ambulance took about        10 mins to get

 into the ground it seemed to be going slowly - no sense             of urgency.   There

 seemed to be a problem with communication.

1.     Lack of communication between emergency services.

2.     It should be known by numbers going through turnstiles that certain are

of the ground are filling up quicker than others and therefore the tunnel

should have been closed to stop people getting     in the middle terrace

sect ions   (3 & 4).

3.     If there are segregated areas on the terraces the number of people going

through turnstiles should be monitored.

4.      The Police should have been prepared for a large number of   fans coming

to     the ground without tickets hoping to buy one outside the ground.

5.      Either the number of tickets allocated to Liverpool   should have been

^^her     or a different   large ground should have been used.

6.     I feel that what happened at Hillsborough could have happened at any

number of other grounds.

DID YOU HAVE DIFFICULTY ENTERING THE GROUND1. IF Y,                                   GIVE BRIEF REASON.

INITIALLY Y E S , BECAUSE THE GATES 8STORE THE TURNSTILES ifeRE S H U T , WHICH IN

MY OPINION WAS THE CORRECT THJrma TO DO, BECAUSE OF TWE VAST NUMBERS BETWEEN

THOSE GATES AND THE TURj^sf IL E S .            AT ABOUT 1453 I SAW A CONCERTINA TYPE GATE

READING INTO THE AREA MARKED A/G ON THE P L A N „ O P E N .                          IT WAS OPEN FOR THIRTY

SECONDS , NO MORE, jA NUMBER OF FANS WENT THROUGH AND THEN THE^ HORSES^ M O V E D _IN

TO ALLOW THEM TO BE CLOSED.               THIS RELIEVED A LITTLE BIT OF THE PRESSURE.

AFTER    ('HEY WERE CLOSED AGAIN,           THE GATES WHERE I WAS                    WAITING WERE OPENED FOR

US TO GO FORWARD.         WE WENT THROUGH THE GATES AND MOVED DOWN TO THE RIGHT Or

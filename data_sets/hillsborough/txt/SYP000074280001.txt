After       finishing              the     paperwork.                I went        back      onto                             ^"*ne            had

At    about           3.05pm        (15 Q 5 ) ,yf s a w a P o l i c e                 Officer        run on          to the         pitch and

sjjeak      to        the       referee| ,~yjf1 1 ho u,§ti I                still      could        not    see       any           problem,

Together           with         o t h e r (/fVir^ers, I wa s                 directed          to    t ha t     part          of      the    Kop

which       wa s       occupied          by L i v e r p o o l       fans.         Together          with       those          officers,

I formed           a    line       between          these      fans         and    the^Nottingham                  Forest             Fans.

Looking          towards           the    Leppings          Ln      end      I saw       numerous          Liverpool

supporters              spilling          onto       the     pitch,          yi    saw      people        being        lifted           from

the     standing            area      into      the      s e a ti rv$>^afr eaj a b o v e          them.         Other          Police

The     Nottingham               Forest        fans      obviously            thought          t ha t     it w a s        a    pitch

invasion and                initially           started            to    ’b a i t ’ the        Liverpool             f an s        with

obscene          chanting.               More      and more             people        came    o n t o the p i t c h a n d t h e re

appeared              to    be a m o v e        by    them       to         approach         the N ^ i t i n g h a m e n d of the

ground.               I saw a        line          of P o l i c e O f f i c e r s      neajp tp/Xjjne h a l f - w a y                  line        to

After      a few minutes                     I saw ambulances                       rive       and      one     of    these        went

onto     the        pitch.         I then          saw     fans                              icers        and Amb ul an ce            staff

carrying            injured        p e o p l ee t o w a r d s / t h e               ance       to    the       pitch     very       near       to

where      I was          standing.             I saw          people        pull       away      advertising            boarding           and

use     it as m a k e            shift       stretchers.                Injured          people         were     being        taken       out

for     quite        s ome       time.

From     my     position,            all      I could           see     of    events         at     the L e p p i n g s       Ln    end     of

the     p i t c h was        a    l ar g e    group        of    supporters,              Police          etc,        I could       not     see

any     details.

It w a s       sometime           before        the       gravity        of       the    situation             became     c l ea r     to

both myself               and     the    other        occupants              of    the Hop.             The     Nottingham Forest

fa ns    were        initially aggressive                        and     I sensed            t hat      they were         becoming

restless            and    volatile.               However        as     more       people          were       stretchered            out

infront         of    them,        they        calmed          down.

                                                           issed        by the          ^pu^speaker             system,        that       the

                                                           :o r e s t    fans A t 4 r W i 3          to    leav e       the    ground.

I assisted            in the         clearing             of    supporters              from      the     Hop.

After      the       ground        had       cleared,           I sat        in the       stand         together         with       other

Officers            unt il       a Senior          Officer        told        us    to    stand         down.

I was      the       only        officer        in S e r g e a n t       BATTY'S          serial          to    be ^ n    a    leave        day

and     w as    therefore            the      only        officer        from       t h at     serial          ym i

I took         no    part        in a n y     of    the        dead     or    injured          persons          or     their

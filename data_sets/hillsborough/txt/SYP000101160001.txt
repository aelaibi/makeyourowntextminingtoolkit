turnstiles                 A    to G;         they were            instructed          to get           down and were                ejected

from        the       ground           by     other, o f f i c e r s .

At     this        time         there         were       several         h u n d r e d -people          hanging around                       the

area        of     th e        turnstiles              and      due     to the a m o u n t         of     fans      now entering

th e       ground          were        asked        to m o v e        from     that    area        to a l l o w         f ans    in.

Several            people             wh o    had      entered          the   ground         complained             tha t       p e o p l e at

P o l i ce       should             be a w a r e       of     this.                                ,                                     ^              v-«

At     this        I looked              t h r o u g h th e        turnstiles          towards            Leppings            L ane,

although my                    view was          restricted              I c ould      see        officers          on foot          a n d on

horseback               who         appeared           to     be a t t e m p t i n g   to       control        the       surge           towards

the     turnstiles.

People           were          no w    struggling              to e n t e r     the    ground and               in f a c t       were             being
                                                                                                                         R’39'8


pushed       into       the    wall        and       turnstile        entrance           itself.           Many     fans        were

now    complaining             that        someone          would     be     injured,         and     all    officers             at

the    turnstiles             should        go       outside.         All       fans    were     informed           that

officers          inside       ha d a t a s k          to    perform         an d     that    officers         outside

would       be    doing everything                    possible        to a l l e v i a t e     the      p r o blem.

Around       2.40       pm I s a w that               several        fans       had    again     climbed          the       outer

wall    and       were       on top        of    the       turnstile         entrance         roof,        the y were

instructed             to    get     down.           This    they     flatly          refused        to do.         I sa w two

youths       on    the       roo f    showing          their        tickets         to P o l i c e    officers          they

were    again          instructed           to       get    off     the    roof,       but    again        refused.

By    now many          fans       ha d    congregated              around       the     turnstiles           and      several

officers          including myself                    were    being        surrounded          by     fans     who      wer e

being       abusive          towards        us       because        they     ha d     been    subjected           to    the

crush       outside          the     turnstiles.              Fans        were      now being         allowed          i nt o     the

ground       without          the     ticket          stubs       being      torn      off    (this        I presumed             was

to    allow       quicker          entry)        and       these     w ere      being       passed      to    fans      on      the

roof    who       in    tur n b e g a n         to    throw       them     over       the    w all    to     fans      awaiting

entry.

It    had    now       got    to the        stage          where     searching          was    impossible              due      to

the    amount          of fans        congregating                inside        the    turnstile           area     and

together          with       several        other          officers        we    attempted           to c l e a r      the

area.        This       was m e t         with       verbal       hostility           towards        the     Police         and

many    fans       appeared           to be          losing       their      tempers.

I formed          the       opinion        that       before        too long          a Police        officer          would         be

physically             assaulted,           and       due    to     the    fact       that    only      serial         14    was

deployed          in    that       area,        had    an o f f i c e r b e e n        assaulted           then

assistance             would       h ave    been       very       limited        and    the    situation            got      out

of    hand.        Thankfully              t his      did    not     occur.

Whilst       speaking          with        several          f ans    I was       approached           by     a man      who

8 tated      that       he was        a Merseyside                Police        officer,       he     said     that

appreciated           the      pressure            we w ere      under        but     something           had to be don e

and    fast.

I informed          him      that       the       officers        outside            the    g r o u n d w o u l d be d o i n g

without        formally           identifying             himself        to me.

Fans    were      still        congregating               round        the a r e a        inside       the    turnstiles and

I made       several         request          for     them to m o v e          away        to a l l o w      people      to get

entering        H at a         time      but was          un a b l e    to    prevent          this due        to the         number

of    fans    around         the     turnstiles.                These        people        just     disappeared              into

the    crowd.

The    majority         of     ine      fans      went     towards           the     tunnel       lead i n g    to the

Eventually          the      g ates      were       closed,       some        fans- w e r e       still       coming         through

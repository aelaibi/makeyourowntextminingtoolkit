POLICE CONSTABLE 2785




WOODSEATS POLICE STATION, SHEFFIELD




At 8.30 am, Saturday 15 April 1989, I arrived at Woodseats Police Station,

Sheffield to begin a tour of duty for the FA Cup Semi-Final to be held at

Hillsborough Football Ground between Nottingham Forest and Liverpool.                                It

was on my usual day off and I had volunteered for the duty.

At     8.50    am   that     date,    I was    conveyed     to   the Hillsborough       Ground via    a

double        decker   bus    along     with   the   rest   of my       colleagues   from Woodseats,

arriving there at approximately 9-25 am.                        I collected a hot drink and then

established which serial I was in to take up my position for the initial

briefing to be held in the North Stand.                         I was deployed in serial 9 along

with     other      officers     from    Woodseats,       and    had    Police   Sergeant   Jessop   as

serial sergeant.            Inspector Booth was the serial Inspector.

At approximately 9.50 am that date,                   the major briefing in the North Stand

was      commenced,          Superintendent          Greenwood         and   Chief     Superintendent

Duckenfield were amongst others to brief all officers present.                              As soon as

the briefing had finished we were provided with a meal which was eaten in

the North Stand of the Ground.

At approximately 10.30 am that date, along with the rest of my serial 9. I

attended the Spion Kop where, along with serial 10 and my own serial 9, we

were    given a short briefing by Superintendent                       Greenwood,    Inspector Booth

and Inspector Calvert                with regards     to any possible        trouble    spots   on the

kop,    and what       to    do if those       possible     troubles ..occurred.       We   were also
informed of our -duties outs M e            the ground of Penistone Road prior to half

time.                                  ~

At 11.05 am that date, I took up my position on Penistone Road at turnstile

'N'.    This was the Nottingham Forest end of the ground.                  My duties at this

turnstile began.       Any fans which looked suspicious were searched thoroughly

before entering.           Nottingham Forest fans seemed to be entering in a very

slow trickle, only a few at a time, there seemed to be no large bunching as

was earlier anticipated.          Anyone seen drinking alcohol was advised and then

told    to pour it into the gutters at the side of the kerb,                   this was done

under my supervision and other officers under the same area.                     Any can, Coca

Cola, etc, was either confiscated or drunk by the person who owned it, any

confiscations       were   collected       in between   the   turnstile   entrances.     Sticks

from flags were also confiscated and generally there were no objections to

these    orders.      It    was   also     established   after    consultation    with   Police

Sergeant Jessop that crates and box type objects for standing on, were also

confiscated as it was thought that these could be dangerous when stood on

due to surging of the crowd, etc.

A   small   group   of youths near to my turnstile were seen to ask people if

they had    tickets    to sell,     these were moved on,          under   the supervision of

Inspector Booth, on 2 occasions.

Many people of the 20-28 year old region appeared to have been drinking,

although only 2 or 3 seemed the worse for wear, these were denied entry by

me and advised under the ground regulations that they wouldn't be admitted.

About 10-15 Liverpool fans approached me on the turnstile, explaining that

they had    tickets    for the Nottingham Forest allocated Spion Kop, and they

were directed to turnstiles near the North Stand where a safe area had been

set up in case of this occurrence.
At .approKlwKtely 3,06 pm that -date,            I was   approached by Police   Sergeant

Hoyland, who I believe was ift charge of serial 10, who ordered me to shut

my turnstile and permit no-one else to enter the ground.                 He informed me

that there had been a pitch invasion by Liverpool fans at the Leppings Lane

end of the ground and assistance was required.              I immediately acted on this

and ordered 2 turnstiles to close the wooden gates, I oversaw this happen

and then, along with the rest of my serial, I entered the football ground

through the main gates leading to the Spion Kop, under the supervision of

Police Sergeant Hoyland.

We walked quickly through the ground at the rear of the Spion Kop, and then

made our     way through the        fans on the kop near to the pitch.   This area was

almost totally devoid          of   fans and access was very easy.   I then made my way

onto the     pitch via agate at         the bottom of the Spion Kop, directly behind

the goal     posts there,      we then started to jog towards the Leppings Lane area

of the pitch.

As I approached this area, I could clearly see about 20 Police Officers on

the fencing at the Leppings Lane end or on the pitch near to that area.                  I

could also see about 40 or 50 fans on the pitch and many more fans trying

to climb over the fence onto the pitch.

Along with Police Constables 2016, 338, 190 and 1478 I made my way towards

this same area of the fencing,           to what I assumed would be a crowd control

situation.     I soon realised that it was not a pitch invasion and went to

the fencing at Leppings Lane.            At this time I believe I was in company with

Police Constable 338 Mackay who was in my serial.

Once at the fence I could clearly see people being crushed up against the

perimeter    fence.     I stood motionless, for a moment        as I saw an old man,

about   60 years,     behind    the fencing but crushed up to it.        His mouth was
partially      open    and his face *wag discoloured between ashen and blue,                             his

face looked contorted and his eyes were open with a fixed look about them,

I    thought   he     was    dead.      I    looked      to   his   right       and   saw a young      girl,

probably about 12 years old, her face was right up to the fencing and her

cheeks were almost coming through the wire mesh on the fencing.                                 There were

people above her crushing her.                    I thought she was dead also.                  I couldn't

believe It,      for a moment or two I just shouted at the fence for people to

move but my voice was drowned amongst screams and shouting coming from all

around me.

I was wanting to help but didn't know what to do for the best, so together

with Police Constable 338 Mackay I made my way to the gate at the front of

the Leppings Lane fence, behind the goal.                        The gate was opening and people

were   struggling       to    get    out     in   the   panic.        I    can't remember how,        but I

suddenly had hold of a man from the crowd.                          With Police Constable Mackay I

dragged him 20 yards onto the pitch so as to avoid other officers and fans,

and give the man air to breathe.                    He was put into the recovery position by

me   and Police Constable Mackay                  cleared     anything         in his mouth.      Once his

airway was cleared he was coughing and breathing, but alive, he started to

move    himself.        I    felt     that    this      man   would       be    alright   so   with   Police

Constable Mackay we ran back towards                      the gate.            People were being pulled

clear now but were            blocking up the            gate area,        so we pulled them further

onto    the pitch away from the trouble.                      The walking wounded were asked to

move    on and generallythey did so, moving towards the middle of the                                 pitch.

Fans    were   screaming        and        crying    and shouting         at    me,   they wanted      their

relations or friends.                I told them to move back and give us chance                      to get

to them, but I don't think they did.
Again at the gate area, together with Police Constable Mackay, I pulled a

body out from the crowd.             It was a heavy well built man in his 30's.                 He

was discoloured and had orange vomit around his mouth area,                       he was dead.

We grabbed an advertising hoarding and broke it away from its supports and

used this as a makeshift stretcher.                 Photographers were clamouring to take

photographs     of    the    bodies, I wanted         to move     them so   they could be left

alone.      The man was put on the board,              and together with Police Constable

Mackay and 2 Liverpool fans who offered to help, we carried the body along

the pitch towards the gymnasium where I could see an ambulance.                      Nottingham

Forest fans cheered as we went past the kop, the body was taken up the ramp

at   that corner of         the   ground    and put    on the floor next to another body

there.      This was    the 2nd body to be brought here.                  The ambulance crew, I

think they were St Johns, moved the body, and as they did we made our way

back towards Leppings Lane.

Again we assisted           the   injured    in this   area and moved them away from the

goal mouth.      I was        starting      to realise   that     there   could be many deaths

incurred.     I got hold of a man who collapsed on the pitch.                     I put him in

the recovery position and again Police Constable Mackay cleared his airway.

A man claiming he was a doctor came and informed us he would be alright, it

was just exhaustion.

We began to go back to.-the fence area when an Inspector I didn't recognise

told myself,    Police Constables Mackay and Goddard to stand round the rear

of a newly arrived ambulance at the rear of the goal to prevent the crowd

from looking.        We began to do this but it was a complete waste of time due

to   insufficient     officers.        We    were   having   no    effect   whatsoever,   but   I

couldn't find the Inspector to tell him, so I returned to the gateway area

and helped form an archway of officers                 to pass the injured down into for

speed and protection.
A dead body was passed down so with Police Constable Mackay we placed him

on    a   board   and    with    other 'Liverpool        fans     jogged    towards       the Spion   Kop

corner of the pitch.             Once there we were directed into the gymnasium where

the body was unloaded.                There were about 10 bodies present at this time, I

believe, I was shocked as I saw the others.

We    took the board back for a stretcher and ran to the fence area again.

Once at the fence area I tried to get hold of someone being lifted above

the fence.        I turned to see if Police Constable Mackay was with me to help

but he wasn't,          there were so many people around it was impossible to see

him or anyone else             from my serial or that I knew.              As I turned to the fence

again     I   saw Chief Superintendent           Nesbit     make    his     way to the      fence.     He

looked to be trying to help people get over the fence, he then turned and

whilst facing me said,            "My God,      there could be 20 dead here".                 Somehow I

got hold of a young girl, maybe                 10 years, who was alive and crying,                   from

the   fence area.         I took her onto the pitch and took hold of a St Johns

ambulanceman       to    let    him    take   over     from me.      I    started   to try and find

someone I knew, eventually               seeing Police Constable           2507 Wilkes.       I was wet

through with sweat             and had lost my helmet               somewhere.        I      stood for a moment

with Police Constable Wilkes whilst I got my breath back, when an Inspector

took hold of my arm and told me to join the Police cordon being formed in

the middle of the pitch to stop any Liverpool fans who were upset causing

trouble       with Nottingham Forest           fans.     This I did.         From this position I

could see minor skirmishes break out in both stands, obviously between fans

who were upset and their rival supporters.                      I remained in the Police cordon

where I was then joined by Police Constable 2768 Goddard from my serial and

soon others arrived also from serial 9*
■Shortly after-,    I s«w Police    Sergeant    Jessop come   from the Leppings    Lane

side   of the pitch towards uS.      He was trying to locate     the remainder of the

serial.   The crowd was then dispersed and the cordon            was stood down.    We

were   told to go     to the North Stand       for a de-brief,   where Superintendent

Greenwood spoke to all those present.

A short time after we went onto the bus area on Penistone Road to ensure

that   fans   got   straight   on the buses    to take   them to the    train station.

There was no trouble at this location and everything was in order.

Once   the crowd was dispersed we were stood down and walked to Claywheels

Lane   for transport back to Woodseats         Police Station.   We    arrived back at

7•00 pm that date when I went off duty.

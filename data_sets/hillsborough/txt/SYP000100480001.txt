              At    8.30           am     on S a t u r d a y ,        15th       April    1989,         I started        a    tour       of    duty        at

              a     parade           at    Doncaster             Police          Station,        regarding        th e       F.A.       Cup    Semi

              Final           at     Hillsborough,                between Liverpool                     F.C.    and    Nottingham              Forest.

              I     was       to     work       in   company           w i t h PC       2584     Musi;,    attached           to    Serial          27,

              under           Sgt.        Mozley.           PC    Musk       and    myself         were    to    man     a    barrier          at       the

              Junction               of    Fielding            Road        and    Penistone         Road.        We    attended           in       the

             North            Stand        of    the      football           ground       at     9.45     am    for    the     match          briefing.

              After           th e      briefing          PC     Musk       and    myself        attended        at    our     point          at    10.45

              where           we     erected         t he      barrier.            Neither         PC    Musk    or    myself           were       issued

             with         a    radio,           only      Sgt.        Mosley       was    given         one.

              While           on     our      point       we     were       visited       several         times       by S g t .        Mosley          and a

              Inspector,                  whose      name        I do       not    know.         From     about       11.30        am    the       volume

              of     fans          began        to   increase              near    our    point,         there    was        a mixture             of

              Liverpool                 and     Nottingham             fans       all    mingled         together        and       walking          in

              opposite               directions,               there        were    no    public         order    incidents              due       to     the

             moving            of       fans     within          my    sight.           It w a s    however       apparent              from       th e

              outset           that        many      of     the       Liverpool          fans      who    passed       us     from       our       right

              to     lef t ,         who      were     aged       in       their    late       teens      and    twenties           were       drinking

              alcoholic                 beverages           that       they       had    obviously         purchased           from       an       off-

              licence              at     the    Junction             of    Penistone          Road      and Vere        Road.

Many    of     the       Liverpool             fans       were        carrying           between          A and           8     c ans      of    beer

or    lager,        or    large         plastic           bottles           of     drink.            They were                not     however

causing        problems.               Many         people        did       however           become          very        annoyed

especially            the    nearer            to    3.00        pm    it       got,     when       we    would           not       allow        them

access       along        Fielding             Road       to    take        a    short        cut    to       the      Leppings             Lane

end    of    t he     ground.

From    the       outset         of    our       "point"          many          Liverpool            fans a p p r o a c h e d              us    and

asked       us w h e r e     the        "ticket           touts"        were.            They        were informed                    that       we

had    not     seen any           and      we       believed           there          were     very       few about.                     Many      of

the    fans       were      surprised               by    this,        and       informed           us    that         there          were

many    "touts"           last        year      and       they        had       had     no    trouble             obtaining              tickets.

It w a s     apparent            that     all        these        f ans         had     no    tickets.               Al l      day       I heard

the    call       for     "spares",              "spares"             from Liverpool                 accents              as     they

searched          for     tickets.              T h e y were           even       asking        Nottingham                    fans.

Several        c a rs     stopped          on P e n i s t o n e         Road          near     to    us       including               a black

taxi    and       the     occupants,                all       Liverpool           fans        asked       for        directions                 to a

Public       House        called         'The B e e h i v e '           as       they        said    a    lot        of       Liverpool

people       were        meeting         there           as    they     knew          the     landlord.

From    E.AO        pm m a n y        f a ns    were          running           along        Penistone             Road,         in b o t h

directions,              obvi,btisly           rushing          to     the       turnstiles.                  A    lot        of L i v e r p o o l

fans    were        irate        because            we    would        not       allow        them access                 to F i e l d i n g

Road.       O.A.P.'s         and middle                  aged     people          with        toddlers             were        allowed

along       Fielding         Road        as      long as          they w a l k e d            along       the        centre           of    th e

road a n d        kept      away       from         the       parked        cars.            Only    about           15       to 2 0 w e r e

allowed       through.

At    3.00     pm we        were       joined            by P C 5 9 8           Stubbings           who       had      been manning                   the

other       end     of F i e l d i n g         Road.           He w a s         enroute        for       his       meal        to C l a y w h e e l s

Lane.        Myself         or P C       Musk        was       going        to    accompany              PC       S t u b b i n s , but          due

to    the    number         of    fans         s t il l       running        along           Penistone             Road,         we      delayed

going       for     our     meal,        u n til         it    became           l ess    b u sy .        Still        many          of     the

Liverpool         fans       wanted           access        along         Fielding             Road,        but       PC    Stubbins

informed        them        they       had     time       to     walk         round       as    there         were         about       2,000

fans     still        queuing          to     get    in.

At     about    3-20        pm we        were       informed             by    a lady          who     lives          in    Fielding          Road

that     she    had     heard          on     the    radio          or    TV       that    something              had       collapsed           in

the     ground        and    s o me      fans       had     been         crushed          to    de a t h .

Shortly        afterwards,                  fans,      s om e       still          drunk       an d    m a n y of       then visibly

shocked        and     crying,              walked        along          Penistone             Road        an d t o l d     us that

people        were     dying          inside        and     there         had       been       a pitch            invasion,            some of

the     fans    were        also       swearing           and       accusing          the       police           of    killing          people.

PC     Musk    and     myself          decided        not        to      totally          abandon           the       barrier,          but

fo r    just    PC     Musk       to     go    to    the       ground          and    leave           me    insitu,          as    we    ha d

not     received        any       direction           from          anyone.           Not       having           radios,          we    did

not     fully     appreciate                the     scale        of      the       situation           inside          the    ground.

1 asked        several           Senior        Officers,              who      passed          along        Penistone             Road,

heading        towards           the     ground       with          'Serials'             if we        were       required             inside,

but     I didn't        get       an y      response           or     direction.                Some        of    the      Liverpool

fans     who    passed           my    point        after        the      match       ha d      been        abandoned,             were

very     aggressive              towards          Police         Officers            and       due     to    numbers          of       these

fans     it    wa s    impossible              to    do     anything               about       it.         I had       occasion          to

stop     three        Liverpool             fans     wh o      begun          to    scuffle           with       each       other       after

Liverpool         fan       took       offence        an d       defended            the       P o l i c e action.

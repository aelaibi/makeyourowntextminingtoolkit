        L fUL,
You sent the Home Secretary a copy of your letter of 19 April to
the Chairman of the Police Complaints Authority asking the
Authority to institute an immediate enquiry into the propriety of
remarks passed by South Yorkshire police officers about the conduct
of fans at Hillsborough. You also asked whether guidelines exist
for the publication of statements once the judicial enquiry has
been announced.  In his reply. Sir Cecil referred this latter point
to the Home Office.

We are not aware of any guidelines which might bear upon a
non-statutory enquiry of this kind. We are, however, confident
that the enquiry, which is now being carried out by Lord Justice
Taylor, will establish the facts of what happened at Hillsborough,
regardless of whatever controversial remarks might have been made
at the time.

                                   FERRERS               .   /

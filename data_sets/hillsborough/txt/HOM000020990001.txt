FOOTBALL LICENSING AUTHORITY

Neil Kinfehan's note of 14 August refers. On page
2 he refers to the proposed appointment of members
to the Authority.

As the Interim Report makes 5 recommendations on
First Aid etc and as the provision of such facilities
is taking^an increasing importance, DOE may wish
to consider the appointment of an ex-member of the
ambulance service or medically qualified person as
a member of the Authority.

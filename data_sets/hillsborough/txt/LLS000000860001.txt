Dear Sir,

Re:    Hillsborough Disaster

I was at the meeting at the Law Library on Tuesday 25th April when members
of the Steering Committee were elected.

You did say during the course of the meeting that any statements of witnesses
should be s^t to you so that they could be taken to the enquiry which opens
on Friday.

I am dealing with a number of claims arising from the Hillsborough Disaster.
However the reason ths£.X write is because I was a witness to the events that
occurred outside the Leppings Lane end when the gates were opened by the
police and I enclose a brief statement I have made dealing with what I saw.

I am more than willing to give evidence if necessary and if I can be of
assistance to you in view of my first hand knowledge please do not hesitate
to contact me.

Yours sincerely,



PAUL   r    .   BERR'

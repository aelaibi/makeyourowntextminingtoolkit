                   BRTEF FOR PRIVATE OFFTCE

1.    ISSUE

1.1   What should be the CPS reaction to a potential re-trial of ex Chief
      Superintendent Duckenfield in the Hillsborough private prosecution.

2.    ACTION REQUIRED

2.1   For the Director's information (the DPP has previously indicated that he
      should not be involved in the case).

2.2   Consideration by the Casework Directorate of our response to a retrial being
      granted by the judge and any applications to us by the Hillsborough Family
      Support Group.

3.    TIMING

3.1   The HFSG meet with their legal team today to decide whether or not to apply
      for a retrial of Duckenfield.

3.2   Mr Justice Hooper, the trial judge, will decide on any application for a retrial
      in Leeds Crown Court on Wednesday 26 July 2000.

4.    BACKGROUND

4.1   The history of the Hillsborough private prosecution is well known.

4.2   The trial for manslaughter, Misconduct in a Public Office of the two most
      senior police officers on duty at the match in 1989 commenced inearly June..

4.3   Following legal argument in the course of the proceedings              only the
      manslaughter charges went before the jury.

4.4   On Friday 21 July ex Superintendent Murray was acquitted. At that time the
      jury were unable to come to a verdict on Duckenfield. On Monday 24 July
      they were still unable to reach a verdict and were discharged.

5.    KEY CONSIDERATIONS

5.1   While the HFSG has not yet contacted the CPS, we anticipate there may be an
      application by them for a contribution towards the costs of continuing the
      private prosecution, or a request that we take over the private prosecution of
      Duckenfield in order to continue it.

5.2   The HFSG may argue that the circumstances and the quality of the evidence
      have changed since the original CPS decisions not to prosecute the two police
      officers and not to intervene in the private prosecution (in order to discontinue
      it).
5.3   At an abuse hearing on 16 February 2000, Mr Justice Hooper stated that while
      the trial should take place he would reduce to a significant extent the anguish
      being suffered by the defendants; he made it clear that the two officers would
      not immediately lose their liberty should they be convicted. He accepted that
      his ruling was highly unusual.

5.4   The jury decision to acquit Murray confirms our review decision on the
      sufficiency of evidence against him. However, their inability to come to a
      decision re Duckenfield may indicate a slight shift in the balance of the
      evidence towards meeting the evidential test.

6.    RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1   The Crown Court have the power to make an order for certain prosecution
      costs of the first trial to be paid out of central funds, under section 17 of the
      Prosecution of Offences Act 1985. We should not become involved in the
       financial obligations of the private prosecutor.

6.2   If the CPS is requested to take over the prosecution in order to continue it, we
       should not be rushed into any decision. We will need to ensure that we are
       informed of any new evidence which may have come to light before or during
       trial. We should be willing to take representations from the parties to the
       prosecution as we did in our previous decision making process. If we still
       consider that our previous decisions on evidential sufficiency were correct,
       then we would only take over the case if new evidence was sufficiently
       significant to warrant a change in those decisions.

6.3   If we concluded that we should take over and prosecute the case then we
      would make our own decisions as to the legal team to be used at court. We
      would not be 'led' by the HFSG.

6.4   It is difficult to see how we could be involved in the case without taking it
      over in its entirety. It is likely to be all or nothing.

7.    CONCLUSION

7.1   Await tomorrow's court rulings before further consideration of any necessary
      action to be taken.

             BRIEF FOR PRIVATE OFFICE



ISSUE


What should be the CPS reaction to a potential re-trial of ex Chief
Superintendent Duckenfield in the Hillsborough private prosecution.


ACTION REQUIRED


Consideration by tne Casework: Directorate of our response to a retrial being
granted by the judge and any applications to us by the Hillsborough Family
Support Group.


TIMING


The HFSG meet with their legal team today to decide whether or not to apply
for a retrial of Duckenfield.


Mr Justice Hooper, the trial judge, will decide on any application for a retrial
in Leeds Crown Court on Wednesday 26 July 2000.


BACKGROUND


The history of the Hillsborough private prosecution is well known.


The trial for manslaughter, Misconduct in a Public Office of the two most
senior police officers on duty at the match in 1989 commenced in early June.<


Following legal argument in the course of the proceedings only the
manslaughter charges went before the jury.
4.4   Qn Friday 21 July ex Superintendent Murray was acquitted. At that time the
      /          ‘• 'C f V
          jury         unable to come to a verdict on Duckenfield. On Monday 24 July
          they were still unable to reach a verdict and were discharged.


5.    KEY CONSIDERATIONS

                                                                 < h \k u f& -
5.1   While the HFSG has not yet contacted the CPS, there may be an application
                                                             A

      by them for a contribution towards the costs of continuing the private
      prosecution, or a request that we take over the private prosecution of
      Duckenfield in order to continue it.


5.2   The HFSG may argue that the circumstances and the quality of the evidence
      have changed since the original CPS decisions not to prosecute the two police
      officers and not to intervene in the private prosecution (in order to discontinue
      it).


5.3   At an abuse hearing on 16 February 2000, Mr Justice Hooper stated that while
      the trial should take place he would reduce to a significant extent the anguish
      being suffered by the defendants; he made it clear that the two officers would
      not immediately lose their liberty should they be convicted. He accepted that
      his ruling was highly unusual.


5.4   The jury decision to acquit Murray confirms our review decision on the
      sufficiency of evidence against him. However, their inability to come to a
      decision re Duckenfield may indicate a slight shift in the balance of the
      evidence towards meeting the evidential test.

               should not be rushed into any decision. We will need to ensure that we are

Q.   Did the CPS consider taking over individual charges rather than the whole case?

A.   Our main consideration was the manslaughter charges. We considered that there
     might be a case to answer for these charges, although it was still our view that
     there was not enough evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction. At an early
      stage in the proceedings leading up to the trial, Mr Duckenfield faced a charge
     of attempting to pervert the course of justice. We felt that there was no case to
     answer on that charge and, following High Court proceedings, we took that
     charge over and discontinued it. Subsequently, a charge of misconduct by a
     public official, which was based on the same facts as the earlier attempting to
     pervert the course of justice charge, was pursued by the private prosecutor. We
     note that this charge was [dropped] [stayed] [?] and was not, therefore,
     considered by the jury.           ^U              IT . *

            Chris, please can you draft a question & answer on the taking over of the charge. As far as the 1998
            date for being asked by both parties to intervene, that's the info I have on my log, perhaps George can
            confirm?
           Given the proximity to the end of the trial, I think we should make this the last tweak before it goes to
            Chris Newell & private office.
           Thanks for all your work,

           Julie Seddon rang. She has some suggestions for amending the draft Press Notice. She will put them
           in and E mail/fax to us. W e discussed them - 1am happy. The draft is fairly well intact.
           She has suggested that we do a briefing for the Sheffield Star on the difference between the tests for
           prosecuting and the test for taking over private prosecutions. This seems a good idea - 1said we
           would assist (this might mean talking to a reporter for a bit). She did not suggest that the Liverpool
           Echo was a good idea given that paper's relationship with the HFSG.

             Just to round this off, I had a conference with Philip Sales and David Perry last week about
            declarations of incompatability and effect on prosecutions past present and future. After the con,
             David said that he thought we would interfere with the Code tests at our peril - ie we would be inviting .

            My impression of the Hillsborough case suggests there would not be any impact on the Code Review.
            I thought our decision on Hillsborough was based on the fact that although there was insufficient
            evidence according to the Code, this did not mean there was no evidence at all. This was why we did
            not take over the private prosecution and drop it as we could not say there was no case to answer.
            In these circumstances the Code is doing the job it is supposed to do while at the same time
            safeguarding the individual's right to bring a private prosecution. If I am wrong, let me know.

           Thanks Chris.
           W e are approaching the Code review on the basis that the Code tests (as opposed to their application)
           have not been directly criticised in any j.r. So if your worst case scenario came true we may have to do
           a radical rethink! Our current thinking (we are just about to run a tentative first draft past the D P P ) is
           that the code tests are about right - there is some tinkering with wording as we don't like the word test
           very much. There was a press release about the Code when we started the review but it does not
           help you much as it is more about the process than the content.
           If you can keep me posted on Hillsboro, I will copy you in the first draft once approved by DPP so you
           can see our emerging thinking.

           Just planning for worst case scenario!
           If there is a conviction in Hillsborough, we will face some very awkward questions about how we came
           to our decision not to prosecute in the first place. This could have a knock on effect for the Code
           review. I will copy you into our draft press briefing on the case. Can you have a think about how we will
           answer questions like 'This leaves the Code without any credibility' and 'what are you going to do
           about the Code', etc.
           W e will have an initial stab - but if there is any press briefing re the Code review generally it would be
           helpful to have that. (I recollect seeing some a little while ago).

           one point in particular - what do we say if asked who counsel was who advised us? (In case you did
           not know, there were two, one was Gareth Williams - name sound familiar?)
           If the prosecution fails, I suggest that we say very little and certainly do not say anything which could

                                    They were accused of failing
                                 to stop fans surging through a
                                  tunnel on to a packed terrace.
                                    Mr Murray told the trial he
                                  felt a “sense of responsibility"
                                  and realised many victims' rel­
                                  atives blamed him.
                                    But he insisted he had not
                                  thought any lives were in dan­
                                  ger on the terrace where the
                                  fans were crushed. And if he
                                  had, he would have acted.
                                    The private prosecution was
                                  brought by victims’ families
                                  after the Crown Prosecution
                                  Service declined -to lake action.

                                            Mr Murray was second In command of the
                                          police operation at the 1989 FA Cup semi­
                                          final between Liverpool and Notts Forest

                                          55, were accused of causing the disaster by
                                          foiling to prevent a fatal crowd crush-
                                            As 5,000 Liverpool fens surged into the
                                          ground moments before kick-off, the offi­
                                          cers opened exit gates to ease congestion at
                                          the turnstiles.
                                            Supporters than raced inside the stadium,
                                          along a tunnel, on to the packed, fenced in
                                          terraces - sparking a massive crash.
                                            By 3.06 pm - when the game was stopped -
                                          96 were dead or dying.

                                            The two officers were charged with the
                                          manslaughter of supporters John
                                          Anderson, 62, and James Aspinall, 19, in a
                                          private prosecution brought by the
                                          Hillsborough Family Support Group.
                                            The prosecution said the two victims

                                            Mr Murray was cleared by the jury after
                                          over 21 hours, following a six-week trial

                                          to allow Cans to surge inside.
                                            They claimed they should
                                          have ordered officers to block
                                          off the tunnel leading to the
                                          crowded terraces.

                                          solicitor Richard Manning said:

                      HILLSBOROUGH - PRESS BRIEFING

Acquittal

Line to take: The CPS recognise the statutory right of members of the public to bring
a private prosecution, subject to certain controls to prevent abuse. We would only
take over such a prosecution where there was a particular need to do so on behalf of
the public. This was not seen to be the case here as a number of CPS reviews,
supported by the advice from senior and experienced counsel, considered that there
was not a realistic prospect of conviction by a jury.

Questions

Does the CPS feel vindicated now that the defendants have been acquitted?

Answer: It is not a matter of 'vindication' but of what must be seen as a fair treatment
for both victims and defendants. The CPS reviewed this difficult and sensitive case in
accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors in order to ensure that we played our
part in seeing that justice was done. To that end it was right and proper that the
private prosecutor was allowed to proceed.

This now proves that the CPS were right in the first place?

Answer: No, it proves that the trial jury did not disagree with the CPS overall
assessment of the case.

Will the CPS pick up the bill on behalf of the tax payer for the Hillsborough Family
Support Group

Answer: No, a private prosecution that is not taken over by the Crown would only be
privately funded or come under the Legal Aid system. The court, however, has the
power to make what is termed a 'defendants costs order’ out of central funds and in
favour of the accused following an acquittal. See section 16 of the Prosecution of
Offences Act 1985.


Conviction

Line to take: This case was reviewed at the highest levels of the CPS following
advice from senior and experienced counsel. We applied the principles contained
within the Code for Crown Prosecutors and came to the conclusion that there was 'not
a realistic prospect of conviction'. 'Not a realistic prospect' does not mean 'no
prospect'. This was a difficult and sensitive case where the verdict of the jury has
demonstrated that in the end it is not the opinion of learned lawyers that matters but
that of the ordinary person in the street who is called to give jury service.


Questions

How can HFSG have won when CPS would not prosecute?
Answer: The application of the criminal justice system is not a matter of winning or
losing for the CPS but of ensuring that justice is seen to be done. This is the case
here.

Which counsel advised the CPS back in 1990?

Answer: It would be improper and a breach of confidentiality for the CPS to discuss
aspects of a case that were not aired before the jury in open court.

Will the CPS pay the costs of the prosecution?

Answer: In the normal course of events the successful prosecutor in a criminal
prosecution will be able to claim some or all of their costs, as are just and reasonable,
from the convicted defendants. It is a matter for the trial judge to decide. See section
18 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985.

What was the involvement of the DPP?

Answer: It would be improper and a breach of confidentiality for the CPS to discuss
aspects of a case that were not aired in open court. However it can be said that the
DPP felt that it would not be in the interests of justice for him to be involved in any
decision making in this particular case.

Who made the decision not to prosecute in 1990. What about 1998?

Answer: In both cases the decision was taken by some of the most senior and
experienced lawyers in the CPS, and who were supported by advice from independent
leading counsel in 1990.

Why would CPS not prosecute?

Answer: It was considered after a great deal of deliberation that the evidential test
from tiie Code for Crown Prosecutors was not met. That is, we were not satisfied that
there was enough evidence to provide a 'realistic prospect of conviction' against each
defendant on each charge. A realistic prospect of conviction is an objective test. It
means that a jury or bench of magistrates, properly directed in accordance with the
law, is more likely than not to convict the defendant of the charge alleged. The lack
of a realistic prospect of conviction does not mean 'no prospect of conviction'.

This proves that the CPS will not prosecute police officers doesn’t it?

Answer: No, the CPS will always apply consistently and fairly the Code for Crown
Prosecutors regardless of personal views of the ethnic or racial origin, sex, religious
beliefs, political or sexual preferences, or even the job and status in life of an accused
person.

This conviction casts doubt on the results of the scrutiny by Lord Justice Stuart-
Smith?
Answer: No, as regards the CPS the Scrutiny did not consider the merits of the 1990
decision not to prosecute, but only whether or not any fresh evidence that had come to
light since then might have had a bearing on that earlier review decision. Lord Justice
Stuart-Smith came to the conclusion that none of the evidence that he was asked to
consider added anything significant to the evidence which was available to Lord
Taylor’s Inquiry or to the Inquests.

This is yet another example of CPS incompetence.

Answer: In any criminal prosecution there are always two sides to the same story.
The prosecutor in a case, whether a private person or acting on behalf of the Crown,
has the burden of proving their case to the high standard of proof required by the law,
that of 'Beyond a Reasonable Doubt’. It was not considered by the CPS, supported by
advice from independent leading counsel, that we could meet fulfil that burden before
a jury. We did consider that we could be wrong on that point and therefore we
allowed the private prosecutor to continue the proceedings. We were not able to say
that there was clearly no case for the defendants to answer, that is, there was no
prospect of a conviction. In the end our judgement was found to be faulty and we
must accept that and endeavour to learn from the experience.

                  HILLSBOROUGH - PRESS BRIEFING


ACQUITTAL


Line to take: The CPS recognise the statutory right of members of the public to bring
a private prosecution. The CPS will step in to stop a private prosecution where it is
felt that there is clearly no case for the defendant to answer. In the Hillsborough case,
we considered that there might be a case to answer; this is why we did not step in and
take over the manslaughter charges. The CPS view of the case overall was that there
was not a realistic prospect of conviction and this was supported by independent
senior counsel.


Questions


1. Does the CPS feel vindicated now that the defendants have been acquitted?


Answer: It is not a matter of 'vindication'. We consider that we acted properly
throughout this case both in deciding not to start a prosecution in the first place and
not to stop the private prosecution for manslaughter.


2. This now proves that the CPS were right in the first place?


Answer: We acknowledge that this case was a very difficult one from many points of
view. We respect the right of those who wish to bring private prosecutions.


3. Does the CPS apply the tests in the Code for Crown Prosecutors in deciding
   whether to take over a private prosecution?


Answer: There are a number of different situations. We will take over and stop a
private prosecution where we consider that there is clearly no case to answer or where
the public interest factors against prosecution clearly outweigh those in favour. The
‘clearly no case to answer’ test is different from the ‘realistic prospect of conviction’

test set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors. This approach was considered and
approved by the High Court at an earlier stage in the Hillsborough case.


4. Will the CPS pick up the bill on behalf of the tax payer for the Hillsborough
   Family Support Group


Answer: No. [Depends whether court makes order]. [The Crown Court may make an
order for prosecution costs to be paid out of central funds, under s. 17 of the
Prosecution of Offences Act 1985]


CONVICTION


Line to take: This case has always been considered at a very high level in the CPS.
In 1990, we took advice from senior and experienced counsel.           We applied the
principles contained in the Code for Crown Prosecutors and came to the conclusion
that there was 'not a realistic prospect of conviction'. 'Not a realistic prospect' does
not mean 'no prospect'. We recognise that there will always be a small number of
cases where we decide that there is not a realistic prospect of conviction but a
conviction following a private prosecution actually results.




Questions


5. How can HFSG have won when CPS would not prosecute?


Answer: The application of the criminal justice system is not a matter of winning or
losing for the CPS but of ensuring that justice is done and seen to be done.


6 . Which counsel advised the CPS back in 1990?


Answer: We do not specify who advised us and we do not propose to depart from our
normal practice in this case.

in any decision making in this particular case.

10. Why would CPS not prosecute?


Answer: After a great deal of deliberation we concluded that the evidential test in the
Code for Crown Prosecutors was not met. In other words, we were not satisfied that
there was enough evidence to provide a ’realistic prospect of conviction’ against each
defendant on each charge.^ A realistic prospect of conviction is an objective test. It
means that a jury or bench of magistrates, properly directed in accordance with the
law, is more likely than not to convict the defendant of the charge alleged. The fact
that our view that there was not a realistic prospect of conviction does not mean that
there was 'no prospect of conviction'.


11. This proves that the CPS will not prosecute police officers doesn’t it?


4 July 2000. Ver 1.2
Answer: No, the CPS will always consistently and fairly apply the Code for Crown
Prosecutors regardless of personal views of the ethnic or racial origin, sex, religious
beliefs, political or sexual preferences of an accused person. Further, we apply the
Code for Crown Prosecutors in exactly the same way where the accused person is a
police officer.


12. This conviction casts doubt on the results of the scrutiny by Lord Justice Stuart-
    Smith?


Answer: No, as regards the CPS the Scrutiny did not consider the merits of the 1990
decision not to prosecute, but only whether or not any fresh evidence that had come to

Stuart-Smith came to the conclusion that none of the evidence that he was asked to
consider added anything significant to the evidence which was available to Lord
Taylor's Inquiry or to the Inquests, upon which the CPS decision in was based.


13. This is yet another example of CPS incompetence.


Answer: See answer to number 10 above.


In any criminal prosecution there ore always twe side3 to the story- The prosecutor-ia
a case, whether a private person or acting on behalf of the Crow% has the burden of
proving their case to the-high standard-of proof required by the law, that of'Beyond a
Reasonable Doubt'.—It was not considered by- the CPS; supported by advice from
independent leading counsel, that-we-eould meet fulfil that burden-before a jury- We
acknowledge, however,-the outcome of this case.


We did consider that we could be wrong on that point and therefore we allowed the
private prosec-utor- to continuo the proceedings.—Wo were not able to say that-there
waselearly no case for the dofendanta to answer, that is, there was no prospect of a
conviction. In the end our j-udgement was found to be faulty and wo must accept that
and endeavour-to-learn from the experience-.



4 July 2000. Ver 1.2
14. Surely this means that the Code for Crown Prosecutors is now without any
    credibility?


No. In any event, the Code is being reviewed at the moment. We think that the
realistic prospect of conviction test is set at the right level. If the threshold for
prosecution were to be lowered, that would result in many more prosecutions being
undertaken only to result in acquittal. Nevertheless, we have sought views on whether
the Code can be improved and we are considering very carefully the responses to a
consultation exercise [does this raise expectations?] [add more here?]. It is important
not to change everything on the basis of the result of one case even where that case is
a high profile one.

throughout this case in deciding not to start a prosecution in the first place and not to
stop the private prosecution for manslaughter.


2. This now proves that the CPS were right in the first place?


Answer: We looked at the case in 1990, 1997 and again in 1998 after Lord Justice
Stuart-Smith's report. We are not surprised at the court's decision as we considered the
evidence very thoroughly and we sought counsel's advice before reaching the decision
on each occasion that there was insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of
conviction.




3. Does the CPS apply the tests in the Code for Crown Prosecutors in deciding
   whether to take over a private prosecution?
Answer: There are a number of different situations. We will take over and stop a
private prosecution where we consider that there is clearly no case to answer or where
the public interest factors against prosecution clearly outweigh those in favour. The
‘clearly no case to answer’ test is different from the ‘realistic prospect of conviction’
test set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors. This approach was considered and
approved by the High Court at an earlier stage in the Hillsborough case.

Answer: No. [Depends whether court makes order]. [The Crown Court may make an
order for prosecution costs to be paid out of central funds, under s. 17 of the
Prosecution of Offences Act 1985]




CONVICTION


Line to take: This case has always been considered at a very high level in the CPS.
In 1990, we took advice from senior and experienced counsel. We applied the
principles in the Code for Crown Prosecutors, which says there must be enough
evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction against each defendant on each charge.
We came to the conclusion that there was insufficient evidence for a realistic
prospect of conviction. This does not mean there was no evidence whatsoever; we did
not consider that there was sufficient evidence to bring a case before the court.


In 1998 we were asked by both parties to take over the private prosecution and either
proceed with it ourselves, or drop it. Generally, we only intervene in private
prosecutions in exceptional circumstances. In the light of our earlier decisions not to
prosecute, we could not take it over and proceed.


We considered whether to take it over and discontinue the case but to do that we must
be satisfied there is clearly "no case to answer". The basis of this position is that any
private prosecution started without evidence to establish a case to answer would be
an abuse of the right to bring a prosecution.



Clearly there is a distinction between the "realistic prospect of conviction" test in the
Code which the CPS uses to review cases and the "no case to answer" test. In practice
this means that there will be a small number of cases which do not meet the CPS test
under the Code but where there is a case to answer. Where this happens, the CPS will
not intervene but will allow the private prosecution to go ahead. To apply the Code
tests to private prosecutions would unfairly limit the right of individuals to bring their
own cases, a right which is recognised by the law.


In these circumstances it follows that there may occasionally be cases where we
decided there was not a realistic prospect of conviction and stood aside, yet the case
ended in a conviction. This does not mean we should have decided to prosecute but
that we have acted in the interests of the individual to maintain the right to bring a
private prosecution for a court to decide the outcome.


Questions


1. How can HFSG have won when CPS would not prosecute?


Answer: See Line above


2. Which counsel advised the CPS back in 1990?


Answer: We do not normally specify who advised us and we do not propose to depart
from our normal practice in this case.


3. Will the CPS pay the costs of the prosecution?


Answer: No. [Various orders can be made under sections 16-18 of the Prosecution of
Offences Act 1985: this answer is to be worked up when the result is known and the
court has made any orders as to costs].
4. What was the involvement of the DPP?


Answer: The DPP was not involved as he had previously given advice to one of the
parties in the private prosecution before he took up his post as head of the CPS in
November 1998.


5. Who made the decision not to prosecute in 1990. What about 1998?


Answer: In both instances the decision was taken by some of the most senior and
experienced lawyers in the CPS. The 1990 decision was supported by advice from
independent leading counsel. [ If asked - we did not consider it necessary to take
counsel’s opinion in 1998].


6. Why would CPS not prosecute?


Answer: See Line above.


7. This proves that the CPS will not prosecute police officers doesn’t it?


Answer: No, the CPS will always consistently and fairly apply the Code for Crown
Prosecutors. It does not matter whether the accused person is a police officer or
any other member of society. The fact that a defendant is in a position of
authority or trust is a factor in favour of prosecution which we will take into
account in deciding whether a prosecution is needed in the public interest.


8. This conviction casts doubt on the results of the scrutiny by Lord Justice
Stuart-Smith?


Answer: No, as regards the CPS, the Scrutiny did not consider the merits of the 1990
decision not to prosecute, only whether or not any fresh evidence that had come to
light since then might have had a bearing on that earlier review decision. Lord Justice
Stuart-Smith came to the conclusion that none of the evidence that he was asked to
consider added anything significant to the evidence which was available to Lord
Taylor's Inquiry or to the Inquests, upon which the CPS decision was based.




9. This is yet another example of CPS incompetence.


Answer: No, see Line above. We have acted perfectly properly.


10. Surely this means that the Code for Crown Prosecutors is now without any
credibility?


(do not anticipate this question being asked - but nice to have an answer ready
just in case)


No. In any event, the Code is being reviewed at the moment. We think that the
realistic prospect of conviction test is set at the right level. If the threshold for
prosecution were to be lowered, that would result in many more prosecutions being
undertaken only to result in acquittal. It is important not to change everything on the
basis of the result of one case even where that case is a high profile one.


11. Any other high profile private prosecutions?


Answer: The Stephen Lawrence case; Kent rape case defendant Christopher Davies
sentenced to 14 years in April 1996.


12. Did the CPS consider taking over individual charges rather than the whole
case?


Answer: Our main consideration was the manslaughter charges. We considered that
there might be a case to answer for these charges, although it was still our view that
there was not enough evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction. There were other
charges, though. At an early stage in the proceedings leading up to the trial, Mr
Duckenfield faced a charge of attempting to pervert the course of justice. We felt that
there was no case to answer on that charge and, following High Court proceedings,
we took that charge over and discontinued it. Subsequently, the private prosecutor
sought to proceed on the same charge after committal; the Attorney General entered a
‘nolle prosequi’ which prevented that charge from proceeding further. A charge of
misconduct by a public official against Mr Duckenfield, which was based on the same
facts as the earlier attempting to pervert the course of justice charge, was pursued by
the private prosecutor. This charge was quashed after legal argument, without the
involvement of the CPS or the Attorney General. Finally, the private prosecutor
sought to proceed on a charge of misconduct by a public official against both Mr
Duckenfield and Mr Murray, based on the same facts as the manslaughter charges.
We understand this charge was withdrawn by the private prosecutor following judicial
comment.

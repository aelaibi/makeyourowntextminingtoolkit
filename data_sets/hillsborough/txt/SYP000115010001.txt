NOTE FOR FILE:


HILLSBOROUGH - CONTRIBUTION ACTION


Had meeting this date with Peter Metcalf (Hammond Suddards) with reference
to the letter attached dated 25 May 1990 on the subject above.

We, the South Yorkshire Police, are suing certain other parties including
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club,     Eastwoods Consulting Engineers and,
possibly Sheffield City Council and the television companies, for their
part of the compensation already paid and to be paid by ourselves.

The following action is required:-



1. Action Team

The Action Team will be re-activated, probably on a smaller basis than
previously and possibly in the early stages organised on a part-time basis.

The Team will prepare a report for my signature addressed to Superintendents
Murray, Greenwood and Marshall together with all officers of inspector rank
upwards who on 15 April 1989 had responsibilities at the Leppings Lane end
of the ground from the pitch, through the concourse including the turnstiles
and also the outer perimeter area where management of the crowd approaching
the ground was a responsibility.

 The purpose of the report will be to inform them that the contribution action
 is scheduled to commence on Saturday 2 October 1990 and will outline in
 broad terms the intention of the proceedings, namely, to determine degrees
 of liability between the parties involved.

 Further that whilst at this stage it is impossible to say who in terms of
 police witnesses will be called it may be that a number of officers will
 be required to give evidence in support of the police case.       It is also
 possible that the other parties may call police witnesses on their behalf.

 Once more precise information is available all concerned will be notified
 so that those both attending and not attending will be aware of the position.
 Officers should avoid taking     annual leave   during the month commencing
 1 October and if any leave is already booked then we need to know in order
 to inform our solicitors.


 2. Tavlor Report

 The Taylor Report will be used at the Trial and its findings accepted as
 evidence except where the various parties have indicated they do not wish
 this to occur.   Attached is an abstract from the Interim Report which has
been marked as to the areas where we do not agree judicial notice of the
contents.  This decision has been arrived at after long consultation between
Mr Woodward and Peter Metcalf.

We are asked to consider the same document to see if there are other parts
which we would advise be not admitted in evidence.       The lawyers make the
point that this is in no way a brain-storming exercise.        The purpose of
the contribution action is to apportion liability between the parties and
it is therefore very different from a normal- civil action.

The Action Team will consider the abstract and if they can identify any
area where additional JudicTial notice should not be agreed then they will
indicate that area with reasoned argument as to their decision.

Peter Metcalf is sending a copy to Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and
Superintendents Murray, Greenwood and Marshall for them to make comment
before the final version is served.    The service date is 22 June and our
considerations must be completed well before this date.

Once a consolidated abstract is available     which identifies those parts
thereof with which we do not agree together with those other parts     which
the other parties also disagree, then it will be sensible to circulate these
to the police witnesses we will call and to hold a meeting to discuss the
logic of our disagreement so that in evidence they can take this into
account.

Additional tasks for the Action Team ares-

   a.    To decide if it is sensible for us to agree with the HSE
         calculation that circa 2,000 fans entered Gate ’C ’ on the^.
         second opening.                                           ^

   b.     1988 tunnel closure - ex-sergeant Higgins has given a
         statement to West Midlands Police saying in essence in 1988          >"■
         just before the kick-off he "received orders to close the
         tunnel because the pens were full*.

         Other officers have said they remember the same instruction
         being given but none of them by whom.

          It is believed that none of the      above   was   actually given
          in evidence at the public Inquiry.

          Two Liverpool fans - Peter Metcalf to supply names - have
          given statements that they” saw stewards and police sealing
          the gate and in fact there were more stewards than police
          officers.

          The above needs to be pursued.     Who was on duty at that
          end of the ground in 1988?    What do any of these officers
          remember of the tunnel closure and alleged verbal order
          to do that?   It may be that the instruction to close the
          gate came from the Club.     If it can be shown that many
          stewards were involved then the Club through their agents
          (stewards) should have known of this and their arrangements
          subsequently, ie 1989, seemed to have failed to take account
        ' of the 1988 experience which increases their liability.

              Plan                                    e

       Peter Metcalf has been informed by West Midlands Police that they do not
       have such a plan.    We need to collate the evidence given to the recent
       Inquest and to prepare a plan, possibly colour coded for ease of reference,
",   ^ showing the location of the 95 deceased before the crushing and afterwards
       highlighting movements through the crowd whenever appropriate.


      5. Summer 1985                                      --   -

      There is evidence of correspondence between County, the police and Eastwoods
      concerning new fences and of the police asking for an additional gate in
      the radial fences. Copies of any correspondence on this issue by all parties
      to be recovered and highlighted together with any information we have as
      to why the police made this request.

 OURREF.         PCM/



 Dear Peter,
  H il ls borough

  There was a f u r t h e r directions hearing b e fore Mr. Justice Rose on
  o l t h Mav w h e n a n Order was made fixing the commencement d a t e of
  the trial of t h e contribution action as Tuesday, 2nd O c tober.       The
  trial will take p l a c e in M a n c h e s t e r .

  For reasons to w h i c h I shall refer below, neither I nor Counsel yet
  know which So u t h Yorkshire Police O f f i c e r s we shall wish to call as
  witnesses          It m a y well be that the t r i a l is largely c oncerned-with
  expe r t e v i d e n c e a n d legal argument, w i t h the factual background
  beinq either a g r e e d or put in by refe re n c e to statements or
  transcripts of ev i d e n c e given to the Inquiry.            Nevertheless, I
  think that it w o u l d be prudent to w a r n those Officers who are most
  likelv to be called.             David Duckenfield is an obvious candidate
  but    as he is suspended from duty, I think that I should write
  direct to his Solicitors.             Officers w h o might be warned via

                       u p discussed a little while ago the question of the extent

               trial and I indicated that, at that time, I saw no need for a
        fnll time Officer or team of Officers,              various items are now coming
        £               ab o ut which I will be writing to you separately and, if you
                   th i s can be accommodated, I wo u l d suggest that the t i m e is now
        c o m i n g w h e r e a small t e a m of Officers would be of great assistance.

  D e a r Peter,

  Hillsborough

 At our meeting yesterday we discussed various matters which I hope
                     These ierl? t9kS further ln Preparation for the contribution

             1.      Whether we should accept the H.S.E. estimate of
                       about two thousand people entering the ground
                       through Gate C at the second opening.

             2.      Whether we can get to the bottom of the evidence
                       relating to the closing of the tunnel in 1988,
                       This with particular reference to evidence from
                       Liverpool fans about stewards being concerned
                       in this closure.

            3.       Whether there may be available -copies of press
                       cuttings of statements issued by Bert K c Gee
                       on his retirement.

            4.       Whether it night be possible for you tc prepare
                       a comprehensive p lan of the location of fatalities
                       working from the individual plans produced at the
                       Inquest hearings.

            5.       Whether anyone can remember what ’was the reason for
                       the Police suggesting that there ought to be a
                       second gate in at least one of the radial fence?

           when alterations were being made to the ground
           in the summer of 1985.

In connection with these matters,   I have the following further comments

     1.     I would not suggest that a lot of work is
                done on this but if w or k has already
                been carried out which casts doubt on
                the H.S.E.: figures then I would like .to
                know.

     2.     The officers who gave statements about this
                matter to the Y7est Midlands Enquiry were
                P.C. 2981 Barnes, P.C. 205 Beardshall,
                P.C. 78 Booth, P.C. 229 Cable, P.C. 1157
                Castleton, P.C. 451 Cooper, P.C. 120
                Harris, former P.S. Trevor Higgins, P.C.
                1051 Hobson, P.C. 2528 Hughes, P.C. 138
                Saunders, P.C. 2517 Shelton and P.C. 3017
                Smalley.   There may be others.       It can be
                seen that some of these officers indicate
                that there was a cordon across the tunnel
                and some state clearly that there was not.
                What interests me is the cross-reference
                 to evidence given by a Mr. Eccleston to
                 the enquiry, recorded at transcript day 6
                 page 21E and page 26£ to the effect that
                 there was a joint cordon of stewards and
                 Police with, in the witness* view, more
I                stewards than Police.      This is to some extent
                 borne out by the evidence of the witness
                 Mayhew (day 5, P. 1 5 0 D ) , although this is
                 not as cogent.   This is particularly
                 significant because the Taylor report is
                 quite critical of our a lleged failure to
                 pick up the blocking of the tur.nel on
                 a debrief.   If stewards were also involved,
                  then the failure on the part of the club
                  is at least as great and if the instruction,
                  or request,to block the tunnel came from
                  stewards or from Mr. Lock then the clu b ’s
                  responsibility is correspondingly increased.

      3.     There may be something in these remarks which Is
                 of interest or which could be useiul in cross-
                 examination of the club.

        4.          The preparation of such a. plan is an essential
                        part of our case that the collapse of the
                        barrier was the factor which turned an already
                        serious incident into a major disaster,      it
                        cannot be denied that there w ou l d have been
                        fatalities and serious injuries in the absence
                        of that collapse because it is clear that
                        there were some fatalities in p e n 4.   The
                        evidence which we already have does tend to
                        show, hoever, that much of the fatality occurred
                        in the area in front of the collapsed'barrier.
£                       At present our evidence consists of the rather
                        limited plan placed before the Enquiry and the
                        factual statements of the officers directly
                        concerned in the rescue.   My feeling is that
                        this evidence would be stronger if presented
                        as a single plan prepared from the material
                        produced at the Inquest.   We have an Order that
                        such material can be received in evidence at
                        the trial and it would be much more difficult
                        for our opponents to attack a plan prepared
                        directly from the Inquest material than it
                        would be in respect of a case dependant
                        principally on oral evidence.

        5.       The reference here is to a letter of 2nd May 1985
                       from South Yorkshire C.C. to Eastwoods, their
                       response of 8th May 1985 and finally the
                       South Yorkshire C.C.   response to Eastwoods
                       of 10th May 1985.   You will see that in the
£                     last letter there is a reference to the
w                     proposed additional gate in the radial fences
                      being included primarily at the request of
                       the South Yorkshire Police.
       As  you know', I am away now on holiday until 18th June but
Belinda    Norcliffe will be available here if there are any matters wh< ch
y o u wish to discuss.

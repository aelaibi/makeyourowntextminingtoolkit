            16th November 1990

            50/ES100/KJH




            Dear Minister,


            You will be aware that    "The Taylor Report" recommendations
            impose on association F o o t b a l l clubs the obligation to make
            stadiums all seater within a given period.

            At Southampton we have a particular problem arising f r o m the
            shape and size of the site, the problem can be best dealt
            with by the acquiring of a suitable alternative site and the
            building of a new community stadium.

             I would wish to make representation to you relating to the
             financing of such a project and the taxation implications.

             The profit on sale of the existing site can for corporation
             tax purposes be "rolled over" against the cost of a new
             stadium and no taxation arises.  However the sale of other
             assets i.e. land, houses etc., and for that matter revenue
             assets such as players under contract do not enjoy "Roll
             over relief" even though the proceeds realised be applied
             against the new stadium costs.




                                                                                                               cont/d



Directors: F.G.L. Askham, FCA (Chairman), K. St. J. Wiseman (Vice Chairman)

                                     -2-

It would be of material a ssistance to the clubs who are
planning Area Comm unity stadiums, or reconstructing
existing stadiums, if to finance the project taxation relief
could be allowed on the cost of the land and buildings as if
these were wholly allowable against Trading and Capital
Gains profits.  It would of course imply that any
subsequent disposal of the stad i u m in part or in whole
would be subject to taxation on the full proceeds.

I would be obliged if you w o u l d raise this with the Treasury
and trust it may have your support.

Your sincerely,




F G L ASKH AM

                 I am a Police Sergeant               in the South Yorkshire Poli ce at present

                 stat ioned at the Probationer Trai ni ng D ep ar tm ent , Ecclesfield.             On the

                 date of this i nc i dent I was attached to West Bar Police Stat ion, D1

                 Sub-Division but seconded to C.P.U Harrogate on a Police Trainers

                 Course.



                 At 8 am (0800)          on Saturday 15th A p r i 1 1989 (15041989) I attended at

                 within the Sub-Division with regard to the F .A Cup fixture at

                 Hillsborough Football ground between Nottingham Forest and Liverpool F

                 C.



                 At 9 am (0900) that day I attended at a briefing and was allocated

                   All these officers were known to me and all were

 experienced Policemen.         Our brief was to patrol Pond Street Bus

 Station to receive and direct football supporters trave 11ing by coach

 and service bus.        We were then required to go to the Midland Railway^

 Station to again receive supporters and assist             in the boarding of

 Notti ngham F orest supporters onto P S V ’S destined for the Hillsborouqh

 g round.



 At 2.25 pm (1425)        I arrested

                                                               for being drunk and

 disorderly.        Many of the supporters were the worse for drink.             Where

 they were clearly drunk they were        refused admission to the buses,              but

 due to manpower        constraints were not arrested unless they were

 disorderly.



 After the arrival        of the last train I acquired a spare Transit van and

 the Serial        commenced a public order patrol    in the City Centre.         At

 about 3 pm (1500) we were directed by West Bar Control Room to attend

 at Hillsborough football ground where a serious             public order situation

 was developing.



 At 3.10 pm (1510) we arrived at the ground entering the stadium by the

 main gates in Penistone Road.



 R,adio communications on the football         channel seemed to be inoperative

 and despite a number of attempts        I was unable to receive         instructions

 for deployment.        PS DYSON went to the Police Room under the North
                                                                                          PAGE    3
                                                                                          S3618

           Standi and was      instructed to stand by with other officers at the top of

           the ramp at the Spion Hop end of the ground.            We were then instructed

           by Inspec^of- WHITE to go onto the track and face the crowd ir. the

           North S t a n d .   Many of the spectators were extremely angry and were

           indicating towards the Leppings Lane end of the ground where a scene

           of great disorder was apparent.


                                      M ///
           At this point Superintendent MURRAY instructed the Serial              to go

           towards the Leppings Lane end.          We went to that part of the ground

           where we were met by Inspector WHITE who instructed me to use my men

           to return supporters, who were on the pitch,           into the Leppings Lane

           te r rac e.   It was obvious to me that these supporters were very

           distressed and shocked, although at this point I was still               unaware of

           what had hap pe ne d .     I realised that to attempt to obey this

           i nst ruct ion would be unreasonable and inappropriate.           I did not pass

           on this order but told the Serial members to remain in pairs and

           render what assistance they could.           As we moved nearer to the terraces

           * saw many people        injured and some clearly d e a d .   PC BEVIS went to

    *n      ne man who appeared to be dead and commenced to attempt               resuscitation.

           He was assisted by PC ALLEN who was by now c 1early very distressed,

    |    x ^The man in question h a d , in my view, been dead for some time and I

           tried to persuade PC 8EVIS to give up his a t t em pt s.         He   refused and

           cont inued to t r y , in vai n, to br i ng him round.     He only ceased t ryi ng

           when the man was taken away on a make shift stretcher.



           At this point a fireman requested assistance with making a path

           through the South terrace          in order that equipment    could be brought in.

           Myself, PC REEVES, PC BLACK, PC PEEL, PC HAGUE and STOKES formed a

           clear path,     but other officers arrived and were unsupervised.              I

8          i nst ructed them to mai ntai n the pathway and returned with the other
                                                                                           PAGE         4
                                                                           /       ,       S3618
  fa                                                                      /viKotf
            officers to the pitch.             We were then joined by a PS STUTCHFIELD who

                required men for duties outside the ground.           He took four or five

            members of the Serial but I cannot             remember exactly who.       I then lost

            contact with most of the Serial members.               I took it upon myself to

            ass ist officers who we re he 1 pi ng injured and moving dead bodi e s .             Many

            of these offiers were extremely distressed and we re openly weeping.

            I endeavoured to comfort them and maintain their morale.



            Some time later I was asked by an Inspector to obtain men to provide a

            cordon across the centre of the pitch,              north to south,   to prevent

            rival supporters            clashing.   By this time the fans were extremely angry

            and agitated and such a cordon had become necessary.
            r
        /
            At 4.15 pm (1615)             I made my way back to the Midland Railway Stat ion

            arriving at 4.40 pm (1640).              I there saw PC BEVIS and Sergeant DYSQN

            but I do not recall seeing any other members of the Serial.                  PC BEVIS

   lv       was in such a state of distress that             I instructed him to return to
vt/
 '
            Ulest Bar with a view to retiring from duty,



            The returning supporters were very subdued and the departures went

            without         incident.



            At 5.50 pm (1750)            I returned to Uiest Bar for a debrief session,      having

            ensured the well being of all members of the Serial.                  I prepared a

            file     regarding                 (Drunk and Disord erl y), completed pocket book

 For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan

 Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                   Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
                Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC
        I am very grateful for your letter of 11 February which
 I am sure will be helpful to the Club in obtaining grant aid
 towards the cost of reconstructing the tunnel exit from the Kop.
        You may have seen from the Press that the Club Board
 has now decided to proceed with the contract to provide the large
 roof over the Kop. The extra exits, staircases and turnstiles
 to cater for an extra 5000 people are being incorporated in the
 present scheme but it will be necessary to postpone the provision
 of extra suspended terracing until a later date because of a
 shortfall in the grant which is being obtained.
        The form of the Kop and the various ancilliary structures
 which are being constructed would be exactly as in the drawings
 in your possession.

                                                                        Yours sincerely,

  For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan

  Dear Sirs,
                 Safety of Sport Grounds Act, 1975
               Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic
       Thank you for your letter of 18 December, 1985 enclosing the
  comments of the Building Authority to which I would reply as follows


   Disabled Facilities
   a)   There is no doubt that the Kop is covered by the Building
        Regulations and that we shall need Building Regulations
        approval. However, there has effectively been no change
                in the 1985 Regulations.
                Even if there were a change in Regulations, it is obviously
                commonsense that facilities for the dibbled apply to the
                ground as a whole and not to one particular building. At
                 the moment there are perfectly adequate facilities under
                 the overhang of the roof of the North stand. There is a
                 level approach. The disabled are under the cover-, of the
                 cantilever roof. Any facilities at the front of the Kop
                Would be less sheltered from the rain, and more prone to
                 disruption by the fans immediately behind. It is not a good
                 place at all for disabled people.


                                     An Unlimited Company, Registered In England - No. 1833144
                                                                SHEET   2


EASTWOOD ft PARTNERS

b)   We have no intention of entering into further discussion
     regarding a way in which the 50 or any other number of
     places could be provided under the new Kop. There are
     adequate facilities for the ground as a whole at the
     moment•

c)   The Building Authority clearly has no knowledge whatever
     of the cost of football ground structures. The extra
     £500,000 is made up of several components. Firstly,
     there is a steel frame supporting a precast concrete
     deck, some of it at very high level. Very expensive
     piling is required for the columns of.this steel frame
     because most of the columns are high up on the bank.
     Secondly, the main roof girders have to carry very much
     more load, because of the larger area. The spans of the
     radial girders are also that much greater so they have
     to be stronger. The cost per square foot of all the
     covered space is increased. In addition the framing and
     sheeting at the rear of the stand are on average very
     much higher and, therefore, more expensive. Thirdly,
     the addition of the extra spectators has resulted in
     the need for complete re-organisation of exit routes with
     considerable extra expense. New turnstiles are needed and
     additional toilet accommodation. A re-examination of our
     figures shows the additional cost for the 5,000 extra places
     is about £560,000. To simply roof over the existing Kop with
     no extension would reduce the cost of the scheme to less than
     a half of that for the enlarged Kop. I trust we shall have
     no more of this uninformed opinion.
      This extra money is being provided to achieve 5000
      extra spectators. If we give up 1000 of those spaces to
      provide for say 100 disabled plus 100 helpers then over
      £100,000 of the extra cost of the enlarged Kop has to be set
      against the disabled accommodation. The Building Authority
      must accept that the extra £580,000 the Club intends to spend
     '♦is to cater for those days when the ground is full or nearly full
      to capacity.
EASTWOOD fir PARTNERS

     With regard to the proposal that a glazed shelter might
     be placed over the disabled accommodation in front of the
     North stand, it was not our intention that any seats within
     the North stand would have an obscured view although a few
     of the spectators might have to look through the glass of
     the canopy to see the near touchline. There are materials
     available for the glazed r o o f which might prove to be safe for
      that purpose.
      I regard it as regrettable that there has been such a
      negative attitude on this particular matter. We have not,
      of course, taken the design study any further with regard
      to the possibility of a covering for part of the disabled
      area nearest to the Kop end of the North stand, but would
      reconsider the matter if the Working Party has a change of
      heart.

      Enlarged Kop
            With regard to the request for a barrier to protect
      the ladies toilet, it has perhaps not been realised that
      there is handrailing already in place. A gap will be
      created for an entrance to the ladies toilet. The
       final version of the proposed arrangements is shown on
       the attached print of drawing number 6648/53. The new
       brickwork is shown shaded.

       Roofing the Kop
               we are really surprised by the suggestion that the
       steel frame of the gable walls and presumably the back of the
       stand should be sheeted over.     It Is a common feature of
       every stand structure that I know of in any football grou
       in the country that the sheeting rails and other bracing
       members are exposed on the inner face.     In older structures
        they are generally only at 1.2 m centres but in more modern
        structures they are generally at 1.8 m centres.    With the
        1.8 m spacing it would be extremely difficult indeed to
     -• climb up except adjacent to a column. However, I know of
      * no instance where the sheeting rails of an existing stand
        are regarded as being such a hazard that they should be boxed
        in, with an inner skin as well as an outer skin.     I find
        it very surprising that this matter is being pressed.

EASTWOOD ft PARTNERS

          This correspondence on these matters leads me to believe
     that there would be great advantage if the Club's advisers were
     present for part of each of the meetings of the Officer Working
     Party. Matters of this kind need to be discussed round the
     table rather than in lengthy correspondence. We can be of great
     assistance in providing information which may result in fewer
     matters becoming contentious. It is also inevitable that we
     send you plans which are in some ways preliminary in order
     to give the opportunity to comment at an early stage. The
     plans are incomplete in some respects and this may lead to
     misunderstanding of what is intended or a lack of appreciation
     of the thinking behind what is proposed. There is also the
     difficulty /in the light of comments received from the Club, and
     indeed those from the Working Party, quite significant
     changes may take place at a very late stage. It is desirable
     that any late changes be dealt with in as short a time as
     possible. In this regard I now enclose six prints of each of
     our drawings numbers 7C, 8A, 9A, 17A and 56. As the Club
     will be wishing to place an order for the new building not
     later than the end of January, it may be that an oral presentation
     to your Working Part of what is proposed might be beneficial
     all round.

                       Yours faithfully,

    Dear Sirs,

    Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC

    I thank you for your letter dated 29th November.

    The Building Authority in particular has requested me to bring the following
    points to your attention:-

    Disabled Facilities

    a)   The roofing in of the Spion Kop would appear to constitute the erection
         of a new building. Therefore, the Building Regulations 1985 will apply.
         Hence, with regard to the Disabled, it will be necessary to have regard
         for Schedule 2 of the Regulations.  (Schedule 2 reproduces Part T of the
         1976 Regulations - "Facilities for disabled people", until an appropriate
         Approved Document is issued).

    b)   The Building Authority would like to see a breakdown of the proposals for
         accommodating the 50 disabled places quoted. How have the arrangements and
         calculations for area been carried out? e.g. why the necessity for "a runway
         in front of the chairs"? At Bramall Lane, access is from the end of the
         terrace. At Hillsborough, the front of the Kop could be modified similary
         in the view of the Building Authority.

    c)   The Building Authority also question your costing of £500,000 just for the
         additional terracing.

         The Building Authority refer to the "loss" of 1000 spectators, and your own
         words that "we must have regard for the usual gates at the ground not the
         rare capacity occasions". Under normal circumstances the spectators, whatever
         the correct number, will merely be displaced in their opinion.

         The Building Authority consider that costing should also include a balance for
         possible losses resulting from obscured seats in the North Stand if an adequate
         protected area/shelter was provided in the suggested position in that Stand.



                                                                 “I
         Messrs. Eastwood & Partners,
         Consulting Engineers,
         St. Andrews House,
         23 Kingfield Road,
         Sheffield,                                                        Contd.

Enlarged Kop

The ladies toilet does protrude onto the exit route, as even if the route
increases in width at this point, the corner of the toilets would present an
obstruction to "flow". A barrier should simply direct the "flow" off the corner
and not in itself become an obstruction. The barrier could also prevent pressure
on the toilet wall.

Roofing the Kop

Having regard to the words of the police that "they will climb anything , the
Building Authority feel that the provision of rails at the usual 1.8m vertical
centres and a projecting width of say 200 mm, would seem to be unacceptable.

                                             Yours faithfully,




                                             County Solicitor.

                  NEWCASTLE UNITED FOOTBALL CLUB -
                  THURSDAY 26 DECEMBER 1985




I refer to the attached reports.

I agree entirely with the views expressed in the attached reports
and recommend that we should do all possible to have the kick-off
for this fixture rearranged to 1.00 pm.

I am informed that there will be no trains running on Boxing Day
and supporters will therefore travel by coach or private transport.
This season they have taken between 1 - 3>000 supporters but it is
fair to say there have not been many arrests. Some 2,500 Newcastle
supporters attended the Aston Villa fixture in the Midlands, over
1,000 have travelled to London and over 1,000 to Ipswich.

At the present time, it is estimated that at least 3,000 Newcastle
fans will travel but this could, dependent on league positions etc,
increase to 5,000. It must be borne in mind that Sheffield Wednesday
is the nearest First Division fixture to Newcastle, with the exception
of the Manchester clubs.

The last three visits to Sheffield Wednesday by Newcastle are
as follows:   -




Date              Attendance       Away Supporters   Arrests         Ejections

18 12 82           16,310               2,000           10                  8

19 11 83           41 , 1 3 4       11/12,000           13                  7

30     3 85        26,524               5,000            7                  8

Newcastle supporters are renowned for consuming large quantities of
alcohol and the potential for disorder and drunkenness offences is,
of course, extremely high, especially with this fixture being played
on Boxing Day.

By bringing the kick-off time forward to 1.00 pm, this will obviously
considerably reduce policing problems, in around and en route to the
ground.

There are two remand courts sitting at Sheffield Magistrates
on 27 December 1 9 8 5 , the next scheduled courts being 30 and 31 December
1985. These courts will obviously be busy with custody cases and
are not considered suitable for accepting arrests from this fixture.
It may be possible to arrange a special court if you so wish.

 I have sent under separate cover, copy of a letter dated 25th October and plans
 received fran Messrs. Eastwood and Partners relating to proposals to develop the

 For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan

 Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.
                     Spion Kop Development
      As design of the roof over Spion Kop and the extension of the
 terracing proceeds we thought that the Working Party should be
 given an early opportunity to comment upon the proposals. At this
 stage the roof, although it will be an impressive structure, does
 uot hold the individual interests of all members of the Working
 Party and we will deal with the roof at a later date. However, we
 would like to discuss the parameters surrounding provision for the
 disabled, the increased capacity of the Spion Kop and the exit routes
 as we see them.                                         ,
      Enclosed are six prints of our drawings 6648/7, 8, 9, 16 and 17
 showing in outline the areas of terracing for the enlarged Spion
  Kop together with the exits.
       It was initially thought that the disabled could be accommodated
  along the front of Spion Kop between the North stand in front of the
  perimeter fence, which would be set back about two metres. There
  are disadvantages to this proposal. The advertising boards would
  need to be mounted well into the perimeter track level reducing
  its width. The disabled would be in the 'firing line' of mis-cued

shots on goal but also it would mean that the emergency exit
gates could possibly be obstructed. Providing suitable
protection for them from the weather would also be difficult.
The new roof cannot be projected forward sufficiently to offer
the protection and a purpose made, low level cover, could
obscure the vision of spectators behind them.
      There are ways round these difficulties and it is not
one hundred percent certain that the disabled will not eventually
be accommodated along the front but the present favoured proposal
is to leave them where they are, in front of the North stand, and
provide them with a cover. The cover may be constructed using a
timber frame with clear polycarbonate roof sheets so as not
to obstruct the vision of people sitting behind them in the stand.
       The number of wheelchairs attending matches varies but it
probably averages about 33. As you would expect the number
 increases to say 40 or more for the attractive matches.     The
 ambulant disabled occupy normal seats in the stands.
      .To serve the disabled whether they are placed in front of
 the North stand or eventually along the front of Spion Kop we
 propose that toilet facilities are provided, possibly beneath
 the terracing adjacent to the ramp leading down the side of the
 North stand gable. We calculate that the new capacity of Spion
 Kop will be 21,850, without the disabled along the front. This
 is an increase of 5000 on the present capacity of 16,850.
       The number of exit widths required to evacuate the terrace
 in eight minutes is therefore 46.     The unit widths of the exits
 are shown on the prints.
      The tunnel exit on the north side will be increased in width
 to eight clear units whilst a complete new six unit staircase
 is proposed for the south side.
      We believe that drawing 6648/16 is self explanatory but if
 you wish to have a meeting to discuss the proposals we shall
  be pleased to attend.

                              Yours sincerely,

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic

Thank you for your letter dated 12th August in connection with the Note of
the meeting in relation to the inspection of Hillsborough Stadium on
7th August.

Your comments and views are noted and I would confirm that these will be
recorded as you suggest.

In connection with the workmanship of the brick wall reported in section 2A
of the notes of meeting, the Building Authority maintain the view that the
portion of wall inspected did not meet the requirements of accepted work­
manship procedures outlined in regulations. Typical of these are CP121 and
BS5628 P t . 3 where clause 32.7 is quite specific on the question of filling
of brickwork joints.

Additionally it is felt that a structural wall of this nature, although
designed as a cantilever, should be provided with lateral as well as vertical
strength in order to spread any applied local loading. A slight loss of
beneficial self-weight would also be lost by non-filling of vertical joints
and, of course, as mentioned in Codes of Practice, weathering and durability
may be a problem with open joints.

A further point noted by the Building Authority was the non-standard bonding
of brickwork at the stepped portions of the wall due to the manual cutting of
individual brick units.

It is considered that your points raised in relation to construction are
relevant, but this type of problem could be avoided by using proper site
techniques.

 For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan

 Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                     Safety of Sports Grounds Act
                  Inspection of Hillsborough Stadium
                          7 August, 1985
       Thank you for sending me a copy of your notes, which I
 note had been produced on the same day as the meeting.
       I feel I should comment on the third paragraph of section
 2A which records that the Building Authority representatives
 considered that the standard of workmanship of the brick wall is
 poor.   This statement should be clarified.   The general
 standard of workmanship of this wall was not questioned, and
 the matter which caused concern to the Authority was that the
 perpends and vertical longitudinal joints of the interior of the
 wall were not being filled from the top        as each course of
 bricks is built. You will recall that I said this is normal
 construction procedure. I think my statement should have been
 recorded.
       Indeed I would now go so far as to say that what was
 being advocated by the Building Control Authority is in fact
 undesirable. If the vertical joints are packed with mortar
 as the bricks are being placed, the mortar will set and even
                                      An Unlimited Company, Registered in England - No. 1833144

EASTWOOD fr PARTNERS




dry out before the next course of bricks is placed. The
interface of the two lots of mortar will be weak, and it would
fail in tension under overturning forces or in shear due to
bending about a vertical axis.
      If the vertical joints are left partly open until the
next course of bricks is laid, the mortar laid on the bed
is pushed down into the joint as the brick is tapped down to
level. The amount of mortar pushed down into the joint is
unlikely to fill it completely, but it will be sufficient
to obtain a good key, and without a plane of weakness on the bed
of the brickwork.   Some mortar also extrudes upwards thus
filling the lower part of the vertical joint of the latest
brick to be laid, although the amount forced upwards is likely
to be less than that forced downwards.
      It would be appreciated if my views on this matter could
be reflected in some way, either by an addendum to the Note or
by an addition to the next Note in February 1986.
      One other small point needs clarificaiton.    In the
section headed Spion Kop, the word 'removed' in the fourth line
should perhaps read 'remodelled'.    There will still be an exit
at that point.

                            Yours   sincerely,

I write to confirm the concluding paragraph of my letter of 13th May, the
discussion which took place with all the South Yorkshire Football League
Clubs at: Police Headquarters, Sheffield, and the comments made at the
recent summer" inspection of your Ground by the Officer Working Party.

Now that the Interim Report of Mr. Justice Popplewell has been published
and advice has been received from the Horae Office, the County Council would
draw the following initial measures to your attention

(a)   evacuation procedures should be reviewed in consultation with the
      South Yorkshire Police and the South Yorkshire County Fire Service
      should this not have been done already following previous discussions;

(b)   safety stewards should:-

      (i)      be trained and instructed to deal with any emergency relating
               to fire or evacuation,
      (ii)     be given written instructions about the action to be taken in
               cases of emergency,
      (iii)    receive practical instruction and training appropriate to
               their responsibility,
      (iv)     not be so employed unless they have been so instructed and
               trained, and
      (v)      be adequate in number, physically and mentally capable of
               performing their duties, effectively deployed, effectively
               supervised and readily identifiable

               NOTE - as previously indicated, the South Yorkshire County Fire
                      Service and the South Yorkshire Police are willing to
                      assist Clubs in these matters and, of course, paragraph 9
                      of your Club’s General Safety Certificate specifically
                      relates to safety stewards,

 I write to confirm the arrangements for the "summer"
 inspection of the Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield. This
 will take place at 10.00 a.m. on Wednesday, 7th August,
 1985.

 As agreed, no doubt you will arrange to be represented
 at the inspection at both Headquarters and Divisional
 levels as usual.

 Note of a Meeting of the Officer Working Party (Sheffield District) held at
• the Police Sports- and Social Club, Niagara, Sheffield, on 29th July, 1985

. PRESENT:    S. Allcock (South Yorkshire County Fire Service).
                          (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council).
             1              (South Yorkshire Police).

                         (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council).
                    Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council).

         Purpose of Meeting                                           - --

The purpose of the meeting was to consider the detailed plans submitted by the
letter dated 25th July from Messrs. Eastwood and Partners of arrangements
for the segregation of visiting spectators at the Leppings Lane End of the
Hillsborough Stadium of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club. It was -
recalled that consideration of outline proposals had taken place by the
Officer Working Party on 18th April, 1985. Whilst formal application had been
made for Building Regulation approval and some of the work had actually
commenced, Messrs. Eastwood and Partners had apologised by 'phone that
submission of the detailed proposals for Safety of Sports Grounds Act
approval had apparently been overlooked due to pressure of work and staff
holidays. The plans also included details of repairs to certain crush
barriers on the Spion Kop.

 2.____ Consideration of Proposals

 The   14 detailed plans submitted were, each considered   and discussed individually.

IT WAS AGREED -that, subject to the following points and to the submission of
the necessary detailed calculations to the Building Authority, the proposals
for segregating visiting supporters at the Leppings Lane End of the
Hillsborough Stadium were generally acceptable:-

 (a)    Plan No. 6705/6 - for both security access and emergency egress purposes,
 a pitch perimeter fence gate to be provided;

(b)    Plan No. 6705/8A - the new handrail by Turnstile 23 to be either
shortened or re-aligned so as to maintain the exit width between the outer
(river) wall and Turnstile 23, and the exit width between Turnstile 16 and
the new handrail not to be less than the width of the roller shutter gate
between Turnstiles 16 and 17;

(c)   Plan No. 6705/9A - the single block thickness of the interal walls
(e.g. the cubicles) is not considered to be substantial enough, and a
substantial stud partition (timber or steel - suitably faced) is felt to
be required;

 (d)     Plan No. 6705/10A - same comments as for plan     9A;

 (e)     Plan No. 6705/11A - no objection in principle, but details of exact
 location required;

 (f)   Plan No. 6705/12 - no objection in principle, but no barrier height
 indicated;

 (g)   Plan No. 6705/14A - so long as increased thickness is achieved by steep
 slopes as indicated on the plan and not by "stepped" arrangements to give

                           DOOM Ho.
foothold, the proposals are satisfactory but the possible need to take
measures on top of the wall to discourage persons from attempting to climb
over will have to be borne in mind;

(h)    Plan No. 6705/16A - in view of experiences last year, the front
corner of the Spion Kop (by the crush barriers numbered 5, 8 and 22) to
either have a Pitch Perimeter Fence Gate or radial barrier(s) to overcome
possible lateral crushing hazard when large crowds are present;

(i)    Plan Mo. 6705/17 - for both security access and emergency-egress
purposes, a ?itch Perimeter Fence Gate to be provided;

(j)^   Stewarding of New Gates - as mentioned in my letter of 2nd,May, 1985,
it is essential that all the new gates are fully supervised by Stewards,

     Dear Sir,
                                       Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic
                     Thank you for Mr. Vaughan's note of the informal meeting
     on 6 June.
           The comments of the Fire Services with regard to steel
      covering of the wooden decking are noted.
            First I sh#0J*lexplain that the 2mm thick sheeting is
      not expected to wear significantly for very many years. There
      will be some slight loss of metal due to rusting, but corrosion
      rates for steel under cover are now very low in Sheffield due
      to the drop in sulphur in the atmosphere and we do not expect
       serious loss due to rusting for at least 10 years.
             Our responses to the five comments near the foot of the
        first page are as follows
                (i) It is agreed that the horizontal surfaces of
                     the steel sheets need a treatment to prevent
                     slipping. We shall be experimenting with
                     epoxy and carborundum on a small area which the
                     Fire Service will be invited to inspect. If
                     this is successful, the whole area will be

                                                 An Unlimited Company, Registered in England - No. 1833144
                                                                   SHEET   2



EASTWOOD f t PARTNERS




                treated before the start of the new season.
        (ii)    The edges of the sheets are being screwed
                at 75mm centres, and we think this will
                prevent lifting.
       (iii)    We are looking into the possibility of providing
                a quarter-round beading to close any small gap
                at the junction of the rise and the tread.
        (iv)    It is not considered appropriate to ventilate
                beneath the timber decking. The prevention of
                the spread of fire is the paramount requirement,
                and free ventilation under the deck would create
                a hazard. There is no significant danger of the
                timber rotting as there is no source of water to
                start an attack of either wet rot or dry rot.
                The average relative humidity of the air under
                the steps will be about the same as that of the
                free air (unlike a cellar or beneath a house floor
                where moisture is available from the ground). The
                moisture content of the air beneath the timber will
                vary less from night to day, and with the weather?
                 than the free air, and will be at 100% relative
                 humidity less often. We shall however be observing
                 whether in strong wind it is possible for light
                 rain to drift in below the cantilever of the roof.
                 The overhang is very good, but if rain can enter
                 the floor it will be necessary to do some opening
                 up from time to time to check that all is well.
          (v)   It is not expected that it will be necessary to
                check the steel sheeting after every match. We
                believe the fixings we are specifying will perform
                well. Experience will show how much inspection is
                necessary, but we think that it will be found that
                perhaps twice per year will be adequate.

       The club has now instructed us to accept a tender for the
installation of the steel sheeting on the deck, and we
anticipate that work will be finished by mid-August.
       With regard to the timber in the roof the Club has
received our report and there is considerable concern at the
extent to which the existing steel trusses are overstressed.
We suspect that the steelwork was originally designed for only
10 lb/sq.ft. snow load, but even under that load one or two
members in each truss would be overstressed. It is likely that
the present day requirement of the Code of 15 lb/sq.ft. snow load
will be reduced for this part of Sheffield in the next few years,
but not enough to entirely remove overstressing. The trusses
are old and there has been some loss of metal due to rusting over
the 6 5 years or so since the stand was built.               has
expressed concern over the fact that some of the trusses lean
quite markedly. We have pointed out to the Club that the
proposed changes to the roof are such that a Building Regulations
approval is probably required, and the local authority will need
to be somewhat indulgent if it is to grant such an approval.
We have also asked the Club to indemnify us against claims
in the event that the roof should fail in snow or wind.
        In the face of this situation the Club requires a little
more time to consider the matter. Obviously a decision to spend
a large sum of money on the existing roof, which would still
leave it sub-standard cannot be taken lightly. There is some
feeling that a completely new roof should be provided so
as to remove all possible sources of criticism on safety
grounds. This would also fit in better with long term plans.
        Time was already very tight if the timber was to be
replaced this summer. The full Board will not be able to
consider the situation for some weeks due to holidays. I
 therefore request the Licensing Authority to give the Club
 time to come to a decision, with a view to constructing the new
                                                              SHEET   4



EASTWOOD ft PARTNERS




roof, or alternatively replacing the timber in the existing
roof, during the period May - August 1986.
      It is anticipated that the decision will be taken within
a matter of weeks. If a completely new roof is to be installed,
the planning and Building Regulations approvals will be sought
later this year, and tenders obtained sufficiently early for
work to commence in May 1986.
      This will involve the South stand continuing to function
with the timber in the roof remaining for the coming season.
But the position will be considerably improved compared with
the past. It is obviously very unlikely that the roof could
catch fire once the seated area has been covered with steel
sheets. The timber in the roof is protected from fireworks
or smoke bombs by the asbestos sheets which overlay the timber.
It does not, of course, have the hazard of bituminous felt
covering as at Bradford. The Club hopes that a sympathetic
view can be taken on this particular matter for the coming
season.
      Should your working party or its representatives wish to
see the work on the deck in progress they will be very
welcome to visit at their convenience.

                                Yours faithfully,
                               FILE NOTE

Informal meeting held at the Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield on 5th June 1985

PRESENT:   S. Allcock (South Yorkshire County FireService)
           B. Mincher (South Yorkshire County Fire   Service)
                      (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council)
           J. Strange (Messrs. Eastwood ft Partners)
           D. I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council)

1 ._____ Purpose of Meeting.

The purpose of the meeting was to inspect the mock-up of the proposed steel
covering to the wooden decking to the Upper South Stand seated    area, andto
consider the future of the timbered under-roof cladding to the    asbestosroof
of the Stand.

2 ._____ Proposed Steel Coveting to the Wooden Decking.

To achieve fire resistance of the wooden decking (which sat on   concrete
decking), the Club were considering covering it with steel sheeting.

The Fire Service felt that whilst this would be a short-term answer to fire
resistance, there would be a Slipping hazard if the steel sheets were not
surfaced in some way and a tripping hazard where the sheets were joined and,
as time passed, by the sheets lifting at the edges. In time, the sheets
would also wear, and queried what form of maintenance would besuitable.
The mock-up also had a small gap where the sheets      were joined whichwould
enable small items to pass through and fall into the small void between the
wooden and concrete deckings. Whilst the Building Authority felt that there
were no objections to the proposal from a structural point of view, they
supported the points raised by the Fire Service.    (NOTE - subsequent to the
meeting,              'phoned to say that to avoid deterioration of the
woodwork, it would be necessary to allow some form of ventilation if it were
to be covered by the steelwork, and that he had mentioned this to John
Strange; he would also make the point to Steve Allock).

IT WAS AGREED that, subject to the following points, there was no objection
in principle to the Club's proposal to encase the wooden decking of the
upper South Stand seated area with steel sheeting

(i)     the horizontal areas of the sheets to be sprayed or covered with a
        non-slip substance,

(ii)    the lateral ends of the sheets to be securely fastened to prevent
        lifting;

(iii)   the vertical ends of the sheets to have an overlay to prevent articles
        passing through into the small voids between the wooden and concrete
        deckings;

 (iv)   some form of ventilation to be provided to overcome deterioration
        of the encased woodwork;

 (v)    inspection of the steel sheeting to take place after every match and
        maintenance carried out as necessary.




                        DOCUMENT No.
3 ._____ South Stand Roof.

The under-roof area of the asbestos roof of the Stand consisted of wooden
cladding which had been treated with creosote or similar at some time in the
past. The Club had long-term proposals to replace and extend the roof to
cover both the upper and lower seated areas. However, they were actively
considering replacing the roof as existing by metal sheeting.

The Fire Service considered that recent events had illustrated the necessity
of some form of action on timbered roofs, even though originally it had
been accepted, on certification. Encasement of the wooden decking to the
upper seated area would reduce the fire risk, but it was considered that
action would still be necessary.

The Building Authority pointed out that the proposal would be acceptable
from a structural point of view and would considerably reduce the loading on
the roof. Other factors, such as reverse loading in wind conditions, would
also have to be taken into account.

IT WAS AGREED that the Club's proposals to replace the existing roof with
steel sheeting were acceptable in principle.

4 ._____ Time   Scale.

It was felt that so long as thewooden decking was encased with steel
sheeting on the lines agreed by the start of the season in mid-August, work
on the roof could be on-going with a view to completion shortly afterthe
start of the season.

For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan

Dear Sirs,
               Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC
               Painting of Woodwork beneath South Stand
      Following our telephone conversation on Friday, 17 May,
 I have looked into the paint treatment of the timber at
 first floor level beneath the upper tiers of seats.    This is
 the area through which the general public have to pass when
 leaving the stand and making for the main staircases.
      Round about 1980 a number of works took place in the
 refreshment areas and the players dining room under our control.
 All the new woodwork and the existing partitions in this area
 were painted using Nullifire intumescent paint (attached is
 a photo-copy of the Bill of Quantities).   You may possibly
 remember that during progress of the works,____________
 paid a site visit and found the painters applying paint from
 a can labelled with some other manufacturers name. However, on
 checking, it was established that the Nullifire had been delivered
 in 5 litre drums and had been poured into smaller cans of another
 manufacturer by the painters.
      Not all the woodwork was treated at that time. However we
 did check that all woodwork in that area was either intumescent

             Note of a meeting held at the Hillsborough Stadium,
                      Sheffield, on 23rd January, 1985

            D. I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council)

1.   Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to carry out the "winter" inspection of the
Stadium in accordance with the policy of twice yearly visits to Football
League Grounds in South Yorkshire.

2.___ Ground Inspection

A.   South Stand

The alterations and extensions to the understand area of the Stand (which
had been completed since the "summer" inspection) were shown to the Officer
Working Party.

IT WAS AGREED -

(i)   That any further areas of spalled concrete on the vertical columns at
the rear of the Stand would continue to be monitored and receive attention
by the Club as a matter of maintenance.

(ii) That the unsecured wire to the illuminated "Exit" sign in the Match
Day Sponsors Lounge would receive attention by the Club.

(iii) That the remaining bridge between the Stand and the Club at the rear
of the Stand (now used solely as a means of escape from the Kitchen area)
should be infilled with mesh from a safety point of view to accord strictly
with the appropriate Regulations.

(iv) That the two emergency lights in the Club not operative at the time
of the inspection would receive urgent attention by the Club.

B.    West Stand and Terrace

The Club recalled the practice followed in consultation with the South
Yorkshire Police of separating home and visiting supporters at the rear
of the Stand at certain matches (such as with Liverpool) by erecting
temporary barriers. This worked well but on all other normal occasions it
was the policy of the Police to aim for exclusive use by visiting supporters
of the West Stand and Terrace. On those occasions when the number of
visiting supporters was small and the weather was inclement, it was
obviously desirable to allow heme supporters access to a sheltered area.


           DOCUMENT No.     IS C
 IT WAS AGREED -


 (i)   That the Club would consider at some future date a scheme for
 permanent barriers at the rear of the Stand, subject to any proposals
 being submitted for prior approval by the Officer Working Party in the
 usual way.

 (ii) That the cracked brickwork (adjacent to the concrete vertical column
 at the rear of the Stand adjacent to the North-West Terrace) should continue
 to be monitored.

       T^ at thS ap?arent rusting of the steel columns at the rear of the
 Stand should receive appropriate treatment by the Club.

 C.    North West Terrace

No comments.

D.    North Stand

IT WAS AGREED that so long as larger, not easily combustible, materials
continued to be stored in the timber screened store area under the Stand,
the area would be regarded as acceptable.

E.    Spion Kop

It was noted that the remedial work to the roof of the tunnel exit from
the Kop had stabilised its condition for the time being (pending the
Club s development proposals proceeding'; that the loose coping stores
had been removed from the top of the wall between the Spion Kop and the
South Stand, and that the damaged corrugated metal sheeting between the
Spion Kop and the South Stand had been replaced.

IT WAS AGREED -

(i)   That the condition of the roof of the tunnel exit from the Kop should
continue to be monitored.

(n)   That the Club would carry out the pointing work to the outer perimeter
wall on Penistone Road once the frosts had ceased.

F.    Lighting Pylons

The visual inspection of the lighting pylons (first mentioned at the
inspection on 29th February, 1984) had yet to be carried out by the Club.

IT WAS AGREED that the visual inspection of the lighting pylons would be
carried out by the Club in the near future (weather conditions permitting).

3.___ Public Address System

The Club pointed out that an improved public address system had been installed,
and the Police confirmed that reports received indicated that it was noticeably
better than the previous system.
4 • _____ T o i l e t and C a t e r i n g F a c i l i t i e s

The Officer Working Party confirmed that plans for the revised catering
facilities at the rear of the West Stand had been received from the Club’s
Architect and had been formally approved.

The Club reported that the scheme for the general up-grading of toilet and
catering facilities (particularly in the South Stand) was shortly to be
considered by the Board.

IT WAS AGREED that the Club would submit the proposals for improved toilet
and catering facilities for approval in the usual way, subject, of course,
to the Board's decision whether to proceed with the scheme.

Dear Mr. Chester,
                  Inspection of Floodlight Pilon
    After the visitation by the South Yorkshire Working Party
the weather had cleared up a bit and so I made an inspection
of the pilon immediately behind the South stand.
     I am pleased t<J say that the steelwork is generally in a
very good condition but there is localised breakdown of the
paintwork mainly near the joints.     I had the tail end of a
film in my camera and the three pictures which I took showing
typical corrosion patterns are attached.     Photograph 1 shows
rusting bpth above and below a bolted splice and also some
rusting between the splice plates.       This is just about the
worst of the damage in the tower and although it looks quite
bad, the actual loss of metal is probably still quite
minimal.
    Photograph 2 is a close-up of another joint where there :±s -_
similar rusting between the splice plates and the main angles.
This kind of damage occurs because it is virtually impossible
to seal the gaps between the edges of the pieces of steel forming
the splice with paint so that the steelwork inside the joint
is almost unprotected.

      Photograph No. 3 shows some rusting developing on top
 of one of the angles forming diagonal bracing.     Although
 this looks rather bad it has to be kept in mind that rust
 expands compared with the original thickness of steel
 from which it has been derived and I doubt whether rust
 has penetrated more than about half a millimetre.
      The situation is not such that immediate action is required
 except that if you are wishing to maintain the life of
 the towers for the very longest possible period into the
 future, more than a century say, then it is important that
 maintenance be carried out before the damage has progressed
 too far.     On the other hand, you are only thinking of
 say another 50 years life then I think it likely that it will
 be another three or four years before the amount of deterioration
 makes it imperative that the steelwork be treated to remove
  the localised rusting and then completely repainted.
       Part of the equation is that the cost of painting the
  towers is probably about a quarter of the cost of a new set
  of towers.     Thus, by extending the time between successive
  paint treatments, the money saved will in due course pay for
  some new pilons possibly of a more modern kind.
       Unless the Club has in mind that it wishes to obtain the
  longest possible life from the present pilons, I suggest that
  there is no need to paint at the present time and that you may
  well find }.t is three or four more years before work becomes
  essential.;

                             Yours sincerely,

         Dear Sir,

         Safety of Sports Ground Act, 1975 Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic.

         I passed to you under separate cover on 27th December, 1984, copy of                          a
         letter and plans which I had received that day (dated 18th December)                          from
         Mr.             Chartered Architect, Oxspring, relating to proposals                          for
         revised Refreshment Bar facilities and store at the Rear of the West                          Stand
         at the Hillsborough Stadium.

         As you will recall, the possibility of such proposals were outlined at the
         "Summer" inspection of the Stadium (see paragraph 4 of the Note dated
         9th August, 1984).

         In view of the scope and nature of the proposals, I do not intend to
         convene a formal meeting of the Officer Working Party (Sheffield District),
         but should be glad to receive by Monday, 14th January, 1985, any comments
         which you may wish to make.

                                                              Yours faithfully,

                 TO THE MATCH LAST YEAR I KNEW THAT THE MIDDLE SECTION WOULD GET
                 REALLY CROWDED SO ONCE THROUGH THE TUNNELL I MOVED TO THE RIGHT

EVERYONE WENT DOWN THE TUNNEL. I WENT LOOKING FOR A STEWARD EVENTUALLY FOUND
ONE AND ASKED HOW TO GET TO THE END TERRACE. I WAS IN THE TERRACE THE SECOND
ONE DOWN FROM THE CRUSH (PEN 5) I SAW PEOPLE CLIMBING OVER, IT WAS OBVIOUS

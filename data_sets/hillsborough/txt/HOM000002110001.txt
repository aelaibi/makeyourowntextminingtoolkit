If J______________ I of 5
say as follows:-


I     was born on                                  I am employed as

with                                                                                  I     have

worked there for the past 4 years,


I     first became involved with Sheffield W e dne sda y F.C. about                               5
years ago when the team were promoted from the second division.
A friend asked me to get involved.                     I have always worked on the
turnstiles.                Turnstile operators are moved from              turnstile             to
turnstile each match.                This is club policy and I believe it                        is
for security reasons •               I have worked on t u r n s t i l e s _______ in the
past.            I     am used to this area and to the ground.                  I     am     also
used        to       facing away sup port©v”;^»       I worked at     the           semi-final
match        last year and understood that the semi-final                           this     year
 (1989) was to be dealt with in the same way.


Before           the commencement of each season,           a meeting is              held       of
all the turnstile operators,                  stewards and gatemen at the                   club.
            mee tin g        provides for the registration of             the        turnstile
operators              who    all   receive    a    pass.    I     take     two       passport
photographs to the briefing session and                     receive my ID pass.                    I
am        also         given a booklet containing tickets,           one        of    which        I
complete               and   hand in at every match.        This    book let          contains
match            day      instructions.   I am also given separate                  match     day
 instructions at the beginning of the season.


 As        far       as    I am aware it is not compulsory          to      attend          these
 meetings but I certainly always go.                    A briefing takes place                   at
    the    meeti ng relating to safety.              I think that         these       meetings
    are an extremely good idea.               It has been club practice to                   hold
    such     a m eeting for the past few years.              These meetings                are     a
    particularly good idea for the new people who are taken on each

    season.

A briefing takes place relating to safety.                      We are lectured                    by
the police,         Fire Brigade and ambulance department.                       We are           not
given a br iefing about large crowd pressures outside the ground
as    that it strictly a police matter.                  However we are                 lectured
on     fire precautions and emergency procedures.                       Doug Lock                also

speaks at this meeting.                         ‘b c t u . !2-VT^(     <D T *7 I C C 2- P e e .

There is no basic training for turnstile operators.                               Turnstiles
are allocated each match on a first come first served basis.                                        I
believe that new people m ay be put on season ticket                                  turnstiles
     complimentary tickets first of all as these m ay be                                slightly
easier to deal with.


I now turn to              the events which took place on 15th April 1989 at
Hillsborough.                I had been asked to arrive at              the       ground           by
-bout        11.00 am.       This is somewhat       earlier          than     usual.                 “
reported        to         the Stiles room at     the     players           entrance.              On
arrival        my name was put down on a sheet of paper and I had                                  to
wa i t ' for        my     name to be called out.       ____________              a     steward,
calls out the names of the turnstile operators.                             On        semi-final
day     it     is        very much first come first served.                  My        name       was
called        out and I was allocated to turnstile                     at the           Leppings
Lane     entrance.           I   was given a key and a         docket            to     indicate
which        stile        I had been allocated. All the keys more                       or        less
fit the same turnstiles.               There is a yale lock to get into                            the
turnstile           and then a turnstile key itself to unlock the                                chain
to stop the turnstile spinning round.


The doors to the turnstiles open                  inwards.       Turnstiles A and                    B
are set slightly apart from turnstiles C - G.                          Turnstiles C - G
are all together in pairs,              back to back.


I walked down to gate D and arrived at approximately 11.45.                                         In
fact     I wa lked down with                            |.   We opened up at                     about
                                           - 3 -




noon     after we had received confirmation from the                      police          that
they     were ready for us to do that.             _________________ by to— '-g-iv
hi     1•i 1 Ifi—     t       The    system operates as        follows.              If    the
police        are in place outside and inside the ground we ask                           them
if     they are ready and we open up wh e n we receive an answer                            to
the affirmative.


I     believe we opened the turnstiles at about noon.                      The        police
are     stationed outside the turnstiles to control the crowd                              and
inside to search supporters as they enter the ground.


We     were      instructed       to take B    tickets      only,    i.e.         standing
tickets for Liverpool supporters.


From      noon until 1.00 pm everything progressed                  very         steadily.
In fact we had a ver y slow start with supporters arriving in                                a
very      orderly         fashion.   By and large the        supporters           arriving
were families.


We     were      checking tickets as they were handed to us.                         We    had
been      told      by the police to let in Liverpool               supporters            with
Nottingham          Forest     tickets    if     they    seemed      to     be       genuine
Liverpool           supporters.      I think that people who had arrived                     at
the     ground       without      tickets were     buying     them        outside          from
touts.


I     received instructions with regard to tickets from                          a    police
officer         with a large beard and a flat cap.             I do not know                his
name.       We are instructed to do what the police tell us.                              There
were      not     a lot of L i v e r p o o l f a n s wit h Forest tickets  in any
                                    C -  L, I
event.          After a while -a police officer told us not             to  accept
any      more Forest tickets.            He said that we had let            enough          in.
    After that direction we were turning people back who                                         attempted
    to get in with the wrong ticket.                              At that stage it was easy                   to
    turn people back but there were ve r y few people with                                       incorrect
    tickets in any event.


    Some      people            arrived         without any            tickets     at     all.         Between
    turnstiles             D        and    E,     in the compound,            there      was     a      police
    Sergeant.           He was stopping people with no tickets and                                    ejecting
    them      from the ground.                    At first I was refusing entry to                       those
    supporters             without             tickets.         If I     refused        entry     I     simply
    shouted over and told that officer that I had done so.
           I T . w iX 'h       S T ^ r ' i C v j Cr "Cv*.e   rl~ C u J6F                          ,

    The procedure I adopted upon receiving a                                   correct ticket from             a
    supporter           was          to remove the counterfoil and                      give     the     other
    portion of the ticket back to the supporter.                                      I then pressed            a
    pedal       wit h          my     foot to open the turnstile and                      to , -llow         the
    supporter to pass through.


    All was going well until about 2.15.                                   I considered the crowd to
    be     normal for a semi-final.                           However,     after 2.15 and right                up
    until        the        time          we were told to close the gate                   it     was        like
    bedlam.            It       was becoming impossible to                     turn      people        without
    tickets         away.            People were being abusive verbally and I                            think
    that they wo u l d have been violent if they could have got to me.
    Fortunately                there is a wire mesh in front of the                            counter        and
    this served to keep the supporters away                                   from me.


    The      crowd was building up all the time. I did not                                     look     at     my
                   I had counted and numbered 300 tickets during the first
\   hour but after that I had no time to count.                                     I was taking             full
    tickets with no time to tear off gja-a retain ’feha- coun.-fcg #¥g#i°r                                      I
    noticed         that            many supporters had been                  drinking.          Supporters
    were       attempting                 to    get          through    the      turnstiles       in     twos.
    Everyone was trying to get in at once and it was impossible for
                                           - 5 -




me     to        do m y job properly.     I was simply      taking     tickets        and
allowing entry.            Those without tickets got through as there was
simply           no way that      I could turn them back.      I had to leave          it
up to the police to               stop them on the other side.


I noticed that people were becoming distressed.                      The crowd        was
shouting           for the gates to be opened and at one stage                I    heard
someone           shout "open the gates - people are dying outside".                    I
have        never     witne sse d anything    like it in the         past. Between
2.30        and 3.00 pm I         noticed that people were climbing over              the
top     of the turnstiles.            People were also trying to            jump     over
the     turnstile          because they could not get        in   fastly          enough.
Children who had been badly pushed about were being passed over
the turnstile.


I     did not hear the kick off and I did not even know what                         time

it was.


I had an extremely restricted view of the crowd in front of the
turnstile.            I could only see at an angle but I did notice                  that
the whole area was extremely congested.                    j. do not thxnk that         I
have        ever seen so many people and I simply did not                   know     what
was happening.


I      did not see the gate being opened but I did see it                     when     it
was open.            As far as I was aware the gate had only opened                  once
and         I do not know how long it remained open.              I was only         able
 to     take a glance but I noticed people surging                 through.          When
 the gate opened the crush in front of me did not stop                        entirely
 but        it     eased   off.      People were   still     coming     through       the
 turnstiles           however.      The window to the back of         the    turnstile
 was        of frosted glass so that my view in towards                the    compound
 was very blurred.             I could see however between the stile                doors
 of D and E.           I just noticed a massive surge and saw no                  attempt
                                         - 6 -




to    channel       people in any particular direction.            People       were
still     passing through the turnstiles and I think that it                    must
have been after 3.00 pm by now.             Shortly thereafter I was               told
to close the turnstile by a policeman on horseback.


One of the other turnstile operators had a radio.                  There was          a
broadcast          to the effect that three people had died.             We        then
knew that something serious had happened.


After     the order came to close the turnstile we shut the                     gates
on     the inside of the stiles and started to count our                 tickets.
An    object       was     suddenly thrown at my frosted     window        and       it
splintered.         The next thing I knew there was someone banging on
the door.          I was terrified at this stage and decided to put                  my
tickets       in     a bag and get out of the stile.       I did     not        leave
through       the compound but went out to the front of the                stiles.
There     were       policemen    outside and also people      lying       on       the
ground.       I did not know the extent of what had happended                   until
I     passed across C gates from the outside and saw               the     injured
being brought out.            I received no abuse at this stage but I had
taken     off m y badge.         I had *€5*3- bags of uncounted tickets.             By
the     time I came to collect the tickets man y had fallen                   on     to
the     floor.       I picked them up as best I could but I think                  that
some     must       have    been left.   I simply made a run       for     it.        I
handed the tickets in at the office and noticed that they                          were
all     being       stuffed into a large sack.      I received my        pay.         I
then     went       to find a friend to take him home.       I went        to       the
edge     of     the kop in the south stand by the open air               seats       to
meet my friend.            He was not there.     I simply could not        believe
what     I saw..      There were people on the pitch and running                about
everywhere.          I was shattered.      I came out and went home and got
home at about 3.45 pm.             I had to have a large brandy to try and
calm down.

Obviously           I      did not wa i t to be checked out of                               my     turnstile.
Normally         I am c h e c k e d , out at about 10 m in utes after                                the     kick

case,     his           turnstile                stays open until               half       time.      I    would
normally stay in m y turnstile until I had counted up my batches
of tickets and bag them up in an orderly fashion.                                                 Had it     been
a normal m a t c h I wo uld also have been collecting cash for those
people      paying on the door and I wou d have stayed to count                                               the
cash up.          I would then take the tickets and cash to the                                            office
and then proceed to watch the game.


I have operated turnstiles at semi-final games in the past                                                    and
generally           this ' has                 been an e a s ^ ^ j ob.               The    supporters           are
normally          all in the ground b y -2^9* and there is just a                                          steady
flow for the last iggminutes up until 3.00 pm.


I would like to point out that there is absolutely no way                                                    that
turnstile           operators were                            able to accept           mon ey      from people
seeking to buy entrance at this match.                                      There are video cameras
in the turnstiles and,                            if the operators were taking money                         this
wo uld     be       revealed                on        the video         film.          Furthermore,         if     a
turnstile           operator                   accepted            mo ney       he         would     be     fired
immediately.


I have been interviewed by and have p rovided a statement to the
police.


This statement is true to the best of my knowledge and belief.

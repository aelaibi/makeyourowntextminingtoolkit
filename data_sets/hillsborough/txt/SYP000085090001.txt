vrvuis.   j. -y       middle        of    the       r o a d , he         was        spoken          to    by       PC       Wain.           Even          at    2.45          pm    m any

fc h j                u   p po rte rs     were          s t i 11    making              their       way       to       the       working             mens       clu b .            At

                      2.50     pm    we       began          to    walk        down          Halifax          Road          towards             the       football

                      ground,        escorting                Liverpool                 fans       along       the          way.        Halifax                Road       was

                      literally           a       sea    of       empty        beer          cans    and       bottles,                they          were       strewn             in

                      the    road,        pavement                and    in        residents             gardens.                 One       youth          was       strongly

                      advised        re       his       conduct          by        PC    £-.560 B a l l        for          urinating                in    a    front

                      garden.            The       supporters              did          not    seem       to       be       in    any       hurry          to       get       to    the

                      ground        in    spite          of       impending              kick-off             time.              Several             supporters

                      approached              me    and       asked        if       any       match       tickets                were       available.                    I

                      informed           them       that          none     were          being       sold       and          advised             them          to    keep          away

from       the        ground             as    they       would          not     be      allowed             in.        As     we      were       a u t s i de

The    Gate           public             house          abuse       and     scuffles               were       taking           place         between

local          youths           and       Liverpool                supporters.                    At    3 . 0 0 pm       serials            39

and    40       were           at    the       junction             of     Claywheels                  Lane       in     preparation               for       our

meal       break.               We       were       then       informed             via       the       radio          that       there          was    a

disturbance                    at    the       Leppings             Lane       end       of       the       ground.            Serials            39    and       40

then       rnadetheir                way       to       that       location.              On       arrival

there          was     a       mass       of       Liverpool             supporters                in       the     roadway            completely

blocking              both          the       road       and       the     entrances               to       the    turnstile                area.           At

this       po in t         1    n o t i. c e d      an    ambulance              arrive            a nd      s 1 o w 1y      rna k e    it's       way

a Io n g       w i.t hi o t h e r         o f f i. c e r s     a nd      a 11 e m p t e d         to    pa s h     t he      crowci         ba c k ,

therefore              relieving                   pressure           on    the       turnstile               area.            We      were       urging

supporters                 to       go    back          and    also        allow         the       crush          to    be     relieved.                The

supporters                 became             very       angry        at    being         denied             access          to       the    turnstile

area , many                of       them       waved          ticket        at      us    and          were       abusive.              M ou nted

n ffirprs             were          in    attendance                but     their         presence                d i d n ’t      seem       to    have          any

effect          on     the          behaviour             of       the     crowd.         The          o rd e r was          then       given          for

serials           39       and       40       to    go    into        the      ground.             I was          under        the      impression

that       fighting                 was       taking          place        within         the          ground.            I walked,              through          an

open       gateway              and       entered             an    enclosure             behind             the       t e r r a c i n g.         There

were       a    large           number             of    supporters              crowded               in    this       area?          many       people

were       lying           on       the       ground          in    this       area,          a    large          proportion                of    these

people          appeared                 to    be       having        breathing               difficulties.                       I    realsied             at

this       point           that          there          was    obviously              not         any       fighting           taking            place       and

that       the        casualties                   had    been        subjected               to       being        crushed            within          the

crowd.            I    gave          first          aid       to    many       of     these            casualties              and      placed          the

majority              of       them       in       the    recovery             position.                    There       were          bodies        lying         in

this       area        with          coats          over       their        faces,            obviously                beyond          all       help.           The

supporters                 were          very       abusive           towards            myself             and    other          officers,             many
refering            to     us    as    “fucking             murderers".                    I       entered          the       tunnel         from       the

near      enclosure              down       to    the       terracing             and          assisted             in    bringing

casualties               from       within        the       tunnel          to    the          rear.           There          were      two

ambulances               in     attendance             at    the       rear       of       the          enclosure.                 Eventually

myself         and       other        officers          formed          a    cordon                across       the       entrance            at       the

rear      of     the       tunnel,          we    cleared          the       tunnel                allowing          access           out     for

injured          persons            and     in,    for       the       e it; e r g ericy           services          f i re        b r iq a d a ,

nurses,          doctors            etc.         The    Liverpool                supporters                   were       continually

trying         to     breach          this       cordon          many       of    them             beleiving             that       the      game

would       still          be    going       ahead,          Myself          and       several                other       officers            were

jostled,            pushed          and     abused          by    many       fans          wanting             access          to     the

t e r r a c .in g .

Fans      in     the       seated         area     a bove         the       rear       entrance                to    the       tunnel         were

ur i n a t i ng       on      the     officers          mann:i. n g         the       co r d o n , b o t h           officers             and

supporters               were       being        hit    by       urine       from          above.              Also       subject            to       this

were      the       ladies          etc     from       the       refreshment                area's             carrying             water         down

the    tunnel            and     onto       the    pitch          to    aid       the          victims.              A t .4■20          pm    it       was

announced             over       the      tannoy        that       the       game          would          not       go    ahead.             The

Liverpool             fans       then       began       to       vacate          the       terracing                in    large         numbers,

their      manner             was     abusive,          hostile             and       threatening.                       On    the      area          being

cleared          of      supporters              then       walked          across             the       pitch       and       assumed            a

position            in     the      North        Stand       as    ordered             by          a    senior       officer.                We       were

then      $.e - b r i e f e d , a n d        then       transported                   to    Main          Street          Police          Station

a r r i v i ng      at     7„05       pm.

I   can    say        that       at    no    time       was       I aware             of       the       presence             of    any      stewards

either         outside           or    inside          the       ground          it    may             just    be    that          with      the       other

happenings               that       occured        that          afternoon.                    I       simply       overlooked               their

presense.                I was        not    in    possesion                of    a    radio             that       day       and     neither           did

I   hear       any       tranmissions.

The Rt. Hon. Lord Justice Taylor,

LONDON,
WC2A 2LL.


Dear Lord Justice Taylor,

         Thank you for your letter of 5th July.

     Following on from the club seminar which was held on 2nd
August, we have now arranged an exhibition to enable companies
involved in the area of stadium construction/refurbishment to
present their wares to the clubs.

     Entitled "Stadia 90", the exhibition is to be held on
Wednesday and Thursday, 14th and 15th November, 1990 at the
National Exhibition Centre, Birmingham.

     I am writing to enquire if you would do us the honour of
opening the exhibition.  I enclose some further details on the
exhibition.

          I look forward to hearing from you.


                                                      Yours sincerely



                                                             S g j^ g e rta ry .

                                    therefore, essential that clubs have the op portunity to

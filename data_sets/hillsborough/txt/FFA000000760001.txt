Dear Sir,

                  F.A. Cun Semi-Final - 11th April 1981

       Thank ^ou for your letter dated 3rd June, referring
to the various arrangements for the natch at Hillsborough
Stafliura. I note the points you rake and appreciate the
details that you have provided.
     T'Jith particular reference to the nethod of ticket
allocation and the reason why tickets got into the wrong
hands, I assume that you are suggesting that it would be
far more appropriate if ticket distribution could be
controlled more carefully, preferably to ensure that
both Semi-Finalists carried out public distribution at
the same time, so that no fan can be in two places at
once and secondly, that care should be taken to ensure
that the supporters of the other team are not in the
vacinity of a club when their distribution is
anticipated.

     I will ensure that the letter is brought to the
attention of the appropriate Committee when further
consideration is given to the siting of the Semi-Finals
and the ticket distribution system is considered.

                            Yours faithfully,




                              E.A. Croker
                               Secretary

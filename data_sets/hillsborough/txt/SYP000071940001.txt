            I am a single ma n and           I live at the alcove address wit h my mother.



            O n S a t u r d a y April    15 1989 > 450489)       I tr a v e l l e d w i t h   an o r g a n i s ed coach

            party from B a r nes t\avjjyl agency?            C o u n t y Rd,   Walton,        L i v e r p o o l , to

            w a t c h my team Liv er po ol     play N o t t i n g h a m Fo rrest      in the F A         Cup Semi

            Final at Hil lsb or ou gh,        Sheffield.



            I got my ticket          from a friend who got            it from A n f i e l d for £6.00.                 It

            was     for the L e p pi ng s Ln terraces.



            The     coach went direct        to Sheffield,          it only st opped because               of tr\aff/c

            ho ld ups,        although    I can't   remember where          they were.
                                                                                                 P AGE         2
                                                                                                 S1&20

       The    coach was    late starting      off and we d i d n ’t reach S h e f f i e l d until

       about 2. 4 5 p m   (1445).       I can't    remember where we         parked or how far

       away from the ground we were,              but    I did get to the ground before kick

       off.



       As we a p p r o a c h e d the turn stile a rea of the Le^p^ings Ln entrance,

       that's me and my              riends                                              L i v er po ol

       and                                                L iverpool                     tel.    no.      is

                                                     we were    in a mass of people,          there

       were    no queues at all



       I lost both of my friends            in the      crush as we were just swept a l o n a / I

       didn't     go through an y t urnstiles           but went    th rough the big     fconce/tina
cJ5i
       gate wi t h the    crowd,    there was      no way at all        that I could h<W^ st opp ed

       or    change d direction,     the force of the          people was just too great.                  I

       was    swept along     towards   the tunnel w h i c h       leads to the t e r r a c i n g and

       dow n the tXinneJ^      I felt my face getting           pressed against a bar or a

       perso n an d was getting frightened,               I had to break m y glasses          off my

       face to stop them cutting me,              the    crush was so bad I c o u l d n ’t take

       them off as normal.

                                                            and someone      slapping my face and

       sa yin g   'He's OK,    h e ’s OK'

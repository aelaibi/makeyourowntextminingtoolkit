S ea ti n g     ticket      for        the N orth Stand.           We    didn't stop a ny wh er e         between

leaving home            between 9 . 30am          (0930)         and    1 0 pm (2200)     and we were       not

d el ay e d by traffic                 or for any other           reason.        However,      as we a r ri ve d       in

S h e f f i e l d we were             held up by the sheer              volume    of traffic.



We a r r i v e d quite           close     to the       ground a n d _______ (parked the            car    in a

residential          road.             It took about       five minutes           to walk       to the ground.

As we w a l ke d from the                 car to the ground              I did not      receive     or see any

P ol ic e      d ir ec ti on or escort.

because         there were             not sufficient       numbers waiting             to form a queue.

S u p p or t er s were a dm i t t e d without              delay/.        I mmediately before          going

On the other            side          of the   turnstiles         in the open yar d a r e a         leading to

          P rior   to entering         the    terracing       I had e x p e r i en ce d no diff ic ul ty

          entering       the ground.          I had not       seen any gates open other than

          turnstile       gates and       I had seen nobody enter                   the    ground   in an

          u n au th o r i s e d way - everyone         I saw went          through the          turnstiles.         I had

          hand my ticket          to the      turnstile       operator and              I retained the stub of

          the   ticket.       I had not seen any si gn po st in g                   or d irections        but    I know

          where    I wanted to go which was                  behind the          goal. ,



          We had no problems along                  the tunnel       and decided to move                to the     right

f£is1 3   of the    fence w h ic h divides            the    two    central       pens     immediately behind the

          goal.     At    this    point      I did not see a n / Police Officers                    or Match

          Stewards.        I did not see any disorder                    or other         incidents      from entering

          the group up to the             point where we            deci de d to stand on the terracing.

          I did not see any            person drinking alcohol                   in the     ground.



                   and I decided to stand adjac en t                   to the dividing            fence about        one

          third of the way down the                  terracing.



          As time went        on the      terracing         began to fill j/\ pi.           I w o ul d say that at

          about    1415 hours          it started to get            quite J r u . i l   and we were       getting

          pushed.                and   I move across a few yards at about                         the    same    level     of

          the terraces.           We m oved a few yards              to right but where we were                    then

          standing,       there were         some    lads m u c ki ng about.              About   15 m i n ut es    later

          we decided to move             forward to get awa y from the                     lads behind us.           We

          m o v e d forward to a position about                    three     rows back         from the    perimeter

          fence.      As we      looked toward the            pitch there was              part of the goal

I w ou ld estimate      the    time was        now about       1430 and the terracing was

starting    to get     full.     I w ould say,         at that       point,       it was about       the

same as a busy Ho p at a full A n f i e 1d .               We had got         into a position

w h e r e b y there was a barrier           immediately        behind our backs a m ? this                is

how I would usually s t a n d .             B e t w e e n now and    1445 the       terracing       got

even f u l l e r and everyone a ro u n d us had become                  uncomfortable.                     had

said to me that we would move at                   half   time and go further               back.



I can remember        the    teams    coming     out    to war m up.         I did not see them

be cause   I was     be i ng pushed a nd        I could not         see anything.           I say    I

remember    the teams        coming    out    for the warm because                during    its usually

then that    the     team sheets are           read out and         its Liverpool          Suppo rt er s

practise    to cheer        each name as        its    read out.        I remember         that   type of

cheer.     I do not     recall       being able        to hear      the tannoy a n n o u n c e m e n t s .



Fro m this time       onwards was a nightmare and                   I was    frig ht en ed for my own

safety and that        of my friend                .    I did not see or w i t n e s s /& n y

surging    of the     crowd but       I did feel        some    surges.       Initially        I could

feel a surge and more and more                  people    came forward and A o m e             came under

the barrier       behind us.         This    forced us forward from the barrier.



Then,    rather     than surges,       I could just        feel all         the    people    pressed

a ro u n d me and    it was getting          tighter and tighter.



I am aware    now that where           I was     standing       is referred to as Pen 3.                   I

did not see a barrier           break       in Pen 3.



All aro un d me      people were shouting              to people       on the      track which       I

        thought was Po li ce Officers and Stewards.                         We were all           shouting        "Open

        the Gate"         but    they seemed to      ignore       us.



        N o bo d y     could move at or ar ou nd me.              I had men who were              taller     than me

        standing         right    in front of me and the            crowd pressing          forward from

        behind.                  was   to my    left and    I know she was         in the same            diff ic ul ty

        as me        if not worse       due    to her being       smaller    than me and asthmatic,



        There were         people      to my right and       I just      c o u l d n ’t move.       A man behind

        me was         passing a small         boy over my head and as he did tfcis his a rm was

        t ra pp e d a nd his hand was            forcing    itself      down on the t / p          of my head.            I

        could not breathe              properly and my face was             pushed    ip to       the    backs     of

        the men        in front.                                                   , /



        My   r ec o ll e ct io n of the time        is d ifficult        because     I cannot           place     it

        a g a ni s t   the m atch or events         in the m a tc h due to the fact                 I c o u l d n ’t

        see the game at all.                  I had not seen the teams           come on the             pitch or

        the kick         off.



        My   r e co l le ction     is that      it was    sometime      shortly after         kick-off

        probably going            towards      150^ hours    I became aware          of some        going       down on

        the ground.             In my own p a n d   I knew    it was             a l th o u q h    I could not

        move myself         to see h§/.          I felt    out wit h my left hand and                   I caught

        hold of                  h ai r/and    I started to pull         her up.      As    I was        trying        some

        lads     in front of^me m a n ag ed to get her up and above                        their        heads. / T h e y

Ca t    passed her         forward over         the heads    of    people    in front of them.                A    saw

                 on the top of the             perimeter    fence and       I saw her       pushed o/ pulled

        1' think        that by the      time she was       on the      fence and onto            the track,           that

the game had been stopped and the                        players were       off the       field.     At this

point     I was       trying    to get my hands           free    to    push and try to get some

space     to breathe        I c o u l d n ’t do    it and as things were             getting       tighter

and tighter           I just thought       I was going to die.               1 was giving          up and

the ne;;t thing          I knew     I came    to on the floor of the               terracing        step.     I

am sat is fi ed that           I passed out but           I h a ve no     idea how lor>g for.          When

I came to        I was     slumped half       forward and half on my side.                    When    I came

around      I noticed s t r ai gh ta wa y         that    the    pressure    of the       crowd/had gone

and there was air              to breathe.        A girl        whom    I have    never    saen before

a s s i s t e d me    to my feet and she helped me b ac kward up t Y\& terracing

towards      the      tunnel    andthrough        the tunnel       to the yard a/rsa where            I had

o rg in al ly bought my          programmes.         I stayed          in this a rea for the best

part of half an hour               Isuppose.        The    girl who       had helped me       d isappeared

but   the    lads who      had been in front              of me who       had helped

a pp ro a c h e d me and       comforted me.         They a sk ed        if I wanted       them to stay

w ith me.       During      this    time   I was aware           of other Supporters,          Police

and Ambulance,           shou te d at us to move and saw them                     carry and then       put

down on the           ground by me a man.            I can only describe             him as a man

probably       in his      late twenties          or early thirties.             He wore some        sort of

grey jacket w hi ch was             padded and was          hip length.           I cannot    say

d efinate ly but         it may have been elasticated,                     I remember       he wore jeans

w h ic h were        dark blue     denim but       I do not know what             footwear    he wore.

My a t t e n t i o n was    drawn straight a way to his face                     being    blue and    in my

own mind       I was     sure    he was    dead.         I did not       notice anyth in g     particular

about     him ~ he did not wear              s pectacles and            I did not see any j ewellery

or earing,            I remember     his hair was          dark and short.           Apart    from the

blueness       I did not        see any    injuries        to this man.



I saw this man being               carried    not    on a stretcher or hoardings                   but by

the arms and           legs.     I saw them put him down and try to                       revive    him.     I
                                                                                                        PAGE
                                                                                                        S3474

saw others          being    put down in the         same manner and          in the same a rea near

the tunnel,           I noticed some          had their      faces       covered over wit h coats

and the       like,        Others    seemed to be injured hut were                 being      treated or

helped,       it seemed to me to be ma in ly                by S u pp or te rs    but the Police and

A m b u l an c e were      there    too.



1' saw A m bu l a n c e s were       parked by a large            gate a dj ac en t     to the

t u rn st il es     that    I had entered by.            I could see        people      rushing to and

fro from the a m u l an ce s          to the area where            people were        lying    dead and

i njured.



D ur in g all       of this    I was       concerned as to what           had h ap pened to my

f riend                     I went along      the tunnel          into   the terracing        to   look for

her    on the       pitch,



I s ho ul d say that whe n            I had    5came to'      on the terraces            having

r ecovered from fainting                 I saw a    pile    of what at first            I thought was

clothing        right      beside me and at the            front    of the terracing.              As    I was

being       helped backwards          towards      the   tunnel     I realised        it was not

clothing       but a pile of bodies.                1 am not able to describe any one body

w h ic h    I saw    in that       pile.     At first      it didn't       really sink.



E ve n ts    of that a f t e r n o o n     really started to sink            in whe n     I saw that

fella on the ground wit h the grey jacket.



H av in g    d ecided to find]______|l left the area where                       the man wit h the

grey jacket          had been       put and    I m oved through the terracing                  down

towards       the    pitch.        I think    this was      on the other         side    of the     dividim

fence       (Pen 4) and       I made my way onto            the    pitch.     I can say however

that       by this time       the    pile of bodies         I had been next           to and seen was
                                                                                                PAGE     a

      no   longer       there.



      Once     on the      pitch     I was making my way towards where            I had seen

      sitting       in the N orth Stand.         As   I did so,         found me cknd              saw

      me on the         pitch and made      her way towards       us



      Hy rec ol le ct io n         is that the   rescuing and treating       of   people   had calmed

      down and        people were wandering a ro u n d      looking    for   people    they'd    lost

      or just dazed.

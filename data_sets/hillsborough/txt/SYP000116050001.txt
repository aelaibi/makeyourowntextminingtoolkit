           I am a Police Sergeant          in the South Yorkshire Police,     at present

           stationed at Deepcar.

           On Saturday 15th April,          1989 (150489)   I was on duty in connection

           with the FA Cup Semi Final game between Liverpool and Nottingham

           Forest which was being held at the Sheffield Wednesday Football

           Ground, Hillsborough.

           My duties were as officer in charge of a mobile patrol               in a personnel

           carrier,    in company with P C ’s 583 Efavis (driver), 2378 t^ebster,

           particular attention to licensed premises and generally maintaining

           public order.

           After briefing,       at approximately 11am (1100) we took up our patrol

           area.   At this time         I noticed that there were numerous      people waiting

           about outside       licensed premises,    many of them wearing Liverpool

           colours.     Throughout the day until just before 3pm         (1500)      frequent

           checks were made of licensed premises, and several mini               buses and

           vans containing Liverpool          supporters were stopped and checked.         Four

           people were reported under the Sporting Events            (Control   of

     very full from mTcTcfafy onwards and it was obvious that a lot of
</
     ail cohol Was being         consumed.   Conduct of people throughout this period

     was good humoured and there were no public order incidents.

     The area for which I was responsible                is some 20-30 minutes drive from

     the football           ground under normal    traffic     conditions.         In the

     exceptional        circumstances on the day had I been attending the game I

     would have allowed myself at least an hour to make my way to the

     vicinity of the ground,           find somewhere to park and make my way

     inside.      Numerous       people were advise    fof     the time factof by myself

     and other officers but until well after half past two th#re were

     By approximately 2.50pm           (1450) we had made our way towards the

     ground.      On route,       I had heard broken messages on the radio and

/    understood there to be crowd control                problems at the Leppings Lane

     turnstiles.

       asked Ground Control           if they had any instructions and was told to

     stay on patrol around the ground.

     Shortly after 3pm           (1500), we were    in the Penistone Road North area.

     By now I had heard further radio messages and understood there were

     serious     crowd problems       inside the ground at the Leppings Lane end.

     At this time a message was passed from Ground Control                        instructing all

     available officers           to go to the ground.

     We went there via Penistone Road North and Penistone Road.                               When
                                                                             PAGE
                                                                             R532

close to the main North Stand entrance gates        I, instructed PC Davis

to remain with the vehicle, and with the rest of my officers             I

entered tfre ground via the. access between the North Stand and the

S p i o n Hop.'

I looked towards the Leppings Lane end and saw a 'large number of

Police officers and supporters standing on the playing area.              The

game had been stopped.         I could see from this distance   people

climbing over the security fence onto the playing area.

I was still       not fully aware of what the situation was, and from what

I saw I assumed a pitch invasion was taking place.           I walked with my

officers along the front of the North Stand,        expecting to begin

moving supporters either back into the Leppings Lane Terrace or out

of the ground.

My view of what was actually happening was blocked by other             people

until    I actually arrived at the Leppings Lane end behind the goal and

I then saw that a large portion of the crowd — those at the front —

were crushed against the security fence and were          in danger of being

injured.      The one small    gate in the fence was open, and a number of

officers were trying to remove people through this gate.              I went to

assist.

My first sight was of a young man lying on the ground,          half    in and

half out of the gate.         His upper half was free,   but from the waist

down he was trapped by others        lying on top of him and it was

impossible to pull him free until those on top moved.           The    person

immediately on top of him was a couple of feet further back with his

head level with the gateway,        the one on top of him was further back

still,    and so on.    The only practical way of freeing     people was for

those at the back to be moved to ease the weight on those on the

floor.     Several   officers were on the terraces trying to do this.

The   pressure from the crowd who were still on their feet appeared to
                                                                            PAGE
                                                                            R53E

me to be relentless, and a free space behind those on the floor was

only achieved wi th great difficulty due to the crush of people.

At this time     whilst   I was waiting for the man on the floor to be

freed,   I was   aware of people pushed tip -against the fence.      At this

time they all* appeared to foe alive,       but obviously distressed.

Eventually the man was ^reed,         and with another officer I pulled him

from the gateway and left him with others on the playing area.               I

returned and tried to help others out. The whole          problem was the

narrowness of the gate through which people had to pass - there were

sufficient officers on the track to pull         people away,   but only two at

a time could     actually stand in the gateway.

Whilst waiting to try      and help,    I was aware by now that the situation

was really serious and I could see people against the fence who were

obviously dying.     I was helpless to do anything directly to help them

and continued to help pull      people,    both alive and dead,   from the area

around the gateway.       My only clear recollections of this period were

that I knew the area around the gateway must not get blocked with

rescued people,    and I can remember      running with several   people,

myself and others taking an arm apiece,         and dragging them well      out

onto the playing area where they could be attended to.            The only

person whose description I can remember was a fair haired boy about

ten years old,    dressed in a red tracksuit, who I carried from the

gate.    He appeared to have no physical       injuries and he was pleading

with me to go and find his Father         in the crowd.

By approximately 3.45pm      (1545)    the situation around the gateway had

eased considerably.       The crowd had been pushed back and some sort of

system had been established to remove people, most of whom now

appeared to me to be dead.

At this time I was standing some way onto the playing area with PC

Churns who drew my attention to the Nottingham Forest Manager, Brian
                                                                                   PAGE   3

         Clough, who was on the field a short distance from us.             People were

         baginning to move towards him and I heard threatening            comments made

         against him by some.

         rtySflf, PC Churms and others,        pushed our way through the crowd of

         people surroundirtfMr. Clough and went with him to the safety of the

         players*    tunnel.

         No one appeared to be securing the tunnel         entrance at this time so we

         remained there    preventing access by unauthorised persons.

         During the time I was in the ground I had been approached by numerous

         people asking about       casualties or, more often,   being extremely

         abusive towards all the police officers         present.    A good many of

         these were definitely the worse fo drink and I saw one man who I had

         cause to speak to, and who was extremely drunk,            stagger a few yards

         away from me and fall flat on his face in a drunken stupor.             He was

         subsequently removed by members of the crowd.

         At 4.30pm    (1630) all    ’mobile*   officers were ordered back to their

         vehicles.     Myself,   P C ’s churms, Webster and Rees made our way back to

         our vehicle and resumed patrol.         PC Hays, who had become separated

         from us during our initial       involvement,   did not rejoin us until some

         time la t e r .

               I am a Police Sergeant in the South Yorkshire Police, at present stationed
               at Deepcar.

               On Saturday 15th April 1988 I was on duty in connection with the FA Cup
               Semi Final game between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest which was being held at
               the Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground, Hillsborough.

               My duties were as officer in charge of a mobile patrol in a personnel
               carrier, in company with PC's 5$3 Davis (driver), 2378 Webster, 8kk Rees,
               300 Hays and 2628 Churms.

               Our area of patrol was the Deepcar/ Oughtibridge area, paying particular
               attention to licensed premises and generally maintaining public order.

               After briefing, at approximately 11am, we took up our patrol area. At this
               time I noticed that there were numerous people waiting about outside
               licensed premises, many of them wearing Liverpool colours. Thoughout the
               day until just before 3Pm frequent checks were pade of licensed premises,
               and several mini buses and jaaacsidc vans containing Liverpool supporters
               were stopped and checked. Four people were reported under the Sporting
               Events (Control of Alcohol) Act 1985 for possessing alcohol on their way
               to a designated sporting event.

               Checks at public houses showed that some had few customers, wheras others
               - in particular the Silver Fox, Manchester Road, Stocksbridge and the Blue
               Ball, Wharncliffe Side, were heavily patronised by Liverpool supporters.
               Both these public houses in particular were very full from mid day onwards,
               and it was obvious that a lot of alcohol was being consumed. Conduct of
               people throughout this period was good humoured and there were no public
               order incidents.                            r

   The area for which I was responsible is some 20 - 30 minutes drive from
   the football ground under noriial traffic conditions. In the exceptional
   cricumstances on the day had I been attending the game I would have
   allowed myself at least an hour to make my way to the vicinity of the
   ground, find somewhere to park and make my way inside. Numerous people
   were advised of the time factor by myself and other officers but until
   well after half past two there were still people in the public houses
   and still quite heavy traffic making its way towards the ground.

   By approximately 2.50pm we had made our way towards the ground.
   On route, I had heard broken messages on the radio and understood there
   to be crowd control problems at the Leppings Lane turnstiles.

    I asked Ground Control if they had any instructions and was told to stay
    on patrol around the ground.

    Shortly after 3pm, we were in the Penistone Road North area. By now I
    had heard further radio messages and understood there were serious crowd
    problems inside the ground at the Leppings lane end. At this time a message
    was passed from Ground Control instructing all available officers to go
    to the ground.

    We went there via Penistone Road North and Penistone Road. When close to
    the main North S^and entrance gates I instructed PC Davis to remain with
    the vehicle, and with the rest of my officers I entered the ground via
    the access between the North Stand and the Sp&on Kop.

    I looked towards the Leppings lane end and saw a large number ofPolice
    Officers and supporters standing on the playing area. The game had been
    stopped. I could see from this distance people climbing over the security
    fence onto the playing area.

    I was still not fully aware of what the situation was, and from what I
    saw I assumed a pitch invasion was taking place. I walked with my officers
    along the front of the North Stand, expecting to begin moving supporters
    either back into the Leppings Lane Terrace or our of the ground.

    My view of what was actually happening was blocked by other people until
    I actually arrived at the Leppings Lane end behind the goal and I then
    saw that a large porting of the crowd - those at the front - were crushed
    against the security fence and were in danger of being injured. The one
    small gate in the fence was open, and a number of officers were trying
    to remove people through this gate. I went to assist.

    My first sight was of a young man lying on the ground, half in and half
    out of the gate. His upper half was free, but from the waist down he
    was trapped by others lying on top of him and it was impossible to pull
    him free until those on top moved. The person immediately on top of him
    was a couple of feet further back with his head level with the gateway,
    the one on top of him was further backstill,and so on. The only practical
    way of freeing people was for those atthe back to be moved to ease the weight
    on those on the floor. Several officers were on the terracestrying to do
    this.

The pressure from the crowd who were still on their feet appeared to me to
be relentless, and a free space behind those on the floor was only achieved
with great difficulty due to the crush of people.

At this time whilst I was waiting for the man on the floor to be freed, I was
aware of people pushed up against the fence. At this time they all appearedto
be alive, but obviously distressed.

Evetually the man was freed, and with another officer I pulled him from the
gateway and left him with others on the playing area. I returned and tried to help
others out. The whole problem was the narrowness of the gate through which
people had to pass - there were sufficient officers on the track to pull people
away, but only two at a time could actually stand in the gateway.

Whilst waiting to try and help, I was aware by now that the situation was
really serious and I could see people against the fence who were obviously dying.
I was helpless to do anything directly to help them and continued to help pull
people, both alive and dead, from the area around the gateway. My only clear
recollectionsof this period were that I knew the area around the gateway
mustnt get blocked with rescued people, and I can remember running with several
people, myself and others taking an arm apiece, and dragging them well out onto
the playing area where they could be attended to. The only person whose
description I can remember was a fair haired boy about ten years old, dressed
in a red tracksuit, who I carried from the gate. He appeared to have no
physical injuries and he was pleading with me to go and find his Father in
the crowd.

By approximately 3.i+5pra» the situation around the gateway had eased considerably.
The crowd had been pushed back, and some sort of system had been established
to remove people, most of whom now appeared to me to be dead.

At this time I was standing some way onto the playing area with PC Churms
who drew my attention to the Nottingham Forest Manager, Brian Clough, who
was on the field a short distance from us. People were beginning to move
towards him and I heard threatening comments made against him by some.

Myself, PC Churms and others pushed our way through the crowd of people
surrounding Mr Clough and went with him to the safety of the players tunnel.

No one appeared to be securing the tunnel entrance at this time so we reamined
there preventing access by unauthorised persons.

 During the time I was in the ground I had been approached by numerous people
 asking about casualties or, more often, being extremely abusive towards all
 the police officers present. A good many of these were definitely the worse
 for drink and I saw one man who I had cause to speak to, and who was extremely
 drunk, staggera few yards away from me and fall flat on his face in a drunken
 stupor. He was subsequently removed by members of the crowd.

 At 4.30pm, all 'mobile' officers were ordered back to their vehicles. Myself,
 PC's Churms, Webster and Rees made our way back to our vehicle and resumed
 patrol. PC Hays, who had become separated from us during our initial
 involvement, did not rejoin us until some time later.

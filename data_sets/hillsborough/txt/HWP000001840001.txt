                   announcement from a member of the Family Support
                   Group;

        (B) verbal submissions made by George Howarth M.P. and Jane

            Shiela Spiers of the Football Supporters Association;
            and

        (E) the resolution concerning this matter contained in
            Minute 3 99 of the proceedings of the meeting of the
            Policy and Resources Committee held on 23rd February,
            1998, viz:-

This City Council is acutely aware of the outrage from its citizens
following the Home Secretary's presentation of Lord Justice
Stewart-Smith's report on the Hillsborough Disaster, in which the
decision was to take the issues no further.

This decision flies in the face of considerable evidence and has
left the families, the City Council and citizens stunned beyond
belief.  Lord Justice Stewart-Smith quite clearly, on his arrival
in Liverpool left many people in no doubt that he would produce a
negative report.

This City Council therefore calls upon the Home Secretary to look
again at the evidence provided by the families and many others, and
set aside Lord Justice Stewart-Smith's submission. Furthermore,
this City Council'continues to support the Hillsborough Family
Support Group until justice for the 96 victims is finally achieved.

The City Council further calls upon the Party Leaders at
Westminster and M.P.'s on Merseyside to mount a campaign for the
rejection of Lord Justice Stewart-Smith's findings and for the Home
Secretary to institute a new Inquiry.

Failing to do so would be an affront to the families and the
victims.




      al/cttee/hillsborou/draftmin/Y2 702 98
    Resolved that the resolution of the Policy and Resources
    Committee be endorsed and any further action be determined
    at a further meeting when the Family Support Group have had
    the opportunity to determine the precise nature of their
    response to the decision of the Home Secretary and of the
    campaign necessary to support that response.


17. Memorial - Sheffield Wednesday F.C.

    The Working Party considered information that.there had
    been no progress of any sort in relation to the calls
    previously made upon Sheffield Wednesday F.C. by way of
    Sheffield City Council to erect a permanent Memorial to the
    victims of the Disaster at the Hillsborough Stadium.

    Resolved that:-

    (A)   the Chief Executive be requested to write again to the
          Chief Executive of Sheffield City Council to ascertain
          if their meeting with Sheffield Wednesday with regard
          to a Memorial has taken place and if so what was
          decided;

    (B)   the Chief Executives of other Merseyside Councils be
          encouraged to take similar action; and

    (C)   the Leader of the Council be encouraged to discuss
          this matter with his counterpart in Sheffield City
          Council to attempt to ensure their full support.

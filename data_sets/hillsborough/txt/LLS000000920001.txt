 I attended Sheffield Wednesdays Ground on Saturday
 15th April 1989, with a couple of my friends and
 my son.


 We were actually in the ground from about 1.55 p.m
 We stood in the same spot all the time in the
 Leppings Lane End on the terraces.


We could see that it was filling up all         the time
but what I would call the "sudden death" surge,
happended in seconds.


We were right behind the goal, jammed across
the fence.
My son was next to me also crushed against the
fence.
As soon as the surge started I was crushed from
the begining of that    until we couldwalk onto
the terraces and out    on to the pitch.


Once all the crushing appeared to be "over" and
by that I mean that once there was less crushing,
a friend pulled us through.


My son is            and he is         born on the
             »




It is hard to describe the thoughts that were
going through me at the time.


We were being crushed and there were bodies under
me.
The breath was being sqeezed out of me and I thought
that I was going to die.

                                                             /


I thought also, in fact, that my son was one of
the bodies that were under me but I have since
discovered that he actually had to stand on my
head to clamber over.

I sustained, an injury across my chest, down my
             AaA
ribs, under my ribs and down my back.


At one point I actually stopped breathing and
I thought that I was on my way                 out when I took
one last final deep breath and then I felt I was
beind squeezed again and I managed to get through.


I was pulled through by a friend.


It was then that I saw my son again, he was running
around   like a chicken without its head.


My son wanted       to take me to the first aid there
and then, but, I thought that he had seen enough,
and I put on a brave face for him.


I wanted to go home, I had seen people who had
gone to see a football match dieing all around
me and I remember someone to the back of me clinging
to me and I could hear his gasps of breath down
my ear.
All of a sudden, whoever it was, just stopped
breathing.

I wanted to get back home and we started walking
back to the coach.

As I was leaving the ground my bottle went completely,
 I froze but I still carried on putting on a brave
 face for my son.

We eventually got back to Liverpool but on the
way back, my breathing was getting worse and worse
and I knew that I was in a bad way.


From my home I was taken straight to Walton Hospital
on the Saturday night and I have been there ever
since under observation.


I would like to say that when the crushing first
started I turned round and saw a row of 3 or 4
Police Officer.
They were just standing there and we were shouting
at them but none of them reacted at all.
It was like a row of German Officers looking down
on us and not one of them reached for their radios
or helped in any way.


Once the surging started there was nothing that
I could do to help anyone.

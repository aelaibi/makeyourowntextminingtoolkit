    17.   SCOTLAND v. ENGLAND - 29TH MAY-, 1982 Following a lengthy discussion
            the Committee deferred until the next Meeting a decision on whether
            to apply to the Scottish Football Association for'an allocation of
            tickets for this match.


    18.   P.A. CHALLENGE CUP SEMI-FINAL TIE VENUES The Committee considered
            the following Minute of the Executive Committee of 20th August,
            1981:-

           *â€™It was felt that the time had arrived for a policy decision to be
           reached in respect of the staging of semi-final matches. It was
           agreed that a recommendation should be made to the Match and Grounds
           Committee and the Challenge Cup Committee that consideration be
           given to no longer playing semi-final matches on neutral grounds.
           The recommendations of both these Committees should then be referred
           back to the Executive Committee for further consideration."

           The Committee felt that ho change to theRules of the
           Competition should be made this Season. The Committee also felt
           that if the Semi-Finals of the Challenge Cup were to continue tobe
           played on neutral grounds, the two competing Clubs should receive all
           the tickets between them and not as at present, each Club receiving
           40% of the tickets and the staging Club 20%.

           The Committee also decided to discuss further this matter at the
           next Meeting.

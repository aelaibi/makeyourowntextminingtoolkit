                 On Saturday 15th April         1989 <130489)         I was a uniformed officer

                 stationed at West Bar Police Station,                 Sheffield.

                 On that day I started duty at 8 am (0800) at./West Bar Police Station

                 in connection with the football            semi-final              between Liverpool and

                Nottingham Forest which was to take place at Hillsborough Football

                Ground.

                At 9 am (0900)       that day I attended a briefing at West Bar Police

5*2>noA %e> Station during which 1 was assigned to Serial 20 which                                  a reserve

                At 10.30 am (1030)          the serial   commenced patrol of the Sheffield City

                Centre    in a police van regarding arrival                     of fans for the semi-final.

                At 11.45 am      (1145)     the serial was directed to the M-jalat/ty^ai Iway

                Station,    Sheffield where we assisted other officers Vo escort arriving

and a second man arrested as a result of this                      incident.         ^

At 2.43 pm (1443)       the serial      returned to West Bar Police Station for

meal.    Whilst taking meal          in the canteen we were directed urgently to

the ground at Hillsborough             regarding a problem with the crowd.

On arrival at the football                   at    3.13 pm (1313)         the serial went to

the area of the Police         roo           >^e   were told to s t a n d b y .          At that

time    I saw that    injured persons and bodies were being brought from the

area of the pitch by police officers and members of the                            crowd.    We

were then directed onto the pitch to assist with clearing the crowd

from that area.

At 4 pm (160u)       I accompanied PS HELL IWE^kL to Me^pir'ngs L^ne outside the

ground regarding fans         leaving the >fiDund.        We       remained there until

4.30 pm (1630) when we were directed to return to West Bar sub-division.

On route I was dropped on Shalesmoor where                1 was        to standby regarding

fans from the ground making their way back to the city centre.

At 6.30 pm (1830)       I   was directed to return to West Bar Police Station.

At 7.30 pm (1930)       I went off duty.

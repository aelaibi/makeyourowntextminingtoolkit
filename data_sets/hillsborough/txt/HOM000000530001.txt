                will state




     I am employed by SYMAS as                                        and I work

     from the Control Centre, Moorgate, Rotherham.                  I joined the

     ambulance service in 1968 and I have worked through the

     ranks since then.          I have been in the control room for 10/12

     years   and have gained considerable experience.                   I work a

     three shift rota.



3.   On Saturday the 15th April 1989 my tour of duty was 1400-

     2200 hours but as usual I went in early to take over and be

     brought up to date by the earlier Superintendent.



4.   The   control    room         staff consisted of myself          in charge,

     Control   Officer        on    the emergency desk,

     Control   Of f i c e r    on the outpatients           desk,

     control assistants Cath Lines on 1400/2200 hours,

             on days.         It was the usual shift staff



     From 1400 hours it was just routine, dealing with everyday

     incidents        I was             aware   of   the   football   match   at

     Hillsborough as we had been given information about it and I

     had made myself familiar with the information.




                                    I
6.   At 1506.29 an emergency call from force control at Snig Hill

     was taken by                 and put through to me.   The details

     of the call are as follows

15.08.13   F/C              Goodbye



7.   We would not normally send a fleet of ambulances upon a sole

     request from a police officer, especially as I knew we had

     one of our vehicles at the ground.         I did take the call

     seriously but I wanted my own crew to assess the situation.



8.   Immediately afterwards a second call was taken by

     the details of which are:-



15.08.27   DCL   Hello Police

           F/C   Ambulance (---- ) Leppings Lane end, Leppings Lane

                 tin cl •

                 y ou've got love

           DCL   Theres one on its way

           F/C   We want more than one

           DCL   Yes just hold on while we get the ambulance up

                 there we've got officers in the vicinity that can

15.08.51         assess it for whi

9.   We have an emergency channel from control to our officers at

     the ground, who have portable radios.     The ambulances    also




                                      H-
          have radios.      I did not test the   portable radios, but the

          tests would have been done when the officers at the ground

          began duty during the morning.



    10.   After taking the first police call I immediately spoke to

          Stuart Machin Control Officer and asked him to contact our

          officers at the ground so as to obtain a situation report,

          and   to   mobilise     a unit   from the Middlewood Ambulance

          Station,    sending it to Leppings Lane.    I am aware that

                     spoke with              at 1508.49 (Track 19 page 2)
*
          and asked him to assess the Leppings Lane entrance as the

          police were requesting us at this entrance.



    1 1 . A radio message had already come in from Alpha 3 (Patrick
          Higgins). The call was received at 15.05.53 and stated

                Alpha 3 - Alpha 3     C.

                C. A 3 K.

                A3 A3 got problems with crown down at Hillsbro 1 or 2

                come over the top and are injured, these inj could poss

                be slight and not need transportation at this time if

                you could have another motor standing by close to the

                ground please K.

                C. Rg we have the crew stood by at Mw. stn do you want

                them nearer the ground.

                A3 That will do thanks K.

                C. Rg keep me informed if you require them

                K.




                                      5
           A 3 will do.



      Mr Hopkins was in the control room when call was received

      from Alpha 3 and after contacting the standby vehicle at

      Middlewood he immediately decided to leave for Hillsborough.



12.   Shortly afterwards I took a further call from police control

      and was informed that there were a number of fatalities and

      a number    of injuries.       I was given information that a

      "general response"     was in operation at Hillsborough.           I

      aksed    what   this   term   meant   and was    informed   that all

      available police manpower from South Yorkshire were being

      requested to attend Hillsborough to deal with the incident.

      (Track 10, Page 2)



13.   Two off duty officers                      and                had by

      chance come into the office.          Before they arrived I had

      assessed what ambulances        were available, bearing in mind

      that we still had to allow for routine calls.



14.   I satisfied myself that the control officers had kept back

      sufficient cover and was left with several units, I believe

      eight,   and they were all despatched to Hillsborough.          They

      were sent from various stations within South Yorkshire.



15.   Up to now everything was in order, response was good and

      communications were good.




                              6.
16    I told                to start a log and record as much as she

      could.                      started to involve himself in the

      control room work mobilising vehicles and contacting other

      ambulance services,      West Yorkshire,      Nottingham and Derby,

      along with myself.



17.   The   other   services     were   informed that we had a major

      incident at Hillsborough Football Ground.              They were asked

      to mobilise whatever vehicles they had available                   towards

      the South Yorkshire boundary.               They w o u l d   be   used   if

      required   at the incident and if necessary to assist in

      routine work. My call to W.Y.M.A.S. is recorded on Track 11

      pages 8 and 9 and is as follows



15.15.47    RC        Yes we've got a cup tie going on it looks

                      like     theres   a   lot    of   people     injured     or

            RC           Bye Bye



18.   I had given                  a list of control room staff and told

      her   to contact        as many as    she could and get them into

      control.



19.   It soon became obvious that we were dealing with a major

      incident.     Calls were coming in by radio and telephone about

      Hillsborough and additionally routine calls were coming in

      and being dealt with.        Among the calls were several from the

      press and T.V.       These calls started very early the first one

      being received at 1528 from the Mail on Sunday.           Throughout

      the afternoon the calls from the media were persistent and

      very often a nuisance.           The calls blocked our    telephone

      lines,     thus hindering our emergency calls to bring in extra

      staff , mobilise extra vehicles and also relaying calls from

      off duty doctors and nurses who could not get through to

      their own hospitals.         Most of the press, when we told them

      that we did not have time to speak to them were considerate

      enough to ring off and telephone back at a given time. Some,

      h owever,     were      extremely    persistent   and certainly one

      newspaper,     the Sunday Mirror used the 999 call          to    get

      through to us in their search for information.            I and the

      other    control     staff were particularly a nn oye d    at    this

      intrusion.    The volume of the press calls was such that
f

                    Public Relations Officer and P.A. to             came

          in off duty and took over the responsibility for answering

          all    the press   calls.   This meant that one of our trained

          staff who would have assisted in the control room with the

          emergency was effectively removed from this function and

          devoted her whole time to deal with media requests          for

          information.



    20.                    informed me that the emergency   desk could not

          cope with the volume of work,      and I decided the incident

          from then on would be run from the major incident room,

          which is next door. I told the staff what was going to

          happen and with                   went next door to the major

          incident room.



    21 . At 1522 I opened up the Emergency Reserve Channel which
          meant that the majority, if not all, of the calls connected

          with the Hillsborough incident would be taken in the Major

          Incident Room.



    22 . I received calls from our units which were mobilised and en
          route,   I also received calls from other areas to confirm

          that their units were mobile and available.



    23.   I do not know how many ambulances were available from other

          areas, but from the calls I took I knew there were quite a

          lot.     Calls   still came in about the incident and demands




                               IO
      from ambulances grew,       so I directed ambulances from other

      areas to the ground with our own units.



24.   At   1529   (Track   16,   Page 3)   a call     from                was

      received     requesting    the m a j o r   inc ide nt   vehicle   to be

      mobilised.     This vehicle is based at Rotherham and it was

      mobilised at once, as requested.            The vehicle was reported

      mobile and communication with the vehicle was good.               It was

      directed to the ground.



25.   I got reports from units sent to the ground to the effect

      that they had arrived.       They reported when they were leaving

      and going to hospitals.           Some reported seriously injured

      people, but all kind of messages came in.



26.   When the units had left the patients at the hospitals they

      reported green,      that is, empty and were sent back to the

      gr ound.     Casualties      wer e   initially taken to Northern

      General,    but when we were told that it was full all units

      were directed to the Hallamshire.



27.   From the feed back I got I felt that we were coping with the

      situation.     The ambulances deployed to the football ground

      seemed to be sufficient for the demand I did not have any

      requests indicating that insufficient units were available.



28.   When the staff on the ambulances came over the radio they




                                   If
      were calm and when they asked for orders they were given

      them.



29.   The response to the call for control room staff was being

      answered,   and as they reported they were deployed to give

      assistance where it was needed.       The routine work was being

      dealt with    all   the   time   as well    as   the   Hillsborough

      incident.



30.   All the time I was getting reports from our staff at the

      ground and fairly quickly from this information all or most

      of the casualties had been taken from the ground. The demand

      for units    scaled down,     and when they        we re    no   longer

      required I began to "stack" them at two locations, Herries

      Road bus depot and Netherthorpe Road.



31.   There was no point having empty ambulances at the ground,

      but they remained at locations easily accessible to the

      ground should they be further required.



32.                       *ho is in charge of communications had

      answered    our calls     for off duty     staff   and     arrived   at

      Control.    I briefed him of the situation.



33.   The situation from the emergency control room began to ease,

      At some stage we were informed that all casualties had been

      cleared and the incident began to wind down.




                                /2-
34.   During the incident at odd times I was unable to contact a

      certain individual,           but all messages that needed to get

      through got through.              It was possible that on those rare

      times when I couldn't contact personnel                   they were busy

      looking after injured people.                 I would describe the overall

      communication throughout the incident as good.



35.   I do not know how long the incident took.                     It was so busy

      that    it   was   im po s s i b l e    to note the time,       but I would

      describe the response of the services as excellent,                    I was

      very proud of the staff.               They kept calm and did a good job.



36.   As the incident began to close I left the emergency control

      room in the hands of                                and assistant

              :ook over from



37.   I went back into the main control room to ensure that the

      routine work was still going on and I found that it was.                    It

      was very orderly and very efficiently run.                    Throughout the

      afternoon      from     the    time      of   the   initial    call   on   the

      Hillsborough incident between 1500 and 1800 we handled a

      total of 49 emergency calls over and above the Hillsborough

      incident.



38.   One of the extra tasks we had to perform during the incident

      was    to empty    a ward       at Hallamshire.         We moved several




                                   13
      patients to the King Edward VII Hospital at Rotherham .



39.   The request came from the hospital to move the patients and

      we used ambulances that we had available to complete the

      move.

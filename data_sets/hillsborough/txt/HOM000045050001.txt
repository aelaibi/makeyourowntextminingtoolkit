                                          &
I attach some material which you will wish to see.      This is in three parts.

2.     It might be helpful for you to look first at the green folder, which contains some
documents which I have filleted from the files which the Home Office has been keeping
 bout Hillsborough since the issue surfaced again at the end o f last year with

       a)       the broadcast (on 5 December) o f the Granada TV film which we have seen;
                and

       b)       the adjournment debate in the House o f Commons obtained by Peter
                Kilfoyle, MP for Liverpool Walton, on 17 December.

3.     I do not think there is anything else on our files which you will need. But they are
available if you wish to see them.

4.      The main item in the green folder is the material at 13 from Alun Jones QC. You
will need to read this in conjunction with the blue folders (marked Annexes A to G) which he
mentions, which form the second group o f material. In these

       Annex A is the skeleton argument made in the Divisional Court in 1993 on behalf o f
       families o f six o f the (then) 95 Hillsborough victims who were seeking judicial
       review o f the verdict o f accidental death at the inquests on them and applying for fresh
       inquests. The Attorney General had decided in August 1992 not to exercise his
       power under section 13 o f the Coroners Act 1988 to order fresh inquests.

       Annex B is the Divisional Court’s judgement.

       Annex C the affidavit o f Roger Houldsworth, who acted as video technician for
       Sheffield Wednesday on 15 April 1989.

      Annex D (split into D1 and D2) contains transcripts o f evidence at Lord Taylor’s
      Inquiry and at the Inquest which are said to be contradicted by Houldsworth’s
      affidavit at Annex C.
         Annex E is part o f the Coroners address to the jury - the full day’s proceedings on
         Monday 25 March 1991. The Coroner seems to have addressed the jury over (at least)
         three days - on the previous Friday 22 March and on Tuesday 26th. Alun Jones refers
         specifically to what Dr Popper says at page 125 Annex E.

        Annexes F & G contrast material from Dr Ed Walker with the evidence o f Dr Slater,
        pathologist, and others at the Inquest (see also Dr Walkers original 1989 statement at
        2 in the green folder).

5.     The third group o f material is what is contained in the two grey ringbinders. This is
material which the Home Office was sent by South Yorkshire police in February 1997
following an approach from the Department after the broadcast o f the Granada TV
‘Hillsborough’ programme on 5 December 1996 (see 6 and 10 in the green folder). In this,
Volume One contains video schedules for what was shown to Lord Justice Taylor’s Inquiry
and extracts from evidence given (to Taylor) by PC Bichard, who operated the police CCTV
cameras at the ground and (to the Inquest) by three medical witnesses, Usher, Slater and
Gumpert. There is also the Coroner’s reasoning as to the 3.15 cut-off point for relevant
evidence (see especially page 17 o f the extract at 3).

        We have the tapes TB1 and TB2 referred to the in video schedules here. I have not
yet watched them myself, but there will be viewing facilities in our rooms on the 11th floor o f
Queen Anne s Gate. The material itemised at 7 and 8 in Volume One appears to be
extracted from what is described at 1. I do not altogether follow why this is but will pursue it
with the police as soon as I can.

7.      Volume Two sets out the ‘ten questions’ posed by Granada TV (see 6 in the green
folder) and South Yorkshire police’s answers to them.

Taylor Inquiry m aterial held at the Public Records Office

8.      We have located what appear to be the entire records o f Lord Justice Taylor’s Inquiry
at the Public Records Office in Kew. There are 106 separate files which in all, I am told are
12 feet thick.

9.       I attach a schedule (transparent envelope). We have arranged for all 12 feet o f files to
be ferried to Queen Anne’s Gate over the next few days - the first instalment will be here by
Monday. Perhaps you could let me know which o f them you would like to see over the next
fortnight (there may not be enough space for all o f them in your chambers at the Royal Courts
o f Justice).

Leave

        I will be on leave from Thursday next week until Monday 4 August.

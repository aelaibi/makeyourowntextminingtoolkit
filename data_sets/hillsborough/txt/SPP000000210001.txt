Dr. S.Popper,




Dear Stefan,

re:       HILLSBOROUGH Scrutiny

Thank you for your letter of 18 June, with its enclosure. I tried to telephone you earlier today, but
as there was no answer I thought that I would drop you a line.

The impression which I had certainly gained from the previous correspondence was that the
interview itself would not be made public, nor the correspondence which augmented it. Now it
seems that the interview has been published, if only by being placed in the House of Commons
Library. There is little you can do to overcome that but it does not follow, either, that you should
be required to disclose the correspondence as well.

Thus, it seems to me that there is no need for you to continue the correspondence with the Home
Office.

Yours sincerely,

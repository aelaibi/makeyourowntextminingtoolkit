Dear Mr Nicholl
Thank you very much for the revised version of your report.
The next stage will be that we will invite you to come and give
evidence. I do not intend simply to read the report and no doubt
you will be able to take us through it. We will arrange to have
copies of the Tables available so that these can be displayed
when you are giving your evidence.
For your information I am allowing the lawyers to check through
the data base and 1t may be that they might come up with some
variation. If it is relevant I will of course get in touch with
you so that you can decide whether any adjustment in the computations
1s needed. I am not providing them with a copy of your report or
the Tables in it.
Thank you once again for producing this report.
Yours sincerely

Summary

This note discusses the evidence for associations between time of entry to Hillsborough
football ground, age, and alcohol consumption amongst spectators who died. There is
some statistical evidence that those victims who entered late were more likely to have
raised blood alcohol levels than those who entered early. This association is in part due
to the fact that the women and youths who died had little blood alcohol and also tended
to have entered the ground early. However, the association between time of entry and
alcohol levels persisted in men aged 18 or more.

The Data

Data was provided by HM Coroner on the probable time of entry to the ground and
route of entry, the place of death, blood alcohol level, and the age and sex of each of the
95 victims of the Hillsborough football disaster.




Results

1. Time of entry

The time of entry and route of entry were classified as shown in table 1, which also
shows the age, sex, and blood alcohol levels of those spectators who died. Nothing was
known about the entry times of 13 spectators. For a further 22 spectators the time of
entry was assessed as being after 2.30 pm. but it was not known whether they entered via
gate "C", and hence after 2.48 when the gate was opened, or via a turnstile. The
 remaining victims have been divided into two groups according to whether or not they
 entered before 2.48 (via a turnstile), dr at or after 2.48 (when gate C was opened).
 There are associations between both the age and sex of the victims and when they
 entered the ground. More than half (53%) of the victims who are known to have
 entered before 2.48 were under 20, whilst less than a third (31%) of those known to
have entered after 2.48 were youths (table 2). Similarly, all 5 of the women whose entry
times were certainly known entered before 2.30 (table 3). One woman was known to
have entered either through gate "C" or after 2.30, and nothing Was known about the
entrance of the other woman who died.

The age distribution of those who were known only to have entered either through gate
"C" or through a turnstile after 2.30 was the same as the age distribution of those known
to have entered after 2.48; and quite different from that of those known to have entered
before 2.48 (table 2). Furthermore, of the 7 victims known to have died in pen 4, three
were known to have entered after 2.48 (via gate "C") and the other four were assessed as
having either entered through gate C or through a turnstile after 2.30. This evidence
suggests that those victims who were known only to have entered via gate C or after 2.30
may form part of the group who entered after 2.48; and they have been combined with
this group in the main analysis below to form a group of 48 victims termed "later
entrants". The remainder are termed "earlier entrants" (34 victims), or "not known" (13
victims).




Blood alcohol levels

The blood alcohol levels have been divided into three categories: no blood alcohol or
negligible traces (<10 mg/dl); between 10 and 70 mg/dl, and 80 mg/dl or more. The
latter value is the legal limit for drinking and driving and merely provides a convenient,
though arbitrary, divide. It certainly does not imply that persons over this value were
inebriated.

Over half (54%) of the 95 victims had no blood alcohol or negligible traces (< 10mg/dl).
Only 15 (16%) had more than 80 mg/dl (the legal limit for drinking and driving). Blood
alcohol was also associated with age and sex. Nearly three quarters (71%) of the victims
under 20 years old had negligible blood alcohol, compared to under a half (42%) of
those 20 or over (table 4). None of the women had any blood alcohol recorded (table
5).



Time of entry and blood alcohol level    .

Approximately one-third (35%) of the "earlier entrants" had raised blood alcohol levels
(> 10mg/dl), compared to nearly two-thirds (63%) of the "later entrants". The odds of
having a raised blood alcohol level for "later entrants" were 3*1 (95% Confidence
Interval: 1 • 2, 7 • 6) times as great as the odds for "earlier entrants". Thus there is strong
statistical evidence that "later entrants" were more likely to have raised blood alcohol
levels than "earlier entrants".

This association could have arisen merely because the young victims and the women
tended both to be earlier entrants and to have negative or negligible blood alcohol
levels. However, after excluding both women and young men from the analysis, the
association between alcohol and entry time persisted. For men over 18, 45% of "earlier
entrants" had blood alcohols in excess of 10 mg/dl (and 15% in excess of 80mg/dl),
whilst 71% of the "later entrants" had blood alcohol in excess of 10 mg/dl (and 29% in
excess of 80mg/dl) (table 7). Amongst men over 18, the odds of having a raised blood
alcohol level for "later entrants" were 3*0 (95% Cl: 1*0, 9*3) times as great as for
"earlier entrants", exactly as before.

This analysis is complicated by the fact that there were 13 victims whose entrance to the
ground is unrecorded, and a further 22 who can be assessed only to have entered either
through gate C (after 2.48 pm.) or through a turnstile after 2.30. The latter group have
been included with the "later entrants" after 2.48 on the basis of the similarity of their
age distribution and the disposition of their places of death. This may be wrong. If,
instead, the victims are split into two groups according to whether or not they entered
before or after 2.30 pm, then these 22 victims certainly form part of the group of later
entrants defined in this way.

The association between blood alcohol and entrance before or after 2.30 is shown in
table 8, and, again, there is some evidence that later entrants after 2.30 were more likely
to have raised alcohol levels than earlier entrants before 2.30. The odds of having
raised alcohol levels for these later entrants were 2*9 (95% Cl: 1 • 0, 8 • 6) times as great
as those for earlier entrants defined in this way.



Discussion

Whether the alcohol levels and times of entrance of these 95 victims bear any relation to
those in the general body of spectators is difficult to assess. However, if the alcohol
levels of the victims were related to their deaths, in the sense of having increased their
chances of dying, then plainly their alcohol levels might bear no relation to those in the
rest of the spectators who entered at the same time. If, on the other hand, the alcohol
levels in these victims played no part in their deaths and were not a factor in the chance
that they died, then it is at least possible that the victims’ alcohol levels reflect those that
were generally prevalent amongst the spectators who entered at the same times via the
same routes.

Since these are generally small levels of alcohol, it is perhaps unlikely that the level of
alcohol was a contributing factor in the deaths of any individual spectator. That is to
say, it is unlikely that the reason why one spectator died rather than another can be
explained to any extent at all by the victim’s blood alcohol level. (However, this does
not, of course, preclude the possibility that alcohol played some part in the deaths. It
would still be possible, to argue, for example, that the general level of alcohol
consumption amongst the spectators raised the general chance of there being some
victims without being relevant to the deaths of any individuals).

If the level of alcohol was not a contributory factor in the death of any individual then it
is possible that the alcohol levels in the victims entering at different times is a
representative sample of the alcohol levels in the spectators as a whole entering at the
same times. If this is the case, then there is some statistical evidence that amongst
spectators who entered later there was a greater proportion who had been drinking
before the game than amongst spectators who entered earlier..

Summary


This note discusses the evidence for associations between time of entry to Hillsborough football
ground and alcohol consumption amongst spectators who died. There is some statistical evidence
that those victims who entered late were more likely to have non-negligible blood alcohol levels
than those who entered early. This association is in part due to the fact that the women and youths
who died had little blood alcohol and also tended to have entered the ground early. However, the
association between time of entry and alcohol levels persisted in men aged 18 or more.


The Data


Data was provided by HM Coroner on the probable time of entry to the ground and route of entry,
blood alcohol levels, and the age and sex of the 95 victims of the Hillsborough football disaster.




Results


1. Time of entry


The time of entry and route of entry were classified as shown in table 1, which also shows the age,
sex, and blood alcohol levels of those spectators who died. Nothing was known about the entry
times of 13 spectators. For a further 22 spectators the time of entry was assessed as being after
2.30 pm. but it was not known whether they entered via gate "C" after 2.48 or via a turnstile. The
remaining victims have been divided into two groups according to whether or not they entered
before 2.48 via a turnstile, or at or after 2.48 (when gate C was opened). There are associations
between both the age and sex of the victims and when they entered the ground. More than half
(53%) of the victims who are known to have entered via a turnstile before 2.48 were under 20,
whilst loss than a third (31%) of those known to have entered after 2.48 were youths (table 2).
Similarly, all 5 of the women whose entry times were certainly known entered before 2.30 (lable 3)
One woman was known to have entered either through gate "C" or after 2.30, and nothing was
known about the entrance of the other woman who died.
" The age distribution of those who were known only to have entered either through gate "C" or
   through a turnstile after 2.30 was the same as the age distribution of those known to have entered
   after 2.48; and quite different from that of those known to have entered before 2.48 (table 2).
   Furthermore, of the 7 victims known to have died in pen 4, three were known to have entered after
   2.48 (via gate "C") and the other four were assessed as having either entered through gate C or
   through a turnstile after 2.30. This evidence suggests that those victims who were known only to
   have entered via gate C or after 2.30 may form part of the group who entered after 2.48; and they
   have been combined with this group in the main analysis below to form a group of 48 victims
   termed "late entrants". The remainder are termed "early entrants" (34 victims), or "not known" (13
   victims).




 1 -Blood alcohol levels


   Over half (54%) of the 95 victims had no blood alcohol or negligible traces (<10m g/dl). Only 15
   (16%) had more than 80 m g/dl (the legal limit for drinking and driving). Blood alcohol was also
   associated with age and sex. Nearly three quarters (71%) of the victims under 20 years old had
   negligible blood alcohol, compared to under a half (42%) of those 20 or over (table 4). None of
   the women had any blood alcohol recorded (table 5).




 3,Time of entry and blood alcohol level


   Approximately one-third (35%) of the "early entrants" had non-negligible traces of blood alcohol
   (>10m g/dl), compared to nearly two-thirds (63%) of the "late entrants". The odds of having a
   non-negligible blood alcohol level for "late entrants" were 3*1 (95% Cl: 1 • 2, 7 • 6) times as great as
   the odds for "early entrants". Thus there is strong statistical evidence that "late entrants" were
   more likely to have non-negligible blood alcohol levels than "early entrants".


   This association could have arisen merely because the young victims and the women tended both to
   be early entrants and to have negligible blood alcohol levels.        However, after excluding both
   women and young men from the analysis, the association between alcohol and entry time persisted.
   For men over 18, 45% of "early entrants" had blood alcohols in excess of 10 mg/dl (and 15% in
   excess of 80mg/dl), whilst 71% of the "late entrants" had blood alcohol in excess of 10 m g/dl (and
   29% in excess of 80mg/dl) (table 7). Amongst men over 18 the odds of having a non-negligible
   blood alcohol level for "late entrants" were 3*0 (95% Cl: 1 • 0, 9 • 3) times as great as for "early
   entrants", exactly as before.
This analysis is complicated by the fact that there were 13 victims whose entrance to the ground is
unrecorded, and a further 22 who can be assessed only to have entered either through gate C
(after 2.48 pm.) or through a turnstile after 2.30. The latter group have been included with the
"late entrants" after 2.48 on the basis of the similarity of their age distribution and the disposition
of their places of death. This may be wrong. If, instead, the victims are split into two groups
according to whether or not they entered before or after 2.30 pm, then these 22 victims certainly
form part of the group of later entrants defined in this way.


The association between blood alcohol and entrance before or after 2.30 is shown in table 8, and,
again, there is some evidence that later entrants after 2.30 were more likely to have non-negligible
alcohol levels than earlier entrants before 2.30. The odds of having non-negligible alcohol levels
for these later entrants were 2 • 9 (95% Cl: 1 • 0, 8 • 6) times as great as those for earlier entrants
defined in this way.




Discussion


Whether the alcohol levels and times of entrance in these 95 victims bears any relation to those in
the general body of spectators is difficult to assess. However, if their alcohol levels were related
to their deaths, in the sense of having increased their chances of dying, then plainly the alcohol
levels might bear no relation to those in the rest of the spectators who entered at the same time. If,
on the other hand, the alcohol levels in these victims played no part at all in their deaths and were
not a factor in the chance that they died, then it is at least possible that the victims’ alcohol levels
reflect those that were generally prevalent amongst the spectators who entered at the same times
via the same routes.


Since these are generally small levels of alcohol, it is perhaps unlikely that the level of alcohol was
a contributing factor in the deaths of any individual spectator. That is to say, it is unlikely that the
reason why one spectator died rather than another can be explained to any extend at all by the
victim’s blood alcohol level. (However, this does not, of course, mean that alcohol may have
played no part in the deaths. It would still be possible to argue, for example, that the general level
of alcohol consumption amongst the spectators raised the general chance of there being some
victimsjwithout being relevant to the deaths of any individuals).


If it is the case that alcohol played no part in any individual deaths then it is possible that the
alcohol levels in the victims entering at different times is a representative sample of the alcohol
levels in the spectators as a whole entering at the same times. If this is the case, then there is some
statistical evidence that a greater proportion of spectators who entered late (at or after 2.48) or
latish (after 2.30pm) had been drinking before the game.

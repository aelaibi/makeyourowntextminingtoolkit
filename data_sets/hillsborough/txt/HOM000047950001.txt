    HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER

    Thank you for your letter of 18 July 1997. We will obviously co-operate fully in whatever
    way we can with your scrutiny.

    The CPS material in this case is held at CPS Central Casework, United House, Piccadilly,
    York. Mr George Croston is the lawyer involved.

    From the CPS perspective, there have been two distinct phases in this case. First, the CPS
    considered the report of the West Midlands Police and the report of Lord Justice Taylor in
    1989/90. Advice was taken from leading counsel, culminating in an announcement on 30
    August 1990 that there was insufficient evidence to justify criminal proceedings against
    anyone. Staff at Central Casework, York are in the process of compiling a schedule of
    material. We will let you have a copy of the schedule by 4 August 1997.

    Second, we considered further material sent by the Hillsborough Family Support Group in
    March 1997 and in addition, Mr Croston saw some material when he visited South Yorkshire
    Police earlier this year. The CPS view is that the material presented in March 1997 would
    not justify fresh criminal proceedings, a point which was made public by the Home Secretary
    in his announcement on 26 June 1997. A schedule of this material is also being prepared and
    we will let you have a copy by 4 August 1997.

    I hope that these schedules will assist you in your task.

    You mention access to the documents held by CPS. There is a substantial quantity of
    material held by York in relation to both the 1990 and 1997 decisions. You and/or your staff
    would be very welcome to inspect the material at York. Alternatively, if you prefer to
    inspect the material at CPS Headquarters in Ludgate Hill, I will ensure that the necessary
    arrangements are made.

I note that you maybe interviewing some witnesses. We would welcome the opportunity to
discuss the CPS decision making process and to assist you in identifying with precision the
material which we have inspected. Mr Croston would be the relevant member of staff to
help, and he can be contacted on 01904 456595.

I hope that this reply is helpful to you.

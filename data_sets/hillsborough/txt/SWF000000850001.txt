Dear Sirs,
Hillsborough
It seeros to us that there are a number of points which remain
outstanding in relation to this matter.
These could be clarified by a further directions hearing or by
agreement.
Firstly, there appeared to be general agreement at the last hearing
that it would be convenient to have some shorter form of title for
use in the contribution proceedings. We attach a suggested format
for consideration.
Secondly, we do not yet appear to have a direction which actually
fixes the starting date of the trial.
Thirdly, we do not have a direction which fixes the venue of the
trial.

There aay be other matters worthy of consideration* but perhaps you
could let us have your views on the foregoing*

Yours faithfully.

        fixed for the 1st October. We refer you to the transcript of
        the hearing, and also your draft order. We should add that we
        have not received a copy of the Sealed Order of the 20th
        December, and   would    ask you to forward thesame   assoon as
        possible.
        As for the venue of the trial, the action is listed for trial
        in Liverpool subject to the availability of either Mr Justice
        Steyn or Mr Justice Rose, although the parties may agree,
        subject to the approval of the court, upon transfer to another
        trial centre. The appropriate venue for obvious reasons must
        be Liverpool or Sheffield.
        We   suggest that all three parties enquire as to the
        availability of the trial Judges allocated to this litigation
        as that will be the determining factor with regard to the
        venue.
        Your?; faithfully

    YOUR REF




    Dear Mr Sullivan

    The Hillsborough Disaster: Third Party Proceedings in the Lead
    Actions of Chapman and Rimmer

    As you are aware, this firm are instructed to act on behalf of
    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club with regard to the civil
    proceedings   arising from the Hillsborough       disaster.   I
    understand from the Solicitors acting for ^south Yorkshire
    Police and Eastwood and Partners that they have -approached you
    with regard to the starting date of trial and the venue in
    respect of the claims by the Chief Constable of South
    Yorkshire Police for contribution against both Sheffield
    Wednesday Football Club and Eastwood and Partners.

  At the hearing before Mr Justice Steyn in Manchester on the
  20th December 1989, the settlement between the Chief Constable
  and the Steering Committee (representing the majority of
  claimants) was approved by his Lordship, whereby damages were
  to be paid to claimants albeit without any admission of
  liability, and subject to the resolution of certain categories
  of claims, mostly involving nervous shock claimants. That of
  course left the contribution proceedings within the two
  actions of Chapman and Rimmer, the Chief Constable having
t commenced Third Party Proceedings.

    Mr Justice Steyn provided for a trial date in October, the
    trial to be fixed for the beginning of the term in October.
    I have understood this to mean that the trial will commence on
    the 1st October, although Hammond Suddards, Solicitors for the
    Chief Constable have informed us that no specific date has
    been given by the court.

    I also understand from Reynolds Porter Chamberlain, Solicitors

                                                                                                                                                    Contd../..

        for Eastwood &   Partners, that they have sent you a copy of the
        Order of the      20th December, together with a copy of the
        transcript of    the hearing-   It is clear from the transcript
        that the trial   date is to be the first date of the term.

        There remains the issue as to the venue for the trial. The
        case has been reserved to Mr Justice Rose or Mr Justice Steyn,
        and   it is only appropriate that the venue for the trial
        should be such as to be convenient to the trial Judge. It may
        be the case that there is no available listing in Liverpool
        for the 1st October with a trial estimate of 4-5 weeks.
        It will be necessary to liaise with the clerk to the trial
        Judge before any decision can be reached as to the venue.
        However, I trust that the above is of some assistance in
        setting out our understanding of the position.
        I should be grateful if you would kindly telephone upon
        receipt of this letter so that we can discuss the matter
        further.

        Yours sincerely

Dear Sirs,
Hillsborough
Thank you for your letter of 19th April and we thank you also for
copying to us your letter of 20th April addressed to
There does appear to be considerable confusion as to the exact
meaning of the Order of 20th December, the more so as there does
not appear to be a copy on the Liverpool District Registry file
although, as you are aware, the original was sealed out of that
Registry.
As there are other matters on which directions are needed, it is
now our intention to issue a further Summons, which we hope can be
speedily heard.
We will serve a copy on you as soon as it is available.

Yours faithfully.

    Dear Sirs

    Hillsborough

    We thank you for your letter of the 27th April.

    Please provide us with a copy of the Order of the 20th
    December as soon as possible. It is clear from the transcript
    t&at the trial has been fixed for the first day of term in
    October, which is in fact the 2nd October. In our view, it is
    wholly unnecessary to     issue a Summons for the purposes of
    clarifying the trial date.

    However, we understand there is to be an application for
    change of venue.     Mr Sullivan informs us that special
    arrangements will needto be made with the    Circuit Office to
    ensure that either Mr     Justice Rose or Mr Justice Steyn is
    available to hear the trial       in October, but he has no
    intention of making those arrangements until the venue for the
    trial has been clearly, confirmed. Accordingly, if it is your
    intention to issue a Summons to transfer the action to another
    District Registry or trial venue, we would ask you to provide
    us with the Summons together with any Affidavit in support.

                            ithfully

Dear Sirs,
Hillsborough
Thank you for your letter of 3th May.

We enclose a copy of the Order of 20th December, although we are
quite sure you already have this. The relevant paragraph is number
11 and you will see that there is a clear reference to "a date to
be fixed*.                     &
Be that as it may, there are a large number of other matters which
require to be dealt with by the Judge, in respect of which we
enclose a Summons for further directions, which you will see is
returnable at Manchester on Wednesday, 23rd May at 10.30 a.m.
It will be helpful if you can indicate, as soon as possible, the
extent to which you are in agreement with the various suggested
directions.

Yours faithfully^

 Dear Sirs,

 Hillsborough

Thank you for your letter of 9th May acknowledging receipt of the
List of Issues. Leave for service of this List was given by Mr.
Justice Steyn on 6th March, 1990. The position is somewhat confused
because we drew up and served an Order following that hearing, in
accordance with normal Queen's Bench practice, but the Court then
drew up and served its own Order, presumably^following practice in
the Commercial Court in which Mr. Justice Steyn normally sits. The
relevant direction is at paragraph 7 (3) of the Order drawn by
ourselves and at 4 (iii) of the Order drawn by the Court.

We have been concerned to hear from the Solicitors to Messrs.
Eastwood & Partners that your clients have some proposals to effect
alterations of the Leppings Lane terraces.

May we please have an undertaking by return of fax that no works
whatsoever will be carried out until the experts have carried out
their testing programme.

Our expert has been pressing for some progress to be made with
these tests and we shall expect to be able to report to the Judge
at the resumed directions hearing on 23rd May either that the t^sts
have been carried out or that clear arrangements, including dates


                                                                                                                                                                 /                contd.

            Dear Sirs
            Hi11s borough

            We thank: you for your letters of IGth May and 18 th May
            together with the enclosures and in particular acknowledge
            safe receipt of the Summons for Directions returnable on 23rd
            May at 10 am. We axe; aware of the problems concerning the
          | availability of Counsel and it is our hope that the directions
          | can be substantially agreed.

          j We have the following comments, to maJce upon the Summons and in
          I the same order:-

            1.             We agree this direction subject to the amendment that
                           the findings Be findings of fact and those findings
                           shall be admitted as findings of fact;
            2   .          Agreed, Save iha-t
                                          that provision should be made for the
                           Chief Constable to consolidate the marked copies from
                           the parties and to be served upon the other parties
                           within 7 days?

*           3.
            3.1            Xt is our conpera that the transcripts of evidence
                           given to the Taylor Inquiry and at the preliminary
I                          inquest hearings will contain      a great deal     of
                           information which is irrelevant to the issues in this
                           litigation.   However, given the time available, it
I                          will not prove! possible to reach some agreement with
                           regard to the selection of the transcript evidence and
                           for that reason we are prepared to agree          this
                           direction. However, we have the further amendment to
I

            make that the transcript evidence as such-will include
            any statements incorporated in that evidence, as those
            sta.tenie.nts were accepted at the Public Inquiry and at
            the Incraests as evidence in chiefj

3.2         Agreed;

3.3         Agreed;

3.4         This is agrjeed subject to the proviso that any
            statements in your possession which have not been
            served in compliance with 3-3 relating to a person who
            has declined J to provide a statement on the grounds
            that he is subject to the possibility of criminal
            charges will Ibe disclosed.
                           i
3.5         Agreed, save that each party will serve on the ether a
            list of witnesses indicating whether they are to be
            called and/orj whether the transcript evidence will be
            relied upon; j
                           i
            This is agreed save that any party requiring a witness
            to attend fo x cross examination shall give notice
            accordingly to the other parties to the litigation and
            this shall aoply in respect of any name included in
            the list to be served pursuant to 3.5;
4.         The List of Issues was served under cover of your
           letter ■of 4th May which we received on 8th May. The
           List hasnot been served in strict compliance with the
           direction given on 6th March and of course we have 35
           days in which to respond. We are prepared to agree
           this direction subject to the fwwn>AT)f;s or replies
           being served on or before the 15th July 1990?
5.         Agreed, save ■chat experts* reports be exchanged before
           the 15th Angus t 1990;
6-         Our views on! this matter are to a large extent
           irrelevant. Tne Court has already given indication
           that the trial will be in Liverpool or Manchester to
           which we have ho objection.
                         i
7.         The Order of 20th December provides for the trial to
           commence at the beginning of the Michaelmas term on a
           date to be fixed. The transcript evidence clearly
           shows that Mr jJustice Steyn meant the first working
           day of term and that is the direction we will be
           seexica.      1
3.         Agreed.

                      Agreed# save fox the amendment: that the title should,
                      read:—
                      "In the matter of the disaster at Hillsborough Stadium
                      on 15th April 1989 and in the matter of Third Party
                      Proceedings In Chapman and Rimmer".
     10.              We consider that a date for the next pre-trial review
                      should he fixed at the hearing for further directions.
                      This is a sensible course of action to ensure the
                      availability of Counsel to attend on any further
                      application- The time estimate is agreed.

     Accordingly, we would |ask you to provide your comments upon
     the above so that we can reach agreement or at least narrow
     down those areas where J there is disagreement. Given our views
     we will also require your comments to enable us to agree on
     whether it is approprijate for the hearing to be adjourned to
     the 24th May with a time estimate of 1 hour.

    YOUR REF                  BN/HILLSBOROUGH


        Dear Sirs

        Hillsborough

        We refer to your concern raised in your letter of the 14th May
        over the proposed alterations to the Leppings Lane terraces.

        It was the intention of the Club to provide seating to the
        terraces in compliance with the recommendations made by Lord
        Justice   Taylor  in his final report.      As   a result of
        relegation, the Club decided to postpone those works, ,and
        there is no possibility of those works being undertaken before
        next years close season. However, the Club now wish to remove
        the barriers and fencing to that terrace immediately before
        the start of the forthcoming season.

       The Club agree to the removal of a further barrier from the
       ground for testing in accordance with the agreement reached
       between the experts at their meeting on the 5th April. By the
       end of July/the beginning of August, the experts in the
       litigation will have completed their enquiries for the
       purposes of preparing a report, and therefore from that point
       of view, there is no need for the Leppings Lane terrace to
       remain in its present state as the parties will not be
       prejudiced by such works being undertaken.

      Our comments are also subject to no objection being made by Mr
      Sharpe, responsible for the West Midlands Police investigation
      team.   At this stage, our intention is simply to make you
      aware of the Club's proposals and to say quite clearly that
      the whole matter should be reviewed once again at the end of
      July when we have a much clearer picture of any potential
      problems that may be caused by these intended works.

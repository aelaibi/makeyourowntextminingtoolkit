                 public house in Sheffield and/Xhere was about, 40 fans in the pub both

                 Nottingham Forest and Liverpool.

                 On the way to the g rewind I saw quite a few policemen,          one was giving

                 verbal directions to the different ends of the ground.              I also saw

                 several   people who appeared merry through drink but there was no

                 fighting or disorder.

                 I arrived at the entrance to the group^'at about 2.45 pm ( 1445J r f sT*^

                 I saw one mounted policeman and two other          policemen outside the
 fb u c t^       turnstiles,   they were trying to organise people but there were too

                 many people there to have any effect.          I did not see any stewards

                 outside the turnstiles.

                 I did not have any difficulty finding my entry point but obviously I

                     difficulty enterTnrKj^the ground because of the rubbers of people
                                                   ^
             J   trying to get in.   At ab           pm (1455 i     saw a blue metal

                 concertina gate at the f                of the J m r n s t i 1es being opened, a

                 mounted policeman assisted in the ajrening of the gate.             T here was a
      K ®
                 surge through this gate and I jrfSTs carried into the ground.            I did not

                 have to hand my ticket/in, u have since destroyed it.  I saw about
                 C ATT  UMAtJTTH-     ____ ,
                 lads climbing the walls into/ the ground. Once through the gate myself

                 and       went to the t d i A e t . When we came out we walked into the
                                     i& S T C 5 t ^ W D
                 tunnel under the West stand, at this time it was quite orderly.       About

                 half way down the tunnel      I was aware that t ^ T players had just come
Ob4 Pitch
                 onto the pitch.     Suddenly7 the re was a syrge from behind and I was

                 carried forward into pen four.         I hcun? ind i cate d on a se par ate sheet

                 where my first match viewing position was and where I was when the

                 crush was at its worst

                 There was no police or steward control at the tunnel.              I did not see

                 any fighting,    drunkness cup disorder     in the ground.     I did not see

                 anyone drinking alcohoLr in the ground.

         From the time I entered the terrace the pressure from people behind

         grew and I could not move my arms or indeed move in any direction.

         The pressure became so uncomfortable           I started sweating heavily and

         feeling unwell.        Only a couple of mi nutes^tfScT) passed and I could feel

         rnyself going u nc on sci ous .   The last W u n g   I remember was looking at

         f,he ground clock a nd saw it was J3C06 pm < 1506 h r s ) .     I remember my

         friend             holding onto m a f tel 1 ing me not to fall to the floor.

         The crowd was so tight yK was impossible to fa l 1 to the ground.               It

         was then that I w ent /un co nsc iou s.      I later remember waking up on the

         pitch and lookij^g at the clock,        it was 3.26 pm < 1526 h r s ) then.     The re

         was a polic§^ffan looking at me.       He hit me in the face to bring me

         round.      I did not go to hospital       in Sheffield.   I was more concerned

         that my relatives would have seen me on the television and would be

         worried.



         I left the ground at about 5 pm (1700 hrs) following a loud speaker

         a n no un ce me nt .

         After the match was stopped I feel that the police,            fans and everyone

         else who were there were trying to do their best.

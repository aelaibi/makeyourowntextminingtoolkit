Within       minutes           of       that       incident              I became           aware        of    people          being

On    reaching         the       entrance               tothe            tunnel        I saw        several           people       ly ing at

the     entrance          apparently                injured              with       many     others           in a t t e n d a n c e

attempting           to      revive           and       transport              the     injured           to    nearby ambulances.

On    seeing        t hi s     I then             looked        into          the     tunnel        and       saw    further           people

apparently           injured,                being       carried              from     the     tunnel          and       again     to    the

ambulances           in a t t e n d a n c e             at    the        scene.            I was       then        i n f o r m e d -of the

crush        situation           in      the       terrace           area        by    several           people          whereupon           I

immediately            ran       into         the       terraced              area     my     p at h     to    the       scene     b e in g

blocked        for     a short               time       by    people           at     the     rear       of    the       terrace.

After        eventually             pushing             my w a y         to    the     front        area       of     the      terrace           I

18 yrs,        blond         hair        of       medium        build          wearing         a maroon             coloured           crew

neck     jumper        and       l i ght          coloured           trousers,               I approached                 PC A u c k l a n d

t ask    o f reviving               the       youth.            Eventually                 I wa s      informed           that -the

youths        pulse       had       returned             and        he    wa s      transferred               by    others       onto        the

pitch        itself       to     the         awaiting          ambulance               crews..

I    then     began       to a s s i s t           other        officers              in    removing           approximately

           After       clearing          the       area    of    these        bodies          I then        remained                 in the          ;

           After      a short           time       1 left       the     terrace          via      the; g a t e            in the         perimeter

           Whilst       remaining             in    that       location        I eventually                 met           PS    4 6 6 'Whit lam a n d

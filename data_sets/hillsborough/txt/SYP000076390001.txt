We     all       left        the       pub    ajr a b o u t        twenty          past      one,        having           had     a    substantial

meal.         I had         dran^/T           pint       of    lager          and      a    glass        of     wine.        We       then       drove

to     the       ground.           1 know          the    directions                to      the    ground            as    I had           visited

the      stadium            on     previous          occasions.

we     travelled              along          the    Sheffield                ring           road       a r r i v i n g at               H a r r i e s Rd.        I

         ed      the       car     in H a r r i e s       Dv       at    about              2.13pm         < 1 4 1 5 ) to             2 . 2 0 pm ( 1 4 2 0 ).

    e then        walked           to    the       ground.          As       I walked            along        the         road        I saw man y

suppo rters                u r i n at i ng     1 n the         street. I                   remember           p a s s i ng              a    l a r g e p u b 1 ic

house         and      seeing           hundred          of    fans          crowding            the     pub,        I thought              to    myself

then        that       they        wera^leaving                things          a    bit      late.

We     walked          to     the/ground,                arriving             at    the      S    Stand         entrance              at    about

1440        (1440).           I Xiould         add       that       I saw          several         incidents               of         drunkeness

on     my     watf"to/the               ground.          I also          saw       many      people           who     I knew           to    be

Liverpudlians                     by    their       accent          and       dress         trying         to    purchase              t i c k e t s . It

was     evident,               that          there          were       many          supporters          there          without             tickets.

I entered                 the       ground             via        the row         of   turnstiles             numbered                23     to       28,       I

drew        up       in       front          of    tfye W         S t / a nd . I c a n           recall       the       following                 events            but

I saw           fans          swinging             on       the     netting            and       the    posts          of       the    goal          at     the      W

end.

I saw           a    youth          who       I would             describe             as    white       male,          22       to    25,       5'7,        long

scruffy              hair,          he       had       a    blue       t       shirt    and       a    brown       waistcoat                on.       He     ran

 o      our          end       and       was       signalling                   the    V with          both       hands.          He       had        run    the

length              of    the        pitch         from          the       W    end.    He       was    soon       led          away       by    the

Police              down       the       players             tunnel.             I got       the       impression                that       this          youth

was     trying                to    start          a       riot.

Some        5       minutes             later          this       was          repeated          by    another          man,          in    his       fifties

who     appeared                   to    be                                                                                                     He    too       was

led     away             by    the       Police.

Sitting          near          to       me    was       B o b b ^ ROBjftfN, t h e                England             Manager              and          I    recall

a    youth       with          a        scouse         accent           g'ijirtng h i m        some         verbal                  abuse,              he     h a d come

from       the    pitch                 and     was         standing           at    the       front           of    the            V I P ’s b o x . H e t o o

was    arrested                and        led      away.

It    still       wasn't                apparent             to    me     that        people              had       died.       On refl ec tion                       one

of    the    ironys                is     that         Bobby       R O BS O N was          still           signing             autographs                    at

this       time.

At    about       this             time       a    supporter              walked          along           the       row       of     seats             where          we

sat    and       I stopped                   him       and    asked        him       where           he    was       going.              He    said          he       was

looking          for       a       phone.          I asked          him        where        he       was       seated          and        did          he    have          a

ticket.          He    maintained                      he    was    looking           for        a    phone.             I would              put          this

youth       at    under                 18 a n d       add    that        he        smelt      strongly                  of         drink,              not s c o t c h

or    any    spirits                    but     beer.        He    looked            intoxicated                    to    me.       A l t h o u g h he

wasn't       staggering                      but       he    couldn't           have       walked              a    straight              line.

It    was    still             not        obvious            to    me     the e n o r m i t y         of        what          was     going             on,.      The

youth       I described                      above          was    really getting                    on     my       nerves           now,          I

physically             got          hold          of    him       and     handed          him        to    a       Steward.              I believe                   the

Steward          handed             him       to       Police       Officers^It                      was       obvious              to    me       that           this

youth       had       come          into          the       ground        without          a     ticket,             had        filtered                   out       of

the    standing                area          and       was    t r y i n g r to       avoid           the       Police,              by    finding                a    way-

out    of    the       stand.                                       ,                                 ,

later       Kenny          DALGLISH                made       an    a^/ourtceinent                   on    the       PA       to     the       effect                of

to    me    that       confusion                   reigned.

We    still       hadn't                been       told       what       was        happening.                                 f\

           e m e r g e n c y Tservices. We                                did    so    and    saw       the          horrors          that       have          been       shown

           She        was          ashen-faced                   and       looked       extremely                distressed,

           I said,                 "How          bad       was       it?"       She    said,       "There's                been       several             deaths."

           This        was          the          first          I. n e w    of    any       fatalities.

           We        made          our          way       up    Herries          Rd    back       to    the          car    and       went       back          to    pick

          J t   he    other             3       up.       We    did       this    and       then       got       stuck          in a       bit       of    a    traffic

      ^     jam.       There                was       a    brand          new    medium       blue          Transit             van,       two       cars       in       front,

           it        was       a    hired             vehicle             from    Merseyside,                the       occupants                of    this          van,

           Nottingham                       Forest             supporters             who    were       in       a    Mini       bus       travelling                in    the

           opposite                 direction.                   They       were       trying          to    get       in       the    van.          I remember              a

           Policeman                    with          a    bushy          beard,       40    to    50       yrs,       s o r t i ng        this       out       si n g l e

           handed.                 He       got       all       the       supporters          back          in       the    Liverpool                van       and       they

to)        drove           off.

           we        followed                   the       van    along          the    road       and       near       the       traffic             lights          at

           Broughton                    Ln       several             of    the    occupants             got          out    and       started             kicking          at    a

           yellow              Austin             Mini          and       were    trying          to    turn          it    on    its       side.          There

           were        2       occupants                   in    the       car.       The    lights          changed             and       we    moved          off.

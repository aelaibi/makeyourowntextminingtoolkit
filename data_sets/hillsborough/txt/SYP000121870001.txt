along P en is t o n e       R o a d near       to the turnstiles,                 as    I did so        I saw a man

who    I know to be the d e fendant                                  stood       in a queue        of    people

was    u n s teady on his feet.                  As    he    pre s e n t e d his ticket           for    collection

at    the t u rnstile         I a pp ro a c h e d      him and the          following          c o n v e r s a t i o n took

PC BROUGHAMs                       "How m uch have you had to d r i n k ? ”

                                    " I ’ve    had     quite       a bit    t h a n k s , but     I ’m a 1 r i g b t . 1'

As    I spoke      to                      noticed that he was                  unsteady on his            feet,     his

eyes were        g l a z e d , his        speech was         slurred.           He was     in fact       drunk.

PC B R O U G H A M :               "I am a r r e s t i n g you            for   trying     to get into the

            I                      "Oh no,        I've had a nightmare,                   I d o n ’t believe          it."

that a large number                 of Liverpool            supporters           had climbed         over     the

perimeter        fencing        of that enclosure.                   A line of officers                 had formed

across     the     pitch some             10 yards      from the goal             in order        to h o l d the

Liverpoo l       supporters          to that          end of the          ground.        My    iinprerjsfoon wa|\

that    this was a crowd               control,        public      order      situation.                 The

a t m o s p h e r e w i t h i n the    stad i u m at that          time was         volatile.

As    I looked towards             the L e p pings Lane            end of the ground                     I saw a

number       of youths         stood       on the    perimeter        fencing       of the L e p pings Lane

end some       13 yards          to the      right     of the      goal    as     I looked at              it.I made

m y way to the yo u t h s             and    climbed onto          the    fencing.          As       I    looked at

the    crowd at       that       point      I saw that a l t h o u g h the terrace was                         packed

with    people       it looked to be nothing more                      than that          people          did not

appear       to be    in danger.             At my     request      the two youths              on the          fencing

got down,        d r o pping      back      into    the    crowd on the terrace                 side.           I got

d own off      the    fencing at            that    point     to see a number             of youths who              had

climbed over          the      fencing       stagg e r i n g around.           I approached               one    of the

youths       and spoke         to him.        It was       obvious     he was       injured          in some w a y ,

I formed the          impre s s i o n       that he was winded,              and    1 therefore                sat him

down against          b il l b o a r d s    near to the goal           in order          that    he       could get

h i s b r e a t h foa c k „

At    that    stage     I turned           r ound to see       that    the    co rdon of of f i ce r s had

held    its    p o s ition and a large empty space                       created on the                  pitch behind

the officers.            I then saw the accused]________                          run    past the officers

and    into the       penalty a r e a         in front        of the Kop.           1 saw that             the

a t t e n t i o n of m a n y     in the stadium was              drawn to this y o u t h as                    he waved

his arms at o p p o s i n g           spectators          w i t h i n the Kop who were               o b viously

becoming       e xc i t e d by his actions.                  I then focussed my a t t e n t i o n on

              standing         just    behind the          cordon of officers.                  As       I did so

              turned and          ran towards          the    corner     of the L e p p i n g s Lane and

the Old Stand.              As    he did so         I saw PC W e l c h       (EE)       approach

He ther efore         turned and            ran in my d i r e c t i o n and I was able                     to knock

him to the floor.                 I was a s s is t e d       in detaining          the y outh            by PC

                was    taken    to the Police R o o m where                 he was documented.

gymnasium.             Two young       children,        a ged a p p r o x i m a t e l y 9 years         of age,

a p p e ar ed    to be f o llowing         the body scr e a m i n g          ’Mummy,         Mummy".        The   body

of    the w om a n was         put onto       the floor,          o b v i o u s l y dead,,     T o g e t h e r with

someone         else    1 approached          the two      children         shepherding         them away         from

the body,,            We were     then joined          by a female          police     officer        who    took

the    two      children away.

A fter a few m om e n t s            I saw a man        in the       gym who was        going wild,           trying

to get       near to a body shouting                   ’I t ’s my brother,           help h i m ’ .         Quite

ofavi o u s 1y all       bod i e s 1ai d i n t he gym a r ea were                 dead.        To ge t her with

another         officer       I a pp ro a c h e d the man.          We    physically         had to       restrain

the ma n and           pull    him out     of the gymnasium.                 On getting         out     of the gym

I do not know where                  the man went.          As     I looked ar o u n d         I saiflearns hf

officers and s p e c t at or s             carrying        bodies and badly              injured towards           the;

g y m n a s i u m area.       I saw the          s it u a t i o n was     so desperate and so many

bodies were          being      brought         out that about           six bodies         had been       laid

outside        the g y m n as iu m on the floor.

A y o u th who       1 do not         know      called me         over to the       bodies,       pointing        to

one y ou th saying,             ’Look       at him,        I don't know           if h e ’s dead.        I d o n ’t

think     he    is*.       I looked         at the body and w o u l d describe                   it as

fo ll ow s; - White,          male,      a g ed approxirnately 20 years,                    ginger    hair       cut,

into a m o de rn style above                    the hair         line at the back.            I looked at the

foody and saw that              he had s to p p e d            breathing.        I was    of the opinion

that     he was      dead,      however         together w ith DC W a l s h a w           X t hen    performed

the     kiss    of    life.       After      doing      this      1 a ga i n   checked the        body and

believe        I felt a pulse.               I then       remained wit h the body w h i c h seemed

to go     into some         sort of         spasm.        After a        time,     I have   no    idea how

long,     a doctor         ran over         and    looked at          the y outh saying,          ’He's        doing

alright,        h e ’s h y p e r - v e n t i l a t i n g ’ .     B y this time a m b u l a n c e s       had

a rr iv ed at        the scene and were                being      loaded wit h       injured      people.

T o ge th er w ith others             I carried         the y o u t h     to the front        of the       queue of

injured and he was                taken away by ambulance,,

Fro m    this      stage    on my       recol l e c t i o n s     are    vague,    I remember        there

seemed       to be     people        every w h e r e and         X was aware       that     by that       time a

number       of doctors         and medical            staff      had a r r i v e d at the scene.

My other mai n           r e c o l le ct io n    is that         together with a Cl I) Sergeant

(working        in uniform)           we a t t e m p te d to organise             seating     for    relatives

outside        the gymnasium,,             The    next     thing        I clearly     remember       is being

seated, in the N or th Stand,                    together w ith           large    numbers       of other

at Asda,          we went       to the      car and        put on the         radio,      we heard that        there

had been          "crowd t r o u b l e ’ at H il lsborough.

we hear d that             there     had been a number               of deaths at Sheffield.

I tried to           contact       the     eme rg en cy number          but    found       it constantly

engaged.

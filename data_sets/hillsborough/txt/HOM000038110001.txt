        MR. COLLINS:      Chief Superintendent Duckinfield, please.

                 DAVID GODFREY DUCKINFIELD Called

                       Examined
                       ---- 5------bv1-------------
                                       MR. COLLINS:

Q. Mr. Duckinf i e l d , you are David Godfrey Duckinfield.      Is that
   right? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. And you are Chief Superintendent in charge of F Division? - A.
   Yes, sir.

0. May I ask you a little bit about your Police history, please,
   first? When did you first join the Police? - A. I joined the
   Police as a Cadet in 1960.

Q. And which Force was that? - a . It was in the Sheffield City
   Police at that time, and then I remained a Cadet for three
   years and became a Constable in the Force in 1963.

Q. And obviously you were promoted from time to time, but give us
   just a brief outline of your career in the Police until you
   took over on 27th March this year your present post? - A. Yes.
   I started as a u n i f o r m e d ‘Constable at Hammerton Road Police
   station, which was the Division that I am now in. I served
   there as a uniformed Constable, working beat patrol, for a
   period of two y e a r s . Then I left there and went into the CID
   as an aide, and six months later I was posted as a Detective
   Constable.

        I remained in the CID in Sheffield City Police Force as
   it was then, and was promoted Detective Sergeant shortly
   afterwards, after six years, and then eventually spent time on
   the Regional Crime Squad and was promoted a uniform Inspector
   in 1974.

Q: Where was that? - A. At a Division to the south of the city,
   Hackenthorpe Division, and at that time I gained experience of
   football matches at Bramall Lane when Sheffield United were at
   that time in the First Division attracting large c r ow d s .

Q. What was then the capacity of Sheffield United ground,
   roughly? - A. To be honest it is difficult to suggest, but I
   think about that time possibly 50,000, but there have been
   changes since that time.

         I remained as a uniform Inspector in that area for a
   year.   Following that. I was transferred to the Headquarters
   Community Liaison Department and served there for a period as
   Inspector, and latterly as Chief Inspector until 1979 when I
   was transferred from the Headquarters Community Liaison
   Department as uniform patrol Chief Inspector at the
   Ecclesfield sub-Division.     I remained there for a year, and
   then shortly afterwards I was transferred to the No. 1 sub-
   Division working from Hammerton Road Police station.     At that
   particular location I policed the Sheffield Wednesday football

                                                   D.G. DUCKINFIELD


      ground for a period of 12 months.

    Q. Your rank at this stage being? - A. Chief Inspector.   In that
       period I think if I am correct which was between September
       1979 and June 1980, I had experience of policing a Semi-Final
       tie between Liverpool and Arsenal, and also the major tie
       between Sheffield Wednesday and Sheffield United on Boxing
B     Day.   On both of those occasions they attracted capacity
       crowds.

    Q. Which was your area of responsibility within the grounds? We
       know Chief Inspectors have the responsibility of a number of
       serials? - A . At that time the organisation was a little
       different, and to be quite specific I cannot other than to say
       I was on the perimeter track occupying a position very similar
       to the Sergeant who now occupies that position where the
       players run out.

    0. Near the players' tunnel? - A. That is right.      I had that
       responsibility.      I remained there until June 1980.  In June
       1980 I was transferred again as a Chief Inspector to the
       Attercliffe sub-Division which deals with the industrial part
^     of the city, and at that time did not have a particular
D     involvement with football matches or public order.        I
       remained there for a period until 1985, when at that time
       after prom ot i on , I moved to West Bar Police station as a
       uniform Superintendent and Deputy Divisional Commander.

            From the transfer to Attercliffe to West Bar then my
       policing role changed considerably.  As you can imagine in the
       city centre I was regularly involved with the policing of
       marches, demonstrations, on a regular basis, and also
       responsible for the policing of Sheffield United football
       ground.  During the initial period I policed the ground on a
       regular basis and took a regular interest in the game and also
       the policing of the ground.

    Q. When you say responsible for policing, were you the person who
       drew up the operational plan? - A. No.   The structure is such
       that the sub-Divisional Commander, that is the Superintendent
       of the Central Division would with his planning team draw up
       that plan, and as Deputy Divisional Commander would monitor
       that situation and assist and supervise in the absence of that
       Officer.   The Officer at that particular time was
       Superintendent Marshall, who is now my Deputy Divisional
       Commander.   So he and I worked together for a considerable
       period quite closely on public order matters.

    Q. That was from 1985 until....? - A. Until I was promoted
       recently.  I may have got that particular date wrong, but
       certainly for a period of three years with Mr. Marshall.

    Q. So about three or four years before your promotion? - a. yes.

    Q. We know you went into post on 27th March, was it, this year? -
       A. Yes, sir.
                                                                                D.G. DUCKINFIELD


                           Q. From what you told us, although you had had experience of
                              policing football matches and as a Chief Inspector had had
                              experience at Hillsborough and perhaps as a Constable? -
                              A. Yes, sir.

                           Q. You had not had experience of planning an overall
                              responsibility for a *big tife such as this? - A. In terms of a
                       B      Semi-Final tie, you are quite correct, but I should make the
                              point that during my period at West Bar I had an involvement
                              not so much in the detailed planning but certainly supervision
                              of the Billy Graham concerts that were held at Bramall lane
                              football ground, where there was a capacity crowd, and only
                              last year during the summer Bruce Springsteen, an American pop
                              artist, came to Bramall Lane football ground for a weekend,
                              and he held two concerts on a Saturday and Sunday evening, and
                              there was an expected attendance of 48,000 people on each of
                              those days.  It would be wrong to say I know that 43,000
                              attended, but almost that number attended.    So I have
                              experience at first hand only last year of policing a Bruce
                              Springsteen concert and a large number of people attended.

                           Q. But your last direct contact with Hillsborough, if I have
                              correctly followed what you told us, was some 10 years ago? -
                       D      A. In terms of a Police Commander, yes, sir.

                           Q.    In terms of any sort of policing?     - A. Yes, it was.

                           Q.    So you were in need, were you not,of reconsidering  orlooking
                                 again at Hillsborough stadium itself? - A. There was,
                                 understandably, with a promotion only a short period before
                                 the event, I may not be so well acquainted with the finer
                                 detail as possibly Mr. Mole, but the point is I know the area
                                 and have policed the area before.

                           Q.    Yes, but things have changed since you had been there over  the
                                 last 10 years.  Most particularly in that period the radial
                                 pens had been erected, and that of course made a considerable
                                 difference? - A. Yes, sir.

                           Q.     When was it you were first    aware you were going to be landed
                                 with the policing of  this    game? - A.I would say, as Mr. Mole
                                 was, I think it would have    been the Saturday, or Sunday, the
                                 weekend where the fixtures    for the Sixth Round were decided.

                           Q.     20th March, I think, or thereabouts. Only about a week
                                 before. - A. I think the announcement was made on the Monday
                                 morning when the draw would be made.

                           Q. I c a n ’t immediately remember what date it was.

                                      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Monday, 20th March.

                                      THE WITNESS:   So I learned then.

                           q .        MR. COLLINS:   You learned then, and you realised
                                 immediately this was going to land on your plate very shortly
                                 after you had taken over? - A. Yes, sir.

      Q. We have heard you had a meeting with Mr. Mole and the other
         Officers who were going to be concerned with the planning on
         the 22nd, the Wednesday? - A. Yes, sir.

      Q. You were given, I imagine, the operational order, or the draft
         operational order as-I suppose it then was? - A. I attended
B        the meeting on that particular day prior to my promotion, and
         Mr. Mole had called a meeting with all interested parties, and
         because of the success of the previous operations and his
         knowledge then matters were discussed and agreed on the past
         format that had been successful.

      Q. So you as it were were given the operational order,
         appreciated that it had been successful, and saw no reason to
         assume it would not be equally successful this year? - A. I
         did not accept it in total just like that.   I sat in at the
         meeting.  The provisional arrangements were made, and I think
         if you look to the following Wednesday from my statement then
         I held a meeting with Superintendent Murray....

      Q. That is on the 29th   March? - A. Yes, Chief Inspector Beale and
         Inspector Sewell in   my office.    I went through the operation
D        order page by page,    looking at the situation, examining it and
         speaking with them,    asking for their advice and guidance,
         bearing in mind the   arrangements Mr. Mole had suggested.    I
         was in no way being   critical but just examining for myself.

      Q. Of course. - A. And having been satisfied with the
         arrangements and the advice I accepted that we should
         proceed on those l i n e s .

      Q. Had you been to the-ground for yourself by then? - A. No. sir,
         I think by then I policed the ground on possibly the following
         Saturday.

      Q. Was the meeting on 29th, was it at that meeting effectively
         this plan was given the go ahead? - A. Yes, sir.

      Q. Presumably it had to be agreed on some time in advance? - A.
         very much so.  If you think in terms of timescale, we were
         talking in terms of I think 2 -and-a-half weeks.

      Q. Indeed.  Easter was before that.  This was already after
         Easter.  So effectively you had a fortnight after 29th March,
         or 16 days, to go, and therefore clearly agreement had to be
         reached by 29th March? - A. I should make the point, I don't
         think agreement was reached in haste.

      O. No, no, I am not suggesting it was.  I am agreeing with you,
         really, it was necessary, because apart from anything else you
         had to get the manpower together? - A. Very much so, yes.

      Q. And until you knew what the plan was you would not know what
]rj      the manpower was going to be? - A. Yes.

      Q. All I am asking you is whether it might not have been sensible
                              il 1

                                                   D.G. DUCKINFIELD


      for you to have gone to look at the ground to see whether you
      could identify for yourself any possible problem areas before
      you committed yourself to the final decision about the plan,
      the operation order? - A. I take your point, sir, but I was
      going to visit the ground very shortly afterwards.  There was
      still time to make adjustments and amendments, and bearing in
      mind we always retain the right to adjust, bearing in mind the
      information and intelligence you tend to receive.

Q. I follow that, but it is much better, is not it, to have a
   plan properly formulated rather than one that gets changed
   because of unforeseen circumstances? - A. I take your point,
   but I was being advised by Officers who had considerable
   experience and at that stage I relied upon that experience.

Q. Indeed, but yours was the ultimate responsibility, and was
   going to be the ultimate responsibility.  If anything went
   wrong it was your neck and not theirs? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. When you did go to the ground did you make an inspection of
   the ground to see whether you could identify any potential
   trouble spots? - A. Yes, sir, I walked around and examined the
   g r o u nd .

Q. You spotted, no doubt, tjie lack of directions within the
   turnstiles in Leppings Lane? - A. I cannot say categorically I
   looked from the turnstiles and saw the lack of signs.

Q. If you had looked from the turnstiles you could hardly have
   avoided appreciating the lack of signs, could you? - a.
   Bearing in mind that I know the location and I know the a r e a ,
   and I know there are signs there.

Q. Is this not something that you appreciated could give rise to
   possible problems? - A . At that time, sir, no.

Q.           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  When was it you walked round the
      ground? - A . On the Saturday following, sir.  That would
      b e ... .

q .        MR. COLLINS;  That would be about lst-2nd April, I think.
      - A. If that is the date of the Millwall match, that is
      correct.

Q. Did you take operational control at that match, or did you
   simply watch to see how it went? - A. Effectively I was the
   Divisional Commander and in overall command, but on that
   particular occasion I left the running of the match very much
   in charge of the Superintendent, and walked the area and
   familiarised myself with the situation.

Q.     For example, you presumably went to look at the turnstiles to
      see how people   were getting in, how the arrangements worked? •
      A. Yes, sir.

Q.    What about the pens?  Obviously you spotted the existence of
      the pens. Did  it occur to you then that there was a possible
                                                                               D.G. DUCKINFIELD


                                  problem if people came down that central tunnel into those
                                  pens, a possible problem of overcrowding? - A . I was aware of
                                  the restrictions, shall we say, but bearing in mind at the
                                  Millwall match the crowd was such or the visitors were
                                  such that it was not self-evident of the difficulties that
                                  might be experienced.
                                                          •    «
                           B   Q. By which you mean there was a relatively small number of
                                  supporters coming from Millwall? - A. Yes, sir.

                               Q. And presumably it was only necessary in those circumstances or
                                  perhaps only necessary to use may be a couple of those pens?
                                  I don't know. - A. I would say the central two pens. sir.

                               Q. Just the central two pens? - A. Yes.

                               Q. Effectively, then, a tiny crowd? - A. Yes. but I cannot be
                                  specific as to how many.

                               Q. No. obviously, but it would follow it was less than 2,200 if
                                  only those two central pens were used.  You knew you were in
                                  for a sell out, a capacity crowd at the Semi-Final? - A. Yes.

                           D   Q. Did you think at all of the possible effect of those radial
                                  barriers, those pens, on a capacity crowd? - A. No, I examined
                                  the situation, and I had* been aware previously of sway in
                                  football crowds and the need for penning people on occasions
                                  to prevent lateral movement, and also of allowing crowds when
                                  they are in small numbers of being able to run from one end to
                                  the other and meet up with opposing fans.

                               Q. Those are problems which were simply irrelevant in relation to
                                  the capacity crowd of one side supporters, were not they? - A.
                                  Yes, sir.

                               Q. What you had to apply your mind to was the possible problem
                                  that could arise, surely, of people cramming into the central
                                  pens, or indeed the outer pens for that matter, and not being
                                  able to spread laterally? - A. Yes, sir.

                               Q. Was that a problem which occurred to you as a possibility? -
                                  A. In discussions with other Officers who had more experience
                                  of the ground than I had, and from my own observations at that
                                  time, it did not look as though it would be a problem.

                               Q. You could see there was the central tunnel? - A. Yes.

                               Q. You knew that A-G turnstiles which gave on to the part of the
                                  concourse leading to that central tunnel were the turnstiles
                                  that were to be used for the terraces? - A. Yes.

                               Q. I assume you knew that? - A. Yes.   We are talking about the
                                  Semi-Final tie?

                           H   Q. Yes,   indeed.   - A. Yes.
                                                                         /Q. That being so,

                                  That being so, the likelihood was, was it not, that fans
                                  coming in through A-G would most naturally gravitate towards
                                  that central tunnel? - A. Provided they liked to watch the
                                  game from the rear of the goal, yes sir.

                             Q. But not only that, it was the only obvious way in to the
                                terracing because the-re was.no sign at all to the left,
                         B      indeed there was a wall with an opening in but no sign
                                whatever and to the right there was a sign but it was a
                                considerable distance away and frankly invisible unless
                                you really looked hard? - A.Yes, that is the situation.

                             Q. That is a fair description,    is it not? - A. Yes, that is
                                a fair description.

                             Q. Therefore surely anyone coming in would naturally, as I
                                     cravitate towards that central tunnel whether cr not
                                say, g
                                he wanted- to go directly behind the goal? - A. Yes, I
                                think that is a fair assessment.

                             0. That being so, was there not an obvious potential problem
                                of overcrowding in those central pens unless some steps
                        D|      were taken as part of the plan to ensure that people were
                                directed away from those central pens should they become
                                full? - A. I don't accent that sir.  I think the situation
                                is that people would enter the ground there and ordinarily
                                assess the situation.  This is my perception.  They would
                                assess the situation and if they chose to go into a position
                                behind the goal then they would go down the tunnel.  If
                                they went down the tunnel and it was an area that did net
                                suit them they had got two opportunities to either (a)
                                return from the direction they came or move to either side
                                along the back of the wall of the West Stand.

                             Q. Provided those gangways were kept clear at the back to
                                 enable them to get through to move from side to side and
                                 provided that there w e r e n ’t people coming down the tunnel
                                .behind them to maJce it difficult for them to turn round
                                 and go back? - A. Yes sir, you must bear in mind these
                                 people that are coming are football fans who are accustomed
                                 to football grounds and the peculiarities of football grounds.

                             Q.    Well did you not appreciate that the vast majority of those
                                  fans would be fans who were used to Anfield where they go
                                  through on to an area of terracing which has no penning
                                  and thus they can go down the middle and fan out all over
                                  the ....   A. Can I make the point sir?   Liverpool played
                                  at Hillsborough last year and had the same accommodation
                                  and as I understand it they had the same accommodation
                                  this year at a league match so it was not new to them.

                             Q.    That may be but you would expect them to remember in
                                  detail a year after? - A. Sir, I think that football fans
                                  I v/ould think are of such a nature that they know the
                    H
                                  ground sufficiently to know the spots where they want to
                                  go and these fans it is their third visit in twelve months.

    q   . We 11 some of them? - A.     I take your point.

    q   . 6,000 came in February we know? - A. Yes.

    Q. 5ut Chief Superintendent, are you saying that you have had
       no discussions at all because it simply did not occur to
       you that it would create a'problem about any plans to
B      ensure that there no overfilling of those central pens?
       - A. My understanding sir of the situation is that the
       crowd management control and the filling of pens is ^€>t.
       a Police responsibility.  The direction of fans and things
       of that order are the responsibility    the Club and riot
       the Police Service.

    Q. Well did you ask about that? - A. I did not need to ask,
       sir, I knew.

    Q. Well did you ensure that there was liaison with the Club
       so that there was some sort of control and direction
       Giving should that become necessary?-A. As far as I was
       concerned Superintendent Murray whe was the Ground
       Commander had liaised with the Club.   The Club ar.d our­
       selves accept our individual responsibilities and as far
D      as I am concerned it is clearly defined,   wy understanding
       is, as I have said earlier, crowd management, filling of
       pens.and monitoring of pens is a Club responsibility and
       not that of the Police Service.

    Q. That may be in theory but in practice the Police are very
       concerned if the situation arises which has the capacity
       to lead to disorder or the capacity to lead to injury or
       loss of life? - A. I take your point.

    Q. Nov/ ov erfilling of pens has that capacity,         does it not?
       - A.Yes.

    Q.    And therefore the Police must have an interest surely in
     "    -.ensuring  that pens such as this are not overfilled? - A.
         I am. not abrogating a responsibility for crowd safety
         or not looking after the care of persons and life etc.
         VJhat I am saying is that in general terms the general
         responsibility is with the Club.     Having said that, if
         it had been brought to my attention that there were
         difficulties where injury was likely to occur from over­
         filling and the Club were not monitoring the situation
         and doing their job, and the information came from- my
         Officers that   there was difficulty, I would have responded.

    Q.    I follow that, but what I am perhaps suggesting to you
          is you ought to have taken initiative because you ought
          as the Officer in overall control to have appreciated
          the potential problem? - A. I would appreciate the problem
          sir, I take your point, but the situation is that until
          a problem develops and it is a problem that is developing
H         and that those who are responsible for dealing with that
                               a



                                       D.G. DUCKINFIELD



   problem are not accepting that responsibility and dealing
   with it effectively, then I think that problem should be
   left with them. If it gets out of hand and there is a
   likelihood of injury then I will step in and do my job.

Q. That sounds like a recipe for disaster, Chief Superintendent,
   because what you are effectively saying is this, is it not,
   that you let them get on with it and only if the worst comes
   to the worst do you take any steps.  What I am suggesting
   is you should foresee areas of problems such as this and
   take or make contingency plans? - A. Can I take you back, sir?

Q. Yes. - A .   If I said that I apologise,   that was not ....

Q. No, I want to give you the opportunity to make absolutely
   clear what you are saying? - A. Taking it stage by stage
   the responsibility for crowd management and control and
   the filling of pens is the responsibility of the Club.
   If the filling of pens gets to a situation where they are
   overfilling and it becomes apparent to me that they are
   overfilling and difficulties are likely to occur, then I
   shall take some action.   Wow I have not got to the situation
   where there are major difficulties or a disaster likely to
   o c c u r.
                            *
Q. But surely it must be good policing and good practice to
   try and foresee situations which might lead to the need
   to take emergency steps so as to avoid them arising at all?
   - A. Yes, I can accept your point that we should have
   Police Officers in positions who can monitor the position.

Q. Did you take any steps to see if there were Police Officers
   as part of the plan who could monitor for example over­
   crowding in those pens? - A. Yes sir, if you examine
   Serial 1, the track serial, there are 20 Officers there who
   are spaced equi-distance around the track and there were
   Officers along the Leppings Lane side of the track behind
   that goal and looking towards G a t ® 1-6 Police Officers were
   in position there and they could monitor visually the filling
   of the pens.

Q. So you considered, did you, that Serial 1, looking at the
   Operational Order whi ch is Document 14 if you wish before
   vou, it is Tab 14 on the document that looks like this.
   Have you got it? - A. Yes sir.

Q. It is Serial 1, perimeter track.  That part of Serial 1
   because they are spread out, as I understand it, all round
   the perimeter? - A. Yes.

Q. That part of Serial 1 which is in front of the Leppings
   Lane terracing, it is part of their responsibility, is it,
   or you considered it was part of their responsibility, to
   monitor and report on the numbers in the pens and to check
   on the possibility of overcrowding? - A. It is a responsi­
   bility of theirs if the filling of the pens gets to the
                          Iz z



                                    D.G. DUCKINFIELD


  point of overcrowding and furthermore if you examine the
  brief for Serial 13, there are six Officers on Serial 13
  who have a responsibility for looking over the West Stand
  into the West Stand terrace and in doing so whilst it
  strictly speaking describes responsibilities ....

Q. It is at 'D', isn't it, of .Serial 13. "Six P.C.s will be
   located at the front of the stand to prevent missiles
   being thrown/stand tickets being dropped to the terraces
   below or persons climbing in from the terraces to the
   stand and to maintain order". - A. Whilst it does not
   specifically say it, I would expect that those Officers
   in looking over from the Stand into the terrace for the
   points raised there would also monitor any overcrowding
   and report that back.

Q. So are you telling us that it was your understanding of
   this Operation Order that the relevant Officers in Serial 1
   on the perimeter track and the six Officers at the front
   of the West Stand in Serial 13 were the Officers who would
   oversee, as it were, and report on the problems or any
   problems that might be created by overfilling of Pens 3
   and 4? - A. I don't want to leave those Officers with that
   sole responsibility bearing in mind I was in the Control
   Room at some stage which, overlooks that particular area
   and so were other Officers, so I would suggest that there
   was -jnore than those Of If ice rs having a view of that
   situation.

Q, I appreciate there were plenty of Officers having a view,
   but we are concerned or I am concerned at this stage
   of my questions with the advance planning and you are
   telling us that it was your understanding of the Operational
   Order, are you, that those Officers were the Officers who
   would have that responsibility? - A. Yes sir.

Q. There is nothing in that Operational Order that gives them
   that responsibility specifically, is there? - A. Ho sir,
   but if we are talking in terms of safety then if you refer
   to my briefing notes of the Friday morning and the Saturday
   morning, then I stress safety, crowd safety, evacuation
   procedures and it is clearly stated in there.

Q. In general terms, yes, but as far as you are aware was any
   briefing given to those Officers in Serials 1 or 13 that
   part of their responsibilities was to keep an eye on pens
   specifically to radio up or to concern themselves with
   potential overcrowding? - A. I personally did not but you
   would have to ask Superintendent Greenwood who was the
   Ground Commander because the basis of the briefings was
   that I gave the overall briefing on the Friday morning to
   Supervisory Officers and then delegated the responsibility
   for more specific briefings and a tour of specific areas
   of responsibility to the Sector Superintendents and on the
   Friday morning whilst I gave the briefing, the Sector
   Superintendents then took their Supervisory Officers around
   locations in and around the ground so that their Supervisors

                         could walk the terraces, could walk the escape routes, etc.
                         So I personally did not give a specific instruction but
                         I think that Superintendent Greenwood would be able to
                         answer that specific point.

                       Q. Did you discuss for example with Superintendent Greenwood
                          or whoever the responsible .Officer was, the question of
                          overcrowding in those pens? - A. No sir, I didn't, but
                          I think you will find that Superintendent Greenwood has
                          a view of that particular end of the ground because he
                          was there in 1931.

Q. It is a document headed "Pre-match Briefing".   I think it
   is dated the 17th April.   It is headed, "Pre-match Briefing
   FA Cup Semi-Final given 14.4.89" - it can't be the 17th.    I
   can't read the date, but anyway "Pre-match Briefing, FA Cup
   Semi-Final given 14^4.89.".   Is that right Mr. Duckinfield?
        A. I havs not got the copy that you've got.

Q.      I thin:< what I've got is your        ....-   A. Is it   a
        computerised print-out?

q   ..... final version put through a computer.  I think it was
      put through by West Midlands.   - A. There are minor
      inaccuracies on that one that don't differ greatly, but I
      have now the original.

Q.      I haven't I think    got the original of that.       The statement
        I have seen ....

             LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:         Have you got a copy of that Mr.
        Woodward?

             MR. WOODWARD:   Sir I'm not sure what it is. What has
        happened, the West Midlands have put into neater form the
        documents which may have been original.   Sir there may be
        confusion as to what the .witness is looking at.  If this
        can be identified sir ....

             LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   "Pre-match Briefing FA Cup
        Semi-Final Given 14th April '89".

             MR. WOODWARD:     Does it begin "Gentlemen the event
        today is the FA   ....

             MR. COLLINS:   No, the event tomorrow is the FA Cup
        Semi-Final since it was given on the day before.

             THE WITNESS:         May I explain sir to iron out the
        difficulties?

q   .        mr.    COLLINS:   I'll just ask you this:   the statement
        I've got    is not on the face of it a statement taken by the
        Police.     This was a statement was it, as it were volunteered
        by you?     - A. My statement as awitness?

Q.       Yes.   -   A. Yes sir.

Q. Ana passed through the Police solicitors to West Midlands,
   is that right?  - A.   Yes sir.

Q.       And you annexed to it      two appendices,   one of which was
        these briefing notes.       - A. Yes.

Q. On the Friday, and I think what happened was West Midlands

                                                    D.G. DUCKINFIFLD




        retyped it and put it through its computer and you say it
        made a few errors in doing so.  - A. Yes sir, but that is
        no criticism of West Midlands.

Q. No, I'm not suggesting it*was intended to be.  As I
   understand what you have told us the errors are immaterial
   on the whole.  - A. Yes.   Minor really.

Q. Bur. let us deal with them if we come to them, or if there
   is any bit of it.   The difficulty is ....

             MR. COLLINS:    I am sorry sir, I'm afraid we've had a
        breakdown.

             LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Two more copies are coming for
        us in a moment.

q   .        MR. COLLINS:   Mr.  Duckin£ield, actually looking
        through the Friday Briefing it frankly doesn't differ I
        think virtually at all from the Saturday does it?  - A.
        There are paragraphs missed out sir.

Q.      I follow that, but we oan see that from the amendment.
        A. Yes.

Q. Essentially we can do this by looking at your Saturday
   briefing because it is virtually identical.  - A. More or
   less.  There is just the odd word where the tense changed.

Q. The only reason I suggest that is because I know Mr.
   Woodward has got lots oE copies of the Saturday briefing,
   and if we know that the Saturday one is really the one that
   matters then we can look at that.   - A. Yes.

Q.     I don't want to be unfair to you butI haven't spotted any
      material difference between the two.   - A. I checked them
     'yesterday.

Q. Let us then concentrate on the Saturday briefing, which was
   a briefing for whom?    This was a pre-match briefing for
   all Officers on duty in the stadium?  - A. That is right
   sir.

Q.      I think somewhere there is a picture of them all sitting
        there, but whether that is one that is actually before the
        Inquiry or not I don't know, but they all sat in the North
        Stand.  - A. Yes sir.

Q.      All 900   or whatever   it was of them. -   A. 801 I think.

             MR. WOODWARD:      Sir, do you have copies of this
        document?
                                          D.G. DUCKINFIELD




     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     No. Iam about to get a    copy
of the one we are now not going to use so perhaps wa    can
have the ones that we ace going to use.

     MR. WOODWARD: - Can I give you a copy of the real
document?

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Thank you.    (Produced)

     MR. COLLIN'S:  We will use your original rather than
the one sent through the West Midlands computer.  I think
what you are effectively saying is this, correct me if I am
wrong, that if we look at this we will see that there are
certain paragraphs crossed   out. - A. Yes sir.

Those paragraphs which are crossed  out you gave to the
Inspectors and above on the Friday.   - A. Yes.

But you deleted for the general briefing on the Saturday.
   A. Yes sir.

So if we look at this we can see an amalgam oc what you
gave both to the Inspectors and to the general body of men.
I suppose I should call them Officers on the one hand and
the men on the other, I don't know.  - A. They are all the
same .

Now the second paragraph which was deleted was obviously
something you had in mind and told the Inspectors was the
inevitability of a number of early arrivals.  - A. Yes
sir.

 And you refer to a certain number of gates capable of being
 opened from 11 am and endeavour to get people into the
 ground as quickly as possible.  In fact can you recall when
 the gates at Leppings Lane end were opened?  - A.
'Specifically I can't sir.  The general arrangements were,
 as I have said there, for twelve noon, but because people
 sometimes do arrive early and we would like to get them off
 the streets we ask Sheffield Wednesday for their co­
 operation in opening one or two gates in all parts of the
 ground at 11 so if people want to go into the ground they
 could do so.

In fact very few people would want to go in that early
would they?  - A. I think that might be a fair assessment
sir.

Then you go on to stress that if supporters do not have a
ticket then whatever they say they will not be allowed into
the ground.  - A. Yes sir.

                                            D.G. DUCKINFIELD




Q. That is obviously something on which you placed consider­
   able importance, the keeping out 06 non ticket holders.
   A. Wall with a 54,000 capacity then there is n o .room for
   anyone else when all the tickets have been sold.

Q. That is absolutely right, but does it follow from that, and
   from your emphasis in this document, that you were aware of
   the probability that people would come without tickets and
   try to get in?  - A. I would say possibility that people
   may arrive, but at that time when I gave that briefing
   there was no information whatsoever from the intelligence
   sources that people would arrive in numbers or large
   numbers without tickets.

Q. Is this not something which you anticipated?  - A. Not
   necessarily because bearing in mind we had taKen the
   trouble to write to the respective clubs to ask them to
   print in their programme our advice.  We had also used
   extensive publicity from all sections of the media to
   advise people not to come if they did not have a ticket,
   and we would hope chat people generally would accept thac
   advice and not arrive.
                          *

Q. Perhaps the difficulty is you did not have experience, but
   did not experience of policing football matches tell you
   that that hope was frequently not fulfilled?  - A. If we
   refer to previous experience of this particular tie, that
   is the semi-final tie, involving the two clubs last year,
   then I didn't know of large numbers of people from what Mr.
   Mole told me arriving without tickets.

Q. Were you aware that there had been complaints from
   Liverpool about the allocation of the part of the ground
   that was allocated to them? - A. I was aware of the media
   publicity that suggested that Liverpool supporters were not
  .happy with their allocation.

Q. Didn't Mr. Mole tell you specifically about those
   complaints?  -    A. He told me that there had been
   complaints and   that there had been considerations, so I was
   aware of that, but not that numbers of fans were determined
   to arrive without tickets.

Q. Didn't you foresee the possibility of that when you knew
   that there was  an under-allocation of tickets to the
   Liverpool side?  - A. It is a possibility but I can only
   work on information received, knowledge, and to take a
   course of action based upon knowledge and past experience.

Q. Do you get intelligence from other Forces as well as from
   your own experience?  - A. Yes.

Q. About the habits of the fans from a particular club?

                                           D.G. DUCKINFIELD




   A. We ask for all available information.

Because fans of particular clubs do have particular
reputations do they not?  - A. Yes I am sure they do.
They acquire reputations over a period.

And they may be unfounded but they do have certain
reputations, and this is something presumably which the
Police go into.  - A. Yes.

Had you for example learnt of the Cup Final I think in 1986
when I believe there were problems with non ticket holders
from Liverpool trying to get into the match and causing
difficulties.  - A. I was not aware of that.

That I think was a matter of common general knowledge.
A. If  was a matter of general knowlege it w a s n ’t knowledge
to me  and 1986, with respect, is three years ago.

I follow that.  -  A. The Police Service have to work upon
current information that is available at the time.

Yes, but this is information surely which is available      from
for example the Metropolitan Police.

      MR. WOODWARD:    Sir I hesitate to rise.     It is not
clear    from the course this questioning is taking whether or
not as a result of the investigations      that have been
carried out by the West Midlands Police there is
information that should have been in possession of
Sheffield, West Yorkshire Police (sic) concerning the
particular propensity for local supporters to arrive late
or without tickets.    That is not something that has been
canvassed in the letters of the Salmon Document that has
been put to us, nor has it been part of the evidence so
far of the witnesses who gave evidence for the fans.        In
fact it was specifically denied, at least I think by one
witness that there was a propensity to turn up late or to
turn up without tickets.      We appreciate the speed with
which this matter is progressing.      If this allegation is to
be prusued we require to have particulars of it.       Sir, more
importantly so that we can investigate it or go to the
detail of what is being put, we wish to have the
opportunity    of knowing what is said, but it may be that
information    is already got. If it has already been
obtained if    my learned friend, counsel for the Inquiry, is
in possession of it may we see it.      That will save us then
canvassing all aroung the country concerning the propensity
of Liverpool football supporters.

     MR. COLLINS:    I am not and I don't think I have at
all in this part of the questioning suggested a propensity
to arrive late.   I was not on that at all.  It is a
                            135
                                                D.G. DUCKINFIELD




   question of non ticket holders.   There is evidence before
   the Inquiry of considerable numbers on this occasion.
   Thre is also as I understand it evidence from some of the
   local residents of it being commonplace for there to be
   ticket touts at events sucfc as this, which presupposes
   people arriving without tickets, and if my learned friend
   takes 'The Independent' and had read the magazine on
   Saturday he would have seen where I got the source of the
   19 86 Cup Final at Wembley.

        MR. WOODWARD:    With respect if this Inquiry is to be
   conducted because of what appears in the press then that is
   not an appropriate way of proceeding.   We have been given
   indication of the allegations that are to be made against
   this particular Officer and against the Police in
   particular.   It is not suggested as we understand it that
   there was a recognisable propensity on the part of
   Liverpool supporters to arrive late or to attend without
   tickets that should have put us on particular notice for
   this occasion.

        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       That they more than anybody
   else did this?         ,

        MR. WOODWARD:      Indeed sir.

        MR. COLLINS:      Sir I w o n ’t pursue that certainly at
   this stage.

Q. All I am asking you Chief Superintendent is whether you
   expected or anticipated that there was likely to be an
   appreciable number of people arriving without tickets and
   you say no you didn't anticipate that.  Is that correct?
   A. The intelligence report that I received gave no
   indication whatsoever sir.

Q. But it was obviously a problem which you were aware of and
   wanted to cater for, hence your reference to it in the
   briefing note.  - A. I catered for it because there is a
   need for a flexibility of thought and approach.

Q. You say:

                "The ground has a capacity of 54,000.
                It is an all ticket match, and all
                tickets have been sold so there is no
                room for anyone who doe sn ’t have a
                ticket because we will break safety limits."

      A. Yes.

Q. Which of course is the obvious point.  Then you deal with
   segregation and the arrangements for segregation.  Then you
                                             D.G. DUCK INF I FT.n




deal with the sterile area along the back of the South
Stand.  That refers does it to the barrier that was set up
just to the east of the Leppings Lane entrance to the
ground.  - A. If you take a point from the River Don and
trace it along the River Don towards the South Stand, then
in that area there we created a sterile area with barriers.

And we have seen from the photographs one of the barriers
was just to the south I suppose of gate C.     A. I c a n ’t
say specifically but it was in that area.

Then you deal with the colour coding of tickets, and I
think copies ware provided as you indicated in the hand­
written note.  You dealt on Friday with the routing of
vehicles and spectators.  You explain that.  The need for
adjustment for extra time, pointing out that both wore red
and so this would give some problem of identification, and
then you have said to the Inspectors what colours they wear
on the field.

          "Attention that this match will take
          place without any public disorder and we
          must ensure the safety of the public."

And then you had said to the Inspectors and above

          "both inside and outside the ground and
          segregate the opposing fans"

but for some reason you deleted the "both inside and
outside the ground".  -   A. That was only the following
day.  I would have given the whole of that to the
Inspectors.

I follow that entirely.     -    A. I take your point.

I wondered why you deleted the reference to "ensuring
safety of the public both inside and outside the ground"
when you gave the briefing to the troops.   - A. I can't
categorically say sir.  There was a need to look at this^
and deliver the message that was necessary, and I think in
my view that the Inspectors would convey that message with
their operation order and specific. briefing.

Then you go on:

          "This will mean       ..."

now "element of" has been crossed out.  Was that crossed
out'for the Friday as well as the Saturday?  - A. Yes sir.

          "This will mean control by Police
          Officers and in addition to ensure
                         137
                                             D.G. DUCKINFIELD




           things run smoothly there must be no
           obstruction of the highway and we
           must be extremely vigilant to ensure
           there is no damage to property either
           in the ground or in the vicinity of the
           ground."

-   A. Yes sir.

This of course was the public order side      of the policing
is that right?  -A. Yes that is right.

And you deal with turn out and professionalism, you want
the public to be treated properly, transgressors to be deal
firmly, and then you say this:

           "I cannot stress too highly the word
           'safety'.  This ground will be full to
           capacity today and some of you may never
           have experienced a football match of this
           nature. Our job is to ensure the safety
           of spectators and you must make sure you
           know the escape routes, the problem areas
           and that you are fully conversant with your
           responsibilities should a crisis arise."

Now you refer there generally to the escape routes, the
problem areas ana your Officers and men being fully
conversant with their responsibilities should a crisis
arise.        Now the escape routes, that is relatively straight­
forward isn't it because they are limited and fairly
o b v i ou s . -    A. Yes s i r .

And those are matters which I imagine you would have
expected what, the Inspectors to have pointed out to their
individual serials?   - A. If we go back to the Friday
briefing, the purpose of the Friday briefing was so that
people who were there could be briefed by their
Superintendent and the Inspectors could in turn, before
they saw their respective Sergeants and Constables, could
wal.< to their respective areas of responsibility, both
inside and outside the ground, and the intention was that
they would wal.c the Spion K o p , the-North Stand, the South
Stand, the walkways, look at the gates.      Not only the
gates on the perimeter track but the gates on the stands,
the escape routes, so that if a crisis arose they knew
exactly what they had got to do and they could brief their
Officers accordingly on the Saturday.

Now the problem aceas.  What in your view were the problem
areas that needed to be identified?  - A. First of all
there was the problem in the Spion Kop because there has
been previously fans who have obtained tickets for the
                       i j b
                                         ■D.G. DUCKINFIELD




oooosing fans' end and on this occasion if Liverpool fans
had obtained tickets for the Nottingham Forest, which in
turn they did, then we had got a segregation problem in
that the Liverpool fans were in with the 21,000 Notts
Forest.              -      *

     tended to ask the questions from their supervisors.

Q.    I follow that. - A. No, they did not.   No-one   asked me any
     questions.

Q.    Did any of the Officers ask you any questions    about which were
     the problem areas? -'A. No,*sir.

Q.‘ Then you deal with their attitude:

          "There will be a   tremendous atmosphere within the ground
          but you must not   be caught up in this or the events that
          are taking place   on the field.  You must remain detached
          and clear-headed   at all times to respond to events".

     - A . Yes.

Q. Then you say you would have overall command but you had
   delegated certain areas of responsibility to particular
   Superintendents, and presumably you had identified those areas
   to the Superintendents concerned? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Then you say that Mr. Murray would command the control room,
   Mr. Greenwood within the stadium, Mr. Marshall outside and Mr.
   Chapman to the Nottingham outside.  Then you deal with the end
   of the briefing:

          "Any difficulties or decisions within those areas will be
          taken by those Officers or to the Sector
          Superintendents” .

     Then you deal with CID matters and then with trains.  Clearly
     by the Saturday you knew the times of the expected arrivals? -
     - A. Yes.

Q. Then with transport arrangements with Nottingham Forest;
    transport arrangements for Liverpool from Midland to the
  ■ ground.   Then you end by saying:

          "The order covers most eventualities, and I c a n ’t in this
          limited time cover everything, but there will be
          additional briefings by your Superintendents or
          supervising Officers.  Your Inspectors have had a copy of
          the operational order and are fully conversant with what
          our intentions are today.  Let me just say this.     Firm
          but fair policing will be the correct attitude.     Safety
          of supporters in this ground is paramount.  Nobody gets
          in without a ticket. Nobody takes drink or banners into
          the ground and nobody goes in who    is drunk” .

     - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Then you passed it on to Mr. Murray to supplement the
   briefing, and I will ask him about that aspect.  So that was £
   fairly general sort of briefing, was it not? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. In general terms,    left to the Superintendents and the Officers

             below them to fill out so far as detail was concerned? - A.
             Yes, sir.

        Q.   Following that briefing, which took place, and      we .have now
             come on to the Saturday, I think at 10 o'clock      in the morning?
             - A. Yes, sir.

        Q. And took what, how long in all about? - A. In my case possibly
    B      10 minutes; but I think the briefing overall was over in about
           20 m i n u t e s .

        Q. Did you remain while Mr.   Murray did his part of the briefing?
           -A. Yes, sir.

        Q. Effectively he dealt, did he, with the emergency evacuation
           procedure? - A. Yes, sir.
•   c   Q.   And the coded message we have heard about.   - A.    Yes.

        Q.    He dealt with television and video, cameras in the ground and
             the BBC coverage. - A. I c a n ’t specifically remember that,
             sir, but if that is in his statement.

        Q. He dealt with travelling arrangements.     He dealt with
    D      prisoners and ejections.*- A. Yes.

        Q. He dealt with alcohol.  He dealt with dealing with
           inflatables, which is something which is relatively           new in
           soccer crowds, is not it? - A. It is,sir.

        Q. Flags and so on.        Again, on the whole, relatively general
           m a t t e r s . He did not identify any specific problem area? That
           was left, presumably, to the Inspectors of the individual
           serials? - A. Yes, sir.

        Q. And then that finishes the briefing, and I think you then went
           to speak - I am sorry, you toured the area then.   Does that
          .mean you went outside the ground? - A. Yes, sir. I spoke with
           the men in the ground who. were sat in the stadium     shortly
           after briefing.  I left and went in a Police car, toured the
           area and assessed the situation, arriving back at the ground
           somewhere in the region of 1.15.

        Q. Did you then go into the Police control box at about lO-to-2?
           - A. Yes, sir.

        Q. What had you done between quarter-past-l and 10-to-2? - A. I
           spoke with various Officers.   I ate a hurried meal at 1.30.  I
           left there to meet with Superintendent Murray to go and see
           the referee to discuss -with him our respective
           responsibilities.  That is the referee and the Police service.

        Q. I think you made some arrangements about stopping the match
           should it be necessary to do so? - A. Yes.

        Q. And that should have involved informing one of the linesmen of
    H      the need to stop the match, who would then go and inform the

pa r t icu lar one.
                                  %


Sorry, which one, the one we are already looking at? - A.
Number 48 sir.  Generally speaking I would not sit anywhere.
There is no room.  You have to stand.  Mr. Murray v/ould sit
to the extreme left where that sandwich box is.  Sergeant
Goddard would sit opposite the blue tulip mike in the centre.
P.C. Ryan would sit to his immediate right under the video
monitors and P.C. Bishard would stand at the back in this
area.

Now that tulip one, the blue one that you have referred to,
is that the mike which can be used to cut into the. Tanncy
system? - A. No sir, that microphone is on the extreme right
where the papers are by the right-hand window'.

I see, the one sort of sticking out from that bit of equip­
ment? - A . .Yes sir.

What is the tulip mike then? - A. That is the personal radio
mike.
                          t

If we loolc at'Photograph 49 that shows actually the extension
of the bench we are looking at in 48 down to the left,      <
doesn't it? - A. Yes sir.

And shows three more consoles, •little white ones in the desk
top itself.  Are those for the relevant cameras. 1, 2. and 3
respectively and 4? - A . I don't know the technical details
sir.

Ahc it'is :that end you were telling us that Mr. Murray sits?
- :A.- No> Mr: Murr-ay> sit-s, • -if we-are-looking., at-..Photograph,;49
u s u ally over by- --theleft-hand window near, the'door             -r

I see, yes.    I beg .your pardon,    in front of that desk? -
A. Yes.

By the sandwich box--in the corner.   I take it that Cameras
1, 2 , 3 , 4 and S are all showing on those screens during .
all the time that the people are coming into the match,
are they? - A. Yes sir.

So you }ust have to look up to those screens to have a
view of the situation shown by those cameras and you can
ask presumably for the cameras to be moved to pan round
if you want to show' any particular part of the terracing
or the turnstiles at either end? - A. Yes,- there are.
limitations on some but overall you can get a very good *

Q. And obviously within the scope of their range? - A. Yes.

q   .         LORD   JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Have I got this right, that
        the master    screen flicks from 1 to 2 to 3 to 4 to 5 but can
        be made to    stop on anyone of them if you want to? - A. I
        don't know    sir, I have not got that technical knowledge.
                                        *
              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Very well.

q.            Mil. COLLINS: Anyway, the important point is that
        you have the facility there at any time to look at the
        situation at the parts of the ground visible from those
        five cameras? - A. Yes sir.

Q.       If we go on to Photograph 51    and   52, those show the view
        do they not from the control     box   on to the West Stand and
        terraces? - A. Yes sir.

Q. And most particularly perhaps 52 which shows that you have
   a reasonably clear view on to those terraces?  A. Yes sir.

Q.       Presumably-you have a p a i r of field glasses in the control
        box, do you? - A. No sir.

Q.       You don't? I thought we had some evidence    that there     was
        a pair of field glasses? - A. If     there is it is not      vithin
        my knowledge.           1

Q. It would be a sensible thing to have, wouldn't it? - A. It                 1
   could be advantageous, sir.

Q. Now by -the time that Mr. Jackson left, which we h a v e ■identified
   as being some time after 2 o'clock? - A. Yes sir.

Q.    What was the state .of play within the ground, by which I
    mean were you' able to ;get some idea as to how people were--..
   • coming— in-and: hoW'- full -.things seemed to .be.an-d-.. so on?,...-      ..

    were people on the.:'Leppings "Lane terrace and Stand-and •
     there was a crowd outside the turnstiles at the Leppings
    Lane end.

Q. Now I want to ask you a bit about that crowd outside.   I
   think we heard from Mr. Mole that the Operational Order
   did not really make any provision to cater for the late
   arrivals of fans to the Leppings Lane end because it was
   not anticipated that there would be a sudden surge,
   late arrival.  Is that right as you understand it? - A. Yes.

Q. You yourself had not anticipated the possibility of the
   late arrival? - A. No sir.

Q. Like Hr. Mole.  It was clear, was it not, before 2.30 that
   there was some problems out of the Leppings Lane end? -
   A. No sir.

q   . Well we know that at 2.17 there was a radio message from
      S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Marshall askiag that Leppings Lane be
      closed? - A. I would dispute that time, sir.

q   . Well it is actually on the log so it is not possible to
      dispute it, is it? - A. I think that will found to be a
      mistake sir.

q   . w h a t time do you say that that mess age came from Superintendent
      Marsh all ? - A. I believe the time was nearly 2.30.

q   . is that something that you can recall looking back on the
      timing? - A. It is a factor in my mind that the 2.17 time,,
      which I am aware of, but 1 don't believe to be correct.

Q. You know it is in the log? - A. Oh yes.

q   . What makes you think the log is inaccurate? - A. My own
      perception of the situation.             .
                                      •
q   . Well that may be, but o n e ’s own perception of times is
      often mistaken as one knows and that is why one tries to go
      to independent.evidence of timing.     You will accept that
      as a general proposition, I imagine? - A. I accept that
      general proposition.

q. What makes you think that your perception is right and the
    log is wrong on this occasion? - A. Because I remember
    looking at the situation and being conscious at 2.30 of
    events' which I. will relate and knowing' that, a message had
    been passed for Leppings Lane to be closed.. ,J: remember..               ..
    looking-at the-monitor and wondering why it.ha& been .               ’... .

    on the ^compilation--video- tha.t if my recollections-are/;Vf..... ...
    correct from the video, that is 2.31.           .•

q   . I am. not suggesting that Leppings Lane was in fact closed
      at 2 i17^-what the log shows is that Superintendent Marshall
      requested first that-it should be closed at 2.17? - A. I
      will accept that the log shows that.

q   . You say that you think that is inaccurate and the request
      came later? - A. My perception is that the request came
      later.

Q.   Because as I think also you know from the records and
     indeed from Superintendent Marshall's own recollection,
     the request was not complied with immediately? - A. Yes
     sir.

Ana one of the reasons for that was you were not able to
make radio -communication with the Officers at the other ' ^ 7 ^ -
end of Leppings Lane, not the roundabout end with Penis tone
Road but the other end of Leppings Lane? - A. I d o n ’t know
the reasons sir.

But in any event the request to close Leppings Lane to
traffic at whatever time it came, was an indication, was
it not, of problems arising in that area? - A. No sir,
we are dealing with a football match and crowds who
arrive and I would say that a happy crowd does not necessarily
mean a problem, but I take your point on that.

Well it was not part of the plan that Leppings Lane should
be closed, was it? - A. No sir.

And as far as you were aware it was not something that had-,
had to be dene on previous occasions? - A. Bearing in mine
I had only three w e e k s ’ experience there and not of a semi­
final, so I can't comment about previously. /

Well didn't you ask Mr. Murray who had had that experience
whether this was something which was usual the closing of
Leppings Lane? - A. No sir.

You were not aware then whether this was a usual or an
unusual request? - A. No sir.
                                                                          4

But it did suggest, whatever else, that there were a-large ‘
number-of people in Leppings juane, dici it not? — A.- Yes. s i i .

Who were not able to be contained cn the pavements? - A. Yes
sir.

And .'it'-"did “suggest and perhaps confirm what you could see on
your video, monitor "that there was a considerable crowd of
people' out'side'-'the--'entrances-. at ;Leppin.gs .La.ne_spiliingvou.t ..-: :
on to the < r o a a w a y A . .There' was a crowd .of .-people1,..,yes ..
sir.

You-could see that on your monitor certainly, by half-past-2?
- A. Yes sir.

And it was clear was it not by then at the latest that there-
was or there were some difficulties in people being put
into proper order as it were to get smoothly through those
turnstiles? - A. It was not clear to me, sir.

Well couldn't you see the mass of people outside? - A. I
could see the people but I was not aware of the difficulty.

Also by half-past-2 you were aware, were you not, of the
position in the West terracing, the Liverpool terracing,
that there was a concentration in the centre, that is in
Pens 3 and 4 and gaps on the sides? - A. Yes sir.

Q. You say in ‘your statement that you asked for a Tannoy
   message to be relayed at this stage or at about this
   stage? - A. Yes sir.

Q. Which was, you say', for fans to move forward and spread
   along the terraces?   A. Ye§ sir.

Q.      First of   all was that Tannoy message put out? - A.        I believe
        so sir.    I gave the instruction to P.C. Ryan.

Q. You were in the bo:-:? - A. Yes, I told him to put the Tannoy
   message out.

Q. But you could hear whether he did or not, couldn't you?
   - A. No sir.

Q. C o u l d n ’t you hear him talking? - A.To be specific no, but
   there is noise going on all the time.        I gave the instruction
   to P.C. Ryan to give the message and P.C. Ryan would give
   the message.

q   .         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Well if he could hear you asking
        him to do it you could hear him do it, couldn't you? -
        A. Yes sir.              ,

q   .        MR. COLLINS:    Vie11 did you?        I mean did he do it?

Q. Coulc you hear the Tannoy in the control room? •- A.. Mo sir.

Q. Was it said once or more than once? - A. I don't know sir.

0. well it obviously was "not having any effect, was it, when
   it-was made.   Did it appear to have any effect? - A. I
   can' t be specific s ir ’
                           .' I asked him to'carry out an
   instruction and he carried out that instruction.

                     the terraces? - A. I can't be specific.

                  0.    Did people move forward and to the sides? - A. I asked         them to
                       move forward, but I was looking at other things.

                  0. Surely, if you thought it important to make the request you
             B       would have checked to see if the request was effective? - A.
                     Yes, but there were people coming in all the time.

                  0.    I know there were. Why did you think it necessary tomake
                       that request? What- was the purpose of it? - A. i was
                       looking at the ground situation and saw the terraces, and I
                       saw the concentration of people, and I asked him to give
                       out a Tannoy message for people to move forwards and
                       s id e w a y s .

                  0. What was it you thought might happen if the message was not
                     put out? - A. I thought there might be a bui^d up.

                  Q.    Did you think that a build up might be dangerous? -.A.         It
                       could cause difficulties.
             D    0. What difficulties?. - A. Because people'were not moving
                     forward .

                  Q. Did you think a build bp in the centre pens might create
                     dangers? - A. 'Not at that stage, sir.                                 1

                  0. But you were concerned enough to put out: a message to- try to
                     eet people to go t-cr the sides and to move forward in the pens
                   f themselves? - A\ to me it was an obvious course of action
                     looking at the situation.

                 -Q. Did it.occur to you" if it was important one way of achieving
                      that-would be to send a serial of Police Officers to-the^-ba:ck

                      cross my mind.

                  Q. Again, did it cross your mind if this was something which was
                     important, as clearly you thought it was, you might send
                     Officers to- the -back of the tunnel to give, directions to -
                     people :to go round the sides when they came in.through-the ■
                     turnstiles? - A. There were Officers in that area, sir, and it
                     was not full at that time.

                  0. I know, but you could perceive from the         front there was a
                     potential problem in that the centre of         the terracing was
                     filling up and the sides were not? - A.         Yes. but I think you
                     are making more of a problem than there         was.

                  0    Yes. but there was enough of a      problem for you to take action
                       by asking for Tannoy? - A. Yes,      but that was a situation where
             H         as sround Commander I looked at      the situation, asked for an
                       instruction to be given, and it     was given.

                  0 . I follow that, but in order to achieve something did it not
                      occur to you you might have to take further action, and one
                      obvious action is to instruction the Officers behind the
                      turnstiles, part of whose duty - this is 14 and 15 - part of
                      whose duty was to keep order on the terraces, to do something
                      about it? - A. I did not an,instruction, sir.

              B   G. I know you didn't, but why d i d n ’t you? - A. Because the
                     thought did not enter my mind because there were Officers
                     there.

                  Q. Officers can't be expected to do anything if they d o n ’t know
                     the problem on the other side.  They c a n ’t see through the
                     West Stand, can they? - A. There is an Inspector there and
                     supervisory Officers who know that detail very well indeed.

                  G.   But the y - c a n ’t see through the West Stand, can they? - A. They
                       are supervising the situation, sir.

                  Q. But I repeat, they can't see through the West Stand.     You
                     perceived a problem.    Unless you tell them, and you have a
                     radio;   you can communicate with the Inspector - unless you
                     -ell them, ’’Look,- there is a problem building up.. We have got
              D      a concentration in the centre of the terraces.     Would you take
                     some action, please” . Unless you do that they are not going
                     to be able to do it, are they? - A. Police Officers aci on
                     t'neir initiative, and 'on this occasion they would have been
                     monitoring the situation, but I did not give a specific
                     instruction.

                  q   . I fully accept that Police Officers are expected to act on
                         their initiative, but it is a bit hard to.expect them to do so
                        when they c a n ’t see what is happening, is not it? - A. They
                         are. .aware of the situation in that area and they would be
                       ■ aware of any build up. .                           .          '

                     that.

                  0. Anything is possible, but did you cause such a message to be
                     given to them? -A. I personally did not, sir, but bearing in
                     mind there are other Officers in that control room who may
                     have taken independent action as a result of my Tannoy
                     message.

              ^   Q. But you are the one in charge, and it is you who perceived the
                     problem.  It is you who asked for the Tannoy message to be put
                     out? - A. Sir, I gave instructions and other Officers who are

                           supplementary actions they carry them out.

                      Q. Yes, I see.  In any event, you were going out of the
                         turnstiles now.  Incidentally, before I leave that, how did
                         you expect them to be. able to spread out o.ver the terraces? -
                         A. By moving along through the gates.
                 B
                      Q.   Which gates? - A. The gates that were open at the back                     of   the
                           terrace.

                      Q. You were aware from the monitor by this stage, and we are
                         still about half-past-2, of the increasing number of
                         supporters in Leppings Lane and the crowd outside the
                         turnstiles? - A. Yes, sir.

                      Q.   "Crowd" is a fair word,          is not it, at that stage? - A.            Yes.

                      Q. Did you wonder at that stage whether you would be able to get
                         everyone in by 3 o'clock? - A. Yes,' I spoke with
                         Superintendent Murray, and on looking at the
                         space available inside the ground and the crowd
                         outside, I asked him what he thought about .the
                 D       situation, and his words were something to the
                         effect, "We have half-an-hour yet.   We'll get all
                         those i n " .
                                                I
                      Q. "All those"? -Tell me,' you presumably made, a mental assessment
                         as to how full.the ground was, at the Liverpool end? - A. Yes.

                      Q. Whether you had got in about half, about a quarter,                      about
                         three-quarters or whatever? - A. Yes.

                        0. Wha.t. was your mental assessment•as to the approximate numbers
                           looking round the stands and the terraces that. ..you.had got in
                           of the Liverpool supporters? - A. Looking..at .the North Stand
                     :.    if was. :approxi:niHtel>L- half., f u l l ,-b u t .bearing: l-n-jmdnd: -tji'ose- fans

                      Q. I follow that all that. - A. And the Leppings Lane terrace was
                         filling.  I c a n ’t be specific, possibly half full.

                     - q . You •must- have thought to yourself, "We have- got about, half,
                           third, quarter, in already.    We have got about half, third,
                           two-thirds, three-quarters to come", some sort of mental
                           process like that? - A. I did not flag up in my mind, "Half,
                           quarter".    I just looked at the situation and thought.

                      0. You have been talking in terms of about half full? - A. Yes.

                      G. So that'suggests that is what at least crossed your mind at
                         the time, that it was about half full? - A. The North Stand.
                 H    Q. And the terraces? - A. Yes.

                      0. And the West Stand? - A. No,             I c a n ’t say.

                       Q. If it was about half it meant you had about 12,000 to get; in?
                          - A. No, I don't accept that.  I said I can't work on figures.

                            If - if - if it was about half, if that was a rou-gh guide, a
                            rough assessment, then as a p a t t e r of there were about 12,000
                            people to get in, because we know there were about 24,000
                   B        Liverpool supporters? - A. I would not have thought the figure
                            of 12,000 was accurate.  You are tying me to figures and I
                            can't be specific.

                       Q. No. I am not tying you to any figures.  I am simply pointing
                          out as a matter of I think logic.... - A. I know the point you
                          are making.

                   c   q   ..... if it was about half full' then there were as a matter of
                             fact - I am not saying this went through your mind --but as a
                             matter of fact there were about 12,000 people to get in? - A.
                             To be honest, sir, you have to accept that I looked around the
                             sround and I did an assessment, and a figure'of 12,000 that
                             you are suggesting did not flag up in my mind, and I did not
                             think there was anything like that.
                   D   o    I am wondering whether you ought to Have thought perhaps in
                            those terms when you were* assessing whether you should take
                            any positive action to. possibly postpone kick-off? - A. Just
                            let me clarify the position.   I was discussing with
                            Superintendent Murray the position inside the ground and      1
                            outside.  Our perception was that t h o s e •outside could.be
                            got inside by the appropriate time.

                       O. Y e s . but was this on the assumption that the crowd outside was
                          everyone, and there were not going to be any more added to the
                          crowd as minutes passed by? - A. We assessed the situation as ..
                          we saw it at that time.

                       Q. But •you. did:'appreciate,'/. did -;you , that vt-hat:.-crowd that .youi::i,_. c
                          .could is&e. ^.n .the .video. :.on:-the. monitor ,was,.-not ^necessarily. ..the:..
                          whole--of it.because/.there would .be people-coming and. joining...
                          that crowd as the .minutes went by? - A. The information w a s •at
                          that time the traffic routes were clear and those people who'
                          were to arrive were there in the vicinity.

                       Q. But was'-.not it. vital to try to get information to see whether
                          there were a lot of people still to come, still arriving.'' -A.
                          I was not receiving any information that there were more
                          people to come.

                       Q. Did you not ask for that information? - A. No.

                       q   . Was it not vital that you should get it? - A. I had got Sector
                             Commanders who could advise me of the situation.

                       Q. But the Sector Commanders away from the ground would not know
               H          that there was this crush building up at Leppings Lane, would
                          they? - A. No, but they would know that people were walking to
                          the ground.

Q. Unless you ask them because it is a material situation, there
   is no reason why they should tell you?   Why should they tell
   you, "We have got people walking down”?    That is an
   unnecessary message which will clog up the air waves, won't
   it? - A. Sir, the Sector Commanders are responsible for their
   areas.  If they see s&methirfg unusual they would report it.

Q. But it would not be unusual.  If people are coming down to the
   ground at about 25-to-3 there is nothing particularly unusual
   about that, is there? - A. No, sir.

Q. You knew you had a problem already at the gates because you
   could see that there was already a crowd outside the Leppings
   Lane turnstiles? -.A. Sir, you use the word "problem":  At a
   game such as this there is a crowd.  That does not necessarily
   mean a problem.

0. When I say "problem” , there was a crowd of a sufficient size
   to make you ask Mr. Murray, because you were^worried about it.,
   whether you could get them all in by 3 o ’clock? - a . I don't
   say I was worried.

G. Why did you ask him? - A. I w a s ■assessing the situation as an
   operational Commander.   ♦

Q. But at least you must have had raised in your mind a slight
   question mark .as. to whether you would be able to get them in
   by 3 o ’clock, otherwise presumably you would not have
   bothere'd to ask Mr. Murray the question? - A. I make
   assessments as the game develops and I made an assessment on'
   that crowd there.

 q   .         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: ..Mr. Duckenfield, you said the log
         was" wrong about when the request was made to -close 'Leppings •
         Lane? - A. Yes, my lord.

>G. And .I: t h i n k you said, it .was not at 2.17,: it -was ..about .2:30?:. v
    A . Y e s , my L o r d .

 G. Suppose you are right about' that, suppose it was 2.30, does
    not that indicate that somebody who was on the ground outside
    the Leppings. Lane entrance thought at any rate at 2.30- that,
    there was a problem? - A. Yes, there was a crowd that .was
    spilling on to the roadway.

 q   _        MR. COLLINS:   All I am wondering, Chief Superintendent,
         and I shall I hope leave this subject after this question, and
         it is this.  You were aware there were people certainly by
         2.30, sufficient to spill out over Leppings Lane and cause
         problems in the roadway? -A. Yes.

 G. Thus there was the request, and you could see on the videos?
    Right?  So there was a build up of people? -A. Yes, sir.

 0. To use a fairly neutral term, a build up of people at the
    Leppings Lane entrances? - A. Yes, sir.

0. That build up you had to clear by 3 o'clock? - A. Yes. sir.

Q. You asked Superintendent Murray whether he thought you would
   be able to clear that build up by 3 o'clock?  Right? - A. Yes.

Q. And he said,      "Yes".   Re thought it would be'all right? -A. yes,
   sir.

Q.   In those circumstances surely it was vital for you to
     know whether there were going to be a lot more people coming
     to add to that build up in the minutes following 2.30. because-
     that would gravely affect, would it not, the question of
     whether you would be able to get them all in by 3 o'clock, if
     there were a lor more people to come to join in on this build
     up? -A. It would.

0. It is elementary that,        is not iz? -A. Yes.

Q. In those circumstances why did you not ask the relevant Sector
   Commanders at a distance from the ground to report to you
   whether there was still a lot 'cf people approaching Leppings
   Lane to add to that build up., because only if you knew that
   would you know whether it was 'necessary -to postpone kick-off?
   - A. If we look at the cf-owd situation at Leppings Lane at
   that t i m e , I can.estimate what the crowd might be, and if that
   crowd outside, for a r g u m e n t ’s sake, was 2,000, and others were
   to come. then, there is still plenty of time to cope with          <
   others coming in.

Q.   But are -you saying that your assessment that there was time to
    get all the people in, took into account the fact that there
    was still people likely to come down and add themselves to
    this build up? You took that into account, did: you? - A. We
 •• took into account the fact the people were there'and-there was
    a possibility of others coming'.

■G.. 'Did' you •‘seek''-to .as'sess -how many others or: get .some. idea.- of- how,
      many' others were to come? - A. No, sir.                                .

O.   Why not? - A. I did not ask the question at that time, sir.

Q.    Why not? - A. Because the.traffic routes were clear and I
     thought the.people:were there, and there was no..informatioa
     coming in that people were coming to the ground in large
     numbers.

Q. But with respect, Chief Superintendent, you are not going to
   get that information unless you asked for it, are you? - A. I
   would expect Police Officers to report in if there were large
   numbers of people congregating and large numbers of people
   walking towards the ground.

Q. We know that was in fact the situation because we have
   heard plenty of evidence to that effect.   - A. I did not
   receive that information sir.
                            *              _

Q. Did you instruct, as part of your briefing, your Sector
   Commanders outside or any Officers to give you that
   information should the occasion arise?    - A. No sir, I
   would expect them to give it me.

Q. Oh Chief Superintendent is that fair to them really to
   expect them of their own volition to give that sort of
   information, which isn't immediately obvious as being vital
   information., to you as Ground Controller? - A. They are
   trained Police Officers sir.

Q. Yes but they have to be briefed don't they, and they
   expect to receive instructions from their superiors don't
   they?  - A. They are trained Police Officers who police
   football matches regularly.

Q.- You see what you -appear to be saying is that you would
    expect vour subordinates to take all- the steps necessary
    of their own initiative to fill you in as things wan!: on.
    is that really fair to them?   - A. It is fair sir.   They
    are trained Police/Officers, they are accustomed to this
    situation and they' are out there to advise me.

Q. Even if they don't know that circumstances are such and
   unusual circumstances have.arisen which.render the
   necessity to give the advice from your and that they don't
   know about?  - A. At 2.30 sir I didn't consider it
  ••unusual.

Q. Well you didn't know what was usual did you, because you.

 . Yes but not at Hillsborough and not at the Leppings Lane
   turnstiles.  - A.   Not at the Leppings Lane turnstiles
   but Superintendent Marshall, who has experience, could
   assess'the situation and advise me.

Q. You say, going back to your statement, and I have got page
   5.  Please have it in front of you if you wish.  Having
   dealt with 2.30 and the question about whether you get
   people in you say this in your statement:

                "About this time I asked Superintendent
                Murray to clarify with me the circum­
                stances under which we would consider
                delaying kick-off."

       A. Yes sir.

q  presumably you asked him that because you were concerned
    .
   as to whether you ought possibly to delay the kick-off.
   A. No sir, not specifically.
                            c              *"
Q. Why did you raise it then if it wasn't   in    yourmind as
   something which was a possibility?  -    A. As    anew
   Commander, and thinking through many of the developments
   in a semi-final tie, I asked him to clarify with me the
   situation for delaying kick-offs, and it was a general
   conversation.

q   .   Did you not know then what was the contingency plan for
        delaying kicx-o ff,. because it was your responsibility and
        no-one else's, to decide on whether kick-off should be
        delayed wasn't it?    -   A. Yes sir.

Q. Had you not clear in your mind before you started what
   were the circumstances under which you would delay kick-
   off?  - A. As I said earlier I had had a discussion with
   Superintendent Murray and during the day, as with many
   things to clarify my thoughts, I asked him for advice
   once more.            t

Q. Why did you need, his advice because you surely had already
   made the decision of the circumstances under which kick-
   off’ would be postponed.     A. I discussed with          i
   Superintendent .Murray many things, and I just .discussed
   with him that point to refresh my memory.

Q. And you go on in your statement to identify what you have
    already given, us in evidence, namely, that you had
    previously agreed that if there-.was an identifiable
    problem, for example a serious incident, an accident on
    the motorway, fog or something like that, which prevented

                   "As opposed to those who had been brought •
                 : to '-the area within a reasonable time but              .•
                   had chosen not to enter the ground as soon
                   as possible."

           A. Yes sir.

Q. That suggests that you had taken a policy decision that if
   problems arose due to late arrival of fans because they
   chose to arrive late you wouldn't postpone the kick-off.
   - A. You have got to be very careful in a situation such a-
   this with regard to delaying kick-offs.  Now if there is a
   major incident then yes I would seriously consider
   delaying a kick-off as I hava said.

I appreciate that it is a big step to take and it is an
unpopular step with the teams and no doubt with thosa
responsible for staging the match, but it is a matter of
common experience with policing football.matches is it
not that people will try, if there is a build-up, if
there are any problems at the entrances, you get
difficulties if people are pressing in to get in by kick-
off?  - A. Yes sir.

You have potential crowd problems.           -   A. Yes sir.

If you get a large number of people who are not in the
ground by kick-off.  - A. Not necessarily.

They get frustrated apart from anything else, they are
liable to push, they are liable to try to take other
measures to get in on time.   - A. If we deal with crowds
generally and people who are late for events, one would
imagine th-at they queue and 'orra orderly queues and
behave normally.

Are you a Police Offiqer speaking or- ....               -   A. No I'm
applying a generalisation.

You may hope that, or imagine it, but it doesn't happen
does it? 'Certainly not with football crowds.   - A. 3 u ; ,
football crowds shouldn't be different; to anybody else.*.

Maybe they shouldn't, but it is a recognisable phenomenon
that:if you want to get to an event on time you do all you
can to get to the turnstiles on time , and if there is a
•crush and a crowd of people you tend to get pushing. It
may be stupid but it tends to happen.   - A. It can occur.

Arid'it is- something you. should foresee....,-.,. A... As,..a.i..Ppliqe..
Off icer 'I-- ca-n- foresee the difficulties.;''                :      :;VT

So' you could foresee the problem that if there was a crowd
of people   still trying to get in through the Lappings
Lane turnstiles at three o'clock, or just before three o'cl
you'-might have--a crowd control problem.    A. I might.

And more importantly you might have a safety problem
because oeoole can get crushed in that situation.  — A.
If these"people are frustrated and they are pushing to get
in .

And that is something which you foresaw.             -       A. Not on tne
semi-final day. .

You foresaw surely as something which might happen if you
had a large number of people trying to gt in or still out
at or about kick-off.  - A. I think the point is sir that
                                              D.G.   DUCKENFIELD




thera was a crowd at 2.30, there was a crowd of people who
were trying to get in, and thera is potential for
difficulties, but I didn't foresee at that time from the
information supplied to m e , that there would be any
difficulty.

Let me put it this way - I know you didn't foresee any
difficulty but let me ask you this:  you asked your
question of Superintendent Murray at about half past two
as to whether he thought you could get them all in on
time.  - A. Yes sir.

He said he thought you could.        -   A. Yes sir.

If he had said, "No, I'm afraid we have got a build-up
hers, I don't think we will be able to get them in in time
we are going to have problems." what would you have done?
   A. 1 would have seriously considered delaying kick-off.

Exactly.  And why would you have seriously considered
delaying kick-off?  - A.. ^Because the advice I was being
given was that there vjas a difficulty.

But why would you d e l a y 'kick-off in those circumstances?
What difficulty did' you foresee, or what problems' did you
foresee or what dangers did you foresee if you did not ^
delay kic:<-off? - A. Would you rephrase that, again sir?

 You say that if Mr. Murray had said to you, "I don't- think
we will be able to get all this lot in by three o'clock."
   -    A.- At that stage I would have considered delaying kick-
'of f .     ■      .

 Why?' - A. Because if you can't get the fans in, and ther
'wa:sJ:a' considerable-number outside that- Wer^nj t: getting,.... _ .
1 tfi'e'reV I’would- h-ave delayed-the kick-of f,.                - .

 But for what purpose?  To accommodate the fans or because
 you thought that there might be otherwise crowd control
 oroblems and disorder problems outside, or a combination
’of the two?  - A. No.   We are taking the point that
 what I am saying is this:  if there were perceived
 difficulties that could have caused a major problem at
 2.30 and the advice I was being given is we should delay,
 I would have considered delaying.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       We are skirmishing.      Can I try
 and clari fy:

 All counsel is asking is if you had decided to delay the
 kick-off against what risks would you have .made that
 decision? Why would you have thought it right to do it?
 -  A. If there was a ’danger to life and injury.

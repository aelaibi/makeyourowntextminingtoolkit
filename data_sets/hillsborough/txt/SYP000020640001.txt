     REPORT ON PA CUP SEMI FINAL AT SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY. ON 15TH APRIL 1989

I first noticed that something was wrong more or less     immediately after   the      ballhad
hit the Nottingham Forest crossbar for I turned to my     left to      see the Liverpool
supporters swaying forward, something seen many times at football matches.
It was then that I noticed a spectator inside the perimeter fencing on the pitch and
realised that obviously there were problems at the Liverpool supporters end of the
ground. The Public Address system was very poor in volume although a number of
announcements were made. Later on when the volume was turned up an announcement by
the Liverpool FC Manager, Mr K Dalgleish, was heaxd without any problems at all.
The main complaint I have received is that the publicdid not know what was going
on and people felt that they could have been kept more in the    picture.

The FSA



The FSA was set up in Liverpool following the Heysel Stadium
tragedy in 1985 and has developed into a prominent nationwide
organisation.    There are 12 regional branches and membership
includes supporters from all 92 League clubs.       The FSA unlike the
National Federation of Football Supporters Clubs (NFFSC), is not
based on individual clubs.


                                                                               /
The NFFSC                                                                  ^


The NFFSC was founded in 1927 and represents supporters' clubs
throughout   the UK.   It    is   administered   regionally with    six
divisions - Northern, Midland, Southern, Welsh, South Western and
Scottish. The aims of the Federation are to encourage, promote
and develop support for football throughout Great Britain.         It is
widely felt that the NFFSC is not as forward-looking as the FSA.
Meetings and correspondence with the Minister for Sport


The FSA and the NFFSC met the Minister for Sport in January 1988
and December 1988.          The January meeting covered a range of topics
including the football supporters organisations relations with the
football authorities and individual clubs, FA Cup Final ticket
allocations,       the    UEFA     ban    on     English    clubs       and    membership
schemes.       The December meeting discussed the proposed national
membership       scheme     for     football        supporters      to        which    both
organisations were opposed.


During November 1989 the FSA and NFFSC wrote to the Secretary of
State for the Environment and the Minister for Sport respectively
requesting representation on the Football Membership Authority
(FMA) provided for in the Football Spectators Act.                        The Minister
for Sport made it clear to both organisations that he would be
happy to consider any nominations put forward.


Tony Goulbourn, Chairman of the FSA, wrote to the Minister for
Sport     in   November     nominating         himself     and    the    FSA     National
Secretary, Martin Jones, as members.                 The DOE did not receive any
formal nominations from the NFFSC.


These requests for representations on the FMA followed statements
in the House by the Minister for Sport during the passage of the
Football       Spectators    Bill        about    the     importance      of     football
supporters having a greater               say at        club level and needing to
be involved in the national membership scheme and the FMA.                             This
message    about    the     need    for     clubs    to    move   closer        to    their
supporters was reiterated by the Minister for Sport most recently
during the debate on safety of football grounds on 30 January
(Hansard extract at Flag A)


The NFFSC wrote to the Minister for Sport on 25 January this year
suggesting a joint meeting with the FSA to discuss post - Taylor
issues.    The Minister replied suggesting that as safety at sports
grounds    and   Lord   Justice   Taylor's   alternative   strategy   for
combatting hooliganism were Home Office issues he might wish to
seek a meeting with Home Office Ministers.        (Corresp. attached at

T h a n k y o u fox      your    l e t t e r of    25 J a n u a r y s u g g e s t i n g a joint
meeting        with      the     Federation         and    the      Football          Supporters
Association..

It may be helpful if I first explain the position on the proposed
national membership scheme and the Football Licensing Authority
in t h e light of L or d J u s t i c e T a y l o r ' s fin al re port on the
Hillsborough Stadium disaster.

As you know in his final report Lord Justice Taylor concluded
that he could not support a national membership scheme because he
did not believe that the technology would work well enough to
avoid the danger of congestion and disorder.                          The Government has
always made it clear.that it would not implement the scheme until
it had given full consideration to Lord Justice Taylor's report.
In the light of his report we have decided not to proceed with
the e s t a b l i s h m e n t of the F oo t b a l l M e m b e r s h i p A u t h o r i t y w h i c h
would have had the responsibility for drawing up and implementing
a detailed scheme.             The national membership scheme has therefore
been put on the back burner.                             v

Lord J u s t i c e T a y l o r r e c o m m e n d e d an a l t e r n a t i v e s t r a t e g y for
combatting football hooliganism including the creation of new
offences specifically related to football/ the use of attendance
centre    orders       and     electronic           tagging     of      offenders.            The
Government       will    be    looking         carefully      and      quickly       at these
suggestions.

Lord J u s t i c e T a y l o r w e l c o m e d the p r o p o s e d e s t a b l i s h m e n t of a
Football Licensing Authority.                    While the Authority will no longer
be required to license football grounds for the purposes of a
national membership scheme it will have a crucial role to play in
s u p e r v i s i n g the s a f e t y r e s p o n s i b i l i t i e s of local a u t h o r i t i e s
under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 in respect of sports
grounds at which designated football matches are played.                                  The FLA
will also be the m e c h a n i s m t h r o u g h w h i c h we will e n s u r e the
provision           of  all-seater       accommodation               at those   grounds/         as
recommended by Lord Justice Taylor.
S a f e t y at. s p o r t s g r o u n d s and c o n s i d e r a t i o n of Lord J u s t i c e
Taylor's proposed strategy for combatting football hooliganism
are primarily the responsibility of the Home Office.                            You might
therefore wish to write to the Home Office.                            If there are other
issues which you would like to discuss with me/ my office would
be happy to arrange a meeting.

I am copying this letter to Lord Ferrers/ Graham Kelly at the
Football Association and Arthur Sandford at the Football League.

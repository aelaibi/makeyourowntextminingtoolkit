Dear Doctor Popper

HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

Many thanks for your letter dated 31 August 1990 in which you set out your
reasons for wishing to delay releasing the DPP file and statements to the
South Yorkshire Police until after the completion of the Inquests.

I am in consultation with the Police Complaints Authority but that process
is unlikely to be completed until after 10 September 1990.  I will then be
in touch with you again.


Yours sincerely




Chief Constable
Investigating Officer

FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL - SAFETY

Introduction

This note summarises discussion with DOE (SARD) (Peter Lee) over
the cost of safety functions to be carried out by the Football
Licensing/Safety Authority (FLSA) (my terminology in the absence
of any credited title for this new body which might be set up
under the Football Spectators Bill (the Bill).

I was asked to help over the cost of inspection teams operating
under the auspices of the FSLA and for any contribution on costs
for HO letter which will have to be sent by DOE to 'H' Committee.

Preliminary Enquiry

Before meeting DOE I consulted both Mr Archer and Mr Stickley.
Figures given to me by the former suggested that the approx cost
of a fairly senior fire officer (say Divisional Officer grade)
would cost/about £40,000 per annum plus accommodation cost).
This figure was also estimated for the cost of an engineer. This
same figure was therefore projected for the cost of a police
officer of equivalent rank/standing.

Calculation of Cost

The annex A to this note summarises the calculations. At this
stage the exact safety role (if any) of the FSLA is not known;
nor is the extent of any monitoring it is to carry out.
Similarly, the nature, content, detail of any ground examination
is uncertain; the extent to which inspection of ingress
routes/turnstile arrangements for licensing purposes (as opposed
to safety purposes) is unclear; and the inspection frequency has
not been determined - though annual inspection is likely. The
degree to which the safety element of any monitoring/checking has
additional resource implications beyond those already estimated
in relation to the licensing only functions is far from clear -
not least because the basis of the original estimate (£250,000 so
I was led to believe) was not known.

Other Points

I repeated doubts as to the workability of the arrangement and
the HO position to the effect that giving safety functions to the
FSLA was contingent upon the Taylor Inquiry.

I stressed the very general nature of estimates in the light of
the preceding paragraphs;  and that the figures were given
informally as a gesture of assistance rather than an official HO
costing exercise.  I stressed the need for caution.  I made clear
inspection time (3-4 days) did not, so far as safety was
concerned, entail any testing or verification of calculations
(and that we had internally estimated about 3 days for safety
alone).

As agreed with DOE I have since prepared a draft contribution for
their consideration.  This is at Annex B and has not been needed.

Copies of this note go to Mr Archer and Mr St^ckley with Annex A
only.

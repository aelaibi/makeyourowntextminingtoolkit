                 service.

                 On S a t u r d a y    15th April         1989      I travel led to the H i l l s b o r o u g h Stadium,

                 traffic      hold ups           en route.

                 We    parked the          vehicle at a t e mp or ar y            car       park on a fact o r y       premises

                 off H ER R I E S ROAD.

                 After     parking         the    vehicle we wa l k e d         to the        turnstile      entrance       to the

         W h il /t making                our way      on foot       to the      turnstile         I saw hundreds        of

         N o t t i n g h a m Forest          s u p p o rt e r s    in the      location.         Som e of these

                                                                                            /
         there was              no sign of any disorder.

         On going             inside       the    ground      I did not         see any S T E W A R D S or any uniform

         Po l i c e         officers       to direct myself              or other       supporters.

         We made             our way to the mi ddle                 of the S p i o n Ko p terrace            behind the

         N o t t i n g h a m Forest          goal     mouth.

         At appro;<imately                  15 minutes            before    kick off        it became       uncornfortably

         crowded where                   I was    s t a nding all        the    gangways were         blocked      by standing

         suppo r t e r s         and      people were         pushing a n d       shoving        to get     late    vantage

         points.              On several          o c cas ions      people were         pushed over and others               were

         pushed             into me.

         On first a r r iving                in the S pi on Kop there was                       plenty of    room,    it was

         only       in the         last f if t e e n minu t e s prior             to kick        off that      things    became

         so u n c om fo rt ab le            and    because         of the      lack of stewards           people were

         fending             for t he m s e l v e s   and     pushi

         It a pp e a r e d         very disorganised.

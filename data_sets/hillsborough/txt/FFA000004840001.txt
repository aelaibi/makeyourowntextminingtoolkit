  Dear i|*f

                                                Hi1isborough

              Thank you for your letter of 11th May,                                198 9,

        I have briefly discussed ths matter with the Chairman
  and ha has aareed to place it bafore Council on 25th May,
  1989.

         We feel that perhaps it might be better to seek
  delegation to a Committee of five.   In this way the
  non-availability of one or two members on any given date would
  not preclude us from moving quickly towards a comprehensive
  report.   Also, we would be able to have a more widely
  representative working group.

                                            lours sincerely,__________

O        Dear Sirs,

         Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.


          If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
          of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent,
          on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m. Details of venue will be notified in
          due course.

          I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
          evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
          coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
          inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

          Subject to the Coroners’ Act 1988 and the Coroners’ Rules, the Inquest is
          under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
          witnesses who wish to give evidence.  I am at present engaged in considering
          this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

          Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
          to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
          appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me to
          consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

          May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
          attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

              I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
              names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision as
              to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

              I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
              heard from you by the end of Septentfje-r I will assume you have no names to
              submit.

              Yours faithfully,

Dear Dr Popper,

RE;   David William Mather

I have seen Mrs Mather and been through the Summary with her.

She has no questions to put arising from it.

Mrs Mather will attend the presentation of David's Summary, she will
probably be accompanied by a friend and a member of her family.

I trust this information is of assistance.

Yours Sincerely

 1>eax Sirs,

 He: mnz william w a s a                            (deceased) H0 .56 .
 As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
 Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
 be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
 on the 15th of January 1990.

 I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
 has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
 behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not' to resume the
 Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

 I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
 Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
 he may wish to undertake.

 I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
 or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
 matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
 a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
 on this matter further.

 ■;I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
   if conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
. fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

 Yours faithfully,



\S.L.Popper,
 H.M«Coroner.

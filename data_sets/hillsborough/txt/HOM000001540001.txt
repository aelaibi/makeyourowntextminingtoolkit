tne        young          Lad        got       over         the        fence       to     the       other       side.            The       Policeman

appeared                to     be     in       some         confusion              as     he    c o u l d n ’t      communicate                  with        the

game         got     under        way           and      people           began        tim-bing             over        the         p e r i m e t e r fence

from         b e h i n d the      goal.               At    some          stage            I saw       a    little          boy          c a r r i e d by      a

Police         Officer           and        another person                      and     placed          on       the     grass            directly           in

front        of     us.        It      was          obvious          that         the      boy     appeared                to       be    dying.          The

constable             and      the         person           tried          to     revive          him       with       mouth             to    mouth      and

heart        massage.                 At    first          we       thought           he'd        succeeded.                    A    few       minutes

later        they        carried            him          away       to     the       p l a y e r s ’ tunnel.                    Then          more

supporters               carf-s t nr o u g h t h s                 gate      behind          the       goal       but       more          came        over     tb

fence        and      came       onto           the        grass         and      even       onto          the    pitch             and       collapsed.

       a     Po l i c e came          and       to       ail       intents             and    purposes                it    appeared              to m e       to

be     a     public order              situation.                     1 saw            Karen       Lockett              come         out       o n t o the

She        had     her     arm        in    a       sling          and     she       was     being          assisted                by    Sean

Dawson.             She       disappeared                   I d o n ’t          know       where           she    went.              A    uniformed

Policeman             ran        up    to       the        linesman             and      I thought               he     was         going        to    stop

the        game,         By      now       supporters                were         around          the       goal        and         thus       taking        you

attention             away        from          the        game.           The       linesman              ran     up      to       the       halfway          iir

the      bouy        of       her    sister             who       was     being        assisted             by    others             and      he r

father          who       was       there          irrate          and      very       distressed.

Russell          gave          her       mouth          to     mouth        and      I gave          her        heart          massage.,

At      one     stage          the       father          got       very       irrate         and          panic       set       in,       well       in.

Another          man          came       up        who I u n d e r s t a n d              was    a    medic        of          some sort,              I

d o n ’t      know        his       name           b u t he        was      40-43         yrs,       with       grey           hair and         slightly

built         with        a    grey       jacket*                 The    girl        we     were          trying          to    revive          was        14-

15,      brown          hair        (long),             white         tee     shirt,         blue          jeans,          no     bra .         We     spent

some       time       trying             to    revive             her    and      an      ambulance              came          from       behind           the

West       Stand          goal.           As       it    did       approach            it    was      very        slow,           hindered             by

the      bodies           and       the       confusion               and     chaos,             I think          it       ran       over       the        legs

of      some     csad          people.              It       pulled         past       us    and          I believe             that         they      put

the      other        girl          in.        The       father          of     the       girls       was        snouting               for     us     zq

father          went          with       the       ambulance.

We      got     ho l_cl of          an    advertisement                     board,          put           the    girl          o n it     and        r a n to

the      far     corner,             towards                 the    gymnasium               area.          When        we       g ot t h e r e ,       there

were       no    ambulances.                        W e p ut        her      downand            continued             trying            to    revive

Sometime             later,          a medic             came       with        an     oxygen         cylinder                 and    ventilator.

                  We     walked       past         the     South          Stand,       a    driver          of    a    Rolls       Royce           asked       us     if

                  minutes          there     whilst           the         crowd       thinned         util       a little,

                  We    then    walked           out       the    m a m      gates,          turned          right        and      walked          through

                  the    park       towards         Hillsborough                  town       centre.             While        we       were       going

                  through       the        park     we      sa,       s    little          trouble       between           the     Nottingham                  and

                  Liverpool          supporters.                  1 think            Notts       fans       had       picked       a fight           with        a

                  couole       of   Liverpool              la d s .        We    made       our       way    back        to     the         car,    got    in

                 the     vehicle         ard       drove         to    Lincoln         Hospital             at    about        7,20          pm    -1?30),

                 My     observations               in    hindsight              are    that       I    c o u l d n ’t      see     why        one    supporter

                 had     to   assist        in      the       attempted              recovery          of    injured           people.

                 For     my   mind,        too      many         policemen            stood       about          and     let     supporters               try        to

                 recover        people         and       administer              mouth       to    mouth          and     heart         massage           when

                 really       it    is     policemen             who       are       trained       to       do    this.

MY RECOLLECTION OF HILLSBOROUGH



I arrived at the ground at two thirty to find thousands of people.
So we headed for Turnstile ’C' because we could not see any for 'B’.


After joining the gpowd we found ourselves getting crushed and
police horses adding to the panifc.


On getting near the turnstiles at approximately 2.55 pm the blue
gate to our left was opened. We were then just' tarried along with
'the fcrowd, our feet not touching the ground.   Onfce through the gate,
instead of going through the tunnel ahead, we turned right because
we tane last year and knew it would be packed in the middle.      Thats
why we are alive today.


In my opinion t;he policeman was right to open the gate because of
the fcrush outside.  But onte the gate was opened people should
have been directed left or right and the middle blocked off as it
was last year. This time there was no one to direct the* people, so
they just went straight ahead.


I think the whole thing was badly organised as people were just
hearded in like eattle. They had no %hoifce.


This is one day I will never forget, the things I saw will be with
me forever. I hope this will be of so-ne help.

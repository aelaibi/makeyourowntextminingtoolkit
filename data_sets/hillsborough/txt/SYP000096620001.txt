                    SUBJECT:    ARRESTS O N SATURDAY 15 APRIL 1989 FA CUP SEMI FINAL- NOTTINGHAM
                        FOREST v LIVERPOOL




                          With reference to the above I have to report as follows:

                          Arrests in and around the Hillsborough Ground in connection with the
                          above garne totalled 44.  Of these, 10 were charged, bailed to court and
                          released.   The delay in charging prisoners 10, 11, and 12 at F Division
                          was due to the fact we were unable to verify them until these times.
                          Attached is a sheet showing full details of all prisoners, material
                          times and their disposal.

                          In addition there is a further list attached showing a further 14
                          arrests in D Division during the build-up to the kick off time and who
                          in fact never got further than the Midland Station and     City Centre,
                          with the exception of tvra who were arrested later. These being a Notts
                          Forest fan at 17-28 in Pond Street, for s4 Public Order Act and a
                          Liverpool fan at 18.55 at the Midland Station for being drunk and
                          disorderly.

                          The total arrests therefore in connection with football supporters for
                          the above date is 58.   I have checked with the other Divisions of the
                          South Yorkshire Police, A, B, C and E and there were no arrests in
                          connection with the subject of this report.

                          Of the 58 prisoners, 24 were charged and bailed to court, 24 were
                          verbally cautioned and 10 were ejected from the ground.     One of the
                          prisoners from D Division,                   |has already been dealt
                          with.  He was remanded in custody after his arrest and appeared before
                          Sheffield Magistrates Court on 17 April 1989 charged with s4 Public
                          Order Act and offensive weapon.   He was fined £200.00 on each charge
                          with £15-00 costs.

                          I would at this point like to' point out that the adverse publicity in
                          the national press in respect of prisoners appearing at Sheffield
                          Magistrates Court on Tuesday 25 April 1989, were in no way connected
                          with prisoners dealt with at either FI or F2 on the 15 April 1989, but
                          were in fact prisoners from D Division who never got as far as the
                          ground or its proximity.

                          I submit this report, together with the attached lists of prisoners and
                          their details for your information.

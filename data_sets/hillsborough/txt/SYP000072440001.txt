                                     We    set           out      from        Wal l a s ey           at    about       10.30am              <1030)            and    eri r o u t e    to

                                     Sheffield                 we       stopped            off       at   Rottherham                   t o go      to     a    pub     there.         I think

causing          us       to    move       over          into       the       other        lanes.

We    eventually                arrived             in    Sheffield                at    about        2.3Qpm          (143Q)       and       as    f ar

as    I    can       remember             we    parked             the       car    opposite           a    block       of     flats

somewhere             off       Wood       Rd.           It    was       a    good       two        miles       away.        From       where          we

parked          the       car    we       got       into       a    taxi       and       it     took       us    down     to      the    ground.

I    c a n ’t s a y        that       I saw          any       Police          giving           directions             other       than       I saw

Police          cars       going          past.

Whilst          getting          to       the       ground,            I d i d n ’t        notice          anyone       else       havipjg         a

drink          its    taken          that       fans          do    drink          from       cars     anyway.

Also       after          we    had       parked          the        car      and       getting        to       the    group'd,         I d i d n ’t

witness          any       disorder,                fighting             or    drunkeness.

We    eventually                arrived             at    the        entrance            to     the    grouryS a t           about       2.45pm

C l 44-5) ■          When       we    got       there,             there       were        no       orderly       queues          just       a mass

of    people          who       were       pushing             to     get      into        the       ground.           From       getting

outside          the       entrance             and       getting             to    the       turnstiles,              I d i d n ’t h a v e            too

much       a    problem              but       I d i d ’nt           expect         to     find       this       big    crowd       of       people

outside          the       turnstiles.

I would          normally             have          expected             to    find        queues          to    get    in,       not    a    free

for       all    as       it    was.           I also          expected             to     find       Police          Officers          to    stop          ui

outside          the       ground          looking             and/checking                   for     tickets.            That      d i d n ’t

happen          this       year       as       did       1 a*>r y e a r        when       we        were    there.           Last       year       we

were       stopped             somewhere             by       the     bridge.

When       I did          reach       the       turnstiles                   I was       Jrfy t h e    barrier          towards          the       side

of    the       turnstiles                by    the       River          Don,/when              a    Police       Officer          on    a    horse

was       telling          us    Imere          was       more        t u r jnst lies           a r o u n d the        side.        This          would

have       where          gate       C.        As    he       told       us    this        I ducked             under    the       barrier             and

walked          round,          I had          already             ripped          my    t i ck e t o f f        ready       to    hand       in at

expected             to    find       more          t u r n s t i 1e s .

When       I got          round       I saw          that          i n s t e a d ^ of     the        turnstiles           I found            a n open

           The        only          Police          I saw          outside          the       turnstiles                was        the         one    on     the       horse,

           1' d i d n ’t            see       any    Stewards                outside          the       ground.

           As     I said             I walked             through             the       gate^^jt              I d i d n ’t w i t n e s s                  the        gate

           opened.

           As     I said             earlier             I walked             through          the       open          gate        and         at    no    time

           was        I approached                   by       anyone          for       my    ticket,             which          I still             have        in m y

           possession,                    a    photocopy                of    which          I now       produce              as      an       exhibit           marked,

                  1   .
           As     I got             through          the          gate       I had       got       my    ticket             out,       which          had        B    side       on

           it     and          I was          looking             for    the       sign.           I    could          see       the       B    above        the       tunnel

           and        I went             up    to    it       and       about       halfway             between             the       turnstiles                 and       the

           tunnel              there          was    a Policeman                   standing             about.

           As     I was             walking          towards             the       tunnel,             the    Policeman                pointed             the        way

           towards                 the    t u n n el      and       we       followed          the       rest          of     the      crowd          down           the

           tunnel.                  We    had       fairly          free       passage             down       the       tunnel,                until       we        got

           about              10    feet       away       from          the    end,          although             the   y &      were          others        following

           me     down,             because          someone             reached             over       and       panched             me       hat.




s?
           I would                 describe          the          Policeman             outside          tJj/fe       tunnel          as       a man       in        his    late

           4 0 ’ s,           tall,       wearing             a    flat       cap       with       wfrote         braid          on    the          peak.,       I thought

           he     must             have       been       an       Inspector             oT'-'somethi n g .                  Apart          from       him        there       was

           no     other             Police          or    Stewards             at       the    entrance                to     the      tunnel.

           Once           inside          the       ground          I d i d n ’t w i t n e s ^ a n y                   disorder,                or    consumption

           of     alcohol                inside          the       ground,          it       w^s       just       a    big       rush          to    get     a       spec.

           When           I    reached             the    end       of       the    ’U d m n e l       I wormed             my     way         through           the       crowd

           to     get          to    my       spec       behind          Tstwr g o a l .           The       pen      was        full          but    I w o u l d n ’t

           say        o v e r c r o w d e d , it              was       no    more       than          I would          expect             on       the    Hop       at

           An fi e 1d .

which       I    nowp r o d u c e        as        an    exhibit                marked,                  E.        Also    marked             8     the

position             I was        in     after           the       incident.

While       I    was        in P e n      3       I d i d n ’t ^ s e e a              barrier           break       in    this       pen          and     as

far    as        I was          aware, I w a s / n o t             n e a r it         when        it    did        break.

As    the       game       w a s /k i c k           off       I felt             this       big        push    forward          from           behind

I felt          myself          bVflig        pushed          forward                and    I went           about       two    steps             forward

and    I was          then        pinned           against             a    crush          b a r r i e r . My       leg     was      pinned

against          one       of     the    struts              on    the          side       and     I    c o u l d n ’t m o v e       it.

After       the       push        there           was    girl          on       my    right        hand       s i d e,    who       was        turning

blue,       she       h a d ,curley               blonde          hair          and    was       in     her    3 Q ’s .        She       was        being

crushed          against           the        barrier             against             her       stomach,           so    I put       my       arm

arround          her       to     help        pull       her       up.           Then       this        bloke,          I think          her

boyfriend             came        over        the       top       of       me    and       tried        to    hold       her    up,       as        he    did

this     he      had       pushed        me        down.           The          crush       was        then    getting          even           worse,

because          my    face        was        being          pushed             into       the     back       of    the     feller             in    front,

rny g l a s s e s      were        getting              pushed             o ff .

Also    the          girl       was     being           pushed             further              f o r w a r d as w e l l.           As    far       as     I

can    remember              I was       held           in    that          position             for     about          fifteen

minutes.             I was        tapping           the       chap          in       front       of    me     on    the     shoulder                and

screaming             to     him       that        I c o u l d n ’t             breathe.

I    remember          that        tw i ce         during          that          time       I felt           myself       f a i nt i ng           and

rny e y e s      closing           then           opening.                 I can       remember              the    pain       my    leg          was

causing          me    and        that        I    c o u l d n ’t m o v e             it    at     all.        As       I recall          I. f e l t

myself          about        to    pass           out    for       the          third       time       when        the    pressure                from

behind          was    relieved.                   During          this          time       I    c o u l d n ’t     breathe          properly              it

was    just          gasps        of    breath,              there          w a s n ’t          room      to b r e a t h e      properly.

It    was       at    this        time      that         I    received                the       injury         to m y    rig>n.          leg      which

was      pinned          against             the       barrier.              I can          remejyriSer           that        thepain          was

there,         and       when       I    passed          out       it       was       gon^T

I believe             the      surge          gf       the    crowd          was/caused                when       the       players           came       onto

the      pitch        a nd     there          was       the       r o a ^ f           the     crowd,            and     everyone           rushed         in

to    see      the       game.

When       the      pressure             had       been       relieved                there       was       a    chap       shouting           to    make

a    gangway          from         the       front       to       the       back.           So    we    made          the     gap    and       these

two      fellas          came       up       carrying             another             fan.        As    they          got     to    me     they

tripped          up      the       steps          in    front       of       me       so    I grabbed             hold        of    his       shoulders

and      held       his       head       and       carried          him       out          along       the       tunnel.            We     laid      him

down       outside            the       yard       area       and       he    was          still       breathing,              so    we       turned

him      on    his       side.           The       lad       I helped             had       close       cropped             fair     h a i r , was         in

his      late       20*s .          He       was       wearing          a    coat          w h i ch,    I took           off       and     placed

under         his     head.         I    c a n ’t        remember             anything                else       about        him.

After         the     coat         was       under       his       head,          a    policewoman                came        over       and     asked

if    he      was     alright,               I said          he    was       and       she       went       away.           1 then         went      off

as    well.

As    I got         up       I saw       a        hap    l a 1d      out      on       the       ground           with        ab r o w n      leather

coat       over       his      h e a d , who            was       obviously                dead■

Also       1 saw         a    Policewoman                giving             the       kiss       of    life       to someone,                 and    a

P o 1 i certian w a s          pushing             against          his       chest.

I then         turned          to       go    backdown             the       tunnel           and      I saw          a Pol i c e m a n        standing

there         and     there         was       this       old       fella          who       was       hitting           the    policeman             on

the      chest,          saying          he       couldn't          find          his       young       kid.            The    Policeman             was

crying         his       eyes       out,          so    I went          over          to    the       fella       and       pushed         him      into

the      tunnel.             I said          to    him       that       w e ’d go           and       look       f or    his       s o , so         we

went       back       down         the       tunnel          into       pen       4    to     look      for       him,        I just          stoa d

about         there          and    could          see       the    barrier                that       had       crushed        in    the       other

So    after       that       I       could       see       what       was    going       on       y K e    pitch          and       I heard          a

loudspeaker             announcement                   saying          clear       thg/pitch,                  I carried              on     standing

there       until       I heard             an       announcement             Seeing          the         game       had       been        abandoned

so    I t h e n .l e f t         the       ground,          that       waj/about             4pm          (1600)          to    4 . 3 0 pm        (1630) .

During       the       day       I d i d n ’t w i t n e s s            anything          that         I    consider             to      be    a

criminal          offence,                other       than       letting       so       many        people           into       that         stand.

I believe          that          factors             contributing             towards             the      d e a t h s was            the

allocation             of    the          tickets.              Liverpool          should           have        had       the       Spion         Kop

end.        The    A.A.          or       RAC    said       the       cars    could          have         been       re-routed               b ut    the

Police       and       F .A . s a i d           no.

Also       the    mad       scramble             outside           caus'd       them         as     well.            There          was      no

control          outside             the    ground,             n g / s t e w a r d s at      all,         no    one          was     checking            to

see    if    you       had       a       ticket,       wfuch          they    had       done         last       year.

After       the    game          had       been       stopped,           there      were          Police         who          were      helping           as

I said       the       Policewoman,                   but       others       were       standing               about          doim^nothing.

It    seemed       as       if       they       weren't          trained,          but       I be 1 i e \ g          PjaJ^fce a r e           trained

in    first       aid       so       I    can't       say       why    they    weren't              helping.

All    I    can    say       is          really       two       main     things,         I     can't           see       the        l o g i c in     the

allocation             of    the          tickets          and     the      kick    off        Police            Control and

directions             in    and          outside          the     ground.

If    this       had    have             been    done       there        wouldn't            have         been       a    mad        r u s h to      get

in    and    no    disaster                would       have        happened.                                                                              S '




I would          like       to       add    that       I c a n ’t s e e        the       logic            in    the       Police           thinking

that       there       was       going          to    be    a    pitch       invasion.                When       people             were      being

crushed          against             the    fence          at    the     front      the       Police            were          just      walking           up

and    down       taking             no    notice,          they       could       have       looked            up       to    see     what         was

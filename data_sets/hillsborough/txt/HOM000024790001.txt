      Dear Sir,

      FA CHALLENGE CUP FINAL - ALLOCATION OF TICKETS                                      1>H

      In 1988 my department began to receive complaints from football supporters who were
      unable to purchase tickets for the Cup Final at face value, although plenty of tickets
      appeared to be available at inflated prices.

      As a result of these complaints I started an investigation which has looked at the
      Football Association's ticket allocation policy for the 1988 and 1989 Cup Finals. The
      results of these investigations are contained in two reports which have been considered
      by the City Council.

      On 8 th November, 1989 the City Council approved the following resolution viz:

                    - a copy of the 1988 and 1989 reports into the allocation
                    of the F.A. Cup Final tickets be submitted to Lord Justice Taylor
                    as evidence for Phase II of the Inquiry into the Hillsborough
                    Stadium Disaster.

...   I accordingly now formally submit copies of both reports although you may have already
      received copies from other sources as they have been widely circulated.


      Yours faithfully,



               r KA


      Chief Trading Standards Officer

    F.A. Cup Final Tickets
    (TS/33/88)




                         Report of the Chief Trading Standards Officer


    1.   On 13th June 1988 a preliminary report on F.A. Cup Final tickets was presented to
          the Trading Standards Sub-Committee of the Trading and Licensing Committee. The
          Chief Trading Standards Officer's final report on the subject is now attached for
          the information of members. (Appendix AA).

    2. In accordance with the instructions of the Trading Standards Sub-Committee the
        report has been submitted to the Director General of Fair Trading, the Minister
        of Sport and all Liverpool MPs calling for their support in requesting the Football
        Association to amend its F.A. Cup Final ticket allocation policy.

    3. The report represents the most detailed investigation carried out into this subject
•       and reveals widespread abuse of the F.A.te rules. The Chief Trading Standards Officer
        believes that the present allocation policy seriously affects both the economic and
        safety interests of supporters.

    4. Members are invited to note the report and the Chief Trading Standards Officer
        will advise the Sub-Committee of the responses in due course.

                       THE ALLOCATION OF F.A. CUP FINAL TICKETS

                    Report by the Chief Trading Standards Officer


INTRODUCTION
For a number of years there has been some concern on Merseyside that the policy of the
Football Association in respect of its allocation of tickets for the F.A. Cup Final
leads to a shortage amongst the supporters of one or both competing teams. Fans who
cannot obtain tickets at face value from the F.A.'s allocation to their club are often
then forced to pay inflated prices to ticket agencies and touts in order to attend t ^
final.

Prior to the 198S F.A. Cup Final between Liverpool and Wimbledon trading standards
ofxicers at Liverpool City Council received a number of complaints related to ticket
shortages and excessive mark-ups on tickets.  Against this background the Council's"
Trading Standards Department commenced an investigation in an attempt to gauge the
extent of the problem and its effect on supporters.  This report details the results
of that investigation.

  ■A. ALLOCATION POLICY
It is understood that the approximate allocation of tickets for the F.A. Cup Final is
as follows:-

            Finalists                                  50,000 (
            County Football Associations               27,000
            Overseas Associations                         500
            First Division Clubs                        5,000
            Second Division Clubs                       5,000 .
            Third Division Clubs                        1,400
            Fourth Division Clubs                       1,400
            Non-League Clubs                            1,500
            F.A. Council Representatives                1,250
            Football Association                        2,000
            i.'e~b ley S ta diu~                          50C

Tr.ese figures are based on a nominal ground capacity of about 95,000 for v.'embley Stadiu

It can be seer, that approximately 46,000 tickets are allocated to clubs, associations
and individuals not directly connected with the two finalists.    It should also be notec
that there is an equal allocation to the clubs involved in the final and no account i«
taker, o: tr.e average number of regular supporters following the respective tea-.s.

Tne problem of ticket shortages amongst supporters was highlighted this year because of
tr.e considerable difference in the average home league attendances of the two finalists
Liverpool F.C. attracted an average of about 40,000 fans throughout the season, whereas
Wimbledon F.C.'s average home gate was less than 8,000. The current policy of allocati
approximately 25,000 tickets to each club left a potential shortfall of at least 15.00C
tickets in Liverpool and a possible surplus of up to 17,000 tickets at l.’imbledon.

It may be felt that a fairer allocation system would take some account of the numbers c
regular supporters following the respective teams throughout the season. From observati
at Wembley this year it was apparent that considerably more Liverpool fans attended the
final than the 25,000 tickets allocated to the club.   It is difficult to estimate~the
exact number of Liverpool supporters inside the ground but a reasonable estimate would
between 30,000 and 40,000.  This would mean that between 5,000 and 15,000 Liverpool
supporters obtained tickets originally allocated elsewhere.

EVIDENCE GATHERING
In order to establish some estimate of the numbers and sources of tickets sold above f
value trading standards officers from Liverpool City Council set up a local telephone
information line to receive evidence from supporters.  In addition, a team of 16 office
                                           - 2 -

travelled to Wembley on the day of the final to question a sample of fans outside the
ground.  It is believed that this was the first time such information has been sought
from supporters at Wembley Stadium.

INFORMATION RECEIVED
The information received by trading standards officers at Wembley Stadium, and via the
telephone information line in Liverpool is detailed at Appendix A. It may be summary
as follows:-

     a)   Number of allegations of overpriced tickets received         -   555
     b)   Allegations by persons willing to give names and addresses   - 313
     c)   Highest price for £8 standing ticket                    *    _ rgr,
     a)   Highest price for £30 seat               ,                   -£165
     e)   Average price of an £6 ticket                                _ £35

It is estimated that officers at Wembley Stadium, were able to make a very-general enau
of somewhere between 5% ana 10% of fans, or 5,000 to 10,000 people.

STAMPS ON TICKETS
It is understood that Football Association rules require all Football Clubs and County
Football Associations to place their stamps on F.A. Cup Final tickets allocated tr> the
Appendix B to this report lists details of those clubs and associations whose ste^fc*
appeared on tickets for which supporters indicated to trading standards officers that
they had paid prices over face value.   It may be summarised as follows

     a)   Number of Football Club stamps on allegedly overpriced tickets           - 38
     b)   Number of County Association stamps on allegedly overpriced tickets      - 15
     c)   Approximate number of allegedly overpriced tickets bearing NO STAMP      - 300
     d)   Number of tickets in current possession of trading standards officers    - 110

It was notec that of the 300 tickets observed bearing no stamp to indicate their
source, mar.y were tc sections of the stadium which may have been allocated to
Wimbledon supporters. It is hoped that the Football Association will check the serial
numbers of all tickets to indicate their initial allocation source in order that it
might be established if any clubs or associations are breaking F.A. rules. The Footba
Association will alsc be requested tc establish how many unstamped tickets identified
as being sold on the unofficial market trace back to original allocations to the F.A.
themselves, F.A. Council Representatives, Overseas Associations and Wembley Stadium.

In those cases where a ticket bears an origin stamp the Chief Trading Standards Office
has written direct to the club or association concerned requesting that they .establish
tne person to whom tne relevant ticket was originally supplied and advise him if thev
can indicate that the ticket was, in fact, correctly used. It is hoped that ail clubs
and associations involved will cooperate and identify any individuals found tc have be
breaking F.A. rules or profiteering at the expense of genuine football supporters.

FORGERIES
A further problem at the Cup Final this year was that of forged tickets. Many fans
approached both trading standards officers and police officers to check the validity
of tickets they had purchased from unofficial sources. Many examples of forgeries
were seen. All forgeries appeared to be printed with the same gate and entrance numbe
which enabled police and Wembley officials to deny fans with forged tickets access tc
the ground. It was apparent that the shortage of tickets for the game provided a
potentially lucrative market, particularly amongst Liverpool fans, for the forgers.
Mar.yr fans had paid inflated prices for forgeries.

SAFETY IMPLICATIONS
Trading standards officers at Wembley observed very large numbers of Liverpool support
with tickets for the end of the stadium allocated to Wimbledon fans. It is likely the
many of these tickets will have been allocated originally to Wimbledon Football Club a
therefore will have reached Liverpool supporters through unofficial sources. To the
credit of both sets of fans there was no trouble inside the stadium but this situatior
                                                                                 cont
                                                  - 3 -

      did lead to a breakdown of segregation procedures which could have had very serious
      consequences.

14.   Trading standards officers did observe a certain amount of violence outside the stadiv.
      At least four ticket touts were seen to receive severe beatings.  There were also two
      attempts by supporters without tickets to storm the gates. This led to some violent
      scenes and serious confrontation with the police as they tried to repel the charges an
      restore order.  This violence certainly represented a serious risk to the general safe
      of fans queueing or walking around outside the stadium. Virtually all the violence
      observed outside the stadium was ticket-related. Much of this violence may have be-n
      avoided if more tickets had been allocated to supporters of the participating teams7

       LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS
15.    Under Section 2 of the Fair Trading Act 1973 the Director General of Fair Trading has
       a duty to keep under review any commercial activity which could involve practices whic:
       adversely affect the economic or safety interests of consumers. A copy of this report
       will be passec to the Director General of Fair Trading with a reauest that he exar-’ne
       the Football Association’s current ticket allocation policy which he may deem to be in
       breach of the Fair Trading Act in which case he could ask for that policy to be amende
       The Chief Tracing Standards Officer believes that this report helps identify that poli
  _ a s having a very serious adverse effect on both the economic and safety inte-ests of
  ^ r n a n y football supporters. Should the Football Association be requested to amend <ts
       policy by the Director General and fail to do so, it could be forced by Government 0-d*
       to make appropriate changes.

16,   It is not illegal under UK law to sell tickets for sporting events, pop concerts
      theatres etc at prices above fact value.  It is illegal in certain other countries and
      certain cities in the United States.  In New York, for example, a licence is needed to
      resell tickets as a business activity. All tickets must be printed with their price
      and a maximum premium (about 2 dollars) at which they can be resold.  It is an offence
      to sell at more than the price plus the premium. Regulations prohibit licensed resell-
      of tickets from buying tickets other than from the event promotors or other licensed
      resellers ana records must be kept showing details of all transactions. There is no
      doubt that similar regulations introduced in this country would severely curtail the
      activities o* ticket touts at a variety of events and lead to many mere tickets b ^ n e
      available tc fans at, or close tc, face value.

      SUre-'-ARY
      a)   Almost half the tickets for the F.A. Cup Final are not allocated to the club*
           competing in the final;

      b)   There is ar. equal split of tickets between the finalists and no accour*        t-’
                                                                                             -'c'-
           oi average home league attendances;

      c)   The present allocation policy can lead to a shortage of tickets amongst the
           supporters of one or both finalists;

      a)   The F.A.'s allocation policy can result in many supporters having to pav inflated
           prices for tickets;

      e)   The safety' of supporters can be put at risk by the present ticket allocation police
           Virtually all the violence outside Wembley Stadium this year was ticket related anc
           segregation arrangements inside the ground failed due to large numbers of tickets
           at the Wimbledon end coming into the possession of Liverpool fans;

      f)   Ticket shortages amongst supporters can provide a potentially lucrative market for
           ticket forgers and many examples of forgeries were seen at this year's final;

      g)   Liverpool trading standards officers received allegations from 313 people who state
           they had bought their tickets above face value and were prepared to give names and
           addresses to the officers.  A further 247 general allegations of over-priced ticket
           were also received;

                                                                                      c o n t :-
                                                      -   A   -




         h)   Officers have observed tickets in the possession of Liverpool supporters bearinc
              the stamps of 56 Football League Clubs and County Associations to whom they were
              originally allocated by the F.A.  Approximately 300 tickets bearing no stamn^ we'
              observed in the possession of Liverpool fans;

         i)   The Chief Trading Standards Officer believes that the F.A.'s present ticket aUoc-
               tion policy falls within the remit of Section 2 of the Fair Trading Act 1973 ^nd °
              could be held to be operating against the economic and safety interests of consume

         j)   The sale of tickets at prices above face value is not illegal under current UK law
              Some countries, however, do have legal restrictions on ticket touting.

18.      Despite all the considerable difficulties in obtaining information from the large crow
          at Wembley Stadium, the number of reports of overpriced tickets and the wide variety o
          ticket sources indicated from club and association stamps leads to the conclusion that
          there is widespread abuse of Football Association rules. The present system of a'lnrs
          tion leads to large numbers of tickets ending up in the possession of persons tn C - w *
          they were not originally allocated.                       "           5------- -----—— —

     ‘       saxe    F.A. Cup Final tickets above face value is now almost institutionalised.
         Examination of the large numbers of newspaper advertisements offering tickets shoes'ho
         many tickets are being passed on by individuals or organisations to whom they halBbee:
         officially allocated.  It is clear that some people are profiteering at the exper^^ of
         the football supporters who cannot get a ticket from the allocation to their club.

          RECOMMENDATIONS
20.      In order to reduce the unofficial market in Cup-Final ticket sales and thereby help
          protect the economic and safety interests of supporters, the Football Association are
          requested, upon receipt of this report, to consider:-

               a)   a review of the ticket allocation policy with a view to providing more
                    tickets for the supporters of the two clubs participating in the final;

               b)   taking into account the average home league attendances of the final­
                    ists when apportioning tickets between them;

               c)   requiring all tickets to be stamped with details of the clubs,
                    associations or organisations to which they are allocated, without
                    excep tior,;

               a)   with the aid of ticket serial numbers provided in this report,
                    conducting an enquiry to establish how the tickets came into tr.e
                    possession of individuals apparently unconnected with the sources
                    to which they were originally allocated:

               e)   taking disciplinary action against those found to be in breach of
                    F.A. rules;

               f)   publishing their own report on the results of investigations and
                    enquiries made as a result of this report.

         OTHER ACTION
21       This report will also be submitted to the Director General of Fair Trading under ,Sect
         2 of the Fair Trading Act 197j, to the Minister of Sport and to all Liverpool Members <
         Parliament.

The Allocation of FA Cup Final Tickets
(TS/33/89)


                        Report of the Chief Trading Standards Officer
                         (Officer Contact - Peter Mawdsley 225 3322)

Introduction
 1. In May 1988 trading standards officers from Liverpool City Council carried out
     the first in-depth investigation into the allocation of tickets by the Football
     Association for the FA* Cup Final. In respect of the 1388 Final between Liverpool
     and Wimbledon evidence of the extent of ticket touting was gathered by means of
     a telephone hot-line for fans who had paid inflated ticket prices and by interview­
     ing fans arriving at Wembley Stadium on Cup Final day. The results of the
     investigation were reported to the City Council in August 1988.

 2.   The FA's allocation system in 1988 was approximately as follows:-

                    Finalists                       50,000 (25,000 each)
                    County Football Associations    27,000
                    Overseas Association               500
                    First Division Clubs             5,000
                    Second Division Clubs            5,000
                    Third Division Clubs             1,400
                    Fourth Division Clubs            1,400
                    Non-League Clubs                 1,500
                    FA Council Representatives       1,250
                    Football Association             2,000
                    Wembley Stadium                    500

      It will be noted that almost half the available tickets were allocated to clubs,
      associations and individuals not connected with the two finalists. Additionalljr
      no account was taken in the allocation of the average number of regular supporters
      following each finalist.

3.    The evidence gathered in the 1988 investigationrevealed:-

      a)   450 specific allegations of overpriced tickets from the hot-line
           and from enquiries made of approximately 5% - 10% of fans at the
           Final. Details of all ticket serial numbers were passed to the
           FA;

      b)   the stamps of 55 Football Clubs or County Football Associations
           appeared on approximately 150 of the overpriced tickets, additionally
           about 300 carried no stamp to identify the source to which they
           were originally allocated by the FA.;

      c)   many examples of forged tickets were evident at the 1988 Cup Final;

      d)   large numbers of Liverpool supporters had been able to purchase
           tickets from touts for the V.’ir.’.bledon end of the stadium leading to
           a breakdown in segregation arrangements;

      e)   a degree of ticket-related violence was observed outside the
           stadium with at least four ticket touts being attacked and two
           attempts being made by ticketless supporters to storm the gates.

                                                                                     cont:-
                                         -   2   -




4.   The Chief Trading Standards Officer's report concluded that the FA's
     allocation policy for tickets for the Cup Final could lead to:-

     a)   large supplies of tickets going to persons not wishing to
          attend the Cup Final;

     b)   ticket shortages amongst the supporters of one or both
          finalists;

     c)   supporters having to pay inflated prices for tickets from
          unofficial sources;

     d)   a potentially lucrative market for ticket forgers;

     e)   the safety of supporters being put at risk due to failures
           in segregation arrangements and large numbers of fans
           travelling without tickets.

5.   Liverpool City Council subsequently supported all the recommendations
     included in the report which were as follows

     a)   the FA review their ticket allocation policy and provide more
           tickets for the two clubs in the Cup Final;

     b)   the FA take into account average home league attendances when
          apportioning tickets between the finalists;

     c)   the FA require all tickets to be stamped with the identity of
          the organisations to which they are allocated;

     d)   the FA conduct an enquiry with the aid of the serial numbers
          provided in the report to establish how those tickets came to
          be sold at inflated prices;

     e)   the FA take disciplinary action against those found to be in
          breach of FA rules;

     f)   the FA publish their own report on the results of their
          investigations.

S.   A copy of the report was submitted to the Director General of Fair Trading
     under Section 2 of the Fair Trading Act 1973 alleging that the FA's ticket
     allocation policy acted against the economic and safety interests of consumers
     and was, therefore, subject to review by the Director General in accordance
     with his duty under that legislation. Copies of the report were also
     submitted to the Minister of Sport, all Liverpool MPs, Liverpool and Everton
     Football clubs.

Responses to the 1988 Report
7. The report was sent to the FA on 25th July, 1988. The FA decided to set up a
    special sub-committee of their Matches and Grounds Committee to consider in
    detail the evidence provided by Liverpool City Council's report. To date
    (September 1989) no response has been received other than to acknowledge
    receipt, to indicate that their enquiries are continuing and to indicate that
    they will be producing a report into their investigations of Liverpool City
    Council's allegations which they may or may not make public.

8. It is understood that the FA have provided an interim report to the Director
    General of Fair Trading indicating the action they have taken against clubs,
    associations, organisations and individuals found as a result of Liverpool

                                                                          cont:-
                                           - 3 -

      City Council's report to have breached FA rules as regards tickets allocated
      to them. The FA are understood to have issued penalties ranging from life
      bans to percentage reductions in tickets for certain periods of time. It is
      believed that the Director General of Fair Trading has reserved his position
      and is awaiting a final report from the FA before deciding what action to
      take under the Fair Trading Act.

9.    Both Liverpool and Everton Football Clubs have indicated that it is their
      policy to press the FA for an improved allocation system giving a greater
      number of tickets to the two clubs participating in the FA Cup Final. Both
      clubs have reiterated this policy after consideration of Liverpool City Council1s
      report. Both clubs have indicated that they would be willing to forgo the
      bulk of "heir allocation: of tickets .for all7Cup.?.Finals,in.'..which they were not
      participants in order that sufficient numbers of tickets would be available
      to the supporters of those teams involved in the Final.

The 1989 Cup Final
10. Pending the final outcome of the investigation carried out by the special
     sub-committee of their Matches and Grounds Committee, the FA decided to
     allocate tickets for the 1989 Cup Final on the same basis as for 1988.
     However, in the light of the Hillsborough tragedy a decision was subsequently
     taken to offer the bulk of the tickets to Liverpool and Everton Football
     Clubs who each took 35,000 tickets. The remaining 10,000 - 15,000 tickets
     were distributed by the FA on an ad hoc basis in view of the shortage of time
     available and no set allocation ratio was worked out for the remaining clubs,
     associations and organisations.

11.   Since the 1988 Final considerable alterations have been taking place at
       Wembley Stadium with more and more standing areas being converted into seated
       accommodation. This reduced the capacity of the stadium at the 1989 Final
       to approximately 85,000. Had the FA decided to continue with their alloca­
       tion policy of previous years this would have meant a drop from about 25,000
       to just over 2 2 , 0 0 0 in the number of tickets allocated to each finalist, thus
       further exacerbating the ticket shortage problems and further fuelling the
       activities of the ticket touts.

12.   In the light of the decision to distribute the bulk of the tickets to the two
       clubs involved, trading standards officers decided to conduct a further
       investigation into the activities of ticket touts to establish if the improved
       allocation system did indeed reduce ticket touting and its associated problems
       as forecast in Liverpool City Council's 1988 Cup Final report. Once again a
       special hot-line was put into operation for people to report details of tickets
       bought from touts and a squad of 20 investigators from the Trading Standards
       Department attended Uembley Stadium on Cup Final day to take similar details
       from supporters arriving at the ground. The 1989 operation by trading
       standards officers exactly duplicated that of 1988, thus permitting meaningful
       comparisons to be made on ticket touting between the two years.

The 1989 Evidence
13. Trading standards officers were given details, including serial numbers, of
     75 tickets allegedly purchased at prices above face value. That represents
     a reduction of 83% from the comparative figure (450) in 1988. Thus it will be
     seen that by an increase of 40% in the numbers of tickets allocated to each of
     the finalists an 83% drop in ticket touting was achieved. Appendix A gives
     details of the 75 tickets involved.

14. The highest price   alleged to have been paid for an £8 ticket was £100, the
     lowest price was   £10, with an average of £56. The highest price for an £18
     ticket was £200,   the lowest £25, with an average of £104. Full details
     recorded were as   follows


                                                                                corn;:-
                                          - 4 -

            TICKETS        LOWEST PRICE       HIGHEST PRICE          AVERAGE PRICE
            43   @    £8        £10                £100                   £56
             5   @   £12        £25                 £90                   £65
            17   @   £18        £25                £200                  £104
             5   @   £26        £40                £150                  £101
             3   @   £32        £70                 £85                   £78
             1   @   £75       £130                £130                  £130

15.   Of these 75 tickets none carried any stamp to indicate its origin. Whereas
      both Liverpool and Everton Football clubs were exempted by the FA from stamping
      their names on their ticket allocation due to the numbers of tickets and
      shortage of time involved, it is understood that all other clubs, associations
      or organisations who received tickets had been instructed by the FA to stamp
      them. It would appear, therefore, that FA rules are still being broken by
      some in this regard. It will be recalled that last year over 300 examples of
      unstamped tickets were noted.

16. Enquiries have revealed that 60 (80%) of the 75 tickets which were alleged to
     have been sold at prices above face value came from the 70,000 allocation
     shared between Everton and Liverpool. Information from the clubs is that
     none of these tickets were allocated to staff. Both clubs have cooperated®*
     fully with trading standards officers in their investigations. It is
     inevitable under any allocation system that a small number of fans will
     pass on their tickets and it would appear that some touts obtained supplies
     of tickets in this way. It was noted that of the 75 tickets mentioned the
     majority were bought from touts outside Merseyside by fans living outside
     Merseyside.

17.   Once again this year numerous ticket agencies were able to obtain supplies
      of Cup Final tickets, although the increased allocation to the two finalists
      will have significantly restricted the numbers available to them. Eleven
      ticket agencies were named by supporters as having been the source of their
      tickets. Nine of the eleven agencies were based in London. Also, in contrast
      to the 1988 Cup Final, no evidence of forged tickets came to light during the
      investigation in 1989.

18. Observations by trading standards officers at Wembley Stadium on Cup Final
     day revealed that there were fewer ticket touts operating in the vicinity of
     the ground. It was apparent that several thousand fans had travelled to the
     Final without tickets hoping to be able to purchase one on the day of the
     game. The vast majority were to be disappointed and most dispersed as
     kick-off time approached. There was, however, around kick-off time, a charge
     at a gate by a number of fans which was repelled by the police.

19.   A further problem which was evident at Wembley Stadium this year concerned
       certain tickets having been sold for seats which, due to ground alterations,
       did not exist. Additionally some tickets were sold for seats which turned
       out to have an obscured view, although the tickets were not marked as such.
       Other tickets were sold with an indication that they did have an obscured
       view and yet afforded little or no view at all. These circumstances led to
       some people having to stand throughout the game whilst others missed the
       early part of the game whilst queuing to make their complaint. Trading
       standards officers are currently dealing with a range of complaints and
       attempting to secure redress for the people affected.

Summary and Conclusions
20. a) The 40% increase in the allocation of tickets to the two finalists
         in 1989 led to an 83% drop in ticket touting;

      b)   there was a significant decrease in ticket-related violence at the
           1989 Final;

                                                                         cont:-
                                         - 5 -

      c)   there appeared to be no forged tickets in circulation at the 1989
           Final;

      d)   FA rules regarding the stamping of tickets to identify the club,
           association or organisation to which they were originally allocated
           continue to be broken by some. Although Everton and Liverpool were
           exempted this year, no stamped tickets appeared in the survey.

21.   The FA has indicated that the improved allocation of tickets in 1989 is a
      one-off decision. It is understood that they will not decide on the allocation
      for the 1990 FA Cup Final until next year. The evidence is clear from this
      report that the extent of ticket touting can be controlled through improved
      allocations to the participating teams.

22.   It has become commonplace for large numbers of ticketless fans to travel to
      the Cup Final in the hope of being able to purchase a ticket from a tout on
      the day of the game. This situation is the legacy of previous inadequate
      ticket allocations over many years and the known situation of large numbers of
      tickets being available to touts due to the allocation system placing large
      numbers of tickets with persons who do not wish to attend the Final. The
      improved system this year led to far less tickets being offered outside the
      stadium and a continuation of the 1989 allocation system will lead to a
      reduction in the numbers of fanstravelling without tickets.

23.   Although the segregation of fans   is not a serious problem at an Everton v
      Liverpool Cup Final, a continuation of the improved allocation system would
      lead to smaller numbers of fans being mixed because far less tickets would
      change hands after initial allocation. Large numbers of touted tickets can
      nullify vital ground segregation arrangements.

24.   In 1988 an estimated £250,000 was paid by supporters in enhanced ticket prices
      for the Cup Final. In 1989 the vast majority of genuine supporters of the
      two finalists were able to obtain their tickets at face value thus depriving
      the touts and other greedy people within football of their usual lucrative
      dealings in connection with the FA   Cup Final.

25.   Although the FA were provided with 450 ticket serial numbers for investigation
      in July 1988 they have been slow to respond publicly in announcing the action
      taken against those found to be inbreach of their own rules on FA Cup Final
      tickets. Those who have been punished so farby the FA, and those tempted to
      misuse tickets in the future, would be far more likely to comply with ticket
      rules if they were to be named to the public after being shown to have broken
      the rules.

26.   The clear indication from the comparisons between the 1988 and 1989 FA Cup
      Finals is that an improved allocation of tickets to the participating teams
      can lead to major improvements in terms of the safety of supporters and in
      terms of the economic interests of supporters. Only the ticket touts lose
      out under an improved allocation system. In the past, too many tickets have
      been given to clubs, associations and organisations who would not send
      representatives to the Final, rather tickets would be passed on for profit
      and would usually end up back in the hands of committed supporters but at
      vastly inflated prices.

Recommendations
27. In the light of the evidence gained at FA Cup Finals over the past two years
     the Chief Trading Standards Officer now recommends that:-

      a)   the Football Association be requested to agree to allocate up to
           70,000 tickets to the cup finalists and to take into account average
           home attendances in deciding the ratio of tickets to be allocated;

                                                                        cont:-
                                        - 6 -

     b) the Football Association be requested to investigate all
         allegations of breaches of their rules identified in this
         report;

     c) the Football Association be requested to publish the results
         of their own enquiries into the evidence provided by Liverpool
         City Council's 1988 Cup Final report and publish details of
         those who have received punishments for breaches of FA rules;

     d) the Football Association takes steps to ensure that all Football
         Clubs, Associations, Wembley Stadium, FA Council representatives
         and the Football Association themselves place their stamp on all
         FA Cup Final tickets allocated to them in order that the original
         sources of tickets sold by touts can be readily identified by
         fans;

     e) the Director General of Fair Trading be requested to consider this
         report in addition to the Chief Trading Standards Officer's 1988
         report, and in line with his duty under section 2 of the Fair Trading
         Act, to take steps to ensure that the Football Association's future
         ticket allocation policy for the Cup Final does not act against the
         economic or safety interests of consumers;

     f)   a copy of this report be also submitted to the Minister of Sport and
          all Liverpool MPs.

     g) a copy of the 1988 and 1989 reports into the allocation of FA Cup
         Final tickets be submitted to Lord Justice Taylor as evidence for
         Phase II of the Inquiry into the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster.

hurling            abuse       at      th e       police         and     some        were       stating          a-wish             to    go       back

officers.                At    this         point         we w e r e        still         not       aware       of w h a t          had       happened

and      we    went       down         th e       tunnel.             I went         to    the       left       of     the      divind

railings            and met            a    colleague              f r o m FS,        I told             him    there          were       bodies

outside            the    tunnel            to w h i c h         he    said        there        were       bodies          down          on    the

terrace.             Upon        hearing               t hi s    I went         down       th e      terrace           and      managed             to

get      onto       the       perimeter                tra ck .        At     this        point          I realised             there          h ad

However,            1 looked               to     my    righ t        to w h e r e        an a m b u l a n c e         was      parked             and

saw      officers             pulling             bodies         out     of     the       terrace          through             the       gate.           Upon

seeing         th is      I went            to a s s i s t         and with           other          officers             pulled          out       3 to

4    bodies.             1 checked                the     bodies         for       signs        of       life    but       it w a s           obvious

they      were       dead.             Sometime               later      I turned              to    look       onto       the       pitch          in

On the     1!:>th April       1989(150489)          we all met         in Forrnby at about                   -10.00am

and we     travelled to S h e f f i e l d         in two      cars.        The    normal        jour n e y time          is

two hours       so this w o u l d       have    given us s u fficient                time       to get

Hillsborough         in time      for    the    kick      off,   we    tr a v e l l e d a l o n g m o t o r w

from Liverpool         and     t r a v e l l e d through S t o c k p o r t        to Shefjffe1d .


                                                                       \
At about      11.00am we        e n c o u n t e r e d the    first     t r a f f jJ T j a m ,    this     being

about a mile         from the        island at the end of t Ijp m o t o rw a y in St o c k p o r t „

'his jam was         caused     by    road vw o r k s » plus       t t j j T sheer     volume      of supporter

vehicles.      The vehicles           consisted of L iv J F rp                   suppo r t e r s   vehic l e s        and

Everton      supporters        vehicles        who w e r T t r a v e l l i n g      to B i r m i n g h a m    to    play

in the other         semi     final.     I know for a fact                 that     the    final     hundred

yards    to the      roundabout         referred to took              us one        hour a n d this           is the

first    reason      I will     refer     to that made           suppo r t e r s       late a r r i v i n g        for

the game.      After     clearing        this     roundabout          we t r a v e l l e d for about               three

qu a rters    of an hour at a reasonable                    speed and            then hit a further

thi r t y minutes.       The    rest of the journey was                     r e asonably         trouble       free

and    uneventful.       Although        I did not a t t e n d         the       corre s p o n d i n g    game      last

year    I have a tt e n d e d H i l l s b o r o u g h     football         gro u n d on     previous

occasions      and    I am     r e a s o n a b l y familiar with            its     location.        We      reached

the Hal ifax R o a d at about             14.10hrs      this     being       some    two hours         longer

than we had a n t i c ipated.           There       had been an article              in the       previous

weeks    programme,        advising       us to      park    in the Pars o n s Cross area w hich

is near     to the Hali f a x Road.            The    roads     in this are a were            very heavily

congested with          large       numbers    of moving        vehicles       attempting          to find

parking spaces          and other       vehicles       parked all        over       the    place.



We    p e rsonally turned up a side                 road,    w hich had a shop             called      the

’Fruit Eiow3." on the            corner    of this      road and the Hali f a x Road and

although       there was        no where      to    park.    We were     fortunate         that     a resident

came    into    the street and a l l o w e d          us to     park on the          d r i v e w a y of his

house.    This man w o u l d         not accept any m oney from us and stated                           that    he

had had dee 1 i ngs wi t h L..i.ver poo 1 S u p p o r t e r s          in t he      pas t and k new t hat

we wouldn't        be a problem.

s u pporters walking            to the ground.         At this        time    I can say that            none    of

our    party had      consumed any alcohol.                 W hen we    reached the H a l i f a x Road,

w e came a c ro s s a g e ne ra 1 store w h i ch wa s oppo si t e t he                     "Fruit Bowl'         and

we went    in to get a drink.              I never      drink     before a game so                I had a can

of    coke and     I did notice         that a couple          of my mates           had a can of beer,,

I cannot       recall     how busy this            shop was    or whet h e r        people were         leaving

with    cans of beer a l t h o u g h       I do know tii#*re was a coach                    car    park

b o u ndary wall and a large              p roportion        of these were           drinking       beer     f ro m

c a n s . There    were    no    instances o-f any           d i s o r d e r l e y behaviour      or

drunkeness.        Whilst       in this area,         1 did     not    notice any Police               presence

and there were          no signs       directing       us    to the     ground.       We    could hear         the

Nottingham        suppo r t e r s    in the    ground singing and              I p r e sumed there were

very few Liverpool                 suppo r t e r s    in the ground:,             because       they w ould         have

been       outsinging        them and drowning                 their    voices        out.



As we w a l k e d along Hali f a x Roa d a l t h o u g h there were                           large     groups       of

Liv e r p o o l    supporters         going      to the ground we were able                      to walk       freely

and these          supporters        were      not    spilling         out onto the           road.     I do not

recall        seeing      other     fans     drinking          from cans and there were                     certainly

no    instances          of d r unkeness         or d i s o r d e r l y behaviour.



We a p p r o a c h e d the      roundabout at Leppings Lane and                           I became aware             of

s'u ppo r t e r s s hout i n q out          ’Any ticks t s * ’Any t,.ic{sets’ » There we r e qu i t e

a    lot of supporters ma k i n g                these     requests and we did comment amon g s t

o u rselves        that    there were more              p e o p le than       normal      without       tickets.          I

did    not see any ticket                 t o u t s / 4 n d on re f l e c t i o i n    I would       have     thought

that       the Police w o u ' J ^ j T a ^ ^ n a d e       sure we had tickets                 before        being

allowed        to a pp r o a c h    the    ground.        We   turned        into L e p p i n g s    Lane and

there was a noticeable                    increase        in the volume            of s u p p o r t e r s    in this

area.       I am    not aware        of traffic           being     prevented          from using           this    road.

Although          I did not see any             cars      present.          The   s u pporters       were     using       th

roadway and           pavement       to a p p r o a c h    the turn s t i l e s and           there were           small

groups        of supp o r t e r s    standing about              in groups?           a g a i n we were       able       to

walk       freely on a p p r o a c h to the            turnstiles.            There was a m a r k e d          decreas

in people asking              for tick e t s         in L e p p i n g s Lane and          I a g a i n did not            see

an y ticket         touts.     There was a m in o r i t y              of    fans wit h       cans of beer           but

a ga i n    I did not see any drunkeness.

was aware          of the group of             t urnstiles        thro u g h w h i c h       I was    to enter.           I

awaiting        to enter        the    ground through the               turnstiles.             I w o u l d estimate

there w o u l d       be about a t h o u s a n d s u p p o r t e rs in this                  small      a rea outside

the    turnstile and there were                      no signs      of any queues.               I personally

to a sudden halt,              a position            I have m a r k k a A1       on the         plan.        My

getting        up again.       As we were            ushe r e d across       by this          horse       I came      up

groups        of supporters                making        their way a r o u n d            to an area m a r k e d C on

the    plan.           I gained the              i mpression that               these     people were         entering        the

ground,           so    I decided to follow them.                        There       was      no great       pressure

withi. n this            crowd and           1 was able          to walk          through a gate m a r k e d C on

the    plan.           There was         a large         gap of some             four     or five      feet    where we

made     our entry.             My a t t e n t i o n was         not     drawn to the               presence       of any

Police Officer                 or     club steward           in the         v i c i n i t y of tjgn.s gate and             I am

not aware              of who       op e n e d    it.    I was     just         reliev e d j R o     get    inside     the

by me        to A n f i e l d football              club).       AsS^I stood            inside       I heard       people

b ragging          that     they had been able                   to enter without                   having    a ticket        1

I made my way over                     to the tunnel             under          the West S t a n d and e v e n t u a l l y

Tunnel     and      I c a n ’t remember what               quantity     of s u pporters         were       entering

this    tunnel.        I cannot       remember where              I was ytfen the teams              came     onto

the    pitch or w hen the m at c h got                    underway^

The    three       of us then made           our w a y ^ along       the    tunnel   and we were a D i e                i<

walk along          quite   freely.

I b e l i e v e d at    this    time    that      this was         the only way          into the         terraces

and a 11 ho ug h we d i d n ’t pa r t i cu lari y war11 t o be be h i nd t he g oa 1 we

of the g r o u n d .                                                    /



We had almost           reached       the    end of tha/^tunnel w hen              it became          h eav i l y

that    the    game had        commenced.        i/W 'e   soon     real isea vnat        even    11 we goi

into    the    terracing we w ould              be unable          to see   the game       so we          deci d e d to

try and       find anot h e r     vi#winq area.              We    ran back along         the    tunnel        and

tur ned    rig                   rend and        t hr ough a gap        i n the wall.           Af te r sorne

This was       d                  own initiative as                there were      no signs          or    personnel

                   peopie   to this a r e a . .



After     reaching       this    viewing        point my a t t e n t i o n was       d i r e c t e d to

watching       the game         and    I was     not aware of any           incidents       o c c uring        in any

of the     pens      infront     of     the West Stand.



I then     recall       that    during       the game        that Peter B E A R D S L E Y alm o s t           scored

a goal and just a fter                that     I saw a su p p o r t e r     climb over          the       fence

dividing       the     pens,    from the        track and he went and spoke                     to    the

Liverpool          goalkeeper.

        During      the time       that    f o l lowed          I saw a steady stream of supporters

        climbing         from pens 3 and 4 and to the edge                            of the       pitch.      A large

        number      of    people were          injured and were                eventually          treated     by    people          i

        uniform.          There was a line of Police Offic e r s                            across     the    half way          lin

        a p p a r e n t l y to stop opposing              suppo r t e r s meeting.



        I have      no r e c o l l e c t i o n of who went              on,    on the       pitch after        the m a t c h

        was    sto p p e d and     I cannot          offer any s u b s t a n t i v e         information        in relatio

        to the dead or            i njured as          to how they            came ac ross         thei r injuries.              I

        did not witness            any    crowd        crushing        or surges         in pens 3 or 4.



        We e v e n t u a l l y   left    the ground as a result                      of tannoy m e s s a g e s       informin

        us that      the game       had been a b a n d o n e d at about                  4. 1 5 p m

        On    leaving      the ground          I saw Jfiat a number                  of supp o r t e r s     had become

                            the j o u r n e y to our            vehicle and           the    s u bsequent      journey

        h om e was       u n eventful

        In concl u s i o n        I personality feel                 that a major           factor     in this       disaster

         as the       presence      of tjp>e d i v iding             fences     in the       pen        I can see          no

        useful      purple        in^hem        being       there and          if they h a d n ’t people w o u l d

        have    been able         to move about             from one          pen toanother.            At Old T r a f f o r d

        they have a similar               set    up but         these are        controlled           by the P olice            and

        once a pen         is full       of supporters,               they will        start       filling a n o t h e r        pen

        up and so on.



        The    second      point    of note was             that      by the     presence          of the     line    of

The tragedy a t Hi l l sborough stadium might well have befrFk,avoided i f the b a r r i e r s
s e p a r a t i n g the s upport er s from the p i t c h had not been t h e r e . On the o t h er hand
i t jiay well be thought premature t o remove t h e s e b a r r i e r s permanently from a l 1
t h l | | l ~)othal 1 grounds in the count ry.

A s o l u t i o n might be to r e p l a c e each s e c t i o n o f the f i x e d b a r r i e r by a s t rong swi ng­
ing g a t e , hinged a t the top and able to swing inwards towards the p i t c h but normally
locked in p l a c e by e l e c t r i c a l l y operat ed h o r i z o n t a l l y s i i d i n g b o l t s .

These g a t e s could be remotely o pe r a t ed , i n d i v i d u a l l y , from a cont rol room or tower
i n s i d e the stadium, from which a l l part s o f the ground and the crowd could be kept
under cont i nuous o b s e r v a t i o n by d i r e c t v i s i o n and/or c l o s e d c i r c u i t TV m o n i t o r s . _
The g a t e s and t h e i r corresponding co n t r o l s wi t c h e s would be i d e n t i f i e d by matching
l e t t e r s , numbers or c o l o u r s . Radio communication between the co nt ro l room and
p o l i c e with w a l k i e - t a l k i e s , s t a t i o n e d a t s t r a t e g i c p o i n t s o u t s i d e and i n s i d e the
ground, would be e s s e n t i a l .

The f a c t i s t h a t any l a r g e crowd i s a p o t e n t i a l l y l e t h a l organism, however good-
natured the o c c a s i o n - p a r t l y because t ho se in one area o f the crowd do not know
what i s happening in o t h e r a r e a s , p a r t l y because i n d i v i d u a l s in a crowd may not
e x e r c i s e enough p a t i e n c e and i ma g i na t i o n , p a r t l y because emotions are c o n t a g i o u s .
A few poli cemen, thems el ves w i t h o u t knowledge o f what i s happening in o t h er part s
o f the stadium and i t s surrounds, not equipped with 1o u d - h a i l e r s , cannot be blamed
f o r f a i l i n g to cont rol a r e s t i v e mob. Both the crowd and i t s " c o n t r o l l e r s " must
have a c c u r a t e , u p - t o - t h e - m i n u t e informati on and e f f e c t i v e communications are v i t a l .

Short o f p la c i ng a l l f o o t b a l l grounds o u t s i d e the c i t y c e n t r e s and making them a c ­
c e s s i b l e onl y by l o c a l f e e d e r t r a i n s i t i s d i f f i c u l t to s ee how f u r t h e r d i s a s t e r s
can be prevented u n t i l the n e c e s s a ry thought and money are expended on measures
lik e these.         Also everyone should be t aught from chil dhood onwards how to behave
in a crowd - above a l 1, wit h p a t i e n c e and s e l f - d i s c i p l i n e .

My daughter (then a small g i r l ) and I were trapped f o r t hree hours in the crowd
 near Hyde Park Gate on the n i g h t o f the fi rework d i s p l a y to c e l e b r a t e Prince
 C h a r l e s 1 wedding and t h i s l e t t e r i s prompted by a d i s c u s s i o n we had w h i l e watching
 the news o f the Hi l l sborough d i s a s t e r .

                                                 I am,
                                                       Sir,
                                                              Yours f a i t h f u l 1y

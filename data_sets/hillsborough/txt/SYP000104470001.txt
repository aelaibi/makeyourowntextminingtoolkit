    CUP SEMI-FINAL 15 4 1989 - LIVERPOOL v NOTTINGHAM FOREST


    At 8 30am, Saturday 15 April                       1989,     I commenced duty at Doncaster Divisional

    Headquarters.                At 8 50am.,           the same date the officers from Doncaster were

    conveyed to Hillsborough Football Ground at Sheffield, arriving 9 40am.



    At 9 55am.,           as    a member of Serial                    we were briefed            in the Main Stand by

    senior officers regarding details of the days proposed events.




    Approximately             10 30am.,       Serial         44 with Inspector Wardle                and Ps Hughes          left

    Hillsborough by PSV vehicle                       and made        our way to the            Al6l - Oughtibridge           to

    perform van,coach                and    car      checking       with    regard    to    tickets        and drink being

    carried in those vehicles.



    At   11    15am.,         after     a briefing           by Inspector War d l e regarding our duties                      we

    deployed on the Al6l checking vans and                             'buses of Liverpool                 fans.   In all    the

    vehicles stopped there was a smell of alcohol and tins of alcohol were taken

    from many of them.


    At 1 25pm., whilst on duty                       , a Bedford coach, vrm KVU 61 P was stopped and a

    total     of    54    assorted         cans of beer          and a bottle          of wine were           confiscated.

    No   one       person       on    the    coach         admitted        ownership       of    these      items   and     were

    disclaimed           in    general      by

              Merseyside.             Pc 2371 Bairstow,              an officer from Serial                 44, interviewed

    and reported the driver,                     a

    Liverpool.            On     this      particular        coach there was a smell                 of alcohol but          all

    parties        stopped           whilst performing              this    duty were       in the main friendly and

    good      natured          and    laughed        and    joked    with    reference          to   the    outcome    of    the

    game,     and    the       fact     that we were not             going to catch             them out      this year      and

    take their beer as the same serial had the previous year.

Approximately          3 00pm.,        Serial    44 resumed             to Clay Wheels          for meal.             Upon our

arrival we were             informed      to get a hot meal,                and upon receipt were                     informed

to    attend     Leppings        Lane     end    of    Hillsborough          as    there    was       fighting          taking

place.          All     the     serial    plus     others         boarded        the PSV    and       we    attended          the

Leppings       Lane    end of the Ground.                   Upon    arrival we stayed a few minutes                            by

our    vehicle        and   I    could    see,    I    estimate          upwards     of    2000       fans    and       Police

milling about outside the turnstiles and in the area immediately inside the

turnstiles at the rear of the Stand.


Upon approaching the turnstiles it was plain to see that the majority of the

fans    were     just       wandering      about      as    though        in a daze,'       some      h y s t e r i a l , many

were a n g r y .


Upon reaching the turnstile area I was directed with other officers to form

a cordon across             the entrance         to the          Leppings Lane end to prevent any other

persons       getting       in to the Ground - some                  fans at this time did turn up with

tickets       and upon being advised                  they could not enter, went and stood on the

far side of the road.


We were then detailed to assist at the side folding gate on the right of the

turnstiles.           I became     involved at this                time    in assisting walking injured                        to

find     safe    places         away   from the fans             coming out        in their hundreds                  from    the

rear     of     the    Stand      area,     so    they      could        await    treatment        and       be       taken    to

hospital.


Ambulances were arriving and some                           bodies were being brought out by fans and

Police.       The      fans     still     came    out       of    this     gate and        as    it    was now         getting

congested          with       injured      people,          dead     bodies       and      ambulance,             I    started

directing fans to other gates and                           away from the area.                 A cordon was formed

inside the area behind the Stand and the fans directed away to gates on the

other side of the turnstiles.                         Other officers and myself then were detailed

 to form a corodon down the side of the                             fencing adjacent to the river to as

 to    form    a wall       to place       the    injured         and     dead    behind.          Later directed              to
 clear    the    bridge         area    adjacent       to    the    turnstiles          to assist          the ambulances

 coming in.


 At this time the fans were just milling about as in a daze, showing a lot of
 verbal anger and hatred which was directed at the Police,                                         however no actual
                                                                                                <5 ^ 2 2 3

physical violence was directed at us.                We were informed by an Inspector not

to react to this abuse but to ignore it at this time.                   Quite a number of the

fans appeared to have been drinking and the was a strong smell of alchol in
the atmosphere.



I continued        to assist      around   the Leppings    Lane end of the turnstiles until

Serial        44 was   reformed    and   directed   to   patrol   the streets   around    Leppings
Lane area in case of fighting - of which there was none.



Later     returned     to Clay Wheels with Serial          44 and was stood down         at 7 00pm
that d a t e .

        I refer to your visit to this office when we made available to you a number of
        departmental files. I promised at that stage to identify, so far as possible, files
        containing correspondence between the Law Officers and Members of
        Parliament about the Hillsborough tragedy. I have now done so.
        There are 33 such files. As we agreed on the telephone, I have put them to one
        side on the basis that you will contact me as and when you would like them
        to be made available to you.

        Thank you for your letter of 18 July 1997 requesting access to documentation about the
        Hillsborough Stadium disaster and proceedings arising out of it which are held by my
        department.

        I understand that the Deputy Legal Secretary, Mr Stephen Wooler has already opened
        discussions with your Secretary, Mr Bone concerning the documentation and how best to
        facilitate the access which you request. Mr Wooler is at present away from the office on
        annual leave and is due to return on Monday 4 August. I understand that Mr Bone is in a
        similar position. Mr Wooler and Mr Bone have already agreed to discuss your requirements
        upon their respective returns from annual leave.

       In these circumstances, I hope that you are content for our officials to liaise with a view to
       the Legal Secretariat providing the information that you have requested in writing albeit that
       this may entail a slight extension to your 4 August deadline.

You have received a letter from Lord Justice Stuart-Smith who has been appointed by the
Home Secretary to conduct a scrutiny into the Hillsborough disaster, requesting access to

I have spoken to Stephen Wooler who confirms that he has already been in contact with Mr
Bone, the Secretary to the scrutiny. Both Mr Wooler and Mr Bone are on annual leave and
both are due back in their offices on 4 August. Mr Wooler and Mr Bone agreed to liaise over
this issue upon their respective returns.

I have drafted a reply to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith. You may wish to personalise the letter
depending upon how well you are acquainted with him.

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER



I have been appointed by the Home Secretary to conduct a scrutiny of possible fresh evidence
relating to the Hillsborough Stadium disaster. I am writing to ask for your assistance (my
Secretary Mr Bone has already spoken to Mr Wooler of the Legal Secretariat).

It might be helpful if I explain that the objective of my scrutiny is to establish whether there
is any significant new evidence which was not previously available to Lord Taylor’s Inquiry,
to the Inquests, or to the prosecuting or police disciplinary authorities. If there is significant
evidence, it will be my aim to see if it would have affected the outcome of any of the
proceedings. I hope to report my findings to the Home Secretary by the end of the year. I
attach my terms of reference.

In the course of my work I expect that I will need to have access to the documents about the
incident and the various proceedings arising out of it which are held by your Department. I
should be obliged if you arrange for the Secretariat to my scrutiny to be informed in writing
by 4 August of the nature of these documents and how we may most conveniently obtain
access to them.

I have written to the Hillsborough Family Support Group and to various other people who
have come forward asking for some basic summary information about the new evidence
which is said to exist. This information will help me during the preliminary stages of my
work.

As my scrutiny of the evidence proceeds I may wish to interview some witnesses directly. I
am also willing to consider interviewing individual witnesses at their request. These
interviews will be private.

The Secretariat to my scrutiny will be happy to discuss the arrangements if you wish. Please
note that the telephone and room numbers shown above are temporary - we will notify you of
our permanent address and telephone as soon as we have them.

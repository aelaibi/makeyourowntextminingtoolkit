Hillsborough Disaster - Liverpool versus Nottingham Forest
Saturday 15th April, 1989 ____________________________________

I am writing to you as Conservative Member of Parliament for Welwyn Hatfield
and Chairman of Luton Town Football Club which, as you know, embraced most of
the Popplewell Report by introduction of a Members Only Scheme effectively
banning all Away supporters which immediately led to violence and arrests being
completely eliminated over the last three years at Kenilworth Road, the Home
of Luton Town.

I would like to give evidence with regard to my own experience as a life-long
supporter of the game to help you to evaluate the experiment carried out at
Luton Town and the intention behind the Football Spectators Bill and my view
of what the consequences would have been if the Bill had been in place before
the Hillsborough Disaster.

I look forward to receiving an early reply.

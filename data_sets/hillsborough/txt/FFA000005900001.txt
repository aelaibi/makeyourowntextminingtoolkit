      DRAFT LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN TO THE 1IOME SECRETARY




      Dear Home Secretary,




                                                FINAL REPORT


              Now that we have had some time to scrutinise thej
      Report fully,       I thought I should write formally to set out The
>•    Football Association's response to its recommendations *


              Our initial response to the Report stands.       We welcome
      it^unreservedly^ and are prepared to accept its
      recommendations,      including those relating to seating and the
      timetable proposed for implementation. Many of the Report's
      conclusions accord with the recommendations we made to the
      Inquiry and our stated position on ground improvements.


              Wo particularly welcome                      ^     suggested
     strategy against hooliganism: stronger detection measures f new
     criminal offences, greater use or attendance orders and the
     introduction of electronic tagging, together with the crowd
     ^control and facility improvements he recommends. We believe
      :hat if this strategy is to be effective it must be treated as
     an integral whole.          We are therefore anxious that the proposed
     ‘criminal offences within football grounds are indeed created
     and enforced.


              We accepi                     _      view that "in the end
     the   ulk of the finances for ground improvement must be raised
     by t e    cli'.bs themselves".    We have always recognised this.
     But   i .1 view of the considerable capital sums which will be
     involved in meeting the targets Taylor sets, we are pleased
     that he did not rule out consideration of a reduction in pools
     betting tax or the extension of capital allowances to ground
     improvements.        We would be grateful if the Government would
     indeed give urgent consideration to these proposals.
          Increasingly over the past few years, we have been
working in a partnership with the Government and police in
tackling hooliganism.        The successful introduction of CCTV,
ground improvements and closer crowd control are all tfte
fruits of this co-operation.        Clearly there is much more to be
donei    and the Taylor Report gives us the opportunity to renew
our commitment to fight hooliganism and improve crowd safety
and conditions.       We are ready to work with the Government to
implement               strategy and meet this allin


|        As many of             •ecommendations bear on Home Office
responsibilities, I would be very grateful if it would be
possible for us to meet^to discuss the          Report and its
implications.         My earnest hope is that we will be     able to
agree a common        approach to promote,   in r
w o r d s , "better   and safer conditions at sports grounds in    the
f u t u re ".



                            Yours sincerely




                                Chairman

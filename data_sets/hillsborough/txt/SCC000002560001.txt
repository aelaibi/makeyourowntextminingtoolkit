This statement, consisting of 6 page(s) each signed by me, is true to the

in evidence, I shall be liable to prosecution if I have wilfully stated in it

I am employed by Sheffield City Council as the Head of the Administration and

Legal Department.            I have held this position since 18.10.89.       Prior to that

date, with effect from 1.12.78 I held the position of Assistant Head of the

Administration and Legal Department          (Legal) but held'the rank of Acting Head

of Department from 24.1.89 to 17.10.89,              during the absence of the Head of

Department on sickness leave.           As Acting Head of Department and Head of

Department,       I had and have overall responsibility for the Licensing Section.

As Assistant Head of the Department,            I had line management responsibility for

the Licensing Section,          in theory, but in practice the Head of Department,

Mr. Pensam,       took a personal interest in this area of work and therefore the

Chief Licensing Officer, David Bownes,             invariably reported to Mr. Pensam.

          ^                              STATEMENT OF WITNESS
                             (C.J. Act 1967,3.9; M.C. Act 1980, *.102; M.C. Rules 1981, r.70)


      Continuation of statement of     Mark Webster


Arrangements for the discharge of functions by local authorities are specified

in Section 101 of the Local Government Act,                    1972.         The Section provides that

a local authority may arrange for the discharge of their functions by a

committee,    sub committee or an officer of the authority.                         It is therefore

possible for a council to delegate its decision making powers to a committee,

sub committee or officer.




Whilst a named officer, who would usually be a chief officer, was the officer

nominated to fulfil the delegated functions of a local authority in

appropriate circumstances,              as a matter of practice,             such schemes actually

operate by the relevant chief officer authorising one of his officers to take

action on his behalf.                Thus an individual officer can take action in the name

of the chief officer of that department.                     The case of R. v Southwark London

Borough Council,        ex-parte Bannerman and Others,                reported in "The Times" Law

Reports on the 12th October,             1989, and Provident Mutual Life Assurance & Derby

City Council     (HL) 79 L.G.R.297 confirm that this is a proper decision making

process within the terms of Section 101 of the Local Government Act,                             1972.

In this instance,        David Bownes,       the Chief Licensing Officer, was authorised to

take action under the powers delegated to the Head of Administration and Legal

Department.      The action to be taken was of an administrative nature as

Mr Bownes was and is an administrator as opposed to a technically qualified

expert.   The Safety of Sports Ground Act,                 1975 requires consultation to take

place with technically qualified experts,                  i e .the Building Surveyor,          the Fire

Authority and the Police.

In order to establish a framework within which Sheffield City Council could

exercise the functions which it was to acquire on the 1st April,                              1986, David

Bownes,     the Chief Licensing Officer,              prepared           a report which was submitted

through the Head of Department to the                    General Purposes Panel which was a sub

committee of the Municipal Enterprise and General Services Programme Committee

(referred hereafter as MEGS) which is                    in turn a committee of the City Council.

The report was submitted to the Panel                    on 3rd March,             1986.




The report "recommended that the following delegations be approved

      a)         all the powers and duties of the Council under the Safety of

                 Sports Grounds Act, 1975 be delegated to the General Purposes

                Panel;

       b)        the emergency procedure powers under Section 10 of the 1975 Act                            be

                 delegated to the Head of the Administration and Legal Department

                 in consultation with the Chairman or Deputy Chairman of this Panei

                 or of the Municipal Enterprise and General Services Programme

                 Committee as appropriate.

       c)        The power to authorise officers under Section 11 of the Act be

                 delegated to the Head of the Administration and Legal Department."




At its meeting on the 3rd March,                1986, the Panel adopted the recommendations

in .the report.          In accordance with usual practice,                       these were subsequently

approved by MEGS op the 17th March,                  1986 and approved by the full Council at

its meeting on the 9th April,                1986.

A second report was prepared by David Bownes which was again submitted through

the Head of Department to the Panel on the 6th May,                               1986.    The Panel resolved

(amongst other things)               "that

       a)        the broad outlines of the administrative system organised by the

                 former South Yorkshire County Council under the Safety of Sports

                 Ground Act, 1975 be noted and authority be given for the

                 continuation of such system for the time being."




This resolution took effect immediately since by virtue of the resolution of

the Panel at its meeting on the 3rd March,                         1986,     the Panel had full delegated

powers to deal with this issue.




As a matter of practice, the minutes of the                         Panel were seen by MEGS and the

City Council.         The administrative system therefore operated in accordance

with those resolutions between 6th May,                         1986 and 7th September,        1987.   During

this period,      the system in operation                was a common one throughout this local

authority and other local authorities.                          The basic principle operated on is

that if there is disagreement between the parties or a matter of policy

requires determination,              then the issue should be referred to the appropriate

committee or sub committee by way of a report from the relevant officer.

Where there is a consensus of opinion between the parties,                                an administrative

decision can be taken not to refer the                      matter to the relevant committee or sub

committee,      and action is           taken in line with the consensus of opinion.

In the instance of the removal of part of barrier 144,                               I believe that

professional advice was received from all the statutory consultees and that

the C l u b ’s engineers were also present, given that there was apparently

consensus between all parties regarding the action to be taken,                               then the

correct administrative decision was taken not to refer the matter to the

General Purposes Panel.




In September,      1987, a report was submitted to the Panel through the Head of

the Administration and Legal Department.                         This report reviewed the operation

of the administrative system relating to Safety of Sports Grounds.                                    The Panel

resolved that:-

      a)       "the details contained in the report now                          submitted regarding the

                operation of the Council’s certification function for the Safety

                of Sports Grounds be noted.

      b)       The revised administrative system set out in the report,                               including

                the establishment of a proposed Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory

                Group comprising representatives of the Building Surveyor,                              the

                South Yorkshire County Fire Service,                       the South Yorkshire Police

                and the Director of Environmental Health and Consumer Services,                               to

                advise the Council on matters relating to the Safety of Sports

                Grounds be approved and___________

      c)       authority be delegated to the Head of the Administration and Legal

               Department to deal with all routine matters in connection with the

               administrative system."




The minutes      of the meeting were considered as a matter of practice by MEGS                           and

the Council      at its meeting on the 7th October,                1987.




My interpretation of the phrase              "routine matters" means to operate the day to

day running      of the licensing system.             It is a matter            for individual judgment

taking account       of the relevant factors at the time.In practice,                           I would

expect that matters about which there were disagreements or matters of policy,

would be referred to the relevant committee, but that where there was

consensus between the parties,             this would be dealt with as a routine matter.

FILE NOTE

21.3.90

Sergeant             of the West Midlands Police rang for some further
information relating to the Hillsborough Disaster.    He asked for David
Bownes1 job title and I informed him that this was Chief Licensing
Officer.   He also asked if David was responsible for the licensing
of Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground.      I replied that the Council
were responsible for the licensing for       the Ground, that a Panel  of
the Council had delegated powers in relation to Safety of Sports Grounds
and agreed matters were dealt with through the Advisory Group.     I said
that David had day-to-day responsibility for the administration of
the Safety of Sports Grounds system.     (This information is consistent
with David's statement to the Inquiry and his evidence).

Sergeant        asked who the Head of Department was, both at the time
of the disaster and now.     I informed him that Roger Pensam was the
Head of Department at the time of the     disaster andMark Webster was
the Head of Department now.

He indicated that this information was      to "top and tail the reports
to the DPP".    He also said that thesereports would be going to      the
DPP shortly and subject to their decision, interviews would take place
once their decision was known.     He said that as soon as he had any
information he would let me know straight away.

il)       My name is                                                     I have been employed by Sheffield
          City       Council         since         1966    in    a     variety      of    administrative           posts.
          I    was    appointed               Principal         Assistant       in    the       Administration           and
          Legal      Department               in   1982.        My    duties    have      included     the        role     of
          Emergency          Liaison           Officer       for      major    peacetime         emergencies        since
          that time.


(2)       Section         138     of      the      Local     Government         Act      1972    enables      a    Local
          Authority to incur expenditure in taking action which is calculated
          to avert, alleviate or erradicate the effects or potential effects
          of    an    emergency               or   disaster      involving destruction               of,    or danger
          to, life or property.

          least      since the 1960's,                    although there is no statutory provision
          requiring          such         a    plan.       The       basis     of   Sheffield        City    Council's
          emergency peacetime plan and my role as Emergency Liaison Officer
          has    not       changed            significantly            since    1982.          The   demise       of     the

Continuation of statement of


         South       Yorkshire              County           Council          in        1986 and         the establishment
         of    the        South       Yorkshire              Fire      and      Civil          Defence        Authority          were
         not     fundamental                to     the       operation          of       the      City     Council's          Plan.
         Obviously,             the        demise           of      the County              Council       meant        that       its
         functions             were        distributed              to, for            example,         the    City        Council
         and     the          Joint        Authorities              and there            were,         therefore,          changes
         in the contact points for these services.


(4)      The    City           Council's          Plan        is     supplementary                to    the    Police       Scheme
         for Major Disasters and although it will usually be brought into
         operation at the discretion of the Senior Police Officer concerned,
         action can also be instigated by any Senior Departmental Officer.
         A    major           disaster       in        peacetime          may      occurin         many         forms       and    so
         requires definition to distinguish it from the routine incidents
         that       are       the     day-to-day             sole concern of the                       emergency       services.
         Neither          the       numbers        of        persons       involved, nor                 the scale          of    the
         damage          by    themselves would necessarily determine                                         the involvement
         of     local          authority           resources            and        a    major          peacetime       emergency
         is    therefore             defined           in     the     Plan      as       "any      disaster          or    serious
         disruption             of        life    arising           with      little         or    no     warning,         causing
         or threatening death or serious injury to, or rendering homeless,
         such       numbers          of     persons          in     excess         of    those which            can       be dealt
         with       by    the       Local Authority and Public Services                                       operating under
         normal          procedures              and    which        calls      for         special       mobilisation            and
         organisation of                   those services. In these                            circumstances,              my role
         is    to    inform the Chief                        Executive        or        the Head          of Administration
         and Legal Department of the emergency and, under her/his direction,
         to    act       as     Liaison           Officer          between         the      departments         and       services
         involved             and    produce           any       progress       or       other     reports           required by
         her/him.             The plan identifies a number of departments and outlines
         their       roles          and     responsibilities                 in a major                peacetime       emergency
         situation.                 The     relevant             departments             are      required        to      draw     up
         and        maintain               departmental               plans            to      meet       the        roles        and
         responsibilities                   placed          upon      them.            The     response         of    the     local
         authority in a major peacetime emergency situation may thus involve
         any or all                 the    departments concerned,                        depending upon               the nature
         and demands of the situation.

Continuation of statement of



(5)      The    version         of       the Plan dated             December          1980 was revised by me,
         on behalf of the Chief Executive,                                 in October 1987 and the final
         draft was approved by the Chief Executive, prior to its circulation
         within        the     Authority          and     to    the        emergency          services,         adjoining
         local       authorities            and     various          other          bodies.        In     revising       the
         Plan,         full        and     detailed        consultations               were        held    within        the
         Authority           and     with     the       South       Yorkshire         Fire       and     Civil       Defence
         Authority           who,        through    their        Emergency            Planning          Unit    with     its
         team     of     full-time           professional                officers,       were       able       to     pursue
         contacts         across           the     range        of       emergency           services          and     local
         authorities throughout South Yorkshire and North East Derbyshire,
         and offer invaluable assistance and advice in compiling the revised
         Plan.         Although the Plan had been up-dated in terms of personnel
         changes        on     a     periodic       basis,          it    was       considered          appropriate at
         that time, to adopt arrangements whereby in future a full revision
         of the Plan would be undertaken,                                at     least    every alternate year.
         To    this      end       arrangements          were        put       in    hand     on    18    January       1989
         to undertake a further revision of the Council's Emergency Plan,
         with     a view           to the circulation                of a revised version during the
         Spring of 1989.                  These arrangements were overtaken by the disaster
         at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989 and the completion of a revised
         document was set back in order to take into account and incorporate
         in    the      Plan,        issues       and    lessons          learned       from       the    Hillsborough
         disaster.

                   comments          on     the     plan       in        the    light       of     the    Hillsborough
                   disaster;

         (d)        measures          to    include             in    the     draft       revised      Plan       an officer
                    with        expertise             in     emergency          communications,                   details       of
                    contact points in adjoining local authorities and additional
                    points       of     contact            in    a     variety       of    departments            within the
                    Council.


 (7)     The     revised         draft      of the Council's                    Peacetime Emergency Plan was
         also     prepared            in consultation                  with the South Yorkshire Fire and
         Civil Defence Authority, taking into account the issues highlighted
         in    the       above    review          and meetings                with       emergency       services.             The
         revised         draft        is    currently                awaiting       the     approval         of    the
         Executive.              In    accordance               with        previous        practice,          the       revised
         draft       identifies            an     'initial            action'        procedure         for     the       Police.
         The        plan       does        not require a               code    word for           implementation               and
         thequestion            of code words                    has    not been mentioned                   at any of my
         meetings with the emergency services.


(8)      I    was      first      contacted             regarding             the    Hillsborough             disaster,         by
         the    Director          of       Health and Consumer Services                           (Mr David Purchon)
         at my home, shortly before 5.00 pm on 15 April 1989.                                                  The Director
         gave     me      an    outline          of the          situation and his                assessment of what
         was needed.             I have a copy of the City Council's Scheme for Major
         Peacetime Emergencies which is kept at my home and I immediately
         contacted          the        (then)         Chief          Executive        (Mr    Ian       Podmore)           at   his
         home       to    appraise          him       of     the       situation.           I     then    contacted            the
         Assistant          Director             of    Family          and     Community          Services          (Mr     David
         Snaith)         who     was       at    this       time       still        at his      home,     and        requested
         the         implementation of                     his Department's role                  in      the        Emergency
         Plan     with         particular             reference         to     the provision             of       rest    centre
         accommodation and care of the homeless.                                      His Department had already
         taken       active       steps          to     get Social            Workers        to    the        scene       of   the

 Continuation of statement of



         disaster       and      a    temporary          centre         was     being          established             at    the
         Hillsborough           Boys'        Club.         This      telephone           call        was        immediately
         followed       by       a    call     from         me    to      the       (then)           Acting           Head    of
         Administration              and    Legal       Department            (Mr       Mark    Webster).               I    was
         informed       that         the     Assistant           Chief        Personnel          Officer              (Safety,
         Health and Welfare)                 (Mr Patrick O'Neill) had already made contact
         with    the South Yorkshire Police HQ at Snig Hill and had offered
         the    services         of    the     Local        Authority.              I    was     not       contacted          by
         South       Yorkshire         Police       during        the     course          of    Saturday              evening.


(9)      I    then    commenced            arrangements           for    the     provision,               if     necessary,
         of meals       for persons           attending the rest centres.                                 This was           done
         through      the       Principal          Administrative             Assistant          in       the Education
         Department          (Mr                              who     was      requested             by    me     to     place
         on     standby         the        School       Meals        Service            but     to        await        further
         instructions           before       commencing           the preparation                of       food.        I ^ en
         reported these arrangements                        back to Mr Snaith who was to inform
         me    if    and when         they     were        required.           It was           not       yet     clear       how
         many       persons      would       attend        the     rest       centres          nor        for    how        long,
         but    3 centres had been opened up at Burngreave Vestry Hall,                                                       the
         Kelvin Community Centre                    and the Sacred              Heart Church Hall.                      Social
         Workers       were        attached         to distressed               families             on a        one-to-one
         basis.       I ascertained from Mr Snaith that the Hospitals and Police
         had    clear     instructions             as    to where the               rest       centres were.                  The
         Burngreave          Vestry         Hall     was      not       required          and    was        subsequently
         closed but the Kelvin and Sacred Heart Centres continued to operate
         overnight.          Mr Snaith subsequently informed me that the Education
         Department's           emergency           feeding         arrangements               were       not     required,
         food being provided                 by     the WRVS         at Kelvin           and by            volunteers at
         the Sacred Heart Centre                    and I was ableto                'stand-down' the School
         Meals       Service         that    evening.            During       the        course       of        the    evening
         I     received         regular       up-dates           from     Mr        Purchon          and        his     staff,
         particularly           in     relation         to     the      mortuary          arrangements                and     the
         use of the Medico-Legal Centre.                             Regular contacts were maintained
         with Mr Snaith who was                     attending the rest centres and the Chief

   Continuation of statement of



          Executive was              fully briefed.                    The afore-mentioned actions                            formed
          a     continuous          sequence              of     events       which           began    with        the      initial
          contact by Mr               Pur chon            and    extended         late        into     the       evening.             The
          pressure          of    the      problem             did not allow time                     for     a    transfer            to
          a central base               in the             Town Hall.             Contacts had been                    established
          and people knew where                           I was.         The potential                for    confusion,               had
          a    move       been     attempted,               would        have      been        considerable.                 I    did,
          however,          transfer        operations              to a central control                         office      in the
          Town       Hall     on     the       morning           of     Sunday        16       April    and        this       centre
          provided          the    focus        for        all     information and decision making                                    for
          many       days     after        the        disaster.            The      action           taken       by    the       Local
          Authority in terms of care, comfort and counselling of the bereaved
          was    the       subject        of      a    letter dated 5 May                       1989 which             I sent          to
          Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry Team, for the attention of Inspector
          Burrows, in response to a telephone enquiry from that Team.

          of    occasions           prior         to       the     Hillsborough               disaster,           notably,            the
          industrial             action      by        manual         workers         in      the     Water        Industry            in
          January         1983,      the       discovery           of     a World War                II bomb          at    Lancing
          Road       in    February        1985,           the     discovery           of      levels        of    methane            gas

          satelite "Cosmos                1900"        crashing in the UK in the Autumn of 1988.

     NOTES OF MEETING BETWEEN SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE, DISTRICT^'EMERGENCY LIAISON
              OFFICERS, AND SOUTH YORKSHIRE FCDA EMERGENCY PLANNING UNIT
                           Emergency Planning Unit, Barnsley
                              15 September, 1989 - 2.30 pm.
                                        MINUTES

2.    Call-out protocols. '
      It was generally felt that it was useful for the different agencies to be in
      regular contact so that they were familiar with each others responsibilities
      and resource capabilities in the event of a disaster.
      There was much discussion about the merits of making radio appeals to get
      staff to an incident.     Some felt that this should not happen and that
      the District emergency plan should   be adhered to.  Others felt that in
      certain circumstances such an appeal was beneficial.
      It was felt that it would be useful if District officers had some highly
      visibleform of    identification, (eg. tabards) when they turned up at an
      incident so that the Police could help them get through.    There is a danger
      that if   toomany people think they can help then roads and access points get
      clogged   up. The Police may be needed to get both local authority staff and
      equipment through to the scene of a disaster.
      In general the Police Officers on the ground are not aware of the Districts'
      plans or arrangements.    However, they should contact the South Yorkshire
      Police Operations Room in the event of a disaster as all of Malcolm
      Edmundson's staff are aware of       the Districts' emergency  arrangements.
      Malcolm Edmundson is trying to make sure that middle ranking officers are
      also aware of these arrangements.
      District liaison officers emphasised that Police contact should primarily be
      with their main call-out points who will alert all other council staff.
      Malcolm Edmundson agreed to call   a meeting to discuss lessons learnt
      following the Hillsborough disaster once the Inquiry report has been
      released.




                                         -   1   -
Exercises
Barnsley aim to have an exercise every 18 mdnths. The next is planned for 17
November 1989.   Roy Foster has issued reports on their November 1987 and
December 1988 exercises.
Malcolm Edmundson said the Police would be willing to participate in any
exercise.   Contact should initially be made through Malcolm Edmundson's
office but local Divisional Police would probably be involved as well.


Resources
The District representatives emphasised that different departments in each
District may have different responsibilities and resources. Therefore it was
important for police contact to be through the District Controller.   It was
felt that resources could not be listed in any great detail in plans as they
were constantly changing.                                                   (


Rest Centres
All Districts have rest centres earmarked in their emergency plans.       The
choice of exact centre to be used would;, be made when it was needed taking
into account the prevailing circumstances.   The Sheffield experience is that
it is preferable to co-locate rest centres with feeding centres.
All District representatives stated that they did not want the voluntary
services to take over setting up rest centres as this created many problems.


Church Initiatives
Archdeacon Lowe of Sheffield is currently preparing a call-out plan for the
clergy in the event of a disaster where counselling is required.         At
Hillsborough many priests had problems getting into the ground.   This plan
will designate an incident controller    to sort out clergy, eg. different
denominations, etc.                                                    (
There was some debate as to whether the District controllers should alert the
clergy or the police should do this directly.      It was agreed that if the
Archdeacon's plan was limited to the clergy and providing a counselling
service then the police should contact them directly.   However, if there was
any role in the plan which overlapped local authority services then the
District Controller should alert the clergy via social services.    This will
be clarified by the Police after liaison with the Arch Deacon.


Home Secretary's statement to CACFOA, 5 September 1989.
The Home Secretary has announced that Fire and Civil Defence Authorities r.re
to be given a new power to co-ordinate the Districts peacetime emergency
planning.   He is looking for a legislative opportunity to introduce this so
the timetable is currently unclear.   However, he has stressed that the main
role for peacetime emergency planning is to remain with the Districts and he
does not intend to merely give Fire and Civil Defence Authorities powers
under section 138 of the Local Government Act.   The Districts could however
create an agency agreement under section 101 of the Local Government Act
1972, to contract the FCDA to carry out their peacetime emergency planning.
A paper will go to CoCo on 24 September 1989.
8.   Chief Executives* Seminar
     Simon Turney passed a copy of a letter from Somerset County Council to the
     District representatives   concerning  the response   to an emergency    in
     Metropolitan areas.   District representatives were asked to forward any
     comments to Simon Turney for incorporation in an Emergency Planning College
     exercise.


9.   Role of the Hazrdous Haste Unit
     Following the meeting between the District liaison officers and the       Fire
     Service Susan Small had investigated the   role of theHazardous Waste Unit in
     an emergency.    The Hazardous Waste Unit is now based in Rotherham.      They
     should be called out via any of the four Chief Environmental Health Officers,
     but in practice they are often contacted directly.      Their role is purely
     advisory.  They will provide information   about wastematerials     but   theywil
     not remove them or dispose of them.


10. Cycle For Future Meetings.
     It was agreed that the group should aim to meet once per year.   Malcolm
     Edmondson agreed to call a further meeting once the Hillsborough Inquiry
     report was released to discuss lessons learnt.

(1)      My name is                                                I have been employed by Sheffield
         City       Council    since         1966    in     a    variety       of   administrative            posts.
         I    was     appointed         Principal         Assistant        in    the     Administration             and
         Legal      Department          in   1982.        My    duties     have     included     the      role       of
         Emergency       Liaison         Officer       for      major     peacetime emergencies                since
         that time.


(2)      Section       138    of    the      Local        Government       Act      1972    enables       a    Local
         Authority to incur expenditure in taking action which is calculated
         to avert, alleviate or erradicate the effects or potential effects
         of     an emergency            or   disaster involving destruction of,                        or danger
         to, life or property.


(3)      Sheffield       City       Council         has    had      an    emergency        peacetime      plan       at
         least since the 1960's,                    although there is no statutory provision
         requiring       such       a    plan.       The        basis     of    Sheffield      City      Council's
         emergency peacetime plan and my role as Emergency Liaison Officer
         has     not    changed         significantly            since     1982.         The   demise         of    the

                        (C.J. Act 1967,a.9| M.C. Act 1980, a.l02j M.C. Rulea 1981, r,70)


Continuation of statement of


         South        Yorkshire           County       Council        in       1986     and        the    establishment
         of     the     South        Yorkshire          Fire       and     Civil       Defence           Authority          were
         not     fundamental              to    the     operation          of    the        City     Council's          Plan.
         Obviously,            the       demise        of    the     County           Council       meant        that        its
         functions          were         distributed          to,     for       example,           the    City       Council
         and     the     Joint           Authorities          and     there          were,        therefore,         changes
         in the contact points for these services.


(4)      The    City        Council's           Plan    is     supplementary                to    the     Police       Scheme
         for Major Disasters and although it will usually be brought into
         operation at the discretion of the Senior Police Officer concerned,
         action can also be instigated by any Senior Departmental Officer.
         A    major     disaster           in    peacetime may              occur       in       many     forms        and    so
         requires definition                   to distinguish it from the routine incidents
         that     are    the        day-to-day          sole concern of the                      emergency       services.
         Neither        the     numbers         of     persons       involved,          nor        the    scale        of    the
         damage by          themselves would necessarily determine the                                         involvement
         of     local       authority           resources           and    a     major           peacetime       emergency
         is    therefore            defined       in    the      Plan      as        "any    disaster          or    serious
         disruption            of    life       arising       with       little        or    no     warning,         causing
         or threatening death or serious injury to, or rendering homeless,
         such     numbers           of    persons       in excess          of    those           which    can       be dealt
         with    by     the     Local          Authority and Public                   Services          operating under
         normal       procedures            and which          calls       for       special        mobilisation             and
         organisation of those                    services.           In these circumstances, my role
         is    to inform the               Chief       Executive or             the     Head       of    Administration
         and Legal Department of the emergency and, under her/his direction,
         to    act     as      Liaison         Officer       between the             departments           and      services
         involved       and         produce      any        progress       or    other       reports           required by
         her/him.           The plan identifies a number of departments and outlines
         their       roles      and      responsibilities                in a major              peacetime       emergency
         situation.             The       relevant          departments          are        required        to      draw      up
         and      maintain               departmental           plans           to     meet         the        roles         and
         responsibilities                 placed       upon     them.           The    response           of     the    local
         authority in a major peacetime emergency situation may thus involve
         any or all            the       departments          concerned,         depending           upon       the nature
         and demands of the situation.

Continuation of statement of



(5)      The    version         of       the    Plan dated December                   1980 was revised by me,
         on behalf of the Chief Executive,                                    in October        1987 and the final
         draft was approved by the Chief Executive, prior to its circulation
         within        the     Authority             and     to     the       emergency        services,         adjoining
         local        authorities              and    various           other       bodies.         In     revising       the
         Plan,        full         and     detailed          consultations              were        held    within        the
         Authority           and     with       the        South    Yorkshire           Fire     and      Civil       Defence
         Authority           who,        through       their        Emergency          Planning          Unit    with     its
         team     of     full-time             professional              officers,        were       able       to     pursue
         contacts         across           the        range        of     emergency          services           and     local
         authorities throughout South Yorkshire and North East Derbyshire,
         and offer invaluable assistance and advice in compiling the revised
         Plan.        Although the Plan had been up-dated in terms of personnel
         changes        on     a     periodic         basis,        it    was       considered           appropriate       at
         that time, to adopt arrangements whereby in future a full revision
         of the Plan would be undertaken,                                 at least        every alternate year.
         To     this     end       arrangements             were        put    in    hand      on    18    January       1989
         to undertake a further revision of the Council's Emergency Plan,
         with     a view to the                  circulation            of a revised version during the
         Spring of 1989.                  These arrangements were overtaken by the disaster
         at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989 and the completion of a revised
         document was set back in order to take into account and incorporate
         in     the     Plan,        issues          and    lessons           learned     from      the    Hillsborough
         disaster.


(6)      The review has included:-


         (a)      a memorandum from me to appropriate Chief Officers requesting
                   comments          on        the    plan         in    the      light     of      the    Hillsborough
                   disaster;


          (b)     a     meeting          between       myself           and    officers        from       the    Education
                   and       Family        Community          Services            Departments        on    8 June        1989
                   to    look        at     the       lessons       to       be     learned      from      Hillsborough,
                   with        particular            reference          to     closer       co-ordination             between
                   emergency rest centres and feeding;

         (c)        the initiation by the Chief Publicity Officer of corporate
                    discussions             on     the       information          and        communications            aspects
                    of     the    Council's                 Plan    with     other           organisations             and    the
                    emergency services; and


         (d)        measures          to     include          in    the     draft       revised       Plan       an officer
                    with       expertise              in     emergency            communications,                details        of
                    contact points in adjoining local authorities and additional
                    points       of        contact          in a     variety       of        departments         within       the
                    Council.


 (7)     The    revised          draft       of       the Council's           Peacetime            Emergency Plan was
         also     prepared            in    consultation             with    the South Yorkshire Fire and
         Civil Defence Authority, taking into account the issues highlighted
         in    the       above    review           and       meetings       with        emergency         services.           The
         revised         draft        is     currently             awaiting       the        approval       of    the     ^hief
         Executive.              In     accordance            with        previous           practice,          the    revised
         draft       identifies             an     'initial         action'        procedure          for       the    Police.
         The     plan      does        not       require        a    code     word       for       implementation             and
         the question             of       code words has not been mentioned at any of iny
         meetings with the emergency services.

         the    Director          of       Health       and Consumer              Services         (Mr David Purchon)
         at my home, shortly before 5.00 pm on 15 April 1989.                                                   The Director
         gave me         an outline              of    the     situation          and his          assessment of what
         was needed.             I have a copy of the City Council's Scheme for Major
         Peacetime Emergencies which is kept at my home and I immediately
         contacted          the        (then)         Chief        Executive           (Mr    Ian     Podmore)          at     his
         home       to    appraise           him       of    the     situation.               I    then    contacted           the
         Assistant          Director             of    Family        and     Community             Services       (Mr        David

         the     implementation                  of    his      Department's             role       in     the        Emergency

         accommodation and care of the homeless.                                       His Department had already

 Continuation of statement of



         disaster       and        a    temporary           centre          was     being       established             at    the
         Hillsborough            Boys'         Club.         This       telephone          call       was        immediately
         followed       by       a      call        from        me     to     the       (then)        Acting           Head     of
         Administration                and    Legal        Department             (Mr    Mark     Webster).               I was
         informed       that           the     Assistant             Chief        Personnel       Officer              (Safety,
         Health and Welfare)                   (Mr Patrick O'Neill) had already made contact
         with    the South Yorkshire Police HQ at iSnig Hill and had offered
         the    services         of      the     Local          Authority.              I was     not       contacted           by
         South       Yorkshire          Police        during          the     course       of     Saturday             evening.


(9)      I    then    commenced              arrangements            for     the     provision,            if     necessary,
         of meals       for persons attending the rest centres.                                            This was done
         through       the      Principal           Administrative                Assistant       in the Education
         Department          (Mr       Brian     Evans)          who       was     requested          by    me     to      place
         on     standby         the          School        Meals       Service           but     to     await           further
         instructions           before         commencing            the     preparation          of       food.         I ^ en
         reported these arrangements back                               to Mr       Snaith who was                to inform
         me    if    and when           they     were        required.             It    was     not       yet    clear       how
         many       persons      would         attend        the       rest       centres       nor     for       how      long,
         but    3 centres          had been opened up at Burngreave Vestry Hall,                                              the
         Kelvin Community Centre and the Sacred Heart Church Hall.                                                       Social
         Workers       were        attached           to     distressed            families        on       a     one-to-one
         basis.       I ascertained from Mr Snaith that the Hospitals and Police
         had    clear     instructions               as     to where          the       rest    centres were.                 The
         Burngreave          Vestry          Hall      was       not       required        and    was        subsequently
         closed but the Kelvin and Sacred Heart Centres continued to operate
         overnight.          Mr Snaith subsequently informed me that the Education
         Department's           emergency             feeding          arrangements            were        not     required,
         food    being       provided          by     the WRVS          at Kelvin           and by volunteers                   at
         the Sacred Heart Centre and I was able to                                       'stand-down' the School

  Continuation of statement of



          Executive was             fully briefed.                    The afore-mentioned actions                         formed
          a    continuous           sequence             of     events which             began        with     the       initial
          contact         by Mr     Purchon           and       extended          late    into     the evening.                   The
          pressure          of    the     problem             did    not        allow time        for    a     transfer            to
          a central base                in the Town Hall.                       Contacts had been established
          and people knew where                       I was.              The    potential        for    confusion,               had
          a    move       been     attempted,             would           have    been     considerable.                 I    did,
          however,         transfer        operations                to    a central control office                      in the
          Town       Hall     on    the        morning          of    Sunday        16    April        and     this       centre
          provided          the    focus        for       all       information          and decision making                      for
          many       days     after       the       disaster.              The     action        taken       by    the       Local
          Authority in terms of care, comfort and counselling of the bereaved
          was    the       subject        of    a     letter         dated       5 May      1989 which             I   sent to
          Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry Team, for the attention of Inspector
          Burrows, in response to a telephone enquiry from that Team.

          industrial             action     by       manual          workers        in    the     Water        Industry            in
          January         1983,     the        discovery             of    a World War           II bomb          at    Lancing
          Road       in    February        1985,          the       discovery       of     levels       of methane                gas

                              15 September, 1989 - 2.30 pm.
                                        MINUTES

2.    Call-out protocols. ’
      It was generally felt that it was useful for the different agencies to be in
      regular contact so that they were familiar with each others responsibilities
      and resource capabilities in the event of a disaster.
      There was much discussion about the merits of making radio appeals to get
      staff to an incident.     Some felt that this should not happen and that
      the District emergency plan should be adhered to.    Others felt that in
      certain circumstances such an appeal was beneficial.
      It was felt that it would be useful if District officers had some highly
      visible form of identification, (eg. tabards) when they turned up at an
      incident so that the Police could help them get through.   There is a danger
      that if too many people think they can help then roads and access points get
      clogged up.   The Police may be needed to get both local authority staff and
      equipment through to the scene of a disaster.
      In general the Police Officers on the ground are not aware of the Districts'
      plans or arrangements.    However, they should contact the South Yorkshire
      Police Operations Room in the event of a disaster as all of Malcolm
      Edmundson's staff are aware of the Districts'       emergency arrangements.
      Malcolm Edmundson is trying to make sure that middle ranking officers are
      also aware of these arrangements.
      District liaison officers emphasised that Police contact should primarily be
      with their main call-out points who will alert all other council staff.
      Malcolm Edmundson agreed to call a meeting to discuss lessons learnt
      following the Hillsborough disaster once the Inquiry report has been
      released.




                                         - 1 -
 Exercises
 Barnsley aim to have an exercise every 18 mbnths. The next is planned for 17
 November 1989.   Roy Foster has issued reports on their November 1987 and
 December 1988 exercises.
 Malcolm Edmundson said the Police would be willing to participate in any
 exercise.   Contact should initially be made through Malcolm Edmundson's
 office but local Divisional Police would probably be involved as well.


 Resources
The District representatives emphasised that different departments in each
District may have different responsibilities and resources. Therefore it was
important for police contact to be through the District Controller.   It was
felt that resources could not be listed in any great detail in plans as they
were constantly changing.                                                  /


Rest Centres
All Districts have rest centres earmarked in their emergency plans.       The
choice of exact centre to be used would, be made when it was needed taking
into account the prevailing circumstances.   The Sheffield experience is that
it is preferable to co-locate rest centres with feeding centres.
All District representatives stated that they did not want the voluntary
services to take over setting up rest centres as this created many problems.


Church Initiatives
Archdeacon Lowe of Sheffield is currently preparing a call-out plan for the
clergy in the event of a disaster where counselling is required.         At
Hillsborough many priests had problems getting into the ground.   This plan
will designate an incident controller    to sort out clergy, eg. different
denominations^ etc.
There was some debate as to whether the District controllers should alert the
clergy or the police should do this directly.      It was agreed that if the
Archdeacon's plan was limited to the clergy and providing a counselling
service then the police should contact them directly. However, if there was
any role in the plan which overlapped local authority services then the
District Controller should alert the clergy via social services.    This will
be clarified by the Police after liaison with the Arch Deacon.


Home Secretary*s statement to CACFOA, 5 September 1989.
 The Home Secretary has announced that Fire and Civil Defence Authorities r.re
 to be given a new power to co-ordinate the Districts peacetime emergency
 planning.   He is looking for a legislative opportunity to introduce this so
 the timetable is currently unclear.   However, he has stressed that the main
 role for peacetime emergency planning is to remain with the Districts and he
 does not intend to merely give Fire and Civil Defence Authorities powers
 under section 138 of the Local Government Act.   The Districts could however
 create an agency agreement under section 101 of the Local Government Act
'1972, to contract the FCDA to carry out their peacetime emergency planning.
 A paper will go to CoCo on 24 September 1989.
8   .   Chief Executives* Seminar
        Simon Turney passed a copy of a letter from Somerset County Council to the
        District representatives   concerning  the response   to an emergency    in
        Metropolitan areas.   District representatives were asked to forward any
        comments to Simon Turney for incorporation in an Emergency Planning College
        exercise.


9.      Role of the Hazrdous Haste Unit
        Following the meeting between the District liaison officers and the       Fire
        Service Susan Small had investigated the   role of theHazardous Waste Unit in
        an emergency.    The Hazardous Waste Unit is now based in Rotherham.      They
        should be called out via any of the four Chief Environmental Health Officers,
        but in practice they are often contacted directly.      Their role is purely
        advisory.  They will provide information   about waste materials    but  theywil
        not remove them or dispose of them.


10. Cycle For Future Meetings.
        It was agreed that the group should aim to meet once per year.   Malcolm
        Edmondson agreed to call a further meeting once the Hillsborough Inquiry
        report was released to discuss lessons learnt.

(1)       My name is                                             I have been employed by Sheffield
          City       Council    since        1966    in     a variety          of    administrative           posts.
          I    was     appointed        Principal         Assistant       in        the   Administration           and
          Legal      Department         in   1982.        My duties       have        included    the     role of
          Emergency       Liaison        Officer        for major        peacetime          emergencies        since
          that time.


(2)       Section       138    of   the      Local        Government          Act    1972    enables      a    Local
          Authority to incur expenditure in taking action which is calculated
          to avert, alleviate or erradicate the effects or potential effects
          of    an emergency            or   disaster involving destruction of,                        or danger
          to, life or property.


(3)       Sheffield       City      Council         has    had    an     emergency          peacetime     plan       at
          least since the           1960's,         although there is no statutory provision
          requiring       such      a    plan.       The     basis       of    Sheffield        City    Council's
          emergency peacetime plan and my role as Emergency Liaison Officer
          has     not    changed         significantly           since    1982.           The   demise        of    the

Continuation of statement of


         South       Yorkshire             County       Council         in         1986     and        the    establishment
         of    the        South       Yorkshire         Fire        and      Civil          Defence          Authority         were
         not     fundamental              to     the    operation              of     the      City      Council's          Plan.
         Obviously,             the       demise       of     the      County            Council        meant        that       its
         functions             were       distributed           to,     for         example,           the    City       Council
         and     the          Joint       Authorities          and     there             were,     therefore,            changes
         in the contact points for these services.


(4)      The    City           Council's Plan           is      supplementary                to    the       Police       Scheme
         for    Major Disasters and although it                                will usually be brought into
         operation at the discretion of the Senior Police Officer concerned,
         action can also be instigated by any Senior Departmental Officer.
         A    major           disaster      in    peacetime           may        occur       in    many       forms       and    so
         requires             definition       to distinguish it from the routine incidents
         that       are       the    day-to-day         sole concern                 of the emergency services.
         Neither          the       numbers      of     persons        involved,             nor       the    scale       of    the
         damage          by    themselves would necessarily                              determine the involvement
         of     local          authority         resources            and      a     major        peacetime          emergency
         is    therefore             defined       in    the      Plan         as     "any        disaster         or    serious
         disruption             of     life      arising        with        little        or      no    warning,         causing
         or threatening death or serious injury to, or rendering homeless,
         such       numbers          of    persons       in     excess         of     those which             can be dealt
         with       by    the       Local      Authority and Public                       Services       operating under
         normal          procedures           and which          calls         for       special        mobilisation            and
         organisation of those services.                                In these            circumstances, my role
         is    to    inform the             Chief Executive                 or      the     Head       of Administration
         and    Legal Department of the emergency                                and, under her/his direction,
         to     act       as        Liaison Officer            between         the       departments           and services
         involved             and    produce      any progress                 or     other       reports          required by
         her/him.             The plan identifies a number of departments and outlines
         their       roles          and   responsibilities                in       a major         peacetime emergency
         situation.                 The    relevant         departments               are      required         to      draw     up
         and        maintain              departmental            plans             to      meet        the        roles        and
         responsibilities                  placed       upon      them.             The     response          of    the     local
         authority in a major peacetime emergency situation may thus involve
         any    or all           the      departments          concerned,             depending upon the nature
         and demands of the situation.

Continuation of statement of



(5)      The version            of    the    Plan       dated        December          1980 was revised by me,
         on behalf of the Chief Executive,                                 in October 1987 and the final
         draft was approved by the Chief Executive, prior to its circulation
         within         the    Authority          and     to     the        emergency          services,         adjoining
         local        authorities           and     various           other          bodies.        In revising           the
         Plan,         full     and       detailed        consultations                were       held       within       the
         Authority            and    with     the       South    Yorkshire             Fire       and     Civil       Defence
         Authority            who,    through        their       Emergency             Planning         Unit     with     its
         team      of     full-time          professional                 officers,       were       able       to     pursue
         contacts         across           the     range        of        emergency          services           and     local
         authorities throughout South Yorkshire and North East Derbyshire,
         and offer invaluable assistance and advice in compiling the revised
         Plan.         Although the Plan had been up-dated in terms of personnel
         changes        on     a     periodic       basis,       it        was       considered         appropriate        at
         that time, to adopt arrangements whereby in future a full revision
         of the Plan would be undertaken,                                 at    least every alternate year.
         To     this     end        arrangements          were        put       in    hand     on   18      January 1989
         to undertake a further revision of the Council's Emergency Plan,
         with     a view           to the        circulation          of a revised version during the
         Spring of 1989.               These arrangements were overtaken by the disaster
         at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989 and the completion of a revised
         document was set back in order to take into account and incorporate
         in     the     Plan,        issues       and     lessons           learned       from theHillsborough
         disaster.

          (a)      a memorandum from me to appropriate Chief Officers requesting
                   comments          on     the     plan        in        the    light       of     the    Hillsborough
                   disaster;

                   and        Family      Community        Services             Departments          on    8 June        1989
                   to     look       at     the     lessons          to    be     learned         from Hillsborough,
                   with        particular          reference          to        closer    co-ordination               between

                    discussions             on     the      information            and        communications             aspects
                    of     the     Council's               Plan       with     other          organisations             and      the
                    emergency services; and


          (d)       measures          to     include            in    the    draft        revised Plan an officer
                    with       expertise              in    emergency              communications,                 details        of
                    contact points in adjoining local authorities and additional
                    points       of     contact            in    a     variety       of    departments within                    the
                    Council.


 (7)     The     revised         draft       of the Council's                   Peacetime Emergency Plan was
         also     prepared in              consultation                with the South Yorkshire Fire and
         Civil Defence Authority, taking into account the issues highlighted
         in     the      above     review          and      meetings          with       emergency          services.            The
         revised         draft        is     currently               awaiting      the        approval        of    the
         Executive.              In    accordance               with        previous          practice,          the     revised
         draft        identifies           an      'initial           action'       procedure           for       the    Police.
         The     plan      does        not       require          a    code     word       for       implementation              and
         the     question         of code words has not been mentioned at any of my
         meetings with the emergency services.


(8)      I    was     first       contacted             regarding            the     Hillsborough                disaster,        by
         the     Director         of       Health and Consumer Services                              (Mr David Purchon)
         at my home, shortly before 5.00 pm on 15 April 1989.                                                    The Director
         gave me         an      outline of the                  situation and his assessment of what
         was needed.             I have a copy of the City Council's Scheme for Major
         Peacetime Emergencies which is kept at my home and I immediately
         contacted          the        (then)         Chief          Executive          (Mr     Ian     Podmore)            at   his
         home       to    appraise           him      of    the        situation.             I      then    contacted           the
         Assistant          Director             of    Family          and    Community              Services       (Mr       David

         the     implementation                  of    his        Department's             role       in     the       Emergency

        Hillsborough            Boys'        Club.         This        telephone         call        was     immediately
        followed         by      a     call     from        me     to    the     (then)               Acting Head          of
        Administration                and    Legal        Department          (Mr     Mark      Webster).               I was
        informed        that          the     Assistant           Chief       Personnel          Officer           (Safety,
        Health and Welfare)                   (Mr Patrick O'Neill) had already made contact
        with the South Yorkshire Police HQ at Snig Hill and had offered
        the     services          of    the     Local          Authority.            I    was     not contacted             by
        South       Yorkshire          Police        during        the course            of       Saturday evening.


(9)     I    then     commenced             arrangements           for the       provision,            if     necessary,
        of meals        for persons attending                      the rest centres.                   This was done
        through       the       Principal          Administrative             Assistant          in     the    Education
        Department          (Mr       Brian     Evans)          who     was     requested            by me     to       place
        on     standby          the         School        Meals       Service        but        to     await        further
        instructions            before        commencing           the preparation               of     food.       I ^ en
        reported these arrangements back                               to Mr Snaith who was                    to inform
        me    if    and when           they     were        required.           It was          not    yet     clear       how
        many       persons       would        attend        the    rest       centres         nor      for    how        long,
        but 3 centres had been opened up at Burngreave Vestry Hall,                                                        the
        Kelvin Community Centre and the Sacred Heart Church Hall.                                                       Social
        Workers        were       attached           to     distressed           families             on a    one-to-one
        basis.        I ascertained from Mr Snaith that the Hospitals and Police
        had     clear     instructions             as      to where        the       rest     centres were.                The
        Burngreave          Vestry          Hall      was       not     required          and    was        subsequently
        closed but the Kelvin and Sacred Heart Centres continued to operate
        overnight.            Mr Snaith subsequently informed me that the Education
        Department's            emergency            feeding          arrangements            were      not    required,
         food being provided by                      the WRVS           at Kelvin and by volunteers                            at
        the Sacred Heart Centre and I was able to 'stand-down' the School
        Meals       Service          that     evening.            During       the       course       of     the    evening
         I    received          regular        up-dates           from     Mr       Purchon          and     his        staff,
        particularly            in     relation           to     the    mortuary          arrangements             and     the
        use of the Medico-Legal                      Centre.           Regular contacts were maintained
        with Mr Snaith who was                       attending the rest centres and the Chief

          Executive was             fully briefed.                    The afore-mentioned actions                        formed
          a    continuous          sequence              of    events       which        began        with    the     initial
          contact by Mr             Purchon           and      extended          late    into     the        evening.          The
          pressure          of    the     problem             did    not    allow       time     for     a     transfer             to
          a central base              in       the    Town Hall.             Contacts had been established
          and people             knew where           I was.             The potential           for     confusion,            had
          a    move       been     attempted,              would         have     been    considerable.                  I    did,
          however,          transfer       operations               to a central           control          office       in the
          Town       Hall     on    the        morning          of       Sunday    16     April        and    this       centre
          provided          the    focus            for all information and decision                              making           for
          many       days     after       the        disaster.             The    action        taken        by    the       Local
          Authority in terms of care, comfort and counselling of the bereaved
          was    the       subject        of    a     letter         dated       5 May     1989 which              I sent           to
          Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry Team, for the attention of Inspector
          Burrows, in response to a telephone enquiry from that Team.

     NOTES OF MEETING BETWEEN SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE, DISTRICT"EMERGENCY LIAISON
              OFFICERS, AND SOUTH YORKSHIRE FCDA EMERGENCY PLANNING UNIT
                          Emergency Planning Unit, Barnsley
                              15 September, 1989 - 2.30 pm.
                                        MINUTES

2.    Call-out protocols. '
      It was generally felt that it was useful for the different agencies to be in
      regular contact so that they were familiar with each others responsibilities
      and resource capabilities in the event of a disaster.
      There was much discussion about the merits of making radio appeals to get
      staff to an incident.     Some felt that this should not happen and that
      the District emergency plan should be adhered to.    Others felt that in
      certain circumstances such an appeal was beneficial.
      It was felt that it would be useful if District officers had some highly
      visible form of    identification, (eg. tabards) when they turned up at an
      incident so   that the Police could help   them getthrough.  There is a danger
      that if too   many people think they can   help thenroads and access points get
      clogged up.    The Police may be needed to get both local authority staff and
      equipment through to the scene of a disaster.
      In general the Police Officers on the ground are not aware of the Districts'
      plans or arrangements.    However, they should contact the South Yorkshire
      Police Operations Room in the event of a disaster as all of Malcolm
      Edmundson's staff are aware of the Districts'       emergency arrangements.
      Malcolm Edmundson is trying to make sure that middle ranking officers are
      also aware of these arrangements.
      District liaison officers emphasised that Police contact should primarily be
      with their main call-out points who will alert all other council staff.
      Malcolm Edmundson agreed to call a meeting to discuss lessons learnt
      following the Hillsborough disaster once the Inquiry report has been
      released.




                                          _   1   _
Exercises
Barnsley aim to have an exercise every 18 mdnths. The next is planned for 17
November 1989.   Roy Poster has issued reports on their November 1987 and
December 1988 exercises.
Malcolm Edmundson said the Police would be willing to participate in any
exercise.   Contact should initially be made through Malcolm Edmundson's
office but local Divisional Police would probably be involved as well.


Resources
The District representatives emphasised that different departments in each
District may have different responsibilities and resources. Therefore it was
important for police contact to be through the District Controller.   It was
felt that resources could not be listed in any great detail in plans as they
were constantly changing.


Rest Centres
All Districts have rest centres earmarked in their emergency plans.       The
choice of exact centre to be used would- be made when it was needed taking
into account the prevailing circumstances.   The Sheffield experience is that
it is preferable to co-locate rest centres with feeding centres.
All District representatives stated that they did not want the voluntary
services to take over setting up rest centres as this created many problems.


Church Initiatives
Archdeacon Lowe of Sheffield is currently preparing a call-out plan for the
clergy in the event of a disaster where counselling is required.         At
Hillsborough many priests had problems getting into the ground. This plan
will designate an incident controller    to sort out clergy, eg. different
denominations, etc.
There was some debate as to whether the District controllers should alert the
clergy or the police should do this directly.      It was agreed that if the
Archdeacon's plan was limited to the clergy and providing a counselling
service then the police should contact them directly. However, if there was
any role in the plan which overlapped local authority services then the
District Controller should alert the clergy via social services.    This will
be clarified by the Police after liaison with the Arch Deacon.


Home Secretary's statement to CACFOA, 5 September 1989.
 The Home Secretary has announced that Fire and Civil Defence Authorities r.re
 to be given a new power to co-ordinate the Districts peacetime emergency
 planning.  He is looking for a legislative opportunity to introduce this so
 the timetable is currently unclear.   However, he has stressed that the main
 role for peacetime emergency planning is to remain with the Districts and he
 does not intend to merely give Fire and Civil Defence Authorities powers
 under section 138 of the Local Government Act.   The Districts could however
 create an agency agreement under section 101 of the Local Government Act
"1972, to contract the FCDA to carry out their peacetime emergency planning.
 A paper will go to CoCo on 24 September 1989.
8.   Chief Executives' Seminar
     Simon Turney passed a copy of a letter from Somerset County Council to the
     District   representatives   concerning the response to an emergency     in
     Metropolitan areas.    District representatives were asked to forward, any
     comments to Simon Turney for incorporation in an Emergency Planning College
     exercise.


9.   Role of the Hazrdous Waste Unit
     Following the meeting between the District liaison officers and the      Fire
     Service Susan Small had investigated the role of the Hazardous Waste Unit in
     an emergency.    The Hazardous Waste Unit is now based in Rotherham.     They
     should be called out via any of the four Chief Environmental Health Officers,
     but in practice they are often contacted directly.      Their role is purely
     advisory.  They will provide information about waste materials but they will
     not remove them or dispose of them.


10„ Cycle For Future Meetings.
     It was agreed that the group should aim to meet once per year.   Malcolm
     Edmondson agreed to call a further meeting once the Hillsborough Inquiry
     report was released to discuss lessons learnt.

(1)      My name is                                                    I have been employed by Sheffield

         City       Council       since          1966    in     a    variety        of     administrative           posts.
         I    was        appointed          Principal         Assistant        in        the   Administration            and

         Legal       Department             in   1982.        My     duties    have        included     the     role       of

         Emergency          Liaison          Officer      for       major     peacetime           emergencies        since

         that time.



(2)      Section          138   of      the      Local        Government       Act         1972    enables      a    Local
         Authority to incur expenditure in taking action which is calculated
         to avert, alleviate or erradicate the effects or potential effects
         of    an    emergency              or   disaster involving destruction of,                          or danger

                                          STATEMENT OF WITNESS
                          (C.J. Act 1967,a.9; M.C. Act 1980, «.102( M.C. Rulaa 1981, r.70)


Continuation of statement of


         South       Yorkshire             County        Council              in        1986    and        the    establishment
         of    the        South       Yorkshire          Fire           and    Civil           Defence          Authority          were
         not     fundamental              to     the     operation                 of    the        City     Council's          Plan.
         Obviously,             the       demise        of        the     County             Council        meant        that       its
         functions            were        distributed             to,     for           example,           the     City      Council
         and     the       Joint          Authorities             and     there              were,        therefore,         changes
         in the contact points for these services.


(4)      The     City         Council's          Plan        is    supplementary                    to    the    Police       Scheme
         for Major Disasters and although it will usually be brought into
         operation at the discretion of the Senior Police Officer concerned,
         action can also be instigated by any Senior Departmental Officer.
         A    major       disaster          in     peacetime             may        occurin many                  forms       and    so
         requires definition to distinguish                                    it from the routine incidents
         that       are    the       day-to-day          sole       concern of the emergency services.
         Neither          the    numbers         of      persons          involved, nor                    the    scale       of    the
         damage          by themselves would necessarily determine the involvement
         of     local         authority          resources              and        a     major           peacetime        emergency
         is    therefore             defined       in    the        Plan           as    "any        disaster          or    serious
         disruption             of    life       arising          with        little           or    no     warning,         causing
         or threatening death or serious injury to, or rendering homeless,
         such       numbers          of    persons       in        excess          of    those which               can be       dealt
         with       by    the Local Authority and Public                                      Services operating under
         normal          procedures          and      which        calls           for       special mobilisation                   and
         organisation of those                     services.              In these              circumstances, my role
         is    to    inform the Chief                    Executive             or       the Head           of Administration
         and Legal Department of the emergency and, under her/his direction,
         to    act       as     Liaison        Officer            between          the       departments           and      services
         involved          and       produce       any       progress              or    other           reports    required by
         her/him.             The plan identifies a number of departments and outlines
         their       roles       and responsibilities                         in       a major           peacetime        emergency
         situation.              The       relevant          departments                 are        required        to      draw     up
         and        maintain              departmental              plans               to     meet         the        roles        and
         responsibilities                  placed       upon        them.               The    response           of    the     local
         authority in a major peacetime emergency situation may thus involve
         any    or all          the departments                   concerned,             depending upon the nature
         and demands of the situation.

Continuation of statement of



(5)      The    version         of       the    Plan       dated       December 1980 was revised by me,
         on behalf of the Chief                        Executive,             in October 1987 and the final
         draft was approved by the Chief Executive, prior to its circulation
         within       the      Authority             and     to     the       emergency          services,         adjoining
         local       authorities               and    various           other          bodies.        In     revising       the
         Plan,       full          and       detailed        consultations                were        held    within        the
         Authority           and     with       the        South       Yorkshire         Fire       and     Civil       Defence
         Authority           who,        through       their        Emergency            Planning          Unit    with     its
         team      of    full-time             professional                 officers,       were       able       to     pursue
         contacts         across             the      range        of       emergency          services           and     local
         authorities throughout South Yorkshire and North East Derbyshire,
         and offer invaluable assistance and advice in compiling the revised
         Plan.       Although the Plan had been up-dated in terms of personnel
         changes        on     a     periodic          basis,          it    was       considered          appropriate       at
         that time, to adopt arrangements whereby in future a full revision
         of the Plan would be undertaken,                                   at least every alternate year.
         To    this      end       arrangements             were        put       in    hand     on    18 January          1989
         to undertake a further revision of the Council's Emergency Plan,
         with     a view           to    the       circulation          of a revised version during the
         Spring of 1989.                  These arrangements were overtaken by the disaster
         at Hillsborough on 15 April                           1989 and the completion of a revised
         document was set back in order to take into account and incorporate
         in    the      Plan,        issues          and    lessons          learned       from       the    Hillsborough
         disaster.

         (a)       a memorandum from me to appropriate Chief Officers requesting
                   comments             on     the    plan        in        the    light       of     the    Hillsborough
                   disaster;


         (b)       a meeting              between          myself       and       officers       from       the    Education
                   and       Family          Community        Services            Departments          on    8    June     1989
                   to    look        at      the      lessons          to    be     learned         from     Hillsborough,
                   with        particular            reference          to        closer    co-ordination               between
                   emergency rest centres and feeding;

                      discussions             on     the      information             and     communications           aspects
                      of     the    Council's                Plan       with     other        organisations            and    the
                      emergency services; and


           (d)        measures          to     include            in    the     draft       revised Plan          an officer
                      with       expertise              in     emergency              communications,             details       of
                      contact points in adjoining local authorities and additional
                      points       of        contact         in    a     variety of          departments within               the
                      Council.


 (7)      The     revised draft                of       the Council's Peacetime Emergency Plan was
          also     prepared             in    consultation               with    the South Yorkshire Fire and
          Civil Defence Authority, taking into account the issues highlighted
          in     the       above    review           and      meetings          with       emergency       services.          The
          revised          draft        is     currently               awaiting       the     approval       of    the
          Executive.               In    accordance               with        previous        practice,         the    revised
          draft        identifies             an     'initial           action'        procedure       for       the   Police.
          The     plan       does        not       require          a    code     word       for    implementation            and
          the     question          of code words has not been mentioned at any of                                              my
          meetings with the emergency services.


(8 )      I     was    first        contacted              regarding            the    Hillsborough             disaster,       by
          the     Director          of       Health       and Consumer Services                     (Mr David Purchon)
          at my home, shortly before 5.00 pm on 15 April 1989.                                                  The Director
          gave me          an outline              of    the       situation and his assessment of what
          was needed.              I have a copy of the City Council's Scheme for Major
          Peacetime Emergencies which is kept at my home and I immediately
          contacted           the       (then)          Chief          Executive        (Mr    Ian     Podmore)          at    his
          home        to    appraise           him      of     the       situation.           I     then    contacted          the
          Assistant           Director             of    Family          and     Community          Services       (Mr       David
          Snaith)          who     was       at     this      time       still        at his       home,    and requested
          the     implementation                   of    his        Department's             role    in     the       Emergency
          Plan     with       particular                reference         to     the    provision          of    rest centre
          accommodation and care of the homeless.                                       His Department had already
          taken        active       steps          to     get      Social        Workers       to    the     scene       of    the

 Continuation of statement of



        disaster        and      a     temporary          centre           was     being      established                 at    the
        Hillsborough            Boys'        Club.         This        telephone         call        was        immediately
        followed        by       a     call        from        me     to     the       (then)        Acting           Head       of
        Administration               and    Legal         Department             (Mr Mark       Webster).                  I was
        informed        that         the     Assistant              Chief        Personnel       Officer              (Safety,
        Health and Welfare)                  (Mr Patrick O'Neill) had already made contact
        with the South Yorkshire                         Police HQ at Snig Hill and had offered
        the     services         of    the     Local           Authority.           I was        not       contacted             by
        South       Yorkshire          Police        during          the     course      of     Saturday              evening.


(9)     I    then     commenced            arrangements             for     the provision,                if     necessary,
        of meals        for persons            attending the rest centres.                                This was done
        through       the       Principal          Administrative                Assistant       in       the     Education
        Department           (Mr      Brian    Evans)           who    was        requested          by    me        to       place
        on     standby          the        School        Meals        Service          but      to     await           further
        instructions            before       commencing             the preparation             of        food.           I
        reported these               arrangements           back to Mr Snaith who was                            to inform
        me    if    and     when       they    were        required.              It was       not        yet    clear how
        many       persons       would       attend        the        rest       centres      nor      for       how          long,
        but 3 centres had been opened up at Burngreave Vestry Hall, the
        Kelvin Community Centre and the Sacred Heart Church Hall.                                                         Social
        Workers       were         attached         to     distressed             families       on        a     one-to-one
        basis.       I ascertained from Mr Snaith that the Hospitals and Police
        had    clear      instructions              as    to where the rest                   centres           were.           The
        Burngreave          Vestry          Hall     was        not     required         and     was        subsequently
        closed but the Kelvin and Sacred Heart Centres continued to operate
        overnight.           Mr Snaith subsequently informed me that the Education
        Department's            emergency           feeding           arrangements           were         not     required,
        food being provided                   by    the WRVS           at Kelvin and by volunteers at
        the Sacred Heart Centre and I was able to 'stand-down' the School
        Meals       Service          that    evening.               During       the    course       of        the     evening
        I     received          regular       up-dates              from     Mr     Purchon          and        his       staff,
        particularly            in     relation           to    the        mortuary      arrangements                 and       the
        use of the Medico-Legal Centre.                               Regular contacts were maintained
        with Mr Snaith who was                      attending the rest centres and the Chief

          a     continuous          sequence             of    events       which        began    with        the      initial
          contact         by Mr         Purchon and              extended late            into    the        evening.        The
          pressure          of    the     problem             did    not    allow        time    for     a    transfer        to
          a central base             in the Town Hall.                          Contacts       had been established
          and    people          knew where           I was.           The potential             for    confusion,           had
          a    move       been      attempted,                would    have       been     considerable.                I did,
          however,        transfer         operations               to a central           control          office in the
          Town       Hall     on    the        morning          of     Sunday      16     April       and     this      centre
          provided          the    focus        for       all       information          and    decision making              for
          many       days    after        the       disaster.              The    action        taken       by   the     Local
          Authority in terms of care, comfort and counselling of the bereaved
          was    the      subject         of    a     letter dated               5 May     1989 which            I    sent to
          Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry Team, for the attention of Inspector
          Burrows, in response to a telephone enquiry from that Team.


(10)      The City Council's plan has been tested or rehearsed on a number
          of    occasions           prior       to       the        Hillsborough          disaster,          notably,        the
          industrial             action     by      manual           workers       in     the    Water        Industry        in
          January         1983,     the        discovery of             a World          War    II bomb          at    Lancing
          Road       in   February         1985,          the discovery            of     levels        of    methane        gas
          on a housing estate in September 1987 and the threat of a Russian
          satelite        "Cosmos 1900" crashing in the UK in the Autumn of 1988.

          annual          basis.         Over        the        past       two     years        these        meetings have

     NOTES OF MEETING BETWEEN SOOTH YORKSHIRE POLICE, DISTRICT~EMEftGENCY LIAISON
              OFFICERS, AND SOOTH YORKSHIRE FCDA EMERGENCY PLANNING ONIT
                          Emergency Planning Onit, Barnsley
                              15 September, 1989 - 2.30 pm.
                                        MINUTES


1.    Present:
      Chief Inspector Malcolm Edmundson, South Yorkshire Police.
      Sergeant                South Yorkshire Police.
      Roy Foster, Emergency Planning Officer, Barnsley MBC.
      Tom Keegan, Director of Public Works, Doncaster MBC
      Peter Nettleton, Deputy Director, Department of Legal and Administrative
      Services, Rotherham MBC
                 Emergency Liaison Officer, Sheffield MDC.
      Jane Nicklen, Sheffield District Emergency Planning Officer, SYFCDA.
      Susan Small, Rotherham District Emergency Planning Officer, SYFCDA.
      Phil Chappell, Barnsley Assistant District Emergency Planning Officer,
      SYFCDA.
      Peter Hall, Doncaster Assistant District Emergency Planning Officer, SYFCDA.
      Phil Webber, Deputy Director of Emergency Planning, SYFCDA.
      Simon Turney, Director of Emergency Planning, SYFCDA (items 7 - 1 0 only).


2.    Call-out protocols. '
      It was generally felt that it was useful for the different agencies to be in
      regular contact so that they were familiar with each others responsibilities
      and resource capabilities in the event of a disaster.
      There was much discussion about the merits of making radio appeals to get
      staff to an incident.     Some felt that this should not happen and that
      the District emergency plan should be adhered to.    Others felt that in
      certain circumstances such an appeal was beneficial.
      It was felt that it would be useful if District officers had some highly
      visible form of    identification, (eg. tabards) when they turned up at an
      incident so   that the Police could help   them get through. There is a danger
      that if too   many people think they can   help then roads andaccess points get
      clogged up.    The Police may be needed to get both local authority staff and
      equipment through to the scene of a disaster.
      In general the Police Officers on the ground are not aware of the Districts'
      plans or arrangements.    However, they should contact the South Yorkshire
      Police Operations Room in the event of a disaster as all of Malcolm
      Edmundson's staff are aware of the Districts'       emergency arrangements.
      Malcolm Edmundson is trying to make sure that middle ranking officers are
      also aware of these arrangements.
      District liaison officers emphasised that Police contact should primarily be
      with their main call-out points who will alert all other council staff.
      Malcolm Edmundson agreed to call a meeting to discuss lessons learnt
      following the Hillsborough disaster once the Inquiry report has been
      released.

3.    Exercises
      Barnsley aim to have an exercise every 18 mbnths. The next is planned for 17
      November 1989.   Roy Foster has issued reports on their November 1987 and
      December 1988 exercises.
      Malcolm Edmundson said the Police would be willing to participate in any
      exercise.   Contact should initially be made through Malcolm Edmundson's
      office but local Divisional Police would probably be involved as well.


4.    Resources
     The District representatives emphasised that different departments in each
     District may have different responsibilities and resources. Therefore it was
     important for police contact to be through the District Controller.   It was
     felt that resources could not be listed in any great detail in plans as they
     were constantly changing.


5.   Rest Centres
     All Districts have rest centres earmarked in their emergency plans.       The
     choice of exact centre to be used would:, be made when it was needed taking
     into account the prevailing circumstances.   The Sheffield experience is that
     it is preferable to co—locate rest centres with feeding centres.
     All District representatives stated that they did not want the voluntary
     services to take over setting up rest centres as this created many problems.


6.   Church Initiatives
     Archdeacon Lowe of Sheffield is currently preparing a call-out plan for the
     clergy in the event of a disaster where counselling is required.         At
     Hillsborough many priests had problems getting into the ground.   This plan
     will designate an incident controller    to sort out clergy, eg. different
     denominations, etc.
     There was some debate as to whether the District controllers should alert the
     clergy or the police should do this directly.      It was agreed that if the
     Archdeacon's plan was limited to the clergy and providing a counselling
     service then the police should contact them directly. However, if there was
     any role in the plan which overlapped local authority services then the
     District Controller should alert the clergy via social services.    This will
     be clarified by the Police after liaison with the Arch Deacon.


7.   Home Secretary's statement to CACFOA, 5 September 1383.
      The Home Secretary has announced that Fire and Civil Defence Authorities r.re
      to be given a new power to co-ordinate the Districts peacetime emergency
      planning.   He is looking for a legislative opportunity to introduce this so
      the timetable is currently unclear.   However, he has stressed that the main
      role for peacetime emergency planning is to remain with the Districts and he
      does not intend to merely give Fire and Civil Defence Authorities powers
      under section 138 of the Local Government Act.   The Districts could however
      create an agency agreement under section 101 of the Local Government Act
     "1972, to contract the PCDA to carry out their peacetime emergency planning.
      A paper will go to CoCo on 24 September 1989.



                                      -   2   -
8.   Chief Executives' Seminar
     Simon Turney passed a copy of a letter from Somerset County Council to the
     District representatives   concerning  the response   to an emergency    in
     Metropolitan areas.   District representatives were asked to forward any
     comments to Simon Turney for incorporation in an Emergency Planning College
     exercise.


9.   Role of the Hazrdous Waste Onit
     Following the meeting between the District liaison officers and the Fire
     Service Susan Small had investigated the role of the Hazardous Waste Unit in
     an emergency.    The Hazardous Waste Unit is now based in Rotherham.     They
     should be called out via any of the four Chief Environmental Health Officers,
     but in practice they are often contacted directly.      Their role is purely
     advisory.  They will provide information about waste materials but they will
     not remove them or dispose of them.


10. Cycle For Future Meetings.
     It was agreed that the group should aim to meet once per year.   Malcolm
     Edmondson agreed to call a further meeting once the Hillsborough Inquiry
     report was released to discuss lessons learnt.

DRAFT STATEMENT


 (1)   My name is                                                 I have been employed by Sheffield
       City        Council     since     1966     in        a    variety        of    administrative             posts.
       I     was    appointed         Principal        Assistant            in     the      Administration             and
       Legal Department               in 1982.        My        duties     have       included the role                 of
       Emergency       Liaison         Officer        for       major      peacetime emergencies                  since
       that time.


 (2)   Section       138     of    the Local          Government           Act        1972    enables        a    Local
       Authority to incur expenditure in taking action which is calculated
       to avert, alleviate or erradicate the effects or potential effects
       of an emergency or                disaster involving destruction of, or danger
       to, life or property.


 (3)   Sheffield            City Council         has had          an     emergency           peacetime       plan       at
       least since the 1960's, although there is no statutory provision
       requiring             such a    plan.          The       basis      of    Sheffield          City     Council's
       emergency peacetime plan and my role as Emergency Liaison Officer
       has     not     changed        significantly              since „1982.              The      demise       of    the
       South        Yorkshire         County     Council           in      1986      and     the     establishment
       of     the     South       Yorkshire       Fire          and     Civil        Defence       Authority          were
       not     fundamental          to the       operation            of    the        City      Council's        Plan.
       Obviously,             the demise         of    the        County         Council         meant     that        its
       functions            were distributed to,                   for      example,         the     City        Council
       and     the     Joint       Authorities and                 there        were,       therefore,           changes
       in the contact points for these services.


 (4)   The    City     Council's         Plan     is        supplementary             to     the     Police       Scheme
       for Major Disasters and although it will usually be brought into
       operation at the discretion of the Senior Police Officer concerned,
       action can also be instigated by any Senior Departmental Officer.
       A     major     disaster        in   peacetime            may       occur      in many        forms       and    so
       requires definition to distinguish it from the routine incidents
       that are the day-to-day                    sole          concern of the emergency services.
       Neither        the     numbers       of   persons          involved,           nor     the    scale       of    the
       damage by themselves would necessarily determine the involvement
                                               - 2 -


of     local       authority          resources       and     a    major      peacetime          emergency
is    therefore          defined       in    the     Plan    as     "any     disaster          or     serious
disruption          of    life     arising         with     little      or    no warning,             causing
or threatening death or serious injury to, or rendering homeless,
such    numbers          of    persons       in    excess     of those which               can be       dealt
with by the Local                Authority and Public Services operating under­
normal      procedures           and which          calls    for       special      mobilisation‘ and
organisation of those services.                           In these circumstances, my role
is to inform the Chief                      Executive       or     the Head of Administration
and Legal Department of the emergency and, under her/his direction,
to    act     as    Liaison      Officer          between     the departments              and services
involved       and       produce       any    progress       or other reports               required by
her/him.           The plan identifies a number of departments and outlines
their roles and responsibilities                           in a major peacetime                  emergency
situation.           The       relevant       departments           are      required       to      draw   up
and     maintain              departmental           plans        to      meet      the        roles       and
responsibilities               placed       upon     them.        The     response        of    the     local
authority in a major peacetime emergency situation may thus involve
any or ali the departments concerned,                               depending upon the nature
and demands of the situation.


The version of the                Plan dated           December 1980 was               revised by m e ,
on behalf of the Chief Executive,                            in October 1987 and the final
draft was approved by the Chief Executive, prior to its circulation
within      the      Authority         and     to    the     emergency         services,         adjoining
local       authorities          and     various          other     bodies.         In     revising        the
Plan,       full      and       detailed          consultations           were      held       within      the
Authority          and    with     the       South    Yorkshire         Fire     and      Civil       Defence
Authority          who,       through       their     Emergency         Planning         Unit       with   its
team     of     full-time         professional             officers,         were    able        to    pursue
contacts           across       the     range        of     emergency         services          and     local
authorities throughout South Yorkshire and North East Derbyshire,
and offer invaluable assistance and advice in compiling the revised
Plan.       Although the Plan had been up-dated in terms of personnel
changes        on    a    periodic       basis,       it     was    considered           appropriate        at

that time, to adopt arrangements whereby in future a full revision
of the Plan would be undertaken,                      at least every alternate year.
To    this    end    arrangements         were    put    in     hand    on    18    January     1989
toundertake a further                 revision of       the Council's Emergency Planr
with a view         to    the circulation         of     a revised version during the
Spring of 1989.            These arrangements were overtaken by the disaster
at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989 and the completion of a revised
document was set back in order to take into account and incorporate
in    the    Plan,       issues     and   lessons       learned      from     the    Hillsborough
disaster.


The review has included;-


(a)     a memorandum from me to appropriate Chief Officers requesting
        comments         on    the    plan     in the        light   of      the    Hillsborough
        disaster;


(b)     a meeting          between myself         and    officers' from             the    Education
        and    Family         Community      Services        Departments       on    8 June     1989
        to    look       at   the    lessons     to     be    learned     from      Hillsborough,
        with    particular           reference to        closer        co-ordination         between
        emergency rest centres and feeding;


(c)     the    initiation by the Chief Publicity Officer of corporate
        discussions           on    the   information         and    communications           aspects
        of     the        Council's       Plan with other            organisations            and the
        emergency services; and


(d)     measures         to   include     in   the     draft     revised      Plan        an officer
        with        expertise        in    emergency         communications,              details   of
         contact points in adjoining local authorities and additional
         points       of      contact     in a variety of departments within                        the
         Council.


The    reviseddraft of             the Council's         Peacetime Emergency                 Plan was
also prepared            in consultation with the South Yorkshire                            Fire and
Civil Defence Authority, taking into account the issues highlighted
                                                           - 4 -


       in    the       above    review             and meetings with emergency                         services.             The
       revised         draft        is       currently       awaiting          the     approval            of    the    Chief
       Executive.             In        accordance          with       previous        practice,            the    revised
       draft       identifies            an        'initial      action'       procedure          for       the    Police.
       The    plan       does          not    require        a    code    word       for        implementation               and
       the question            of code words has not been mentioned at any of my
       meetings with the emergency services.


(8)    I    was     first       contacted             regarding          the    Hillsborough               disaster,          by
       the Director            of        Health and Consumer Services                           (Mr David Purchon)
       at my home, shortly before 5.00 pm on 15 April 1989.                                                 The Director
       gave me         an outline              of the       situation and his assessment of what
       was needed.             I have a copy of the City Council's Scheme for Major
       Peacetime Emergencies which is kept at my home and I immediately
       contacted         the           (then)       Chief     Executive          (Mr    Ian       Podmore)             at    his
       home       to    appraise             him    of    the     situation.           I    then        contacted            the
       Assistant         Director             of     Family       and     Community          Services            (Mr    David
       Snaith)         who     was       at     this      time     still at his             home,          and requested
       the     implementation                 of     his     Department's            role        in     the       Emergency
       Plan       with    particular               reference       to     the provision               of        rest centre
       accommodation and care of the homeless.                                   His Department had already
       taken       active       steps          to    get     Social Workers             to       the       scene       of    the
       disaster          and       a     temporary          centre       was     being       established               at    the
       Hillsborough             Boys'          Club.        This       telephone        call          was       immediately
       followed          by     a        call       from     me     to     the       (then)           Acting       Head       of
       Administration                  and    Legal        Department          (Mr     Mark      Webster).              I was
       informed          that          the     Assistant          Chief        Personnel          Officer          (Safety,
       Health and Welfare)                      (Mr Patrick O'Neill) had already made contact
       with the South Yorkshire Police HQ at Snig Hill and had offered
       the     services            of    the       Local      Authority.             I was       not        contacted         by
       South        Yorkshire            Police          during    the     course          of    Saturday          evening.


 (9)   I     then      commenced             arrangements          for the        provision,               if    necessary,
       of meals          for persons attending the rest centres.                                           This was done
       through          the    Principal             Administrative            Assistant          in the Education
       Department             (Mr       Brian       Evans)       who     was    requested             by    me     to       place
       on      standby          the          School       Meals        Service        but        to        await       further

        instructions                                              before                             commencing                                         the preparation                of        food.               I then
        reported these arrangements back to Mr Snaith who was to inform
        me               if         and. when                                       they were                                            required.                      It was       not yet clear how
        many                  persons                                 would                          attend                               the            rest       centres         nor         for          how         long,
        but 3 centres had been opened up at Burngreave Vestry Hall, the
        Kelvin Community Centre and the Sacred Heart Church Hall.                                                                                                                                                    Social
        Workers                             were                        attached                                      to                 distressed                     families          on          a      one-to-one
        basis.                           I ascertained from Mr Snaith that the Hospitals and Police
        had clear instructions                                                                                       as               to where the rest centres were.                                                      The
        Burngreave                                        Vestry                                Hall                       was                    not         required         and       was           subsequently
        closed but the Kelvin and Sacred Heart Centres continued to operate
        overnight.                                          Mr Snaith subsequently informed me that the Education
        Department's                                                emergency                                          feeding                           arrangements               were          not              required,
        food being                                           provided by                                                   the WRVS at Kelvin and by volunteers at
        the Sacred                                           Heart Centre and I was able to                                                                                   'stand-down' the School

DRAFT STATEMENT


 (1)   My name is                                                      I have been employed by Sheffield
       City Council since 1966 in a variety of administrative posts.
       I was appointed Principal Assistant in the Administration and
       Legal Department in 1982.                          My duties have included the role of
       Emergency Liaison Officer for major peacetime emergencies since
       that time.


 (2)   Section       138       of       the       Local      Government            Act    1972        enables          a    Local
       Authority to incur expenditure in taking action which is calculated
       to avert, alleviate or erradicate the effects or potential effects
       of    an     emergency               or   disaster        involving destruction                      of,    or danger
       to, life or property.


 (3)   Sheffield          City          Council        has      had    an     emergency             peacetime          plan       at
       least      since       the       1960's,          although there is no statutory provision
       requiring          such          a    plan.        The     basis       of     Sheffield             City    Council's
       emergency peacetime plan and my role as Emergency Liaison Officer
       has     not       changed             significantly            since        1982.           The     demise          of    the
       South        Yorkshire               County       Council       in     1986        and        the .establishment
       of     the       South       Yorkshire            Fire     and        Civil       Defence           Authority            were
       not fundamental to the operation of the City Council's Plan.


 (4)   The    City       Council's                Plan    is     supplementary                to     the    Police          Scheme
       for Major Disasters and although it will usually be brought into
       operation at the discretion of the Senior Police Officer concerned,
       action can also be instigated by any Senior Departmental Officer.
       A     major      disaster             in    peacetime          may     occur        in      many      forms         and     so
       requires definition                       to distinguish              it from the routine incidents
       that       are    the       day-to-day             sole    concern of the                   emergency        services.
       Neither          the    numbers            of     persons       involved,           nor       the     scale         of     the
       damage       by     themselves would necessarily determine                                          the    involvement
       of     local       authority               resources           and     a    major           peacetime       emergency
       is     therefore            defined          in    the     Plan       as     "any        disaster          or       serious
       disruption             of    life          arising       with        little       or     no    warning,             causing
       or threatening death or serious injury to, or rendering homeless,
       such       numbers          of       persons       in     excess       of    those          which     can       be       dealt
with    by    the       Local       Authority and Public                    Services       operating under
normal       procedures          and       which       calls       for      special      mobilisation              and
organisation             of    those         services".            In       these     circumstances,                my
role is to inform the Chief Executive or the Head of Administration
and Legal Department of the emergency and, under her/his direction,
to    act    as     Liaison          Officer         between       the      departments          and       services
involved       and       produce          any   progress          or     other      reports           required      by
her/him.          The plan identifies a number of departments and outlines
their       roles       and    responsibilities              in     a. major        peacetime           emergency
situation.              The    relevant          departments             are      required        to       draw     up
and      maintain             departmental              plans          to      meet        the        roles        and
responsibilities               placed          upon     them.       'jthe      response          of    the       local
authority in a major peacetime emergency situation may thus involve
any    or    all     the       departments            concerned,         depending upon                the nature
and demands of the situation.


The    version          of    the    Plan       dated      December           1980 was      revised by me,
on behalf          of    the Chief           Executive,         in October 1987 and the final
draft        was        approved          by     the       Chief         Executive,         prior           to     its
circulation.             In revising the Plan, full and detailed consultations
were held within the Authority and with the South Yorkshire Fire
and Civil Defence Authority who, through their Emergency Planning
Unit with          its       team of full-time professional officers,                                   were able
to     pursue       contacts         across          the    range        of    emergency          services         and
local        authorities             throughout            South        Yorkshire          and        North       East
Derbyshire, and offer invaluable assistance and advice in compiling
the revised Plan.                    Although         the Plan had been up-dated                           in terms
of     personnel             changes       on    a     periodic          basis,       it    was        considered
appropriate at that time,                       to adopt arrangements whereby in future
a full revision of                   the Plan would be undertaken,                           at least every
alternate          year.        To     this      end       arrangements           were     put        in    hand    on
18 January 1989 to undertake a further revision of the Council's
Emergency Plan, with a view to the circulation of a revised version
during       the        Spring       of    1989.           These       arrangements          were          overtaken
by the disaster at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989 and the completion
of a revised document was                        set back in order to take into account
and     incorporate             in     the      Plan,       issues          and   lessons         learned         from
the Hillsborough disaster.
(6)    The review has included:-


       (a)         a memorandum from me to appropriate Chief Officers requesting

                   comments          on     the       plan       in        the     light     of     the        Hillsborough

                   disaster;



       (b)     a        meeting           between         myself       and officers           from       theEducation
                   and     Family         Community          Services Departments                   on    8      June       198 9
                   to    look       at     the        lessons         to    be     learned        from     Hillsborough,
                   with       particular             reference         to        closer      co-ordination            between
                   emergency rest centres and feeding?


       (c)         the    initiation             by    the Chief            Publicity         Officer of corporate
                   discussions             on    the      information              and communications                aspects
                   of     the    Council's Plan                 with        other        organisations            and        the
                   emergency services; and                                                                                   ,


       (d)         measures          to    include          in   the        draft       revised      Plan       an    officer
                   with       expertise              in     emergency             communications,              details        of
                   contact points in adjoining local authorities and additional
                   points       of     contact             in    a    variety of departments                   within        the
                   Council.


 (7)   The    revised           draft       of       the Council's               Peacetime        Emergency Plan was
       also    prepared           in      consultation               with        the   South Yorkshire               Fire    and
       Civil Defence Authority, taking into account the issues highlighted
       in the review and meetings with emergency services and the revised
       draft       is currently awaiting the approval of the Chief Executive.
       In accordance with previous practice, the revised draft identifies
       an     'initial          action'          procedure            for the           Police.          The     plan       does
       not    require           a code          word      for    implementation               and    the       question       of
       code        words      has         not    been       mentioned at               any   of   my     meetings           with
       the emergency services.


(8)    I     was     first       contacted                regarding              theHillsborough           disaster,          by
       the    Director           of       Health       and Consumer Services                      (Mr David Purchon)
       at my home, shortly before 5.00 pm on 15 April 1989.                                                    The Director
       gave me           an   outline           of    the    situation and his                    assessment          of what
was needed.              I have a copy of the City Council's Scheme for Major
Peacetime Emergencies which is kept at my home and I immediately
contacted          the        (then)         Chief       Executive            (Mr       Ian        Podmore)          at    his
home       to     appraise          him      of     the       situation.                I    then        contacted         the
Assistant Director of Family and Community Services                                                      (Mr D Snaith)
who     was       at     this        time         still       at     his      home,           and       requested          the
implementation                of     his      Department's               role       in       the        Emergency         Plan
with        particular              reference            to     the        provision               of     rest        centre
accommodation and care of the homeless.                                       His Department had already
taken       active        steps         to    get       Social        Workers           to        the    scene       of    the
disaster          and     a     temporary              centre        was      being          established             at    the
Hillsborough             Boys'          Club.           This       telephone            call        was     immediately
followed           by     a     call         from       me      to      the        (then)          Acting        Head( of
Administration                and       Legal       Department.                I    was       informed           that      the
Assistant           Chief       Personnel              Officer          (Safety,            Health        and    Welfare)
had    already made                 contact        with        the      South ybrkshire                   Police      HQ    at
Snig       Hill     and       had    offered           the     services            of       the    Local       Authority.
       A

I was        not contacted by                  South Yorkshire                 Police             during the course
of     Saturday           evening. ^           I       then     commenced               arrangements             for       the
provision,             if necessary,               of meals          for persons attending the rest
centres.            This       was        done '-through                the     Principal               Administrative
Assistant           in    the       Education           Department             (Mr      Brian           Evans)       who was
requested           by    me       to     place         on    standby         the        School          Meals       Service
but to await further instructions before commencing the preparation
of     food.        I then          reported            these      arrangements               back        to    Mr    Snaith
who    was        to     inform         me    if       and    when      they        were          required.           It was
not        yet    clear       how       many       persons         would        attend            the     rest       centres
nor for how long,                    but 3 centres had been opened up at Burngreave
Vestry           Hall,    the        Kelvin        Community            Centre          and       the     Sacred          Heart
Church Hall.              'Social Workers were attached to distressed families
on     a    one-to-one             basis.          I    ascertained            from          Mr     Snaith       that       the
Hospitals          and Police had clear instructions                                        as to where the rest
centres          were.         The      Burngreave             Vestry         Hall      was        not    required          and
was        subsequently            closed         but     the      Kelvin and Sacred Heart                           Centres
continued           to    operate overnight.                       Mr    Snaith             subsequently          informed
me that the Education Department's emergency feeding arrangements
        were    not       required,           food       being          provided            by   the     WRVS     at       Kelvin
        and    by    volunteers          at the Sacred                      Heart      Centre      and I was           able    to
        'stand-down1 the                School          Meals         Service          that      evening.        During       the
        course of the evening I“ received regular up-dates from Mr Purchon
        and     his           staff,        particularly               ' in       relation          to     the        mortuary
        arrangements             and     the       use       of       the     Medico-Legal              Centre.        Regular
        contacts          were    maintained                with       Mr     Snaith         who    was    attending          the
        rest     centres         and        the        Chief       Executive            was      fully     briefed.           The
        afore-mentioned                actions          formed          a    continuous            sequence       of       events
        which began with                the       initial          contact by Mr                 Purchon and extended
        late into the evening.                         The pressure of the problem did not allow
        time for a transfer to a central base in the <^own Hall.                                                      Contacts
        had been established and people knew where I was.                                                   The potential
        for     confusion,             had        a     move          been        attempted,            would     have       been
        considerable.  I did, however, transfer operations to a central
                          *
        control office in the Town Hall on the morning of Sunday 16 April
        and this centre provided the focus for all information and decision
        making       for       many     days          after       the       disaster.            The     action    taken       by
        the     Local         Authority           in    terms          of     care,         comfort      and    counselling
        Of     the       bereaved       was       the       subject          of    a    letter         dated    5 May        1989
        which        I    sent     to       Lord       Justice          Taylor's            Inquiry       Team,        for    the
        attention of Inspector Burrows, in response to a telephone enquiry
        from that Team.


(10 )   The City Council's plan has been tested or rehearsed on a number,
        of     occasions          prior        to       the       Hillsborough              disaster,          notably,       the
        industrial             action       by        manual          workers          in    the    Water       Industry        in
        January          1983,     the      discovery             of        a World War            II    bomb    at    Lancing
        Road     in       February       1985,          the       discovery            of     levels      of    methane       gas
        on a housing estate in September 1987 and the threat of! a Russian
        satelite          "Cosmos 1900" crashing in the UK in the Autumn of 1988.

DRAFT STATEMENT


 (1)   My name is                                                     .    I have been employed by Sheffield

       City       Council        since       1966           in    a       variety           of    administrative                po s t s .

       I    was     appointed          Principal                 Assistant             in    the        Administration                and

       Legal      Department           in        1982.           My       duties       have       included           the    role       of
       Emergency          Liaison        Officer             for          major       peacetime          emergencies             since

       that time.


 (2)   Section          138     of    the        Local        Government               Act        1972     enables          a    Local

       Authority to incur expenditure in taking action which is calculated
       to avert, alleviate or erradicate the effects or potential effects
       of    an     emergency          or    disaster             involving             destruction             of,    or danger

       to, life or property.


 (3)   Sheffield              City Council              has       had       an     emergency             peacetime          plan       at

       least      since       the     1960's,           although            there       is no statutory provision

       requiring              such a        plan.           The        basis       of       Sheffield           City       Council's
       emergency peacetime plan and my role as Emergency Liaison Officer

       has     not       changed        significantly                      since       1982.            The     demise          of    the

       South        Yorkshire          County           Council             in     1986          and     the     establishment

       of     the       South        Yorkshire           Fire             and    Civil           Defence       Authority             were
       not     fundamental             to        the     operation                of    the        City       Council's           Plan.

       Obviously,             the     demise           of         the County                Council           meant        that       its

       functions              were distributed                    to,       for        example,           the    City           Council
       and     the        Joint       Authorities                 and       there        were,          therefore,              changes

       in the contact points for these services.


 (4)   The     City       Council's              Plan       is        supplementary               to     the     Police          Scheme

       for Major Disasters                   and although                   it will          usually be brought                      into

       operation at the discretion of the Senior Police Officer concerned,
       action       can also be instigated by any Senior Departmental Officer.

       A     major       disaster           in    peacetime                may     occur          in    many     forms          and    so

       requires          definition          to        distinguish               it     from       the routine             incidents
       that       are     the     day-to-day             sole          concern         of        the    emergency          services.

       Neither          the     numbers          of     persons             involved,             nor     the    scale          of    the

       damage        by    themselves             would          necessarily             determine             the    involvement
                                                           - 2 -


      of     local         authority           resources              and       a     major       peacetime          emergency

      is    therefore             defined           in    the        Plan       as    "any       disaster          or     serious

      disruption             of     life       arising          with        little          or    no    warning,          causing
      or threatening death or serious                                 injury to,             or rendering homeless,

      such       numbers          of     persons          in    excess          of    those        which       can      be     dealt

      with       by    the        Local       Authority             and    Public          Services         operating          under
      normal          procedures           and      which           calls       for       special       mobilisation ' and

      organisation            of        those       services.             In     these       circumstances,               my    role

      is    to    inform           the    Chief          Executive          or       the    Head       of    Administration
      and Legal Department of the emergency and, under her/his direction,

      to    act       as     Liaison          Officer          between          the       departments          and      services

      involved          and       produce        any       progress             or    other       reports          required       by
      her/him.             The plan identifies a number of departments and outlines

      their       roles       and        responsibilities                  in       a major        peacetime          emergency
      situation.              The        relevant          departments                are        required       to       draw     up

      and        maintain               departmental                 plans           to     meet        the        roles         and

      responsibilities                   placed          upon        them.           The    response          of     the       local

      authority in a major peacetime emergency situation may thus involve

      any    or       all     the       departments             concerned,            depending          upon       the nature

      and demands of the situation.


(5)   The    version          of        the    Plan       dated       December             1980 was          revised by me,
      on behalf of the Chief                             Executive,            in October 1987 and the final
      draft was approved by the Chief Executive, prior to its circulation
      within          the     Authority             and        to    the       emergency           services,            adjoining
      local       authorities                 and    various              other       bodies.           In     revising          the
      Plan,           full        and     detailed             consultations                were        held       within        the
      Authority             and     with       the       South        Yorkshire             Fire       and    Civil        Defence
      Authority             who,        through          their        Emergency             Planning         Unit       with     its
      team       of        full-time           professional                officers,             were       able     to      pursue
      contacts             across         the        range           of     emergency             services           and       local
      authorities throughout South Yorkshire and North East Derbyshire,
      and offer invaluable assistance and advice in compiling the revised
      Plan.           Although the Plan had been up-dated in terms of personnel
      changes          on     a     periodic             basis,       it     was          considered         appropriate          at
                                                             - 3 -



      that time, to adopt arrangements whereby in future a full revision

      of    the    Plan would              be        undertaken,                at       least     every    alternate         year.
      To     this        end arrangements                  were            put       in     hand    on     18    January         1989

      to undertake              a    further          revision of the Council's                             Emergency         Plan,

      with    a    view        to        the    circulation                 of       a    revised version             during      the
      Spring of 1989.                    These arrangements were overtaken by the disaster

      at Hillsborough                on        15 April          1989 and the completion of a revised

      document was set back in order to take into account and incorporate

      in     the        Plan,        issues          and lessons                 learned           from    the    Hillsborough

      disaster.



(6)   The review has included


      (a)     a memorandum from me to appropriate Chief Officers requesting

              comments               on        the    plan            in        the       light     of     the    Hillsborough
              disaster;


      (b)     a        meeting       between           myself              and        officers       from       the    Education
                  and    Family           Community             Services                 Departments        on    8    June       1989

                  to    look        at     the        lessons              to    be       learned        from    Hillsborough,

              with        particular                 reference              to        closer       co-ordination            between
                  emergency rest centres and feeding;



      (c)     the       initiation              by    the       Chief            Publicity          Officer of corporate
                  discussions              on    the information                          and      communications           aspects

                  of     the        Council's              Plan        with           other        organisations           and     the

                  emergency services; and


      (d)     measures              to    include           in        the        draft       revised       Plan       an   officer

                  with     expertise                 in      emergency                    communications,             details       of

                  contact points                in adjoining local authorities and additional

                  points        of       contact           in     a    variety              of    departments         within       the

                  Council.


(7)   The    revised        draft          of        the    Council's                    Peacetime       Emergency         Plan was

      also    prepared              in     consultation                with           the    South       Yorkshire         Fire    and

      Civil Defence Authority, taking into account the issues highlighted
in    the       above        review          and    meetings        with       emergency          services.                The

revised          draft       is        currently        awaiting         the        approval          of    the       Chief

Executive.              In       accordance           with       previous           practice,          the       revised
draft       identifies             an        'initial       action'        procedure            for       the    Police.

The    plan       does           not    require        a     code    word          for    implementation                   and

the    question          of       code       words     has    not     been mentioned                  at    any       of my
meetings with the emergency services.



I    was        first    contacted                 regarding       the     Hillsborough               disaster,             by
the    Director          of       Health        and    Consumer          Services         (Mr David             Purchon)

at my home,            shortly before 5.00 pm on 15 April 1989.                                        The Director
gave    me       an     outline          of    the     situation         and       his    assessment             of       what
was needed.              I have a copy of the City Council's Scheme for Major

Peacetime Emergencies                        which     is kept at my home and                         I immediately
contacted          the           (then)       Chief     Executive             (Mr    Ian     Podmore)             at       his

home       to    appraise              him    of     the     situation.             I     then       contacted             the
Assistant          Director             of     Family        and     Community            Services          (Mr       David

Snaith)          who    was        at     this      time     still       at    his       home,       and     requested
the     implementation                  of     his     Department's                role     in       the     Emergency

Plan       with       particular              reference       to     the      provision          of       rest       centre

accommodation and care of the homeless.                                       His Department had already
taken        active       steps          to     get    Social        Workers         to     the       scene          of    the

disaster          and        a    temporary           centre       was     being          established                at    the

HillsMorough             Boys'          Club.         This       telephone           call       was        immediately

followed          by     a        call        from     me     to     the        (then)          Acting          Head        of
Administration                   and    Legal        Department          (Mr       Mark     Webster).                 I    was

informed          that           the     Assistant           Chief       Personnel          Officer             (Safety,
Health       and Welfare)                (Mr Patrick O'Neill)                  had already made contact
with       the    South          Yorkshire          Police       HQ at        Snig Hill and had offered

the     services          of       the        Local    Authority.              I    was     not       contacted             by

South        Yorkshire             Police          during     the     course         of     Saturday            evening.


I     then       commenced             arrangements          for     the      provision,             if     necessary,

of meals          for     persons             attending       the    rest      centres.              This       was       done
through          the     Principal             Administrative            Assistant           in       the    Education
Department             (Mr       Brian        Evans)       who     was     requested            by    me        to    place

on     standby           the           School        Meals       Service           but     to        await        further
                                                                 - 5 -


         instructions            before          commencing             the        preparation            of     food.          I    then

         reported         these       arrangements                back       to     Mr    Snaith who             was      to    inform

         me    if     and      when       they           were    required.               It    was     not      yet       clear       how

         many       persons          would       attend          the        rest       centres        nor       for       how       long,
         but    3 centres             had       been       opened       up       at Burngreave Vestry Hail,                           the

         Kelvin       Community Centre and the Sacred Heart Church Hall.                                                        Social
         Workers         were        attached             to     distressed              families          on       a     one-to-one

         basis.          I ascertained from Mr Snaith that the Hospitals and Police

         had    clear         instructions                as     to    where        the       rest    centres            were.        The
         Burngreave             Vestry          Hall       was        not        required        and       was       subsequently
         closed but the Kelvin and Sacred Heart Centres continued to operate

         overnight.             Mr    Snaith             subsequently             informed me that the Education
         Department's                emergency             feeding           arrangements            were        not       required,

         food       being       provided             by    the       WRVS     at       Kelvin       and    by    volunteers            at

         the Sacred Heart Centre and I was able to                                              'stand-down' the School

        . Meals      Service          that       evening.               During          the     course         of       the    evening

         I     received          regular             up-dates           from        Mr        Purchon       and          his    staff,

         particularly                in    relation             to     the       mortuary           arrangements               and    the

         use of the Medico-Legal                           Centre.           Regular contacts were maintained
         with       Mr   Snaith who              was       attending             the     rest centres            and the Chief

         Executive            was     fully          briefed.           The       afore-mentioned               actions         formed
         a     continuous            sequence             of     events          which        began       with          the    initial
         contact         by     Mr    Purchon             and    extended           late       into       the     evening.            The

         pressure          of       the        problem          did    not       allow        time     for      a       transfer       to

         a central            base        in    the       Town       Hall.         Contacts         had    been established
         and    people          knew       where          I was.           The      potential         for       confusion,            had
         a     move      been        attempted,                would       have        been     considerable.                   I    did,

         however,         transfer             operations             to     a    central       control          office         in    the
         Town       Hall        on    the        morning          of       Sunday        16     April       and         this    centre

         provided          the       focus       for       all        information             and    decision            making       for

         many       days       after           the       disaster.            The      action        taken          by    the       Local
         Authority in terms of care, comfort and counselling of the bereaved

         was      the     subject           of       a    letter        dated       5 May        1989      which          I    sent    to

         Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry Team,                                       for the attention of Inspector

         Burrows, in response to a telephone enquiry from that Team.

       discussions       between       various       parties         including         the    Sheffield         City

       Council,      the    South       Yorkshire             Fire   and       Civil    Defence       Authority

       and   South      Yorkshire        Police          regarding         a    meeting       to    review       the

       lessons     of      Hillsborough.             A        general      meeting        was      held    on     15

       September        1989    as     mentioned             above   and       I   took      the    opportunity

       at the meeting on 15 September                         1989 to confirm the City Council's

       by a number of the Council's                      officers.         Chief Inspector Edmundson

       agreed to call a meeting to discuss the lessons of the Hillsborough
       disaster    once        the    full   report           of   the   Inquiry       has    been    released.

                       Emergency Planning Unit, Barnsley
                         15 September, 1989 - 2.30 pm.

 Call-out protocols.
 It was generally felt that it was useful for the different agencies to be in
 regular contact so that they were familiar with each others responsibilities
 and resource capabilities in the event of a disaster.

 There was much discussion about the merits of making radio appeals to get
 staff to   an incident.    Some felt that this should not happen and that
 the District emergency plan should be adhered to.     Others felt that in
 certain circumstances such an appeal was beneficial.
 It was felt that it would be useful if District officers had some highly
 visible form of     identification, (eg. tabards) when they   turned up at an
 incident so that the Police could help them get through.There is a danger
 that if    too many people think they can help then roads and access points get
 clogged    up. The Police may be needed to get both local authority staff and
 equipment through to the scene of a disaster.
 In general the Police Officers on the ground are not aware of the    Districts'
 plans or arrangements.      H o wever, they should contact  the South Yorkshire
 Police Operations Room in the event of a disaster as all ' of Malcolm
 Edmundson1s staff    are aware     of the Districts'    emergency arrangements.
 Malcolm Edmundson is trying to make sure that middle ranking officers are
 also aware of these arrangements.

 District liaison officers emphasised that Police contact should primarily be
 with their main call-out points who will alert all other council staff.

 Malcolm Edmundson agreed to call a          meeting to discuss lessons learnt
 following the Hillsborough disaster         once the Inquiry report  has been
 released.
3.   Exercises
     Barnsley aim to have an exercise every 18 months. The next is planned for 17
     November 1989.   Roy Foster has issued reports on their November 1987 and
     December 1988 exercises.

     Malcolm Edmundson said the Police would be willing to participate in any
     exercise.   Contact should initially be made through Malcolm Edmundson1s
     office but local Divisional Police would probably be involved as well.


4.   Resources
     The District representatives emphasised that different departments in each
     District may have different responsibilities and resources. Therefore it was
     important for police contact to be through the District Controller.   It was
     felt that resources could not be listed in any great detail in plans as they
     were constantly changing.



5.   Rest Centres
     All Districts have rest centres earmarked in their emergency plans.       The
     choice of exact centre to be used would be made when it was needed taking
     into account the prevailing circumstances.   The Sheffield experience is that
     it is preferable to co-locate rest centres with feeding centres.
     All District representatives stated that they did not want the voluntary
     services to take over setting up rest centres as this created many problems.


6.   Church Initiatives
     Archdeacon Lowe of Sheffield is currently preparing a call-out plan for the
     clergy in the event of a disaster where counselling is required.         At
     Hillsborough many priests had problems getting into the ground.   This plan
     will designate an incident controller    to sort out clergy, eg. different
     denominations, etc.

     There was some debate as to whether the District controllers should alert the
     clergy or the police should do this directly.      It was agreed that if the
     Archdeacon's plan was limited to the clergy and providing a counselling
     service then the police should contact them directly.   However, if there was
     any role in the plan which overlapped local authority services then the
     District Controller should alert the clergy via social services.    This will
     be clarified by the Police after liaison with the Arch Deacon.


7.   Home Secretary's statement to CACFOA, 5 September 1989.
      The Home Secretary has announced that Fire and Civil Defence Authorities i\re
      to be given a new power to co-ordinate the Districts peacetime emergency
      planning.   He is looking for a legislative opportunity to introduce this so
      the timetable is currently unclear.   However, he has stressed that the main
      role for peacetime emergency planning is to remain with the Districts and he
      does not intend to merely give Fire and Civil Defence Authorities powers
      under section 138 of the Local Government Act.   The Districts could however
      create an agency agreement under section 101 of the Local Government Act
     '1972, to contract the FCDA to carry out their peacetime emergency planning.
      A paper will go to CoCo on 24 September 1989.




                                       - 2 -
8.   Chief Executives’ Seminar
     Simon Turney passed a copy of a letter from Somerset County Council to the
     District  representatives   concerning the   response to  an  emergency  in
     Metropolitan areas.    District representatives were asked to forward any
     comments to Simon Turney for incorporation in an Emergency Planning College
     exercise.



9.   Role of the Hazrdous Waste Unit
     Following the meeting between the District liaison officers and the Fire
     Service Susan Small had investigated the role of the Hazardous Waste Unit in
     an emergency.    The Hazardous Waste Unit is now based in Rotherham.     They
     should be called out via any of the four Chief Environmental Health Officers,
     but in practice they are often contacted directly.      Their role is purely
     advisory.  They will provide information about waste materials but they will
     not remove them or dispose of them.



10. Cycle For Future Meetings.
     It was agreed that the group should aim to meet once per year.       Malcolm
     Edmondson agreed to call a further meeting once the Hillsborough     Inquiry
     report was released to discuss lessons learnt.




                                                                         S. Small
                                                                         02.10.99

Ins S - Concluded by saying that
they had received no complaints re
comfort, care or counselling, etc -
indeed on the contrary were aware of
compliments re Council handling of
aftermath.  Hoping to prepare case for
DPP by February - looking at criminal
proceedings/disciplinary action
(for Police?) - same burden of proof
for both.

Operation wound down to approximately
60 officers, 15 Senior Officers
interviewing, etc.

Preparing graphic display for computer
- what happened and when - evidence to
support.

Now going away to 'tease out' inform­    EB - Need for advance notice
ation from today's interview and will    of   areas    to  be   covered  to
return to take written statement         enable     Local    Authority   to
under caution.                           provide full details of dates,
                                         times,      places,     documents,
                                         etc.

May need to interview other

assistance and had better under­
standing of role of Authority.

           Hillsborough - Inquiry by DPP


           Thank you for your letter of the 24th August.

           I will be happy to represent any Council Officer or
           Council Member whom the Police may wish to interview
           as part of their criminal investigation.  I think
           the only matter of relevance that you need to know
           at the moment is that I will be on holiday from the
           7th to 21st September.

           I agree with you that it is unlikely that proceedings
           will be taken against Council Officers and even more
           unlikely that they will be taken against Council Members.
           However, I think it is a very prudent move to have any
           such individuals represented.

           Yours sincerely_________

 Dear Tony

 re: HILLSBOROUGH - INQUIRY BY DPP

 As you are aware the Director of Public Prosecutions has recently
 announced that he intends to inquire into the circumstances surrounding
 the Hillsborough Disaster through the medium of the West Midlands
 Police.

 Whilst I believe it is unlikely that proceedings will be taken against
 Council officers and even more unlikely Council Members I nevertheless
 feel that it would be appropriate for me to make arrangements to have
 legal representation for anyone who may be interviewed as part of
 this criminal investigation.

 Accordingly, I would be grateful if you could confirm that in the
 event of an approach being made to a Council officer and/or Council
 Member you will be willing, in view of your previous experience with
 this topic, to act on behalf of such individuals in the form of
 tendering advice and representing them in relation to this topic.

  Yours sincerely

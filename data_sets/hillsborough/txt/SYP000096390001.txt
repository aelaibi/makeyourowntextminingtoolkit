RE: POLICY & PROCEDURE FOR RELEASE OF HILLSBOROUGH DOCUMENTATION

Release of documentation from Hillsborough Archives

The policy of disclosure of information from the Hillsborough Archives has been in force since
13 June 1991, based on an opinion supplied by Stephen Walker, solicitor to the
South Yorkshire Police Authority. A copy of his opinion is enclosed.

The policy adopted has been in line with paragraph 4c Disclosure Selectively and
Paragraph 8a to e with slight amendments in the case of sub paragraphs b, d and e.
These amendments are:-

Sub para   b If a request is made for a copy of the statement of a person who has subsequently
              died, the statement will be released without seeking permission of the next of kin,
              or executor(s). If a request for a copy of a statement is not accompanied by
             written authorisation from the maker, South Yorkshire Police write to the maker,
              seeking their permission, before providing the copy.

Sub para   d If a request is made for audio, photographic or video material that belongs to
              South Yorkshire Police, then we will release copies. In respect for those who died
              at Hillsborough and in the interests of good taste and decency, we will not release
              photographs or video of post mortem examinations, nor will we release scenes
              from the mortuary and temporary mortuary. Nor will we release pictures of the
              dead, other than to members of their family, or to their legal representatives.




                                                The person dealing with this correspondence is:
                                                Superintendent Hepworth
                                                (0114) 296 3084
              In the case of material not belonging to South Yorkshire Police, if the request is not
              accompanied by authorisation from the copyright holder, this being the case with
              the vast majority of requests, then we will write to the copyright holder, seeking
              their permission to provide a copy.

Sub para e    Pathologists reports are dealt with under Rule 57 of the Coroner's Rules 1984, not
              as suggested here.

Requests for copies of other documentation, for example copies of the submission by interested
parties to Lord Justice Taylor's Enquiry, or a copy of the Ambulance Control Room Log, which
was also submitted to the Enquiry, are met positively. Authority is not sought from the authors,
as these documents lie in the public domain. Where requests are made for copies of documents
that were not submitted to the enquiry and those documents do not belong to
South Yorkshire Police, the view is taken that they are copyright and we write to the owner or
author, seeking their permission to provide a copy. An example of this is the individual
ambulance running logs, where permission has been sought from South Yorkshire Metropolitan
Ambulance and Paramedic Service and is awaited. Our policy is towards openness and this is
evidenced by the release, after due consideration of the request, of a copy of the Phillips Report,
together with its photographic and video appendices, to Ms Ann Adlington, solicitor to the
Hillsborough Family Support Group.

Release of Documentation under Rule 57, Coroner's Rules 1984

Undoubtedly the advice of Stephen Walker, in paragraph 8c of the document referred to above
led to some confusion arising, over the release of material from the mini and main inquests.
A letter from Her Majesty's Coroner dated 10 September 1997 (copy enclosed) attempted to clear
up the confusion, but resulted in a meeting between the Coroner, PC Greenway and myself on
Tuesday 16 September 1997, where I drew up what I consider to be a clear policy for the release
of documentation under Rule 57. A copy of this is also attached.

You will recall from your visit with Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to the Hillsborough Archives on
24 September 1997, that there was a primary               file for each of the96 victims ofthe
Hillsborough Tragedy. This file contained all the documentation and exhibits presented to the
inquests and it was from this file that documentation     was released. We alsomade you aware of
the secondary file for each body, which contained         photographs and videostills that werenot
presented to the inquests. Following comments made by yourselves, you will be pleased to know
that we now release copies of photographs from both files.




                                                 The person dealing with this correspondence is:
                                                 Superintendent Hepworth
                                                 (0114) 296 3084
Charges for Release of Documentation

The advice South Yorkshire Police received in June 1991, from the solicitor to the Police
Authority, recommended that the policy of disclosure should be supported by a policy of
charging. In addition the Coroner's Records (Fees for Copies) Rules lay down a scale of fees
which Coroner's can charge for the provision of documentation under Rule 57.

To date South Yorkshire Police have not imposed a charge for the provision of copies of
documentation from the archives. The cost to the organisation has been and continues to be
considerable. There must come a time when charges will be levied.

Dear
HILLSBOROUGH DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION
Further to our brief conversation yesterday I enclose my opinion on the
issue of disclosure. When you have had the opportunity of digesting it
perhaps you would like the opportunity of talking through it because I
readily accept that the issue is a difficult one in the context of
Hillsborough, therefore any decision on policy can under no circumstances be
taken lightly.
Yours sincerely




Stephen Walker
Solicitor to the Authority

1       I am aware that a substantial number of requests have been received for
         copies of documents and other material acquired for the purposes of the
         various investigations into the Hillsborough Disaster and now in the
         possession of the South Yorkshire Police. The following purposes can be
         identified.
        1    Lord Justice Taylor’s enquiry.
        2    Coronal inquests.
        3    DPP investigation.
        4    Disciplinary investigation.
2       It will be known that Council opinion has been sought on the vexed question
         of disclosure and the following principles can be drawn from this opinion.
        a    As a general rule no documents or material ought to be disclosed unless
             civil proceedings have been commenced and discovery is due to take
             place.
         b   No disclosure of documents, video films and photographs which are
              clearly in the ownership of someone else should be disclosed by the
              Police without the owners consent.
         c   No information should be disclosed that is likely to prejudice any
              disciplinary hearing.
         d   Statements t.aksn far the sola purpose of the six complaints from Messrs
                                                                        These being as
              I understand it the only complaints which have been investigated
              separately and not subsumed in the investigation into the "main event",
              are subject to public interest immunity and therefore must not be
              disclosed under any circumstances.
 3       There is no legal requirement as far as I am aware at present to disclose
         any information. No request for information has been made in the course of
         civil proceedings concerning the Chief Constable where the stage of
         discovery has been reached and there are to my knowledge no relevant
         criminal proceedings.
    4    It seems   to me there are three policies which can be adopted by the Police.
         a     Disclose nothing,
         b     Disclose everything,
         c     Disclose selectively.
         The first may be seen as attractive because of the resource time which will
         be taken in finding, copying and then releasing material. However against
         this is the loss of public favour which may result from not disclosing the
         most innocuous material, say a persons own statement which has no bearing on
         any remaining issues of the disaster. Indeed I would go further and suggest
that such a policy may be misinterpreted deliberately or otherwise by the
media and others so that there is constructed a belief that the Police have
something to hide.
A policy of disclosing everything is not possible for the following reasons:
Material which is owned by someone else should not be disclosed without
their permission and in this context it may seem to be more practible to
refer the person who has requested the material to the owner. Statements
taken as part of the six complaints referred to in Paragraphed cannot be
disclosed since they are public interest immune and it is not for the Police
to wave that immunity.
The final policy of selective disclosure appears attractive because although
it will have resource implications it does enable the Police to protect the
public image aspects of the case, particularly in the light of the Forces
most recent statement of purposes and values. But it does have a further
drawback which is the inevitable arbitration which will have to take place
and which may well lead to allegations of "cover-up" or something similar
thus negating the primary purpose for adopting the selective disclosure
policy.
One final matter which must not be lost sight of is the policy which has
been adopted in relation to requests from the Hillsborough Steering Group.
(ACC Stuart Anderson’s letter of 2 May refers). It has been reiterated on a
number of occasions that no request for disclosure will be considered until
after the disciplinary aspects of Hillsborough have been completed. The
reasoning is of course the possibility that disclosure may prejudice those
proceedings. Even then it has been said that applications will be dealt
with on their merits and that regard will be had to the purpose for which
the material is required. So the principle of selective disclosure has
already been articulated at least to the Hillsborough Steering Group.
A number of different classifications of document can be identified and
although the following list is not intended to be exhaustive it can be used
to develop a policy of disclosure although such a policy would not be
implemented until after the disciplinary aspects of Hillsborough have been
resolved. This of course will include court action such as Judicial Review
relating to decisions taken on those disciplinary aspects
a    Own Statements
     Apart from statements taken in connection with the six specific
     complaints referred to in Paragraph 2d there can ultimately be no
     objection in law to these being disclosed. If previous requests have
     been refused on a "for twe time being" basis. There is a risk of
     criticism if these requests are not dealt with until a fresh request is
     made.
- 3 -


        b   Request for Copy Statements of someone other than the maker
            Again with the exception referred to at (a) there can be no objection
            in law to providing copies as long as there is a written authorisation
            from the maker of the statement. Where previous requests have been
            refused the potential criticism referred to at (a) is relevant.
     c      Request for return of ticket

            These belong to the owners and therefore there can be no objection to a
            request for disclosure from an owner.
    d       Audio, Photographic and Video Material
            In the main this material will not "belong" to South Yorkshire Police
            and under this heading the issue of Copy-right looms large. I would
            recommend that any request from someone other than the owner is
            directed to that quarter.
    e         Pathologist Reports

            These are "expert" evidence and as such any request from someone other
            than the expert should be directed to them.
9    I believe two further points are worth making. In the area of civil claim
     for compensation I know of no case where the refusal to provide statements
     or evidence of a persons presence atHillsborough is holding up the proper
     conduct of .the case. Secondly any policy of disclosure should be supported
     by a policy of charging.

Dear Sir
Hillsborough Disaster - Supply of Documentation
I have spoken with PC Greenaway recently and subsequently with Ms Addfington from
Liverpool City Council who represents the interests of many families. It may be that some
confusion has arisen on the supply of documentation and I felt it appropriate to write and
set out the position as I understand it.
In general, it might be argued that documents supplied to a Coroner by his local police
force are obtained solely for the Coroner and it therefore becomes a matter entirely in the
discretion of the Coroner as to which documents are shown to interested parties. However
the Coroner must still comply with the terms of Rule 57 of the Coroner’s Rules 1984 which
state that parties are entitled to a copy of any post-mortem report, report of a special
examination, transcript of evidence or of a statement which is read out during the inquest
by way of documentary evidence (rather similar to Section 9 of the Criminal Justice Act).
The Blair Peach case makes it plain that in the isolated cases where statements are in fact
collected for purposes other than the Coroners (eg. Police Complaints Authority, Judicial
Enquiry or submission to the DPP) that the ownership of those statements does not rest
with the Coroner. In such a case the Coroner does not have discretion about the release
of documents for they are not his to release. However, he must still fulfil his statutory
obligations under Rule 57.
 It is quite clear that the Hillsborough papers fall into the "Blair Peach category” and I do not
 regard myself as having authority to release any documentation unless it is covered by
 Rule 57. Nonetheless, South Yorkshire Police have taken the stance (correctly in my
 view) that it is appropriate to release to relatives copies of statements relevant to the
 deaths. This is an entirely separate issue to Rule 57 and the Chief Constable must
 presumably make the decision whether documents are to be released or not.

          MEETING WITH HM CORONER CHRISTOPHER DORR1ES
               ON TUESDAY 16 SEPTEMBER 1997 AT 2 PM
    HELD AT THE MEDICO LEGAL CENTRE, WATERY STREET, SHEFFIELD.


PRESENT:        H M Coroner, Christopher Dorries
                PC Ken Greenway
                Supt Alan Hepworth


The meeting was arranged to discuss what items from the individual body files of the
victims of the Hillsborough Disaster should b& feleased to their relatives or legal
representatives, provided permission of the relative was given, under Rule 57 of the
Coroners Rule 1984. The Coroner indicated that he wished PC Greenway and myself to
act on his behalf in releasing copies of the following documents, provided they had been
properly requested:-

■    Post mortem examination report.

■    Any report of a special examination.

■     Statements presented in evidence.

■     Any statements that had been referred to in the summaries orally presented to the
      Coroner in the series of mini inquests held prior to the main inquests.

■     Photographs presented at the inquests.

■     Charts and other documents put in evidence at the inquests.


In addition to the above:

■     Any notes of evidence (transcripts) of the inquest proceedings should also be provided
      if requested by a properly interested person.


The Coroner directed us not to release the summaries contained within the body files, the
sudden death report and addresses of individuals making statements.

He asked that we blank out addresses from any copies. He stated that he would write to
Ms Ann Adlington, solicitor for the Hillsborough Family Support Group, informing her of the
decision and that if she wished, she could contact witnesses through ourselves acting on
his behalf. He agreed to supply a copy of his letter.

The Coroner indicated to us that he did not wish every request to be referred to him, but if
we were in any doubt as to who was a properly interested person he would expect us to
refer that to him. We undertook to provide the Coroner with a list of all requests received.

RE: REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION FROM HILLSBOROUGH ARCHIVES

During the visit of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, Chris Catherall and yourself to the
Hillsborough Archives at Heeley on Wednesday 24 September 1997, you made a number of
requests to us for information, which you agreed to put in writing. To date we have not received
these.

Of the two requests we have already responded to, one on 24 September 1997 was to supply
transcripts of the main and mini inquests and the other was the provision of copies of the plans of
the Leppings Lane terrace reference C275 and C276, which we forwarded on
30 September 1997.

If my memory serves me correctly the other requests were:-

Report on continued research into amendment of officers' recollections;

Research and report on the suggestion that officers were coached to give evidence to
Lord Justice Taylor's enquiry;

Research and report on the provision of video tapes to Yorkshire Television;

Examine the copy video tape provided by yourself via Trevor Hicks and identify where the
various shots are from;




                                                 The person dealing with this correspondence is:
                                                 Superintendent Hepworth
                                                  (0114) 296 3084
Research any breach of the law by Granada Television                     in the    approach     to   a
Hillsborough Inquest Jury Member;

Prepare a report on policy and procedure for the release of Hillsborough Documentation to
interested parties;

Report to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith on a number of outcomes from the civil actions.

Incidentally, neither Ken Greenway nor myself has sufficient knowledge, nor the information to
supply the details which you are likely to request about the civil actions, particularly as most of
them were confidential. The outcomes are not within the knowledge of the force solicitor,
Alan Walker either. I therefore have in mind to write to Peter Metcalf of Hammond Suddards
Solicitors at Empire House, 10 Piccadilly, Bradford BD1 3LR, who acted for
South Yorkshire Police and our Insurers in these hearings, asking him if he will respond to your
request once we receive it, unless of course you wish to write to him directly. I will not action this
further until I hear from you.

Work is progressing on the other requests and I shall soon be in a position to start responding.

Finally, I believe there was a suggestion that Chris Catherall should revisit Heeley to examine the
police officers' statements and the amendments made to them. Can you inform me if this is to
take place and a likely date, please.

You recently asked for a copy of the Phillips report. I have sought legal advice on this
subject. I am advised that the report is not relevant to any current civil action against the
Chief Constable. That being the case, I am now pleased to be able to release it to you.

I have asked Constable Ken Greenway to produce a copy. You will appreciate that the
volume of requests for material, and the scale of some of those requests, mean that it may
take some days before you receive the material.

Dear Sir

Hillsborough Scrutiny

On 23 July 1997 the Chief Constable, Mr Richard Wells, wrote to you (copy letter attached
for ease of reference). On Page 2, Paragraph 4, he referred to a planned visit to
Hillsborough Stadium. Things were said during that visit which Mr Wells is keen that you
should know of (Mr Wells began a period of leave on 30 July 1997).

Mr Wells and I met Constable GREENWAY and Inspector CALVERT at the stadium.
Constable Greenway fulfils a role as archivist and librarian for our Hillsborough material.
Inspector Calvert worked on a number of football matches before the disaster and was
involved in planning events.

Constable Greenway had prepared an album of photographs, taken at the time of the
disaster, which allowed Mr Wells and I to picture the stadium as it was then. We walked
around the inside and outside of the ground and re-familiarised ourselves with what had
happened.

During this tour, Inspector Calvert said that officers, who had been on duty on the day of
the disaster, were instructed to write their own statements and to include anything that may
have been relevant. Inspector Calvert said that when these statements came back from
typing they had been altered in a manner that some officers had found unacceptable, but
they had nonetheless signed the statements.

Inspector Calvert said that officers were coached in evidence to give to Lord Taylor’s
enquiry but that practice ceased part way through the enquiry when it became apparent
that officers were unable or unwilling to adhere to an unacceptable version of the truth.




                                                                        Direct Line: 0114 2523405
            Tel: 0114 2202020                                           Direct Fax: 0114 2523481
The Chief Constable and I were concerned at the implications of Inspector Calvert’s
comments. We did not question him nor comment lest any such action be misconstrued.
At the conclusion of our visit, Mr Wells and I discussed what we had heard.

Mr Wells said that in the seven years he has been Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, he
has not previously heard such things, nor have I in my 12 months with South Yorkshire.
Nonetheless, we resolved to act upon Inspector Calvert’s comments.

Our store of Hillsborough Disaster material is held in the Discipline and Complaints
Department at Heeley Police office. The acting Head of that Department is Superintendent
Alan FOSTER. Mr Wells and I discussed with Superintendent Foster the action to be
taken. Superintendent Foster said that he had been a member of the team of officers who
had worked on the enquiry that followed the disaster. Part of that team’s role was to liaise
with the officers of West Midlands Police and to facilitate their work. Superintendent Foster
recalled that officers on duty at the disaster were instructed to write their “recollections” and
to put down anything they felt, as well as what they believed to be true. He said that, on
legal advice, the recollections were then converted into statements of evidence. He was
unsure of the source of that advice as he was relying upon his memory of events some
eight years ago.

Superintendent Foster recollected that officers who were to give evidence to Lord Taylor’s
enquiry were prepared in the sense that they were briefed. Lord Taylor’s enquiry was
conducted differently to officers’ experiences of giving evidence in a criminal court. It was
an enquiry not a trial. The nature of giving evidence, and questions on that evidence, were
not as in a criminal case. The event itself was traumatic for many officers in a way that is
rare in criminal trials.

As discussed with Mr Wells and Superintendent Foster, I examined our archive of
Hillsborough Disaster material. The “recollections” of officers are systematically filed there.
Some are handwritten. Some are typed in a manner that suggests to me that the officers
did the typing (spelling mistakes, poor type alignment, etc). All that was written in the
recollections was then typed into the HOLMES computer. HOLMES (Home Office Large
Major Enquiry System) was launched in 1987 and the Hillsborough Disaster was one of the
first major uses of it in South Yorkshire.

The typed recollections have been annotated by indexers, police officers who identifying
salient points to be entered in the HOLMES index. For instance, if Constable 123 SMITH
refers to being on duty in serial 21 under the supervision of Sergeant 456 JONES, the
indexer would highlight “serial 21” and “Sergeant 456 JONES” as cross references. Actions
would be raised to ensure that a statement was obtained from Sergeant 456 Jones and
other officers in serial 21.

Some of the typed recollections show pencil lines through some sentences.                 These
statements are in a box marked “Amended Statements”.

I examined a small number of randomly selected amended statements. One officer’s
statement contained a page of information about the writer’s feelings the following day
In the spirit of openness that is the hallmark of Mr Wells’ style, he briefed Her Majesty’s
Inspector of Constabulary, Mr John STEVENS QPM, LLB, MPhil, CIMgt, on these
developments. I am sending this letter to him to bring him up to date.

The Chief Constable is determined that any report which even hints at new evidence
should be put before your Lordship and that such notifications should be made at the
earliest opportunity. For this reason I report these matters to you with only very limited
research. I am confident that additional research would shed further light on Inspector
Calvert’s comments. If you wish me to undertake that research, or to assist your staff in
that work, I will be glad to assist.

Yours faithfully

THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER: SCRUTINY OF MATERIAL

Thank you very much indeed for your recent letter, which I received on 21 July, with its
helpful information and suggestion.

Its arrival coincided with the finalisation of a letter which I had just written to you, stimulated
by your news release on 14 July.

 I will take the opportunity, in this slightly amended letter, if I may, to deal with my original
 points and your own.

 I was very interested to hear from the Home Secretary that he had decided to place in your
 hands the task of reviewing material associated with the Hillsborough Disaster. Whatever
 your final decision, you will be aware of strongly polarised views on the desirability of a full
 new public inquiry. The combination of your judicial independence and your seniority within
 the Court of Appeal will be invaluable in underwriting the integrity of the process of scrutiny.

 Reading your recent press release, I see that you have declared your intention to visit the
 families in Merseyside, with their legal representatives.

 I wonder if you would think it helpful if you were to visit other parties as well, not only for the
 obvious advantage of transparent even-handedness, but for very practical purposes, too.

 For example, I would very much like to brief you personally on the stance which I have taken
 towards the awful consequences of the 1989 events, since arriving to take command of the
 Force in 1990. The very basis of this stance is a frank acknowledgement of the errors which
 can be attributed to the South Yorkshire Police.

 Needless to say, I wouldn't dream of canvassing you on the question of the material to be
 placed before you in the more formal part of your scrutiny.

(shock, distress etc) and the reactions of his colleagues. That part of his statement was
deleted no doubt because it was not relevant to the causes of the disaster. Another
statement referred to the duties performed by Special Constables on the day of the
disaster. The officer expressed opinions to the effect that Special Constables should be
confined to traffic point duties. That part of his statement was deleted, no doubt because it
was opinion not evidence. One statement has a note attached which says that the officer
declined to delete parts of it.

Also in the archive is a letter dated 7 June 1989 from Mr Mervyn JONES, Assistant Chief
Constable, West Midlands Police, to Mr David BRUMMELL, Treasury Solicitor. Mr
Brummell was one of the team who assisted Lord Taylor in his enquiry. I attach a copy of
Mr Jones’ letter. The opening sentence is pertinent to this matter and I quote it in full;

       “You will recall that in the early stages, because of the slowness of the supply of
       written recollections from South Yorkshire officers, it was agreed that we would take
       from them their initial submissions which would be later superseded by their signed
       final versions, after they had been checked by the appropriate legal advice”.

I attach a copy of Mr Brummell’s reply, also dated 7 June 1989. Mr Brummell recognises
that “expressions of opinion were removed from the first versions”. He also says, “it would
not be appropriate to use the original statement for the purpose of the inquiry when this has
been superseded by a subsequent statement”.

The conclusion I draw from this is that the existence of the “recollections” was known to
Lord Taylor’s team and there was no aspect of suppressing evidence. It is a matter for
your Lordship to decide whether Inspector Calvert has “fresh evidence” to offer but my
opinion is that Inspector Calvert was not conversant with what happened and has
misunderstood a perfectly open and proper procedure.

I hold a similar view of Inspector Calvert’s statement that officers were coached in the
evidence to give. In chapter 18 of his interim report, Lord Taylor comments specifically on
the evidence of police officers (paragraphs 279 and 280). Lord Taylor said, "... I must
report that for the most part the quality of their (police officers) evidence was in inverse
proportion to their rank ... the senior officers in command were defensive and evasive
witnesses ... neither their handling of problems on the day nor their account of it in
evidence showed the qualities of leadership to be expected of their rank.”

As a police officer, it gives me no comfort to say that Lord Taylor clearly found some police
witnesses lacking. He was more than capable of determining the truth of what he heard
and had good lawyers to help him.

I think it naive of Inspector Calvert to confuse briefing with coaching. To even attempt to
manipulate witnesses, about to face such a rigorous process with so much hard evidence
(videos, photographs), would have been foolish as well as criminal.

It is my firm belief that all the evidence held by the South Yorkshire Police was made available
to earlier appropriate authorities with an interest in discerning the causes of the disaster.
However, the publicity surrounding the Home Secretary's latest decision has stimulated a
number of approaches to our Force on different themes. Rather than making assumptions
about your interest or otherwise in these offers or enquiries, I have asked Assistant Chief
Constable Ian Daines to forward them to your secretary, Mr Bone.

We will, of course, make available to you and to your secretarial support team any
documentation you need to pursue your scrutiny and which is under our control. The total
material which we house is stored in a room some 15 feet square. All four walls are full from
floor to ceiling with, in addition, a central column (allowing a barely reasonable amount of
access) which also reaches from floor to ceiling. It probably amounts to around two tons in
weight. I describe it in this way only to give you some impression, at a distance, of its scale
and volume.

Ian Daines has already spoken to Mr Bone, offering him (and yourself, should you wish it)
ready access. I will be happy to meet your request for information about the nature of these
documents by 4 August and will try to make it as digestible as possible.

On Saturday 26 July, a small number of officers will be going to the Hillsborough Stadium to
re-familiarise ourselves, or in the case of some officers, to acquaint themselves for the first
time, with the reconfigured ground. Some features remain intact (particularly outside the
ground) following alterations pursuant to the late Lord Chief Justice Taylor's 1989
recommendations but others are, thankfully, very different.

I tell you this only so that you are aware of our intentions and, if you were so minded, to
mention such a facility (willingly provided by Sheffield Wednesday Football Club) to the
Merseyside families when you meet them.

This is one of the other "practical purposes" to which I referred earlier, should you
contemplate visiting other parties.

Whatever your decisions in these matters, you may be assured of my fullest co-operation.

          SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE RECOLLECTIONS

          You will recall in the early stages, because of the slowness of the
          supply of written recollections from South Yorkshire Police Officers, it
          was agreed that we would take from them their initial submissions which
          would be later superseded by their signed final versions, after they had
          been checked by their appropriate legal advice.  I personally made an
          undertaking with the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police that only
          the final versions would be the ones used in the Public Inquiry and this
          was after discussion with you.

          I am concerned that yesterday an officer was referred to his initial
          submission which contained opinion that had subsequently been removed
          from his final account.     Given the undertaking I made to South Yorkshire
          Police I would hope that this would not happen    in the future because it
          was only on that understanding that we received their information as
          early as we did.

          I have formalised this in writing because this effects our personal
          integrity in the matter.  I have copied this letter to the Chief
          Constable of South Yorkshire Police for his information.

                      SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE RECOLLECTIONS

    Thank you for your letter of today's date, which we have already discussed.

    The main difference between the initial and final versions of the South
Yorkshire Police Officers' statements is that any expressions of opinion were
(as I understand it, on the advice of Mr. Woodward) removed from the final
version. As I understand it, Andrew Collins' view is that there is absolutely
no reason for excluding such expressions of opinion when they touch on matters
relevant to the Public Inquiry and that, in the circumstances, there is no
objection in principle to written statements containing such opinions being
submitted to the Inquiry.

    Clearly, in view of the personal undertaking which you have given to the
Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, Andrew Collins agrees that it would not be
appropriate to use the original statement for the purposes of the Inquiry when
this has been superseded by a subsequent statement. However, what I understand
may have happened in the case of the Officer who gave his evidence yesterday is
that the original unamended statement was circulated because of the need to
circulate statements to all parties as rruch in advance of the calling of the
relevant witnesses as possible and because at the time of circulation of the
relevant batch of witness statements the revised, final version of the
statement in question had not yet been received. I understand that in total
there are three cases where this has been necessary: P.C.s Best, Huckstepp and
Illingworth. However, in such cases only the final, revised version of the
statement was given to the press.

    I trust that this problem will not recur in the future.

    I have not copied this letter to the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire
Police, but am naturally happy for you to do so.

Dear Sir

Hillsborough Scrutiny

On 23 July 1997 the Chief Constable, Mr Richard Wells, wrote to you (copy letter attached
for ease of reference). On Page 2, Paragraph 4, he referred to a planned visit to
Hillsborough Stadium. Things were said during that visit which Mr Wells is keen that you
should know of (Mr Wells began a period of leave on 30 July 1997).

Mr Wells and I met Constable GREENWAY and Inspector CALVERT at the stadium.
Constable Greenway fulfils a role as archivist and librarian for our Hillsborough material.
Inspector Calvert worked on a number of football matches before the disaster and was
involved in planning events.

Constable Greenway had prepared an album of photographs, taken at the time of the
disaster, which allowed Mr Wells and I to picture the stadium as it was then. We walked
around the inside and outside of the ground and re-familiarised ourselves with what had
happened.

During this tour, Inspector Calvert said that officers, who had been on duty on the day of
the disaster, were instructed to write their own statements and to include anything that may
have been relevant. Inspector Calvert said that when these statements came back from
typing they had been altered in a manner that some officers had found unacceptable, but
they had nonetheless signed the statements.

Inspector Calvert said that officers were coached in evidence to give to Lord Taylor’s
enquiry but that practice ceased part way through the enquiry when it became apparent
that officers were unable or unwilling to adhere to an unacceptable version of the truth.




                                                                         Direct Line: 0114 2523405
           Tel: 0114 2202020                                             Direct Fax: 0114 2523481
The Chief Constable and I were concerned at the implications of Inspector Calvert’s
comments. We did not question him nor comment lest any such action be misconstrued.
At the conclusion of our visit, Mr Wells and I discussed what we had heard.

Mr Wells said that in the seven years he has been Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, he
has not previously heard such things, nor have I in my 12 months with South Yorkshire.
Nonetheless, we resolved to act upon Inspector Calvert’s comments.

Our store of Hillsborough Disaster material is held in the Discipline and Complaints
Department at Heeley Police office. The acting Head of that Department is Superintendent
Alan FOSTER. Mr Wells and I discussed with Superintendent Foster the action to be
taken. Superintendent Foster said that he had been a member of the team of officers who
had worked on the enquiry that followed the disaster. Part of that team’s role was to liaise
with the officers of West Midlands Police and to facilitate their work. Superintendent Foster
recalled that officers on duty at the disaster were instructed to write their “recollections” and
to put down anything they felt, as well as what they believed to be true. He said that, on
legal advice, the recollections were then converted into statements of evidence. He was
unsure of the source of that advice as he was relying upon his memory of events some
eight years ago.

Superintendent Foster recollected that officers who were to give evidence to Lord Taylor’s
enquiry were prepared in the sense that they were briefed. Lord Taylor’s enquiry was
conducted differently to officers’ experiences of giving evidence in a criminal court. It was
an enquiry not a trial. The nature of giving evidence, and questions on that evidence, were
not as in a criminal case. The event itself was traumatic for many officers in a way that is
rare in criminal trials.

As discussed with Mr Wells and Superintendent Foster, I examined our archive of
Hillsborough Disaster material. The “recollections” of officers are systematically filed there.
Some are handwritten. Some are typed in a manner that suggests to me that the officers
did the typing (spelling mistakes, poor type alignment, etc). All that was written in the
recollections was then typed into the HOLMES computer. HOLMES (Home Office Large
Major Enquiry System) was launched in 1987 and the Hillsborough Disaster was one of the
first major uses of it in South Yorkshire.

The typed recollections have been annotated by indexers, police officers who identifying
salient points to be entered in the HOLMES index. For instance, if Constable 123 SMITH
refers to being on duty in serial 21 under the supervision of Sergeant 456 JONES, the
indexer would highlight “serial 21” and “Sergeant 456 JONES” as cross references. Actions
would be raised to ensure that a statement was obtained from Sergeant 456 Jones and
other officers in serial 21.

Some of the typed recollections show pencil lines through some sentences.                 These
statements are in a box marked “Amended Statements”.

I examined a small number of randomly selected amended statements. One officer’s
statement contained a page of information about the writer’s feelings the following day
(shock, distress etc) and the reactions of his colleagues. That part of his statement was
deleted no doubt because it was not relevant to the causes of the disaster. Another
statement referred to the duties performed by Special Constables on the day of the
disaster. The officer expressed opinions to the effect that Special Constables should be
confined to traffic point duties. That part of his statement was deleted, no doubt because it
was opinion not evidence. One statement has a note attached which says that the officer
declined to delete parts of it.

Also in the archive is a letter dated 7 June 1989 from Mr Mervyn JONES, Assistant Chief
Constable, West Midlands Police, to Mr David BRUMMELL, Treasury Solicitor. Mr
Brummell was one of the team who assisted Lord Taylor in his enquiry. I attach a copy of
Mr Jones’ letter. The opening sentence is pertinent to this matter and I quote it in full;

       “You will recall that in the early stages, because of the slowness of the supply of
       written recollections from South Yorkshire officers, it was agreed that we would take
       from them their initial submissions which would be later superseded by their signed
       final versions, after they had been checked by the appropriate legal advice".

I attach a copy of Mr Brummell’s reply, also dated 7 June 1989. Mr Brummell recognises
that “expressions of opinion were removed from the first versions”. He also says, “it would
not be appropriate to use the original statement for the purpose of the inquiry when this has
been superseded by a subsequent statement”.

The conclusion I draw from this is that the existence of the “recollections” was known to
Lord Taylor’s team and there was no aspect of suppressing evidence. It is a matter for
your Lordship to decide whether Inspector Calvert has “fresh evidence” to offer but my
opinion is that Inspector Calvert was not conversant with what happened and has
misunderstood a perfectly open and proper procedure.

I hold a similar view of Inspector Calvert’s statement that officers were coached in the
evidence to give. In chapter 18 of his interim report, Lord Taylor comments specifically on
the evidence of police officers (paragraphs 279 and 280). Lord Taylor said, "... I must
report that for the most part the quality of their (police officers) evidence was in inverse
proportion to their rank ... the senior officers in command were defensive and evasive
witnesses ... neither their handling of problems on the day nor their account of it in
evidence showed the qualities of leadership to be expected of their rank."

As a police officer, it gives me no comfort to say that Lord Taylor clearly found some police
witnesses lacking. He was more than capable of determining the truth of what he heard
and had good lawyers to help him.

I think it naive of Inspector Calvert to confuse briefing with coaching. To even attempt to
manipulate witnesses, about to face such a rigorous process with so much hard evidence
(videos, photographs), would have been foolish as well as criminal.
In the spirit of openness that is the hallmark of Mr Wells’ style, he briefed Her Majesty’s
Inspector of Constabulary, Mr John STEVENS QPM, LLB, MPhil, CIMgt, on these
developments. I am sending this letter to him to bring him up to date.

The Chief Constable is determined that any report which even hints at new evidence
should be put before your Lordship and that such notifications should be made at the
earliest opportunity. For this reason I report these matters to you with only very limited
research. I am confident that additional research would shed further light on Inspector
Calvert’s comments. If you wish me to undertake that research, or to assist your staff in
that work, I will be glad to assist.

Yours faithfully

THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER. SCRUTINY OF MATERIAL

Thank you very much indeed for your recent letter, which I received on 21 July, with its
helpful information and suggestion.

Its arrival coincided with the finalisation of a letter which I had just written to you, stimulated
by your news release on 14 July.

 I will take the opportunity, in this slightly amended letter, if I may, to deal with my original

 I was very interested to hear from the Home Secretary that he had decided to place in your

 your final decision, you will be aware of strongly polarised views on the desirability of a full

 I wonder if you would think it helpful if you were to visit other parties as well, not only for the
 obvious advantage of transparent even-handedness, but for very practical purposes, too.

 For example, I would very much like to brief you personally on the stance which I have taken

          SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE RECOLLECTIONS

          You will recall in the early stages, because of the slowness of the
          supply of written recollections from South Yorkshire Police Officers, it
          was agreed that we would take from them their initial submissions which
          would be later superseded by their signed final versions, after they had
          been checked by their appropriate legal advice.  I personally made an
          undertaking with the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police that only
          the final versions would be the ones used in the Public Inquiry and this
          was after discussion with you.

          I am concerned that yesterday an officer was referred to his initial
          submission which contained opinion that had subsequently been removed
          from his final account.   Given the undertaking I made to South Yorkshire
          Police I would hope that this would not happen in the future because it
          was only on that understanding that we received their information as
          early as we did.

          I have formalised this in writing because this effects our personal
          integrity in the matter.  I have copied this letter to the Chief
          Constable of South Yorkshire Police for his information.

                      SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE RECOLLECTIONS

    Thank you for your letter of today's date, which we have already discussed.

    The main difference between the initial and final versions of the South
Yorkshire Police Officers' statements is that any expressions of opinion were
(as I understand it, on the advice of Mr. Woodward) removed from the final
version. As I understand it, Andrew Collins' view is that there is absolutely
no reason for excluding such expressions of opinion when they touch on matters
relevant to the Public Inquiry and that, in the circumstances, there is no
objection in principle to written statements containing such opinions being
submitted to the Inquiry.

    Clearly, in view of the personal undertaking which you have given to the
Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, Andrew Collins agrees that it would not be
appropriate to use the original statement for the purposes of the Inquiry when
this has been superseded by a subsequent statement. However, what I understand
may have happened in the case of the Officer who gave his evidence yesterday is
that the original unamended statement was circulated because of the need to
circulate statements to all parties as much in advance of the calling of the
relevant witnesses as possible and because at the time of circulation of the
relevant batch of witness statements the revised, final version of the
statement in question had not yet been received. I understand that in total
there are three cases where this has been necessary: P.C.s Best, Huckstepp and
Illingworth. However, in such cases only the final, revised version of the
statement was given to the press.

    I trust that this problem will not recur in the future.

    I have not copied this letter to the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire
Police, but am naturally happy for you to do so.

 LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S INQUIRY INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

I have now been asked by Counsel appointed by Lord Justice Taylor to request
from a selected number of police officers their recollections, in writing,
of what happened at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989. The reason for my
request is that I understand that a number of your officers performed duty
on a mutual aid basis. Counsel are keen to obtain a cross section of
accounts as soon as possible.

I would like to make       arrangements as soon as convenient, through a Liaison
Officer whom you may       care to appoint, to receive these written submissions
as soon as possible.        There will be no need for cay officers to see yours
personally, although       a proof of continuity will be necessary, but I would
hope that this could       easily be achieved through your Liaison Officer.

The invitation to submit written recollections is based on criteria that I
have already adopted with South Yorkshire Police officers. That is,
there will be no interviews Just simple requests to which the officer will
be free to decide what he or she wishes to say. When supplying any written
submission the officer will be free to keep a copy. I have also oeen asked
by Mr P Wright, Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police, if a copy of
any submission can be made available; I have no objections nor have Counsel
appointed by Lord.Justice Taylor.

In this respect copies of any written submissions can be forwarded direct
by you to Mr Wright at his Sheffield Police Headquarters.

It would be helpful if I could arrange for one of my senior officers to
contact your Liaison Officer in the next few days.

Attached to this letter is the list of officers who I understand were
seconded from your Force.

DIARY OF EVENTS


(12.45 pm Monday 28 July 1997)


At 9.00 am on Saturday 26 July 1997 the Chief Constable and ACC Daines went to
Hillsborough Stadium as previously arranged, each travelled              independently.
Constable    Greenway and       Inspector Calvert arrived     together    in   Constable
Greenway’s car. Constable Greenway had previously asked the Chief Constable’s
permission to invite Inspector Calvert in view of the latter’s knowledge of
Hillsborough related issues. The purpose of the visit was to familiarise ourselves
with the layout of the ground and it’s environment, all of us were in plain clothes.


The stadium staff were on site and we were allowed unrestricted access.            Apart
from greeting staff at the stadium as we walked about, we had no other contact with
stadium staff.


Constable Greenway had prepared an album of photographs taken in 1989 of the
ground, both inside and out. During the course of our tour of the ground Inspector
Calvert volunteered unsolicited information about the conduct of enquiries into the
disaster. He said that officers’ statements had been altered and officers had been
coached in the evidence to give to the enquiry. He said that officers who had been
on duty were instructed to write their own statements and to include anything that
may have been relevant. Inspector Calvert said that when these statements came
back from typing they had been significantly altered in a manner that some officers
had found unacceptable but they had nonetheless signed the statements.


Inspector Calvert said that officers were coached and rehearsed in evidence to give
to the Taylor enquiry but that practice had ceased part way through the enquiry
when it became apparent that officers were unable or unwilling to adhere to an
unacceptable version of the truth.      Inspector Calvert referred to evidence being
made to conform to a “party line”. Constable Greenway was present when Inspector
Calvert made these comments. He did not dissent and spoke in general terms in
support of what Inspector Calvert was saying.


The visit concluded about 11.30 am. Inspector Calvert and Constable Greenway left
together.   The Chief Constable and ACC Daines went to the Police premises at
Niagara, which is nearby, to discuss what they had heard.


They resolved to secure the Force’s archive of material in the Heeley police office.
Chief Superintendent Hale, Operations Departmental Commander, was contacted
and invited to rendezvous with the Chief Constable and ACC Daines at Heeley
police office. Chief Superintendent Hale said that he would contact the duty Task
Force Inspector (Inspector Wardle) and arrange for Inspector Wardle to also be at
Heeley. Superintendent Foster, Acting Head of Discipline and Complaints, was also
contacted and invited to go to Heeley police office.


Heeley police office was inspected and it was noted that the alarm which protects
the Discipline and Complaints area appeared to be functioning normally.          The
outside of the premises were also inspected and appeared normal. The store room
of Hillsborough related material was not entered, the party withdrew beyond the
alarmed area and Superintendent Foster re-set the alarm.      Inspector Wardle was
instructed to post two uniformed Task Force constables in the foyer with an
instruction that no person was to enter the Discipline and Complaints Department
without the prior approval of the Chief Constable or ACC Daines. The officers were
to be relieved by other Task Force officers and the same instructions passed on.
They were also told that if the duty Discipline and Complaints officer needed to
enter the Department during the weekend they were to contact the Chief Constable
or ACC Daines first, and if such entry was authorised they were to take up a position
outside the Hillsborough archive store. They were also to be told that on Monday
morning when normal office activities resumed, they were to move to the position
outside the Hillsborough archive store.
During the course of this meeting, Superintendent Foster said that he had been part
of the team of officers who had worked on the disaster enquiry. He said that some
officers’ statements had contained intemperate and injudicious language.         He
referred to officers’ statements manifesting signs of emotional distress and venting
their emotions against the behaviour of football supporters and senior officers. He
said that those sections of those statements were neither evidential nor helpful and
that after discussions with the officers concerned those passages were removed
from the statements that were later submitted.     He also said that officers were
prepared for the giving of evidence not coached or rehearsed.


Superintendent Foster volunteered to hand his keys to the Discipline and
Complaints Department to the Chief Constable who passed them to ACC Daines on
the morning of 28 July 1997.


The Chief Constable spoke twice to HMIC, Mr John Stevens. On the first occasion
the Chief Constable briefed Mr Stevens in general terms of the information received
from Inspector Calvert and the action that was being taken to secure the store. On
the second occasion the Chief Constable said to the HMIC that he did not propose
to have statements taken from Inspector Calvert or Constable Greenway. The HMIC
endorsed the actions that were being taken.


About 11.00 am on Sunday 27 July 1997 I telephoned the Operations Room and
asked                  to cause the Task Force officers at Heeley to ring me back at
home. A constable rang me and I asked him to tell me the instructions under which
he was operating. He relayed them to me in exactly the same terms as they had
been given to Inspector Wardle.


On Monday 28 July 1997 I attended a Senior Command Team meeting with the
Chief Constable, Deputy Chief Constable and Assistant Chief Constables Davies
and Hollis.   The Force Solicitor, Mr Alan Walker, was also present to discuss
Hillsborough issues. The Chief Constable briefed the others with the events of the
weekend and we agreed that I would take steps to provide physical security for the




                                         3
archive, thereby allowing uniformed officers to be redeployed. We also agreed that
I would take steps to see if the outline of Inspector Calvert’s assertions had been
aired at Lord Taylor’s enquiry.


Before the Senior Command Team meeting I spoke to ACC Norman Bettison,
currently West Yorkshire, previously South Yorkshire.       I spoke to him because he
had been a member of the south Yorkshire Hillsborough enquiry team. He said that
the function of that team had been to facilitate the West Midlands officers in their
access to people and places and that when the team was set up one element of it’s
work had been to study the lessons to be learned with a view to preventing further
tragedies. The team had been established before it became known that Lord Taylor
would head an enquiry for that specific purpose.       In broad terms, ACC Bettison’s
recollection matched that of Superintendent Foster.


At 11.15 am on 28 July 1997 I briefed Chief Inspector Price, Crime and Community
Services, on my requirements relating to security of the premises. At 11.30 am I
advised Superintendent Foster of the Senior Command Team decisions and asked
him if he could recall whether the officers’ original statements were still available
and whether Lord Taylor had been made aware that the statements had been
changed and the purpose for doing so.          He could not recall with certainty and I
asked him to speak to other people to see if they could shed light on this issue.


It had already been arranged that the Force Solicitor, Mr Alan Walker, ACC Daines,
Constable Greenway and representatives of Winckworth Pemberton would meet at
Heeley at 3.00 pm on 28 July 1997. Winckworth Pemberton are a firm of solicitors
whom we propose to engage to represent the Chief Constable at the Scrutiny. The
meeting was arranged about one week previously with a view to showing them the
archive store and opening discussions about how the Scrutiny could be best
handled in terms of Queen’s Counsel etc.




                                           4
(11.30 am Tuesday 29 July 1997)


At 2.30 pm 28 July 1997 I went to Heeley and met                             and
         of Crime Prevention Department.        We went into the store to assess the
crime prevention dimensions. The store was re-locked and I endorsed the officer’s
log.


At 3.00 pm 28 July 1997 we had our meeting with Nicholas OWSTON and Ailsa
LAWRENCE of Winckworth and Pemberton. We briefed them and took them in the
store to see the archive. I endorsed the officer’s log.


At 8.00 am Tuesday 29 July 1997 I met PC Greenway at Heeley. We went into the
store. He showed me a book of officers statements which had been amended.            It
was marked “Amended Statements”. There were 50-100 such statements.                The
original hand written records were present or typed records.      The typed records
looked amateurish; elementary spelling mistakes, poor spacing, etc.       The typed
records did not appear to have been typed professionally.       These records were
written on plain paper with no criminal justice captions of even, in some cases,
South Yorkshire Police headings.      I randomly selected other boxes of statements
and examined them and saw hand written or rough typed statements.


Attached to the original records were .computer print-out typed versions.     These
were marked up in the manner of ? for HObWIES input.           Some sections of the
“Amended Statements” were crossed out on the computer print-out typed versions. I
selected three at random and asked to see the statements that had been handed to
the West Midlands Police.      PC Greenway located the copies given to the West
Midlands and the crossed lines of text did not appear in their copies. We could find
no record of whether the West Midlands Police knew of these deletions.




                                            5
The three examples were;


a)   PC 2343 GARDNER.         Sentences deleted stated that senior officer were
      totally confused.


b)   Constable Glenda ROBERTS. Sentences deleted stated that her Sergeant
      had referred to hysterical radio messages.


c)   Constable PATTISON.      Sentences deleted stated that Special Constables
      had radios when regular officers did not and Special Constables were
      deployed on duties that should have been undertaken by regular officers.




                                         6
After discussion, the following was agreed:

• That the Senior Command Team would work on these present issues
  through Ian Daines and Alan Walker, the Force Solicitor;
• Ian Daines would arrange for a dual-locking system to replace the
  police watch on the archives, arranging for a method of complementary
  keys, one to be placed in the hands of a Senior Command Team
  member and the other to be with Discipline and Complaints, but both
  needed to open the archives.
• Ian Daines and Alan Walker would determine, in the most thorough yet
  discreet way possible - and logging their steps for later scrutiny - to
  what extent, if any, the Calvert assertions had already been enquired
  into and, if so, whether the results o f any such investigation had been
  made available to the earlier authorities party to the Taylor Inquiry.
• If the assertions had been made available to Lord Justice Taylor, then
  we would indicate to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith any documentary points
  to which he might refer.
• If the assertions had not been made available to the Taylor Inquiry, then
  the letter to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith would indicate this and invite the
  judge to form his own conclusions on material, which we would openly
  provide to hirnand about their relevance to his present scrutiny.
• Wherever possible, to buttress our integrity o f initial response to the
  assertions, a letter should leave PHQ for the judge by close o f play on
  this day (Monday) or, failing that, as soon as practicable.
• The planned meeting this afternoon with Winckworth and Pemberton,
  our nominated solicitors, should proceed as arranged to reinforce the
  integrity o f process which had been established so far.
• A Note for File would be made of this morning’s meeting, agreed by all
  present, to underwrite the same integrity o f process .

NOTE FOR FILE

           MEETING OF SENIOR COMMAND TEAM
                   MONDAY 28 JULY 1997
          LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH’S SCRUTINY

The Chief Constable began by updating members about developments
over the week-end when he and Ian Daines had made their planned visit to
the Hillsborough Stadium and surrounds to re-acquaint themselves with the
ground and its new post-Taylor configuration. They had been accompanied
on this visit by Constable Ken Greenway and Inspector Clive Calvert, both
of whom had extensive knowledge of the ground and match arrangements.

During the course of the tour, Inspector Calvert had made assertions that
he believed officers’ statements had been changed before the Taylor
Inquiry to a point where what was presented to Taylor did not represent
the officers’ true feelings or knowledge o f events. He further asserted that
he believed that officers had been ‘rehearsed’ in their evidence to the
Taylor Inquiry.

Constable Greenway had supported the aspect of the statement changing
but did not express a view on the question of ‘rehearsing’.

The Chief Constable had indicated to Greenway and Calvert, that their
conversation had taken place and could not now be ignored.

Following the tour, Richard Wells and Ian Daines had left Hillsborough
and had gone to Niagara Sports and Social Club, where they had discussed
how the assertions might best be handled. They had agreed that
transparency was the guiding criterion by which judgements should be
made and that all parties privy to the assertions, and those with present
control over the Hillsborough archives needed to have their integrity
protected.

For these reasons, they had decided that security of the archives was
critical and agreed that, until Monday, a manned watch should be
established o f the room in which the papers were stored at Heeley police
office - the home o f the Discipline and Complaints Department.

Meetings had been held with Chief Superintendent Peter Hale, who was to
provide, through Inspector Phil Wardle o f the Task Force, the officers
                                      2



required at the site and with Detective Superintendent Alan Foster, who
was acting as head o f the Discipline and Complaints Department.

In the course of establishing the security o f the archives, Alan Foster had
mentioned to Wells and Daines that he had been a member o f a 1989-90
working group of South Yorkshire police officers who had dealt, post-
Disaster, with aspects of statements and ‘rehearsal’. It was his view that
officers had first been required to ‘put everything’ into their statements,
including their feelings about the events of 15 April and that this had
resulted in outpourings which had been inappropriate for evidential
requirements. These emotive elements had later been excised and the
officers required to sign new statements. Officers had certainly been
‘prepared’ for their evidence to Lord Justice Taylor but it was his view
that this had fallen short of ‘rehearsal’.

In view of Superintendent Foster’s association with that aspect o f the
assertions, he agreed that it was best, in the interests of transparency, that
he surrendered his set of keys to the premises and willingly had done so.

Richard Wells had notified the HMI, John Stevens, of the afternoon’s
actions.

Wells and Daines had then returned to Police Headquarters, where they
had jointly prepared a Note for File of what had taken place, to be
processed on Monday.

There had been a telephone call between Daines and Wells on Sunday
morning, with further discussions about alternatives to the human
resources deployed at Heeley, in the form o f a dual-locking arrangement.

Members were invited for their views this morning, the Chief Constable
outlining what he thought were main issues. These were:

• Keeping a sense o f proportion between over-reacting and under-reacting
  to the assertions;
• Establishing the truth of the assertions, with some sense of
  independence of judgement and confining their scope;
• Having an eye to, in priority order, the families’ needs, the Force’s
  needs and the needs of individual officers, whether retired or serving;
• Having an eye to the interplay between rumour and media activity; and
• Sustaining the security of the archives .

SUBJECT:       Complaints and Discipline Department - Heelev.

              Hillsborough Inquiry - Store room - Survey

With regard to the above I have to report as follows:

I feel it should be stated from the outset that this building can be classed as little more than a
shed. It has a wooden clad tongue and groove exterior face with, what appears to be, a thermal
interlayer and plaster board interior wall.

In the circumstances it is difficult to see what could be done from a physical security point of view
to greatly improve the situation. Changes would be more cosmetic than actually
improving security.

Perimeter
The department is enclosed within a chain link perimeter fence which is surmounted with three
strands of barbed wire. In general this form of fencing is easily cut with a standard pair of pliers
and in the security business is only considered to be secure enough to keep an honest person
out.

The redeeming feature of the fence is the limited, but dense growth of shrubbery which reinforces
the perimeter security in the front of the building and around the side where the store room is
located. The shrubbery, together with the fence, does prevent easy breaching of the boundary in
the limited area of the perimeter it covers. However, once entry is gained to the yard, there is a
service path which runs round the shell of the building allowing any person the opportunity to reach
all areas of the ground floor wall.

There is no feasible means of reinforcing this perimeter fence to an acceptable level without
substantial financial outlay.

Lighting
Although I have not visited the site during the hours of darkness, I understand it is relatively well
illuminated.

In normal circumstances I would say this should greatly improve the security of the site. However,
this particular site is not overlooked by neighbouring properties, passing vehicular traffic or
pedestrians. It may be the lights will deter an opportunist attacker. But with little, or no risk, of
being observed, other than the most inept thief may well persist with the attack.

In my opinion, lighting on this site should be maintained, but offers only minimal deterrent effect.

Building
As stated, the structure of the building is not of a quality which should be used to store items of
value or sensitivity.
It would be easy to gain entry either through the exterior wall or by forcing a door or window. In
fact, it is possible to enter the building via the toilet next to the store and either attack the internal
partition wall or enter the central corridor and attack the store room door. The corridor outside the
store is not protected on the alarm system, which means the attacker would be able to gain entry
to the store before the alarm activates.

The existing store room door is not a security door, it is a standard fire quality door which, although
relatively good, is unlikely to withstand even a moderate level of force. That being said, the door
frame is also lacking in substance. It is constructed for internal use only and would most likely
succumb to attack before the door itself gives way.

Although I can advise on security standard doors and frames, such as Russell or Fear Free doors,
which would stand up to a high level of force attack. I feel the quality and strength of the internal
walls would be insufficient to support a quality door of an acceptable standard and could well result
in the security being reduced.

Electronic Security
Alarms
It is an accepted aspect of security that an intruder alarm should only be used to supplement a
good level of physical security. Where alarms are used to replace physical barriers, buildings can
be left open to the type of attack where the intruder gains access and make good his escape
before an adequate response can be made to the alarm activation.

At this time, the alarm on the building, although offering a reasonable level of cover, omits the
store, adjoining toilet and the access corridor. This does not created a problem to the rest of the
building as all other areas are protected. Please see the accompanying report by


Closed Circuit Television (CCTV)
Likewise, too great a reliance is often given to the use of CCTV. In its place and with continuous
monitoring where a response is given to incidents as they occur, CCTV is very effective. In the
main, though, CCTV installations rely on incidents being recorded on tape with the hope that the
offender can be identified later. A satisfactory state of affairs in some instances, but unfortunately
the offence has been committed and if the offender has taken steps to conceal his identity is
unlikely to be identified later.

Fire Precautions
1feel an arson attack on this store may possibly be a more realistic proposition than an attempt at
stealing specific files or statements. The time a thief would require to be in the store before he/she
found what they are looking for would be considerable, increasing the risk of being caught. A
more sure and less risky attack, in my opinion, would simply be to set fire to the building or store
room. Drilling holes through the wall and pouring petrol in would be the easy option.

In view of this, it may be necessary to check with Estates regarding the fire retarding measure
taken when the building was constructed. It may be that some additional measure should now be
taken.

The Fire detection system should also be looked at. Detection of a fire in the building or store will
be of minimal value if there is a delay in fire fighting equipment coming into use. However, the
use of the wrong type of fire fighting materials will have dire consequences on written material.
Gas extinguishing will be the most suitable substance in this instance and steps should be taken to
ensure to ensure portable extinguishers are readily available.

General Observation
As already stated I do not feel these premises are secure enough to house items with the
sensitivity of the Hillsborough Enquiry. Physically, there are only limited changes to the security
which can be effectively carried out and this is unlikely to greatly improve the existing situation.
If it is decided to utilise electronic security as a means of improving the existing poor physical
security, the deciding factor on its effectiveness will be the quality and time of response to any
suspected intrusion. A rapid response will limit the amount of damage caused or items stolen, but
will not necessarily prevent it.

Although I do not believe CCTV can be used to replace good physical security of the building it can
be effective as a security measure. If CCTV is to be used effectively as a means of replacing the
lack of physical security on this building, I feel I must recommend the system should be
continuously monitored with a priority response to any suspicious circumstances

This report should be read in conjunction with the attached report by

Conclusion
Given a choice, I do not believe this is a suitable premise for the storage of vulnerable material,
ideally, a brick built store, without external walls should be found within an existing police station.
A disused police cell with adequate electronic security would, in my opinion, make a suitable
storage area.

SUBJECT:       Security Survey 28-07-97

The following report is to summarise the electronic security that can be fitted to the building
surveyed on the above date. Any locations of equipment are given as if standing in front of the
building with your back to the main road.

Outside protection.


As a visible deterrent I would suggest the fitting of camera housings to the outside of the building.
The cheapest option would be to fit two cameras to the front and right elevations of the building.
These would include camera, lens, housing and Infra-red lighting. Cables from these would be
taken inside the building to a central point where via a video multiplexer the images would be
recorded to tape, preferably in a secure room above ground level.
I have suggested fitting two cameras, but this may leave the rear of the building vulnerable to
attack. During the survey with the force ALO it became obvious that the rear was particularly
vulnerable due to the poor fencing and the fact that nobody in the area had a view of the car park.
To overcome this problem two further cameras would need fitting.
A further consideration is the duration of the installation. If is likely to be for some time as I expect
that it will, then we should fit mains powered cameras this will need a mains outlet to be fitted
adjacent to each camera location.
The overall cost for such an installation at this time is difficult to work out as there are a number or
items that need to be taken into consideration. In general terms though costs are as follows.-

        1. Outside camera including housing, lighting and heater                £    700.00
        2. Video multiplexer                                                    £   1000.00
        3. Monitor - 14"                                                        £    300.00
        4. Cable, fixings etc.                                                  £    100.00

As stated these prices are general prices and I would therefore expect them to be as much as 10%
lower if we were to go ahead and purchase the equipment. Item one will need multiplying by the
number of cameras fitted. It is also worth noting that the cameras would be monochrome to enable
better images at night.

Outside electronic security.
To enable protection to the building from physical attack I would suggest the use of Outside Active
Infra-red Beams. Two could be installed at the corner of the building which would activate if
someone was to come within a metre of the building. These beams could be linked in with the
alarm panel to be installed within the protected premises (see below). The only draw back to using
this type of device is that we will need a post erecting on that corner of the building about 1.5
metres high along with underground ducting to the building (only 1.5 to 2 metres). The cost of the
beams without the cost of the post is around £200.00.
Internal Security.

Alarm System.
The room in question should have its own security system fitted. This could act as an interface
between all the security devices. The system should consist of the following:-

Item 5 : The building already has a substantial security system fitted including "Red Care"
telephone line monitoring. The above equipment could be connected to the existing alarm and
thus utilise the Red Care. In addition to this I would strongly recommend fitting the UHF alarm as a
permanent installation connected to the new alarm panel. This UHF alarm, upon activation would
send a signal to the local control room within five seconds, thus giving the fastest response
available.
Please note also that the outside beams described earlier would also be connected to the new
alarm thus giving an indication of intruders outside, near to the store.

Access Control System.                                                                      .   . .
It has been pointed out that this is an extremely important aspect of the system. With this in mina
and the description of what is required the following system is suggested.

        1. Two reader controller
        2. IR Swipe reader
        3. Swipe cards ( x4)
        4. Power supply
        5. Lock release
        6. Cable
        7. Push button lock release

        TOTAL         =       £ 960

The system would operate in the following way. There would be one card reader that would be
programmed so that two cards would have to be "read" before the lock was released. There is a
printer output available to enable each individual event to be printed as well as be kept within the
systems own internal memory. A push button would be fitted inside the store to allow exit from t e
store.
Please note that the printer will have to be sourced elsewhere ( possibly from I.S. dept). As tne
printer uses RS-232 serial communication then it can be installed upto 50 feet from the controller,
possibly where the outside video surveillance equipment is to be kept.

Internal Video surveillance.
This can be a relatively basic system. As well as giving images of an intruder the system would
give additional information about people using the room, such as who used the room, how long
they were there and what they did. I would also install the VCR in a lockable enclosure within the
store room. This system would cost if in the region of £600.
In addition to the above an additional camera system similar to the one above could be installed
giving images immediately outside the store in the corridor. This would be at a similar cost.




                                                  2
Additional notes.

The existing alarm system needs to be modified. As it stands an intruder could enter the building
via the ground floor toilet and get to the door of the store without being detected.

At the moment I believe that the fire alarm only provides detection of smoke. There is no system in
place to either extinguish or contain fire. As it is paper documents that are being stored a halon
gas type system may need to be considered.

A number of the components of the system will require mains points installing close to where
equipment is to be installed.

It is possible to view what is happening at the site from a remote location such as Force Op's or
the local ACR. Equipment is available to do this but again will incur further cost.

The alarm and CCTV equipment will indicate when an intruder is attacking the premises. As I am
sure you are aware they will not prevent the building from being attacked. If the intruders primary
concern is the material stored at the premises then the easiest option is to destroy it. I feel that the
building isn't substantial enough to resist attack. Therefore, even if the alarm is activated the
response to it needs to be near immediate. If this cannot be guaranteed then it is likely that some,
if not all the material may be lost.

Dear Mr Bone

Hillsborough Scrutiny

Thank you for your letter of 6 August 1997 which I received on 8 August 1997.

I have made arrangements for the Phillips report to be supplied to you. I have reservations
about making it available to a wider audience. The report was commissioned by the (then)
Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police in anticipation of civil actions against the Force.
We have appointed Winckworth Pemberton to provide legal advice to us on the Scrutiny. I
will ask Mr OWSTON to advise me on whether the release of the Phillips report to Ms
Adlington would compromise issues of confidentiality.

I have a similar reservation about the release of the report which the Chief Constable
provided to the Home Secretary before the General Election. Again I will ask for advice
from our solicitors.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, you and your staff are entitled to unrestricted access to our store
of material. I am happy to supply material to other people but not if it breaches the privacy
of others or if the material is confidential, for instance legal advice.

I will turn now to the issues raised by Ms Ann Adlington, solicitor for the Hillsborough
Families Support Group. In her letter to you, dated 5 August 1997, she says she is
“extremely concerned at their (South Yorkshire Police) delaying tactics” in supplying the
statements of two named individuals. Ms Adlington wrote to us on 17 July 1997 asking for
some statements. I wrote to you on 23 July to ask permission of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith
to release material. On 30 July 1997 you wrote to say that it was in order to release any
material we deemed fit to release. Your letter arrived on Friday 1 August 1997. I was out
of the office that day and acted upon it on Monday 4 August. I do not think this can be
construed as “delaying tactics”. Please feel free to copy all this letter to Ms Adlington if you
wish.

Yours sincerely

HILLSBOROUGH


We spoke about the attached letter which I have had from Ann Adlington, solicitor to the
Family Support Group.

2.     She asks in her first paragraph about the report on Hillsborough by Mr Phillips. She
suggests that we supply the Group with a copy of that report, of which it seems the families
were previously unaware.

3.      You said you would be writing to me about the origin of this report. It was, I think
you said, commissioned by Mr Wright as chief officer of South Yorkshire in anticipation of
civil actions against the force. My initial view, having briefly read the parts you sent (I do
not have pages 9 to 149) is that it is unlikely to contain any ‘new’ evidence about the disaster.
We would like to see the parts we have not yet had, but I doubt whether they will prove to be
of much interest in Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s scrutiny.

4.    But I think it would be helpful to meet Ms Adlington’s request. Do South Yorkshire
have any objection to the Group having a copy of the report (in full)? If not, I think it would
be more sensible for you to send it to her yourselves.

5.      Ms Adlington asks also for a copy of the report which your force provided to Mr
Howard before the General Election. This is, I think, the two volumes of material attached to
Mr Wells’s letter of 3 February to Paul Pugh at the Home Office. Would there by any
difficulty about that? If not, it would again help us if you could let her have the papers
direct.

 6.    Ms Adlington’s last paragraph takes up the subject of the statements by Houldsworth
 and Walker. I know you are actioning this. But it might help if I confirm that, as Mike
 Ward said in his letter last week, there is no objection from the point of view of Lord Justice


 G:\HILLSBOR\MAIN\SYORKS.027
Stuart-Smith’s scrutiny to the release of currently existing documents and photographs to
those who have a need to see them. We have no difficulty with your force policy on this
you have outlined it to us.

7.      I hope this is not too burdensome.

    Dear Mr Bone

    Further to our recent telephone conversation I would confirm that
    Ian Daines, Assistant Chief Constable, South Yorkshire Police has
    provided me with a copy of a letter to him from your office dated
    30 July 1997-  That letter contains an acknowledgment of receipt
    of a report on the fiisaster by David Phillips, then Deputy Chief
    Constable of Devon and Cornwall Constabulary.   I should be
    grateful if you would supply me with a copy of this report.

    In addition, the former Home Secretary Michael Howard asked the
    Chief Constable of South Yorkshire to provide him with a detailed
    report of all the points raised in the Hillsborough programme.
    Are you able to furnish me with a copy of the report?

    Finally, please find enclosed copies of my written requests to
    South Yorkshire Police asking them to forward statements made by
    Roger Houldsworth and Dr Ed Walker.  As discussed I am extremely
    concerned at their delaying tactics and would aak you to bring
    this matter to the attention of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith.

    I thank you for your assistance.

Dear Mr Bone

Hillsborough Scrutiny

On 23 July 1997 I wrote to you regarding a report by Mr David Phillips concerning the
Hillsborough Stadium Disaster. As indicated in that letter, I wrote to Mr Phillips to seek
clarification of the background to his report.

On 4 August 1997 I received a reply from Mr Phillips (attached). I believe that Mr Philips’
reply confirms my earlier view that his report does not constitute “new evidence”. However,
that is a matter for Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to decide, not me.

The Chief Constable has instructed me that anything which could be possibly construed as
new evidence should be brought to your attention and I will continue to comply with that
instruction.

Yours sincerely

                           Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s Scrutiny of Hillsborough

                  Thank you for your letter regarding the above. At the time of the Hillsborough
          Disaster I was the Secretary of the ACPO Football Hooliganism Committee and had done
          much to promote a universal approach to the problems of policing football. As a
          consequence I was asked by the then Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, Peter Wright, if
          I would provide a professional expert opinion which might be relied upon in the civil
          proceedings which were anticipated. I prepared my report on that basis both by reference
          to the evidence which came before the hearing; statements obtained in the course of the
          enquiry led by then ACC Mervyn Jones of West Midlands and by interviewing a number
          of people myself and examining documents. The real weight of my report is interpretive.
          For example, I think it was highly significant that the football ground had hardly ever
          been at capacity in the preceding 12 years whereby there was no local knowledge of the
          problems relating to overcrowding; I think that the evidence relating to the previous
          overspill which Mr. Gosling dealt with and the correspondence thereafter, was of great
          importance; I believe that the failure of John Motson and so many other commentators to
          recognise overcrowding was significant; I believe that the engineering of the ground,
          particularly in relation to the lack of secure connection between turnstiles and parts of the
          ground with crowd limits, was a matter of greater importance than the enquiry considered;
          and finally I think there was a good deal of evidence about the conduct of the late arriving
          Liverpool supporters which seemed to be minimised as the enquiry concentrated upon the
          tragic blamelessness of those who suffered.

                 I hope my observations are of some value.

                                                    With respect,

Dear Mr Ward

Hillsborough Stadium Disaster

I refer to your letter of 30 July 1997 and, at the risk of appearing to be pedantic, I must ask
you to clarify one point.

We continue to receive requests for various items; for example

a)    photographs of the ground and deceased persons,

b)     statements made by the person requesting that statement,

c)     statements made by a person who authorises the release of that statement to a
        third party.

Your letter only approves the release of copies of statements to those who made them.

As indicated previously, we have been releasing papers to interested parties for many
years. We have no objection to continuing to do so but the Chief Constable is anxious not
to act without the approval of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith.

I would be obliged if you would clarify the position at your earliest convenience.

Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Daines

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER

I am writing further to your four letters of 23 July to Chris Bone.

As requested, I can acknowledge receipt of both the report on the disaster by David Phillips,
then Deputy Chief Constable of Devon and Cornwall Constabulary, and of the copies of
correspondence to the Chief Constable.

With regard to the approach you have received from Ms Ann Adlington, I can confirm that
we are content for you to agree to any requests you receive for copies of statements from
those who made them. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has indicated in letters to interested parties
that documents can be made available in such circumstances.

Your offer of assistance in considering the various video tapes, photographs and
documentation in your premises at Heeley is much appreciated, and we shall be in contact in
due course to discuss arrangements further.

Yours sincerely




Mike Ward

Dear Mr Bone

Report by David Phillips on Hillsborough Disaster

I attach a report dated August 1990 by Mr David Phillips, then Deputy Chief Constable of
Devon and Cornwall Constabulary, now Chief Constable of Kent.

The provenance of the report is a little unclear. At paragraph 2.1, Mr Phillips says;

       “On 20th October, 1989, I was asked to consider documentary material emanating
       from the Inquiry conducted by Lord Justice TAYLOR into the disaster at
       Hillsborough. I have confined my research to a consideration of documentary
       evidence although I have spoken to other senior police officers, serving and retired,
       in relation to this match and other issues in general, (none of whom had any direct
       involvement in the game at Hillsborough).”

In response to your request for “fresh evidence” to be submitted to you, I forward this
document. I do not believe it represents fresh evidence but is principally another
perspective on pre-existing evidence. However, as with all similar material, the Chief
Constable would prefer to lay material before you rather than pre-judge the material’s
freshness. I will cause enquiries to be made into the background that led to this report and
will contact you again as soon as I have more information.

I would be obliged if you could acknowledge receipt of this letter.

Yours sincerely




Ian Daines
Assistant Chief Constable

Dear Chris

Please find attached unsolicited correspondence from:




Each letter is pertinent to the scrutiny to be carried out by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith. Some
of the correspoondence suggests that they have fresh evidence to offer. I have
acknowledged each letter using the same format (a specimen letter is attached). In
response to my replies I have further letters from two of the correspondents (attached).

I forward these papers for your attention to deal with as you see fit. Please acknowledge
receipt of this and all the attached.

Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Bone

Requests for Access to Hillsborough Related Material

I attach a letter I recently received from Ms Ann Adlington. I also attach the reply I have
faxed to her.

The Chief Constable has responded to many similar requests over the years and has no
objection to responding to this request. However, as explained in my letter to Ms Adlington,
I feel I should consult you first.

We have received a number of similar requests in recent weeks and have acknowledged
them in similar vein. Again I am happy to respond to them but do not wish to do so without
your approval.

Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Bone

Documents Pertaining to Hillsborough Disaster

I refer to the letter dated July 1997 from Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to Richard Wells, Chief
Constable of South Yorkshire. In paragraph 3, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith asks that you be
informed of the nature of documents we hold and how you may obtain access to them.

Our store of documents is held in police premises at Heeley, near the centre of Sheffield.
Our Heeley offices accommodate the Discipline and Complaints Department and the Audio
and Visual Aids Unit. The premises are locked and alarmed at night.

The store room of documents contains about 70 hours of video tape recordings, 30
photograph albums and numerous documents, statements and transcripts. The room is
about 15 feet square and is full from floor to ceiling with shelves of Hillsborough related
items. There is also a central column of documents. There is about 315 feet of shelves full
of papers, etc. We have a computer to help keep track of all the items. Many of the
documents, videos etc are duplicates of records held by other bodies.

We will provide every assistance to you and your staff in gaining access to the documents.
Constable Ken GREENWAY (tel: 0114 2821047) is conversant with all aspects of the
disaster and the documentation. He works at Heeley and I am sure you will find him of
great assistance in your work.

Please contact me when you have considered ho"/ you wish to work, and I will make the
necessary arrangements.

Yours sincerely




Ian Daines

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER


I have been appointed by the Home Secretary to conduct a scrutiny of possible fresh evidence
relating to the Hillsborough Stadium disaster. I am writing to ask for your assistance (my
Secretary Mr Bone has already spoken to ACC Daines).

It might be helpful if I explain that the objective of my scrutiny is to establish whether there
is any significant new evidence which was not previously available to Lord Taylor’s Inquiry,
to the Inquests, or to the prosecuting or police disciplinary authorities. If there is significant
evidence, it will be my aim to see if it would have affected the outcome of any of the
proceedings. I hope to report my findings to the Home Secretary by the end of the year. I
attach my terms of reference.

In the course of my work I expect that I will need to have access to the documents about the
incident and the various proceedings arising out of it which are held by your force. I should
be obliged if you arrange for tiie Secretariat to my scrutiny to be informed in writing by 4
August of the nature of these documents and how we may most conveniently obtain access to
them.

I have already seen the material submitted by you under cover of your letter of 3 February
1997 to Mr Pugh, including the two files and the video recordings TB1 and TB2.

If your force has any fresh evidence relating to the disaster I would be grateful if it could be
forwarded to my Secretariat, at the address above, by 1 September.

I have written to the Hillsborough Family Support Group and to various other people who
have come forward asking for some basic summary information about the new evidence
which is said to exist. This information will help me during the preliminary stages of my
work.
As my scrutiny of the evidence proceeds I may wish to interview some witnesses directly. I
am also willing to consider interviewing individual witnesses at their request. These
interviews will be private.

The Secretariat to my scrutiny will be happy to discuss the arrangements if you wish. Please
note that the telephone and room numbers shown above are temporary - we will notify you of
our permanent address and telephone as soon as we have them.

      SCRUTINY OIM THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER



      STATEMENT BY LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH



     "I.have today started work on the scrutiny of possible new evidence
     relating to the Hillsborough Stadium disaster. My objective is to establish
     whether there is any significant evidence which was not previously
     available to Lord Taylor's Inquiry, to the inquests, or to the prosecuting or
     disciplinary authorities.                                           ’   .


     "If there is significant evidence, it will be my aim to see if it would have
     affected the outcome of any of the various proceedings.      I w ill then advise
     the Home Secretary whether in my opinion there should be a further public
     inquiry, and the prosecuting and disciplinary authorities and the Attorney
     General whether the fresh evidence is such that they should reconsider the .
     decisions they have already taken.


     "I vyill shortly be inviting written representations from those interested and
     w ill then decide whom I wish to see in person. But I can confirm that after
     the summer I w ill go to Liverpool to meet the relatives of those killed and
     their legal representatives.


     "The meetings I have w ill be private and I w ill not be making any public
                                                                           •?
     comments on the evidence or representations which are made to me. during
     the course of the scrutiny. I hope to report my findings to the Home
     Secretary towards the end of the year.


     "Anyone who considers that they are able to submit material to me ’S h o u ld
     contact my secretary via Room 528, Home Office, 50 Quieen Anne's Gate,
     London SW1H SAT."

  Dear Mr Hepworth

  Hillsborough Scrutiny

  Thank you for your letter of 13th October enclosing documentation giving the history of
  South Yorkshire Police’s policy on disclosing information culminating in the letter to Mr
  Bone of 10th October. Ailsa and I will absorb this but at the moment I have nothing to add
  to the comments made in my letter of 10th October.

RE: HILLSBOROUGH SCRUTINY

I refer to my telephone conversation of 1 October 1997 with Ailsa Lawrence, in which I briefed
her about Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's visit to South Yorkshire on 24 September 1997 and his look
at our archive material. During the examination of material he saw and was given copies of two
plans of pens 3 and 4 on the Leppings Lane terraces, one being a composite plan of the
locations where the deceased were last seen alive and the other being a composite plan,
showing the first locations in which they were believed to be deceased. As agreed with Ailsa I
enclose copies of the two plans (Ref DRG9 and DRG10).

We also provided copies of the transcripts of both the mini inquests and the main inquests.
Would you wish to be provided with copies, or because of the bulk of the material would you
prefer to wait until such time as any queries arise from Lord Justice Stuart-Smith?

At the meeting a number of other verbal requests for research and/or information were made and
we secured an agreement that they would be put into writing. To date no written requests have
been received. On 8 October I therefore wrote to Chris Bone, reminding him of this and also
setting out the seven further areas I believe we had been requested to research or report on.
I enclose a copy of the letter for information.

Would you wish to receive copies of the reports which I forwarded to Chris Bone,
with the exception perhaps of the Granada Television approach to a member of the
Hillsborough Inquest Jury, which at the moment fall far short of a Contempt of Court?

     RE: REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION FROM HILLSBOROUGH ARCHIVES

     During the visit of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, Chris Catherall and yourself to the
     Hillsborough Archives at Heeley on Wednesday 24 September 1997, you made a number of
     requests to us for information, which you agreed to put in writing. To date we have not received
     these.

  Of the two requests we have already responded to, one on 24 September 1997 was to supply
^ transcripts of the mainand mini inquests and the other was the provision of copies of the plans of
& the Leppings Lane         terrace reference C275and C276, which we forwarded on
  30 September 1997.

     If my memory serves me correctly the other requests were:-

/ Report on continued research into amendment of officers' recollections;

     Research and report on the suggestion that officers were coached to give evidence to
2    Lord Justice Taylor's enquiry;

3     Research and report on the provision of video tapes to Yorkshire Television;

      Examine the copy video tape provided by yourself via Trevor Hicks and identify where the
 '    various shots are from;

          Incidentally, neither Ken Greenway nor myself has sufficient knowledge, nor the information to
          supply the details which you are likely to request about the civil actions, particularly as most of
          them were confidential. The outcomes are not within the knowledge of the force solicitor,
          Alan Walker either. I therefore have in mind to write to Peter Metcalf of Hammond Suddards
          Solicitors at Empire House, 10 Piccadilly, Bradford BD1 3LR, who acted for
          South Yorkshire Police and our Insurers in these hearings, asking him if he will respond to your
          request once we receive it, unless of course you wish to write to him directly. I will not action this
          further until I hear from you.

              Work is progressing on the other requests and I shall soon be in a position to start responding.

              Finally, I believe there was a suggestion that Chris Catherall should revisit Heeley to examine the
              police officers' statements and the amendments made to them. Can you inform me if this is to
              take place and a likely date, please.

Dear Mr Owston

Hillsborough Stadium Disaster Scrutiny

Thank you for your letter of 3 September 1997.

I am grateful to you for your opinion that the Phillips report is not relevant to any current
litigation. That being the case, we can now consider whether we wish to release it to the
Hillsborough Families Support Group (HFSG).

The HFSG are aware of the existence of the Phillips report and have asked for its release.
They might misconstrue a refusal as evidence that we were suppressing material. That is
not the case and I have, therefore, instructed Constable Greenway that the Phillips report
be forwarded to the HFSG.

You asked the role of Brian Alderman; he works in the legal section of the South Yorkshire
Police Authority and has a knowledge of legal issues surrounding the disaster. In view of
what Peter Metcalfe has told you, I do not think we need to trouble Brian at this stage.

On 3 September 1997 Mr Chris Bone, Secretary of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s Scrutiny,
spent the day with Constable Green way and I at Heeley Police office. In order to brief you
on that meeting, I have arrange to come to your offices at 11.00 am on Wednesday 17
September 1997. I will be accompanied by Ken and Superintendent Alan Hepworth.
Perhaps the most significant thing to emerge from our meeting with Chris Bone was that
they have received almost no submissions which suggests that fresh evidence has been
uncovered. The only real exception to that is my letter dated 8 August 1997 to Lord Justice
Stuart-Smith (copy attached) of which I advised you in my letter of 8 August 1997.

See you next week.

Yours sincerely

Dear Sir

Hillsborough Scrutiny

On 23 July 1997 the Chief Constable, Mr Richard Wells, wrote to you (copy letter attached
for ease of reference). On Page 2, Paragraph 4, he referred to a planned visit to
Hillsborough Stadium. Things were said during that visit which Mr Wells is keen that you
should know of (Mr Wells began a period of leave on 30 July 1997).

Mr Wells and I met Constable GREENWAY and Inspector CALVERT at the stadium.
Constable Greenway fulfils a role as archivist and librarian for our Hillsborough material.
Inspector Calvert worked on a number of football matches before the disaster and was
involved in planning events.

Constable Greenway had prepared an album of photographs, taken at the time of the
disaster, which allowed Mr Wells and I to picture the stadium as it was then. We walked
around the inside and outside of the ground and re-familiarised ourselves with what had
happened.

During this tour, Inspector Calvert said that officers, who had been on duty on the day of
the disaster, were instructed to write their own statements and to include anything that may
have been relevant. Inspector Calvert said that when these statements came back from
typing they had been altered in a manner that some officers had found unacceptable, but
they had nonetheless signed the statements.

Inspector Calvert said that officers were coached in evidence to give to Lord Taylor’s
enquiry but that practice ceased part way through the enquiry when it became apparent
that officers were unable or unwilling to adhere to an unacceptable version of the truth.




                                                                        Direct Line: 0114 2523405
            Tel: 0114 2202020                                           Direct Fax: 0114 2523481
The Chief Constable and I were concerned at the implications of Inspector Calvert’s
comments. We did not question him nor comment lest any such action be misconstrued.
At the conclusion of our visit, Mr Wells and I discussed what we had heard.

Mr Wells said that in the seven years he has been Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, he
has not previously heard such things, nor have I in my 12 months with South Yorkshire.
Nonetheless, we resolved to act upon Inspector Calvert's comments.

Our store of Hillsborough Disaster material is held in the Discipline and Complaints
Department at Heeley Police office. The acting Head of that Department is Superintendent
Alan FOSTER. Mr Wells and I discussed with Superintendent Foster the action to be
taken. Superintendent Foster said that he had been a member of the team of officers who
had worked on the enquiry that followed the disaster. Part of that team’s role was to liaise
with the officers of West Midlands Police and to facilitate their work. Superintendent Foster
recalled that officers on duty at the disaster were instructed to write their “recollections” and
to put down anything they felt, as well as what they believed to be true. He said that, on
legal advice, the recollections were then converted into statements of evidence. He was
unsure of the source of that advice as he was relying upon his memory of events some
eight years ago.

Superintendent Foster recollected that officers who were to give evidence to Lord Taylor's
enquiry were prepared in the sense that they were briefed. Lord Taylor’s enquiry was
conducted differently to officers' experiences of giving evidence in a criminal court. It was
an enquiry not a trial. The nature of giving evidence, and questions on that evidence, were
not as in a criminal case. The event itself was traumatic for many officers in a way that is
rare in criminal trials.

As discussed with Mr Wells and Superintendent Foster, I examined our archive of
Hillsborough Disaster material. The “recollections" of officers are systematically filed there:
Some are handwritten. Some are typed in a manner that suggests to me that the officers
did the typing (spelling mistakes, poor type alignment, etc). All that was written in the
recollections was then typed into the HOLMES computer. HOLMES (Home Office Large
Major Enquiry System) was launched in 1987 and the Hillsborough Disaster was one of the
first major uses of it in South Yorkshire.

The typed recollections have been annotated by indexers, police officers who identifying
salient points to be entered in the HOLMES index. For instance, if Constable 123 SMITH
refers to being on duty in serial 21 under the supervision of Sergeant 456 JONES, the
indexer would highlight “serial 21” and “Sergeant 456 JONES” as cross references. Actions
would be raised to ensure that a statement was obtained from Sergeant 456 Jones and
other officers in serial 21.

Some of the typed recollections show pencil lines through some sentences.                 These
statements are in a box marked “Amended Statements".

I examined a small number of randomly selected amended statements. One officer’s
statement contained a page of information about the writer’s feelings the following day
(shock, distress etc) and the reactions of his colleagues. That part of his statement was
deleted no doubt because it was not relevant to the causes of the disaster. Another
statement referred to the duties performed by Special Constables on the day of the
disaster. The officer expressed opinions to the effect that Special Constables should be
confined to traffic point duties. That part of his statement was deleted, no doubt because it
was opinion not evidence. One statement has a note attached which says that the officer
declined to delete parts of it.

Also in the archive is a letter dated 7 June 1989 from Mr Mervyn JONES, Assistant Chief
Constable, West Midlands Police, to Mr David BRUMMELL, Treasury Solicitor. Mr
Brummell was one of the team who assisted Lord Taylor in his enquiry. I attach a copy of
Mr Jones’ letter. The opening sentence is pertinent to this matter and I quote it in full;

       “You will recall that in the early stages, because of the slowness of the supply of
       written recollections from South Yorkshire officers, it was agreed that we would take
       from them their initial submissions which would be later superseded by their signed
       final versions, after they had been checked by the appropriate legal advice”.

I attach a copy of Mr Brummell’s reply, also dated 7 June 1989. Mr Brummell recognises
that “expressions of opinion were removed from the first versions”. He also says, “it would
not be appropriate to use the original statement for the purpose of the inquiry when this has
been superseded by a subsequent statement”.

The conclusion I draw from this is that the existence of the “recollections” was known to
Lord Taylor’s team and there was no aspect of suppressing evidence. It is a matter for
your Lordship to decide whether Inspector Calvert has “fresh evidence” to offer but my
opinion is that Inspector Calvert was not conversant with what happened and has
misunderstood a perfectly open and proper procedure.

I hold a similar view of Inspector Calvert’s statement that officers were coached in the
evidence to give. In chapter 18 of his interim report, Lord Taylor comments specifically on
the evidence of police officers (paragraphs 279 and 280). Lord Taylor said, "... I must
report that for the most part the quality of their (police officers) evidence was in inverse
proportion to their rank ... the senior officers in command were defensive and evasive
witnesses ... neither their handling of problems on the day nor their account of it in
evidence showed the qualities of leadership to be expected of their rank”

As a police officer, it gives me no comfort to say that Lord Taylor clearly found some police
witnesses lacking. He was more than capable of determining the truth of what he heard
and had good lawyers to help him.

I think it naive of Inspector Calvert to confuse briefing with coaching. To even attempt to
manipulate witnesses, about to face such a rigorous process with so much hard evidence
(videos, photographs), would have been foolish as well as criminal.

  Dear Mr Daines

  Hillsborough Stadium Disaster Scrutiny

  Many thanks for your letter of 29th August. I have now had an opportunity of talking to
  Peter Metcalf of Hammond Suddards. He was extremely useful and gave me all the
  necessary information about the provenance of the Phillips Report.

  He convinced me that it was indeed an expert report produced with litigation in mind. It
  was referred to in evidence and it was disclosed in proceedings which were eventually
  settled. As such its status was potentially privileged in the sense that, until it was put in
  evidence, it would have been possible for South Yorkshire Police to claim legal professional
  privilege in relation to it. Now that privilege has been waived by its disclosure in those
  initial proceedings it is a relevant document which would have to be disclosed in any future
  proceedings.

  I have read it in detail now. Incidentally when I spoke to Mr Davies I had not had time to
  read it and I apprehended from the way I had been instructed that it may have contained
  material which would be damaging to South Yorkshire Police. Instead, of course, it contains
  a good deal of fairly robust defence material on behalf of the police.

  At the moment you are minded not to produce the document to Ms Adlington and whilst
  you would be perfectly entitled not to produce it in the sense that she has no right to
  documentation, that stance is contrary to your expressed policy on the material which you
  are holding and it is my legal opinion that there is no viable-privilege which would protect
  this document.

  Ms Adlington now knows of the existence of the document and she will probably continue
  to press for it until a copy is made available. As I know little about Ms Adlington and
  precisely what she stands for I do not want to express a view on whether tactically it would
  be sensible to let her have the report now or later.

   I do not think the background documentation relating to the Phillips Report is nearly so
   important as I had previously thought it was but if there are any letters commissioning him
   to do this work then I should, in fullness of time, be provided with copies of them.

Dear Mr Owston

Hillsborough Stadium Disaster Scrutiny

Thank you for your letter of 21 August 1997. I have recently returned from a period of
leave and I have been briefed by my colleague, Assistant Chief Constable Martin DAVIES.

There are two issues which I propose to tackle: Dr Walker and the Phillips report.

I attach a copy of a letter which Martin DAVIES sent on 19 August 1997 to Mr Christopher
BONE, Secretary to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s Scrutiny. The letter relates to Dr Walker’s
medical condition. I also attach a copy of Mr Bone’s acknowledgement. At this stage,
these letters are purely for your information.

I will turn now to the Phillips report. You are right to draw my attention to the possible
collision of policy of wishing to be open but withholding the Phillips report. My rationale is
that there is primary and secondary material. Primary material is direct evidence of what
happened on the day of the disaster; statements, maps, photographs, videos etc. We are
as open as possible in providing access to that material. Secondary material includes
items such as the Phillips report which was an interpretation of the primary material and
was prepared for an internal purpose (cf the public inquest and Lord Taylor’s enquiry). My
use of the terms “primary” and “secondary” is my own terminology not a legal usage.

We have supplied a copy of the Phillips report to Mr Bone. It is the function of Lord Justice
Stuart-Smith to determine whether there is new evidence and if it is relevant. Ms Adlington,
on behalf of the Hillsborough Families Support Group, has asked for a copy of the Phillips
report. Mr Phillips is content for the report to be released. Martin Davies has made
informal contact with the solicitors to the apportionment action to which the report was
germane. They feel it could be released. Before I sanction that course of action, I would
                                            lawyer, Mr Peter Metcalf (details below) and Mr

                                                                         Direct Line: 0114 2523405
            Tel: 0114 2202020                                            Direct Fax: 0114 2523481
Brian Alderman (details below). When you have their advice and information, please
advise me on whether the legal position of the Chief Constable could be damaged by
making the Phillips report public and whether privilege could be claimed. If there is no
threat to the Chief Constable’s position, I will then decide whether to make the report
public. I am sorry if that sounds convoluted.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can be of assistance.

Yours sincerely

  Dear Mr Daines

  Hillsborough Stadium Scrutiny

  I am enclosing a copy of a letter I wrote to P C Greenway on 18th August which I am sure
  will have been brought to your attention anyway. I also had the benefit of a couple of brief
  conversations with Mr Davies and now that I have read the Phillips Inquiry and Report as
  well as seeing a copy of Mr Phillips’ letter of 30th July, I have obviously gained a clearer
  impression of its privileged status.

  We do however need to have a thorough understanding of the circumstances in which the
  Phillips Inquiry came to be commissioned and any correspondence or brief which exists in
  respect of that will have a strong influence on my opinion.

  The other points which we will have to understand fully relate to the extent of any litigation
  past, present or pending and the terms on which any litigation has been compromised,
  adjudicated on or discontinued. Ms Adlington’s request will have to be dealt with as of
  course will the points raised in Mr Bone’s letter of 6th August.

  I also need to talk through with you the slight collision of policy which I think we may have
  to come to terms with over on the one hand supplying any interested person with any of the
  relevant material and on the other hand withholding the Phillips Inquiry on grounds of legal
  professional privilege. We also need to review the interaction of the negotiation of any
  claims which are outstanding with co-operation with the Scrutiny bearing in mind the role
  of Hammond Suddards and your insurers.

  Incidentally our address is 35 Great Peter Street, not number 34.

  Yours sincerely,

Dear Mr Greenway

Hillsborough Disaster Scrutiny

I refer to our telephone conversation on Friday afternoon and the two earlier conversations
I had with Mr Davies.

The subject of this letter is the status of the Inquiry and Report by J D Phillips BA (econ)
dated August 1990, then Deputy Chief Constable of Devon and Cornwall constabulary and
now Chief Constable of Kent. It is also written in the light of Mr Dames’ letter of 8th
August 1997 when he tells Mr Bone of the Scrutiny unit at the Home Office that I am
advising South Yorkshire Police on whether the Phillips Inquiry and Report should be
available to Ms Adlington.

Mr Phillips’ Report does not say on the face of it that it was compiled for the predominant
purpose of dealing with actual or anticipated civil actions against South Yorkshire Police.
It does present Mr Phillips as an expert in policing public order events and dealing with
large crowds and at clause 1.3 it states:-

"as Secretary to the ACPO Sub-Committee I prepared and presented Police evidence to both
the Inquiry conducted by Mr Justice Popplewell and the Inquiry conducted by Lord Justice
Taylor".

There is nothing on the face of the Phillips’ Inquiry which would obviously make it
privileged. Nevertheless the task which Mr Phillips was commissioned to undertake and his
letters of instruction might well have this effect. I have also now seen a letter from Mr
Phillips, as Chief Constable of Kent, to Mr Daines dated 30th July 1997. In that letter he
says that he was asked to write...

 "a professional expert opinion which might be relied upon in the civil proceedings which
 were anticipated."

 Legal professional privilege would mean that the document could be withheld even if the
 anticipated litigation did not materialise, if the case itself was adjudicated on, judgement was
 given or if the case was settled or compromised. Once the privilege is established it
 continues to run.

   Dear Mr Giecirway

   Hillsborough Disaster Scrutiny

   I am acknowledging receipt of Mr Daines’ letter of 8th August enclosing a copy of the
   Inquiry and Report by J D Phillips, Deputy Chief Constable of Devon and Cornwall in
   August 1990, and two ring binder volumes amounting to a response to Home Office
   enquiries resulting from the drama/documentary and three videos.

   I also note the contents of Mr Daines’ letter to Mr Bone in the Home Office of 8th August.
   Of course the Phillips Inquiry Report had been supplied to the Scrutiny team but Mr Daines
   is concerned as to whether that documentation should be made available to Ms Ann
   Adlington on behalf of the Hillsborough Family Support Group.

   I have only looked at the very beginning of the Phillips Inquiry Report but it does not
   introduce itself in a way which would firmly suggest that it could be the subject of legal
   professional privilege. As mentioned on the telephone, legal professional privilege is
   available where any document or evidence comes into existence with a predominant purpose
   of its being used in legal proceedings.

   Therefore if the Phillips Inquiry Report d o e s n o t p r o c la im legal professional p r i vilege; at its
   outset or if the whole tenor of the Report does not put it in that category, the only other
   possibility is that the letter or correspondence commissioning the Report might give it that
   status. Can you therefore please investigate how the Phillips Report came to be
   commissioned so that I can decide whether there might be a claim of legal professional
   privilege in respect of it.

   Although it is not strictly part of my instructions, I also need to consider the status of the
   Phillips Report in any litigation which is under way. I understand from you that there are
   two sets of litigation which are current, one involves a test case of six claims by "rescuers"
   and their case is subject to an appeal to the House o f Lords. I do not think the Phillips
   Report would be relevant to that case because presumably the test case relates to claims for
   compensation for suffering, shock and trauma in the rescue process as rescuers.

The other litigation is apparently being pursued by a firm in Liverpool called Wakeman
Rutherfords and if I understood the position correctly from Mr Daines, it is being defended
on your behalf by Messrs Hammond Suddards. Even if legal professional privilege had been
claimed in relation to the Phillips Report in that civil litigation, its existence should have
been disclosed. It therefore follows that its existence should have been disclosed to
Hammond Suddards. Can you confirm that is the case?

I notice, in passing, that Ms Adlington was not aware of the existence of the Phillips Report
until recently and if she was liaising closely with the active litigation which is going on and
being pursued by Wakeman Rutherfords, I would have expected her to have been aware of
the existence of that Report. It was because of this that I thought I should contact you to
see what the state of disclosure of that Report really was.

If there are good grounds for withholding the Phillips Report on grounds of legal
professional privilege, then the advice in that direction from me will be clear. If there are
no grounds for withholding it then South Yorkshire Police will have to operate according
to their policy on this whole subject. My understanding of the policy was that full
disclosure of all material you were holding and all the material which had been made
available to Lord Justice Taylor would be disclosed to any interested party once they
established that they had an interest which was more than just frivolous. If that is the case
and in the absence of any claim for privilege, I would have thought that it should be
disclosed. However I can quite see that begs the question of why it has not been disclosed
in the past when you have adopted a policy of full disclosure.

Yours sincerely,

Dear Mr Owston

Hillsborough Disaster Scrutiny

Thank you for your letter of 29 July 1997 and your fax of 5 August 1997. They show that
you and Ailsa Lawrence have quickly mastered a very complex issue. Your letters were
addressed to Alan Walker, Force Solicitor. He and I have discussed the issues you raise.

Alan’s role was to secure the services of a good solicitor (yourselves), to arrange a first
meeting and to advise me on terms of engagement. I attach your “Client Care”
memorandum which I have signed. Now that we have completed the formalities, Alan will
withdraw.

On the specific topic of medical evidence, Ailsa and I discussed a few thoughts on 5
August. The Sheffield Coroner, Dr Stefan POPPER, conducted the inquest into 95 deaths.
The inquest jury ruled that death was caused by “accident”. In recent months articles have
appeared in newspapers reporting interviews with Dr Edward WALKER. He has also been
interviewed on television. Dr Walker has said that he was not seen by police officers
enquiring into the disaster. He has also said that some people were alive after 3.15pm
Saturday 15 April 1989; the time at which Dr POPPER ruled that they were dead.

Constable GREENWAY gave you a file of papers relating to these issues. One item is a
statement dated 20 July 1989, by Dr Walker. The original is seven pages long. The
photocopy (which you have) does not reveal that the original is written in blue ink as are the
signatures of Dr Walker. The persons witnessing his signature, police officer^             ^nd
APPLETON, have signed in black ink. Dr Walker has left a blank line between paragraphs;
a practice not used by police officers when writing statements. My point is that Dr Walker
did make a statement, he wrote it himself, signed his name eight times, two police officers
witnessed the process and it happened three months after the disaster. I am therefore at a
loss to understand why he is saying he did not make a statement.




                                                                          Direct Line: 0114 2523405
            Tel: 0114 2202020                                             Direct Fax: 0114 2523481
We have received numerous requests, over the years, for copies of documents. We have
released statements to deponents, solicitors acting on their behalf and persons authorised
by deponents. We have released plans and sketches to anyone with a genuine interest.
We have released crowd scene video stills and photographs to anyone with a genuine
interest. We have been cautious about releasing photographs of casualties. We have
released these photographs to close family members or their solicitors but not if a
photograph shows another identifiable casualty. We follow this policy out of respect for
the privacy of other people. We also release statements which have been made public at
the inquest and/or Lord Taylor’s enquiry.

Miss Ann ADLINGTON is a solicitor representing the Hillsborough Family Support Group.
She has written to us asking for various statements and has produced authorisations
signed by the deponents. Some requests have been received since the Home Secretary
announced the establishment of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s Scrutiny. I have written to Mr
Chris BONE, Secretary to the Scrutiny, to say that I have no objection to releasing material
but do not propose to do so until I have his permission. I am keen not to cut across the
work of his Lordship. The first reply from Mr Bone only referred to releasing statements to
those who made them. I wrote again to ask if it was in order to release statements to
authorised third parties and if it was in order to release sketches and photographs (subject
to the restriction described above). I kept Miss Adlington informed of each development.
On Monday 4 August 1997 I received a reply from Mr Bone’s office which gave unequivocal
approval to release papers.

About midday, Monday 4 August 1997, I received a telephone call from Dr Walker querying
the delay in supplying his statement to Miss Adlington. I explained why I had delayed and
that I would be replying shortly. I pointed out to him that I had seen press coverage of his
remarks to the effect that he had not been seen by police officers and had not made a
statement. He replied that he could not recall whether or not he had made a statement. I
told him two police officers had witnessed his signature on his statement. He agreed, that
being the case, that his memory may be flawed.

The file, which Constable Greenway gave you, contains;

a)     a photocopy and typed copy of Dr Walker’s statement;

b)     transcripts of evidence to the inquest by JamesWARDROPE (Consultant),
        Professor Alan USHER, Dr David SLATER and Dr Ernest GUMPERT;

c)     statements by Mr WARDROPE.

In view of the eminence of these people (especially Alan USHER)and the shilly-shallying of
Dr Walker, I do not think we need to pursue further medical opinion. If we did, I would feel
obliged to divulge it to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, whatever it might say. Also, I feel that it is
for Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to decide whether he wishes to gather further evidence in
response to what he is told.
Similarly, the preparation of an affidavit by Constable Greenway (regarding Dr Walker’s
statement being available) can be prepared if Lord Justice Stuart-Smith receives evidence
from Dr Walker and asks us to respond.

At the Sheffield inquest, Counsel for the Chief Constable declined to be drawn into the
argument over time of death. The 1993 judicial review of the Coroners’ verdict was
focused on time of death and the High Court ruled that the coroner’s 3.15 pm cut-off time
should stand. For all these reasons, we should wait and see what medical issues we are
asked to comment upon.

I take the same view of aspects of the Hillsborough drama programme. Its maker, Mr
McGOVERN, does not claim that every element of the programme is factually correct.
Therefore, we do not need to “disprove” facets of the programme such as whether or not
ambulances went onto the pitch.

I attach a draft statement which David Maclean MP, Home Office Minister, was to make to
the House of Commons. In the event the Home Secretary, Michael Howard MP, addressed
the House in somewhat different terms. You may find this draft a useful briefing document.

I attach a draft letter which I propose to send to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith.     I would
welcome your advice on it.

I will be on leave from Saturday 8 August 1997 and will be back at work on Friday 27
August 1997. I would be grateful to hear from you before I go on leave.

Yours sincerely




Ian Daines
Assistant Chief Constable

ADJOURNMENT DEBATE : HILLSBOROUGH - DRAFT SPEAKING NOTE FOR mp
MACLEAN                      1                        ------- -



I would like to join with the Hon Member for Liverpool Walton in
expressing my deepest sympathy for the families of those who were
involved in the tragic events at Hillsborough,                I know I speak
for the whole House in saying that our thoughts will remain with
them this Christmas, which I know they must find a particularly
difficult time of the year.


Anybody who saw the news reports that dreadful Saturday - 15th
of April 1989 - will have been overwhelmed by those terrible and
distressing pictures. I know that for the families who suffered
such appalling tragedy their loss was made all the worse by the
fact that they arose out of an event which should have been a
normal family outing.


Factual drama means points can't be challenged.
The   Hon   Member   for   Liverpool     Walton     has   however   drawn    the
attention of the House not so much to the events themselves but
to a programme - a so called factual drama - which was shown
recently on Channel 4. The makers of the programme Hillsborough
have emphasised that they were acting on behalf of the families.
But   1   must   admit   that   I have   a   deep    sense   of   unease    when
programme makers choose to make their points through a dramatic
format,     which plays upon the emotions of viewers rather than
through a documentary which can allow points to be discussed or
challenged.


Programme wrong about the missing video
So the programme makers made a two hour "drama documentary" in
which they claim they raised a number of fresh points. In fact
many of these points had already been considered by Lord Taylor's
inquiry, in particular I understand the programme makers claimed
that evidence had come to light about a so called missing video
tape and that the Coroner had been wrong in considering that
those who died were dead by 3.15.


If the programme makers had used a normal documentary format and
invited       South    Yorkshire       Police    to comment         on    the charges,        I
understand that South Yorkshire Police could have told them that
the    alleged        missing    video    which      is     supposed      to    have      shown
evidence of overcrowding on the terraces is not missing at all.
It    never    has     been.    The    film     is   in    the    possession       of     South
Yorkshire Police and was given both to the Taylor inquiry and to
the inquest.


It is true that a video from a fixed camera, directed not at the
enclosures where the tragedy took place but at the turnstiles,
did indeed disappear on the night of the disaster. I understand
that this particular video was never in the possession of the
police,       The loss of the video was reported as a crime but the
culprit was not detected. This video has never been found and it
is not the video that the programme makers appear to be claiming
as new evidence.


If the programme makers had used a normal documentary style they
would have been forced to show that the matter of the timing of
the deaths and whether the Coroner had made a mistake in taking
a 3.15 cut off point had already been considered by a judicial
review.        The     producers       chose     not       to    give     audiences        that
information.          Instead they called for another public inquiry.                         I
will discuss that call in a moment.


Four investigations already taken place
But    first     I would        like   to remind          the House      that     there    have
already been four independent investigations or reviews of the
 Hillsborough tragedy:


                there was Lord Taylor's inquiry


        •       there was the inquest into each of the 95 deaths


                there     was    the     investigation           into    police    behaviour
                supervised by the PCA


                 finally, there was the judicial review of the inquest.
Each of these a different purpose;                        I think it might be helpful
if I were just to say a little about of each of these inquiries
and their outcome.


Lord Taylor's enquiry
First,    the        formal       inquiry     by   Lord    Justice     Taylor.     This       was
commissioned by then Home Secretary on the second day after the
disaster. It terms of reference were not only to inquire into the
events but also to make recommendations about the needs of crowd
control and safety at sports events,


Over 31 days between the 15th of May and the 29th of June, Lord
Taylor heard oral evidence from 174 witnesses at a public hearing
in   Sheffield.          He       also    received        evidence     in    the     form      of
submissions and letters. The inquiry considered video film from
three separate sources which provided in all some 71 hours of
further evidence.


Lord Taylor published an interim report in August which set out
the causes for the disaster and made immediate recommendations,
he found that there were a number of causes why the disaster took
place. He found that:


      *     the immediate cause of the gross overcrowding was the
            failure to cut of access                       to the central pens which
            were already overfull.


            they        were       already overfull          because    no    safe maximum
            capacities had been laid down, no attempt was made to
            control           entry      to    individual     pens     numerically,           and
                there       was    no    effective    visual     monitoring        of    crowd
            density.


            he found that when the influx from gate C entered pen
                3,    the     layout     of    the   barriers    there       afforded       less
                protection than they should have done and a barrier
                collapsed.


                he    found       that   the   need   to open gate           C was      due    to
          dangerous     congestion       at     the     turnstiles.        That
          congestion occurred because, as both the club and the
          police should have realised, the turnstile area could
          not easily cope with          the large numbers         unless   they
          arrived steadily over a lengthy period. The police had
          failed to draw up plans as to how they would control
          large numbers should they arrive in a short period.
          Unfortunately that event, which Lord Taylor considered
          was forseeable, took place.


          Finally     he found   that    the    presence     of   an    unruly
          minority     who   had   drunk       too    much   aggravated     the
          problem.     So did the Clubs's confused and inadequate
          signs and ticketing.


So we have it: a number of reasons for the disaster; no single
person or organisation to blame. But Lord Taylor clearly put a
significant portion of the blame for the disaster at the door of
the police.


Indeed he was particularly critical of the attitude of South
Yorkshire Police to the disaster. I quote from the report:


     "It is a matter of regret that at the hearing and in their
     submissions,    the South Yorkshire Police were not prepared
     to   concede that       they were in            any respect at faultin what
     occurred.   Mr     Duckenfield, under           pressure     of    cross-
     examination, apologised for blaming the Liverpool fans for
     causing the deaths. But that apart, the police case was to
     blame the fans for being late and drunk and to blame the
     Club for failing to monitor the pens.              It was argued that
     the fatal crush was not caused by the influx through gate
     C but was   due    to barrier      124a being defective.          Such an
     unrealistic approach gives cause for anxiety as to whether
     lessons have been learnt.          It would have been more seemly
     and encouraging for the future if responsibility had been
     faced."
 if needed
[He also considered the reports that had been published in the
press about the behaviour of Liverpool fans. Again I quote from
his report:
        "Before this Inquiry began there were stories reported in
        the press, and said to have emanated from police officers
        present at the match,              of "mass drunkenness".                   It was said
        that    drunken       fans    urinated         on     police       whilst    they    were
        pulling    the dead          and   injured out,             that    others    had    even
        urinated      on    the      bodies       of    the    dead     and    stolen       their
        belongings.        Not    a single        witness       was    called       before    the
        inquiry to support any of those allegations, although every
        opportunity was afforded for any of the represented parties
        to have any witness called whom they wished. As soon as the
        allegations I have mentioned were in made in the press, Mr
        Peter Wright,         Chief Constable of South Yorkshire,                         made a
        dignified statement dissociating himself                            from such grave
        and emotive calumnies.               Those who made them and those who
        disseminated        them     would    have       done    better       to hold       their
        peace."




Members    of     the      House.     This    is       strong       criticism:       it   hardly
suggests that Lord Taylor in any way had the wool pulled before
his eyes.


But I mu.s..t stress that since the report the police have accepted
responsibility for the part they played in the disaster.                                     Most
recently, the present chief constable of South Yorkshire Richard
Wells    said    on the Today            programme       that       the police       saw their
responsibility in three particular areas. He said
               once     the      gates     were    open       the    police     should       have
               foreseen where the fans would go


               he accepted that they might have reduced some of the
               pressure by changing the kick off time.


               he also accepted that officers did not recognise soon
               enough the distinction between disorder and distress.
So, the South Yorkshire Police have accepted that they were at
fault      in    those    respects. They            have   paid    compensation       to    the
families. This is apart from money paid out by the Hillsborough
disaster appeal.


The inquest
The second investigation into events was the inquest conducted
by    Her       Majesty's        Coroner      for    South    Yorkshire.       This   was      a
difficult task partly because of the number of deaths and partly
because the Taylor inquiry was itself in progress. The coroner
conducted         an     inquiry       into    the     deaths     of    each    of    the     95
individuals and sat for a total of 96 days.


I think it is important that I                      remind the House of the purpose
of    an    inquest;        it    is   a   fact      finding      inquiry      conducted      to
establish reliable answers to four important but limited factual
questions. They are:


        •        the identity of the deceased


        •        the place of death


                  the time of death; and finally


                  how the deceased came by his death.
That is all an inquest can consider. Rule 36 of the Coroners'
Rules       1984       requires     that      the    proceedings        and    evidence      are
directed solely at finding the answers to these questions and it
 forbids any expression of opinion on other matters.


 As   members       of    this     House      are    aware,    the     jury   examining      the
 evidence found that the cause of death was accidental death. But
 the findings of an inquest do not bind any person affected by
 them. The inquest conclusion must not be framed in such a way as
 to determine any question of criminal responsibility on the part
 of a named person or any question of civil liability. A finding
 of accidental death does not prevent further proceedings.




                                                                                           PAGE . Osj?
Investigation by West Midland Police


The third investigation into the events was conducted by West
Midland Police supervised by the Police Complaints Authority with
a view to establishing whether the disaster resulted from or was
made worse by criminal activity on the part of any individual.
It   also considered          whether    any officer     should be      subject     to
disciplinary proceedings. The investigation involved the taking
of 5,341    statements as well as a scrutiny of all the material
which had previously been examined. The evidence was sent to the
Director of Public Prosecutions who concluded that the result did
not indicate that any one should be made the subject of criminal
proceedings.         This     meant   that     neither   Chief       Superintendent
Duckenfield,     nor Superintendent Murray not for that matter any
other person has been charged with any crime.


For any other person apart from a police officer that would have
been     the end of         the proceedings.     For a police        officer   there
remained the question of whether they had failed in their d u t y .
The PCA decided that both Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and
Superintendent Murray should face disciplinary charges.                        Police
disciplinary hearings are held in private;                   they are concerned
only with whether an officer may have failed to conform to police
discipline.      A    disciplinary       hearing    does   not   consider       wider
issues.


But, a further point about police disciplinary hearings which is
 often forgotten is that whilst there are a number of punishments
 which    can   be     imposed     for   bad    discipline     the    most   serious
 punishment     a     disciplinary       tribunal    can     impose    is    that   of
 dismissal or of a requirement to resign.


 This is the heaviest punishment which it is possible to award an
 officer for the very worst offence which he could have committed.
 It means that his conduct must have been so bad that it would be
 inappropriate for him to remain an officer.


 In the event Mr Duckenfield retired because of his ill health in
 advance of a disciplinary tribunal's ruling on whether or not he
was guilty.        But by doing so he took on himself what the worst
disciplinary           judgement could have           imposed upon him to do.             He
stopped being a police officer. The disciplinary hearing could
not continue because such hearings can only be held on police
officers.


On   13 January         the Police Complaints Authority               announced         that
disciplinary proceedings against Superintendent Murray would be
withdrawn. When explaining their decision the Authority stated
that    the    retirement        of   the     Chief    Superintendent       on    medical
grounds     meant       that what     in effect was         a joint allegation of
neglect of duty could not be fairly heard in the absence of the
more senior officer. But, some time later, Superintendent Murray
also decided that he did not wish to remain as a police officer.


So that       is    three    separate     examinations         of events    surrounding
Hillsborough;           each    one   with    a   separate      purpose.    The    fourth
examination was the judicial review of the Coroner’s proceedings.



Review of the inquest


Again it might be helpful if I remind the house that neither the
Home Secretary nor the Attorney General has the power to order
a fresh inquest. That can only be done if my rt hon and learned
Friend        makes an application under section 13 of the 1988 Act.
There     is       a    statutory     requirement       that     in order   to     justify
 directing         a    fresh   inquest      there    should    not only    be    specific
 grounds,      such      a   fresh    evidence,       but   circumstances        that    the
 interests of justice require a fresh inquest.


 The High Court has also developed a doctrine of judicial reviews
 so that the vast majority of issues arising from the conduct of
 inquests can be considered by the High Court. Mr Taylor whose son
 Kevin was         so tragically killed put forward an application under
 section 13 of the act ; the main points were:



                   that the coroner wrongly failed to direct the jury as
             to the verdict of lack of care or accidental death due
             to or     "aggravated by      lack of care"        relating         to    the
             negligence of the police which caused the tragedy.


        •   that the coroner wrongly excluded evidence of lack of
             care in the emergency services and police reaction to
             the deceased initial injuries/ wrongly insisted on a
             cut off point of 3.15 pm for the evidence heard at the
             main inquest.
and
        •   wrongly failed to direct the jury on the availability
             of a verdict of accidental death by lack of care or
             lack    of   care   based    on    the   failure     of       the   various
             responsible      agencies     to    provide    the    deceased           with
             adequate medical       attention after         they had sustained
             their original injuries.


It was also asserted in relation to Kevin Williams that there was
evidence to justify the coroner in concluding that he was alive
beyond the 3.15 pm cut off time adopted by the Coroner and that
pressure had been put on two witnesses to retract their evidence
about the signs of life they described in Kevin Williams after
3.15.


My    Hon   and   learned     friend     the    Attorney    General          carefully
considered the evidence and concluded that none of the matters
raised      afforded      a   realistic        likelihood    of        a    successful
application to the High Court.


The applicants proceeded by way of judicial review. In giving the
judgement of the Divisional Court,                Lord Justice McGowan ruled
that none of the procedural or technical points raised justified
the intervention of the Divisional Court. It found that the cut
off point of 3.15 was a reasonable and sustainable point.


As a Minister        it   is clearly not possible for me to know                       the
truth of what happened on that terrible Saturday. None of us here
can. But we can be satisfied that those dreadful events nearly
 seven years ago have been fully investigated and examined. It is
impossible to guarantee that a tragedy will never occur again but
measures have ben taken to ensure that British football stadia
are among the safest in the world.


The hon Member for now calls for a further public inquiry into
these events.          I fully sympathise with those families who feel
that in some way they have not been given the truth about their
loved one's deaths.              Certainly in an appalling tragedy such as
Hillsborough it is perhaps inevitable, though deeply distressing
for    the     families,         that    there        will    be   confusion     about          some
details- After all the investigations and examinations that have
taken to place, could we ever achieve greater certainty about the
events        after    nearly     seven        years?       I believe    we    could       not.    I
believe that Lord Taylor did an excellent job at the time and one
for which        sports      fans       have    reason       to be     grateful. I do            not
believe we could better it now.


what     would        be   the    purpose        of     a    further    inquiry?       I    fully
understand that some families still feel bitter about the way
that events were handled that terrible day; things were done, or
not done, things were said that should not have been said but the
 fact that we know about them proves there has been no cover up.
 Lord Taylor criticised the police; South Yorkshire have accepted
 that they were partly responsible for the consequences and have
 paid compensation.               The DPP considered and rejected                      criminal
 proceedings against any police officer and though disciplinary
 proceedings          were   not    taken:           Superintendent      Duckenfield,             who
 might,       and we must remember this,                    not have been found guilty,
 chose himself to take the strongest measure which he could be
 forced to take and stop being a police officer.


 Positive lessons have been learnt. Lord Taylor made far reaching
 recommendations which have been implemented:
                  All clubs of the Premier League and First Division
                 have      converted       their       stadia to all          seated grounds.
                 Second and Third Divison clubs should have all seater
                 stadia by August 1999.


          ♦      The       Government          has    made     £l39m     available         to     'the
              Football      Trust   to.   fund    Taylor    related   work,    at
              foortball grounds for projects totalling £437m


British stadia are now recognised as being amongst the safest in
the   word.    This   was    commented     on    by   overseas   visitors     and
officials during EURO S 6 .Thankfulkly there have been no major
incidents since Hillsborough. So, we should not forget the very
positive things which have been achieved.


My current belief is that a further public inquiry would serve
no useful purpose.


What if there is fresh evidence? Now a drama documentary is not
in itself evidence. 1 don't often agree with the hon Member for
Blackburn but he too recognised that it was important to examine
the evidence, not the programme.


But what if in making the drama, the researchers have discovered
new information? As I have explained I am not yet convinced that
they have. But if T:hey have, what then? The Chief Constable of
South Yorkshire has already made clear that if there is fresh
evidence he would wish to have it examined. I understand that if
there were fresh evidence he would not wish it to be examined by
police from the South Yorkshire force, who might be considered
to have a vested interest in the outcome, but by officers of a
different force. Furthermore, he would wish this investigation
to be supervised by the independent Police Complaints Authority.
The Police Complaints Authority have themselves indicated their
willingness to undertake this supervision.                 If evidence of any
wrongdoing were uncovered those papers would be passed to the
Director of Public Prosecutions in order to determine whether
charges should be brought against anybody.


But all this is, at present, entirely hypothetical. At present
we have no new evidence. As I have already made clear I am not
convinced that it exists.
                                           Interventions


How is that police officers have been awarded substantial sums
in compensation and the families have not?


The judgement on the management of the claims for police officers
was a matter for the Police Authoroity. I understand that on the
basis of legal advice the police authority settled 14 cases out
of court. There are a further 25 cases outstanding. Five cases
have   been   taken       to court;   of    these,    four were     successful   in
achieving compensation; one was not. The Police Authority have
said that they will appeal against the four successful claims.


The question of compensation for members of the public is one for
the    courts.        I    understand       that     the   courts   have   awarded
compensation only in thoese cases where there is a close familial
tie. I understand that over £12m has been awarded in damages and
costs to members of the public.


If further pressed
This is entirely a matter for the courts.


Background
The fact that police officers have received substantial sums in
compensation when many friends and relatives appear not to have
done   is a matter         of continuing controversy.          South Yoprkshirs
Police Authority received 1,567 claims in respect of the tragedy;
33 are still outstanding. Many claimants have been found not to
be eligible.


Damages and costs to members of the public have totalled £12m;
South Yorkshire Police say that they cannot immediately provide
details of how many claimants have been succesful. The figures
involved suggest that the sums going to relatives will in some
cases nave been smaller than those going to police officers.
Whilst this appears unjust the courts reach their decisions on
 the basis of loss of expected earnings rather than the grief
 suffered by family members.

              Why was an officer from the former West Midlands Serious Crime
              Squad chosen to undertake investigations into the tragedy?


              I        understand    West       Midlands       was    chosen      to   undertake       the
              investigation          of   the    Hillsborough         tragedy     because      it   was   a
              negihbouring          force.   This was      a choice approved by the Police
              Complaints       Authority.         The   head     of    the      investigation       wasthe
              Assistant Chief Constable Mervin Jones now Chief Constable of
              Cheshire; he was reporting to Geoffrey Dear now an HM Inspector.


                  Background
                  A story cmplainin that Detectiuve Superintend Stan Beechy former
                  head of the controversial West Midlands Serious Crime Squad which
                  was disbanded in Auugust 1989 after a PCA investigation.He was
                  said by the report to be the second most senior policeman. Mrs
                  Williams    is    claiming      Mr    Beechy       was   in    charge   of    evidence
                  concerning her son Kevin and should have presented the jury with
                  the evidence      to suggest that an ambulance did not stop which
                  could have saved her son. Mrs Williams also claims that she has
                  a witness who says that Kev^n was alive after 3.15. The Attorney
                  General's    office     explain       that    the medical        evidence     has   been
                  examined and they are convinced that the 3.15 cut off point for
                  time of death was correct.             This was also the conlusion of the
                  judicial review.

Dear Sir

Hillsborough Scrutiny

On 23 July 1997 the Chief Constable, Mr Richard Wells, wrote to you (copy letter attached
for ease of reference). On Page 2, Paragraph 4, he referred to a planned visit to
Hillsborough Stadium. Things were said during that visit which Mr Wells is keen that you
should know of (Mr Wells began a period of leave on 30 July 1997).

Mr Wells and I met Constable GREENWAY and Inspector CALVERT at the stadium.
Constable Greenway fulfils a role as archivist and librarian for our Hillsborough material.
Inspector Calvert worked on a number of football matches before the disaster and was
involved in planning events.

Constable Greenway had prepared an album of photographs, taken at the time of the
disaster, which allowed Mr Wells and I to picture the stadium as it was then. We walked
around the inside and outside of the ground and re-familiarised ourselves with what had
happened.

During this tour, Inspector Calvert said that officers, who had been on duty on the day of
the disaster, were instructed to write their own statements and to include anything that may
have been relevant. Inspector Calvert said that when these statements came back from
typing they had been altered in a manner that some officers had found unacceptable, but
they had nonetheless signed the statements.

Inspector Calvert said that officers were coached in evidence to give to Lord Taylor’s
enquiry but that practice ceased part way through the enquiry when it became apparent
that officers were unable or unwilling to adhere to an unacceptable version of the truth.




                                                                         Direct Line: 0114 2523405
           Tel; 0114 2202020                                             Direct Fax; 0114 2523481
The Chief Constable and I were concerned at the implications of Inspector Calvert’s
comments. We did not question him nor comment lest any such action be misconstrued.
At the conclusion of our visit, Mr Wells and I discussed what we had heard.

Mr Wells said that in the seven years he has been Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, he
has not previously heard such things, nor have I in my 12 months with South Yorkshire.
Nonetheless, we resolved to act upon Inspector Calvert’s comments.

Our store of Hillsborough Disaster material is held in the Discipline and Complaints
Department at Heeley Police office. The acting Head of that Department is Superintendent
Alan FOSTER. Mr Wells and I discussed with Superintendent Foster the action to be
taken. Superintendent Foster said that he had been a member of the team of officers who
had worked on the enquiry that followed the disaster. Part of that team’s role was to liaise
with the officers of West Midlands Police and to facilitate their work. Superintendent Foster
recalled that officers on duty at the disaster were instructed to write their “recollections” and
to put down anything they felt, as well as what they believed to be true. He said that, on
legal advice, the recollections were then converted into statements of evidence. He was
unsure of the source of that advice as he was relying upon his memory of events some
eight years ago.

Superintendent Foster recollected that officers who were to give evidence to Lord Taylor’s
enquiry were prepared in the sense that they were briefed. Lord Taylor’s enquiry was
conducted differently to officers’ experiences of giving evidence in a criminal court. It was
an enquiry not a trial. The nature of giving evidence, and questions on that evidence, were
not as in a criminal case. The event itself was traumatic for many officers in a way that is
rare in criminal trials.

As discussed with Mr Wells and Superintendent Foster, I examined our archive of
Hillsborough Disaster material. The “recollections” of officers are systematically filed there.
Some are handwritten. Some are typed in a manner that suggests to me that the officers
did the typing (spelling mistakes, poor type alignment, etc). All that was written in the
recollections was then typed into the HOLMES computer. HOLMES (Home Office Large
Major Enquiry System) was launched in 1987 and the Hillsborough Disaster was one of the
first major uses of it in South Yorkshire.

The typed recollections have been annotated by indexers, police officers who identifying
salient points to be entered in the HOLMES index. For instance, if Constable 123 SMITH
refers to being on duty in serial 21 under the supervision of Sergeant 456 JONES, the
indexer would highlight “serial 21” and “Sergeant 456 JONES” as cross references. Actions
would be raised to ensure that a statement was obtained from Sergeant 456 Jones and
other officers in serial 21.

Some of the typed recollections show pencil lines through some sentences.                 These
statements are in a box marked “Amended Statements”.

I examined a small number of randomly selected amended statements. One officer’s
statement contained a page of information about the writer’s feelings the following day
(shock, distress etc) and the reactions of his colleagues. That part of his statement was
deleted no doubt because it was not relevant to the causes of the disaster. Another
statement referred to the duties performed by Special Constables on the day of the
disaster. The officer expressed opinions to the effect that Special Constables should be
confined to traffic point duties. That part of his statement was deleted, no doubt because it
was opinion not evidence. One statement has a note attached which says that the officer
declined to delete parts of it.

Also in the archive is a letter dated 7 June 1989 from Mr Mervyn JONES, Assistant Chief
Constable, West Midlands Police, to Mr David BRUMMELL, Treasury Solicitor. Mr
Brummell was one of the team who assisted Lord Taylor in his enquiry. I attach a copy of
Mr Jones’ letter. The opening sentence is pertinent to this matter and I quote it in full;

       “You will recall that in the early stages, because of the slowness of the supply of
       written recollections from South Yorkshire officers, it was agreed that we would take
       from them their initial submissions which would be later superseded by their signed
       final versions, after they had been checked by the appropriate legal advice”.

I attach a copy of Mr Brummell’s reply, also dated 7 June 1989. Mr Brummell recognises
that “expressions of opinion were removed from the first versions”. He also says, “it would
not be appropriate to use the original statement for the purpose of the inquiry when this has
been superseded by a subsequent statement”.

The conclusion I draw from this is that the existence of the “recollections” was known to
Lord Taylor’s team and there was no aspect of suppressing evidence. It is a matter for
your Lordship to decide whether Inspector Calvert has “fresh evidence” to offer but my
opinion is that Inspector Calvert was not conversant with what happened and has
misunderstood a perfectly open and proper procedure.

I hold a similar view of Inspector Calvert’s statement that officers were coached in the
evidence to give. In chapter 18 of his interim report, Lord Taylor comments specifically on
the evidence of police officers (paragraphs 279 and 280). Lord Taylor said, "... / must
report that for the most part the quality of their (police officers) evidence was in inverse
proportion to their rank ... the senior officers in command were defensive and evasive
witnesses ... neither their handling of problems on the day nor their account of it in
evidence showed the qualities of leadership to be expected of their rank.”

As a police officer, it gives me no comfort to say that Lord Taylor clearly found some police
witnesses lacking. He was more than capable of determining the truth of what he heard
and had good lawyers to help him.

I think it naive of Inspector Calvert to confuse briefing with coaching. To even attempt to
manipulate witnesses, about to face such a rigorous process with so much hard evidence
(videos, photographs), would have been foolish as well as criminal.
In the spirit of openness that is the hallmark of Mr Wells’ style, he briefed Her Majesty’s
Inspector of Constabulary, Mr John STEVENS QPM, LLB, MPhil, CIMgt, on these
developments, I am sending this letter to him to bring him up to date,

The Chief Constable is determined that any report which even hints at new evidence
should be put before your Lordship and that such notifications should be made at the
earliest opportunity. For this reason I report these matters to you with only very limited
research. I am confident that additional research would shed further light on Inspector
Calvert’s comments. If you wish me to undertake that research, or to assist your staff in
that work, I will be glad to assist.

Yours faithfully




Ian Daines

                      SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE RECOLLECTIONS

    Thank you for your letter of today's date, which we have already discussed.

    The main difference between the initial and final versions of the South
Yorkshire Police Officers' statements is that any expressions of opinion were
(as I understand it, on the advice of Mr. Woodward) removed from the final
version. As I understand it, Andrew Collins' view is that there is absolutely
no reason for excluding such expressions of opinion when they touch on matters
relevant to the Public Inquiry and that, in the circumstances, there is no
objection in principle to written statements containing such opinions being
submitted to the Inquiry.

    Clearly, in view of the personal undertaking which you have given to the
Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, Andrew Collins agrees that it would not be
appropriate to use the original statement for the purposes of the Inquiry when
this has been superseded by a subsequent statement. However, what I understand
may have happened in the case of the Officer who gave his evidence yesterday is
that the original unamended statement was circulated because of the need to
circulate statements to all parties as iruch in advance of the calling of the
relevant witnesses as possible and because at the time of circulation of the
relevant batch of witness statements the revised, final version of the
statement in question had not yet been received. I understand that m total
there are three cases where this has been necessary: P.C.s Best, Huckstepp and
Illingworth. However, in such cases only the final, revised version of the
statement was given to the press.

    I trust that this problem will not recur in the future.

    I have not copied this letter to the Chief Constable of South Yoikshxre
Police, but am naturally happy for you to do so.

MACLEAN                               '                                -                        —



I would like to join with the Hon Member for Liverpool Walton in
expressing my deepest sympathy for the families of those who were
involved in the tragic events at Hillsborough.                        I    know I speak
for the whole House in saying that our thoughts will remain with
them this Christmas, which I know they must find a particularly
difficult time of the year.


Anybody who saw the news reports that dreadful Saturday - 15th
of April 1989 - will have been overwhelmed by those terrible and
distressing pictures. X know that for the families who suffered
such appalling tragedy their loss was made all the worse by the
fact that they arose out of an event which should have been a
normal family outing.


Factual drama means points can't be challenged.
The   Hon   Member   for    Liverpool    Walton             has   however     drawn           the
attention of the House not so much to the events themselves but
to a programme - a so called factual drama - which was s h o w n
recently on Channel 4. The makers of the programme H i l l s b o r o u g h
have emphasised that they were acting on behalf of the families.
But   i must    admi z   that   I have       a       deep    sense   of    unease        when
programme makers choose to make their points through a dramatic
iOrmat,     which plays upon the emotions of viewers rather than
through a documentary which can allow points to be discussed or
challenged.


Programme wrong about the missing video
So the programme makers made a two hour "drama documentary” in
which they claim they raised a number of fresh points. In fact
many of these points had already been considered by Lord Taylor's
inquiry. In particular I understand the programme makers claimed
that evidence had come to light about a so called missing video
tape and that the Coroner had been wrong in considering that
those who died were dead by 3.15.


If the programme makers had used a normal documentary format and
invited       South    Yorkshire       Police    to comment         on    the   charges,      I
understand that South Yorkshire Police could have told them that
the    alleged        missing    video    which      is     supposed      to    have      shown
evidence of overcrowding on the terraces is not missing at all.
It    never    has     been.    The    film     is   in    the    possession       of     South
Yorkshire Police and was given both to the Taylor inquiry and to
the inquest.


It is true that a video from a fixed camera, directed not at the
enclosures where the tragedy took place but at the turnstiles,
did indeed disappear on the night of the disaster. I understand
that this particular video was never in the possession of the
police.       The loss of the video was reported as a crime but the
culprit was not detected. This video has never been found and it
is not the video that the programme makers appear to be claiming
as new evidence.


If the programme makers had used a normal documentary style they
would have been forced to show that the matter of the timing of
the deaths and whether the Coroner had made a mistake in taking
a 3.15 cut off point had already been considered by a judicial
review.        The     producers       chose     not       to    give     audiences        that
information.          Instead they called for another public inquiry.                         I
will discuss that call in a moment.


Four investigations already taken place
But    first     I would        like   to remind          the House      that     there    have
 already been four independent investigations or reviews of the
 Hillsborough tragedy:


                there was Lord Taylor’s inquiry


        *       there was the inquest into each of the 95 deaths


                there     was    the     investigation           into    police    behaviour
                supervised by the PCA


                 finally, there was the judicial review of the inquest.
Each of these a different purpose;                       I think it might be helpful
if I were just to say a little about of each of these inquiries
and their outcome.


Lord Taylor's enquiry
First,   the        formal       inquiry     by   Lord    Justice     Taylor.    This       was
commissioned by then Home Secretary on the second day after the
disaster. It terms of reference were not only to inquire into the
events but also to make recommendations about the needs of crowd
control and safety at sports events.


Over 31 days between the 15th of May and the 29th of June, Lord
Taylor heard oral evidence from 174 witnesses at a public hearing
in   Sheffield.         He       also    received        evidence     in   the     form      of
submissions and letters. The inquiry considered video film from
three separate sources which provided in all some 71 hours of
further evidence.


Lord Taylor published an interim report in August which set out
the causes for the disaster and made immediate recommendations,
he found that there were a number of causes why the disaster took
place. He found that:


           the immediate cause of the gross overcrowding was the
               failure       to cut of access             to the central pens which
           were already overfull.


           they were              already overfull          because    no safe     maximum
           capacities had been laid down, no attempt was made to
           control           entry      to    individual     pens     numerically,          and
               there       was    no    effective    visual     monitoring       of    crowd
           density.


           he found that when the influx from gate C entered pen
               3,    the     layout     of    the   barriers    there      afforded       less
               protection than they should have done and a barrier
               collapsed.


               he    found       that   the   need   to open gate          C was      due    to
          dangerous         congestion     at     the     turnstiles.      That
          congestion occurred because, as both the club and the
          police should have realised, the turnstile area could
          not easily cope with           the     large numbers unless      they
          arrived steadily over a lengthy period. The police had
          failed to draw up plans as to how they would control
          large numbers should they arrive in a short period.
          Unfortunately that event, which Lord Taylor considered
          was forseeable,        took place.


          Finally      he    found    that the    presence    of   an    unruly
          minority      who     had    drunktoo    much    aggravated       the
          problem.     So did the Clubs's confused and inadequate
          signs and ticketing.


So we have it: a number of reasons for the disaster; no single
person or organisation to blame. But Lord Taylor clearly put a
significant portion of the blame for the disaster at the door of
the police.


Indeed he was    particularly critical of the attitude of South
Yorkshire Police to the        disaster. I quote from the report:


     ''It is a matter of       regret that at the hearing and in their
     submissions,    the South Yorkshire Police were not prepared
     to   concede that          they were in        any respect at fault in what
     occurred.    Mr        Duckenfield, under      pressure       of    cross-
     examination, apologised for blaming the Liverpool fans for
     causing the deaths, But that apart, the police case was to
     blame the fans for being late and drunk and to blame the
     Club for failing to monitor the pens.                It was argued that
     the fatal crush was not caused by the influx through gate
     C but was due          to barrier   124a being defective.          Such an
     unrealistic approach gives cause for anxiety as to whether
     lessons have been learnt.           It would have been more seemly
     and encouraging for the future if responsibility had been
     faced."
 if needed
[He also considered the reports that had been published in the
press about the behaviour of Liverpool fans. Again I quote from
his report:
        "Before this Inquiry began there were stories reported in
        the press, and said to have emanated from police officers
        present at the match,              of "mass drunkenness".                It was said
        that    drunken       fans    urinated         on     police    whilst    they    were
        pulling    the dead          and   injured       out,       that others    had    even
        urinated      on      the    bodies       of    the    dead     and    stolen    their
        belongings.        Not      a single      witness       was    called    before    the
        inquiry to support any of those allegations, although every
        opportunity was afforded for any of the represented parties
        to have any witness called whom they wished. As soon as the
        allegations I have mentioned were in made in the press, Mr
        Peter Wright,         Chief Constable of South Yorkshire,                       made a
        dignified statement dissociating himself                          from such grave
        and emotive calumnies.               Those who made them and those who
        disseminated          them would       have      done    better       to hold    their
        peace."




Members    of     the      House.     This    is       strong       criticism:    it    hardly
suggests that Lord Taylor in any way had the wool pulled before
his eyes.


Sut_._I mu,s,t stress that since the report the police have accepted
responsibility for the part they slaved in the disaster.                                  Most
recently, the present chief constable of South Yorkshire Richard
Wells    said on        the Today      programme         that       the police    saw their
responsibility in three particular areas. He said
               once     the    gates       were    open       the    police     should    have
               foreseen where the fans would go


               he accepted that they might have reduced some of the
               pressure by changing the kick off time.


               he also accepted that officers did not recognise soon
               enough the distinction between disorder and distress.
So;   the South Yorkshire Police have accepted that they were at
fault      in    those    respects.         They     have   paid      compensation     to    the
families. This is apart from money paid out by the Hillsborough
disaster appeal.


The inquest
The second investigation into events was the inquest conducted
by    Her       Majesty's        Coroner       for    South    Yorkshire.       This    was    a
difficult task partly because of the number of deaths and partly
because the Taylor inquiry was itself in progress. The coroner
conducted         an     inquiry        into    the     deaths     of    each    of    the    95
individuals and sat for a total of 96 days.


I think it is important that I remind the House of the purpose
of    an     inquest;       it    is    a     fact    finding      inquiry      conducted     to
establish reliable answers to four important but limited factual
questions. They are:


         ♦       the identity of the deceased


         •       the place of death


                  the time of death; and finally


                  how the deceased came by his death.
 That is all an inquest can consider. Rule 36 of the Coroners'
 Rules       1984      requires        that    the    proceedings        and    evidence      are
 directed solely at finding the answers to these questions and it
 forbids any expression of opinion on other matters.


 As   members       of    this     House       are    aware,    the     jury   examining      the
 evidence found that the cause of death was accidental death. But
 the findings of an inquest do not bind any person affected by
 them. The inquest conclusion must not be framed in such a way as
 to determine any question of criminal responsibility on the part
 of a named person or any question of civil liability. A finding
 of accidental death does not prevent further proceedings.
Investigation by West Midland Police


The third investigation ’into the events was conducted by West
Midland Police supervised by the Police Complaints Authority with
a view to establishing whether the disaster resulted from or was
made worse by criminal activity on the part of any individual.
It   also considered           whether    any officer      should be      subject     to
disciplinary proceedings. The investigation involved the taking
of 5,341       statements as well as a scrutiny of all the material
which had previously been examined. The evidence was sent to the
Director of Public Prosecutions who concluded that the result did
not indicate that any one should be made the subject of criminal
proceedings.          This     meant     that    neither     Chief     Superintendent
Duckenfield,      nor Superintendent Murray not for that matter any
other person has been charged with any crime.


For any other person apart from a police officer that would have
been     the   end of        the proceedings.      For a police        officer    there
remained the question of whether they had failed in their duty.
The PCA decided that both Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and
Superintendent Murray should face disciplinary charges.                          Police
disciplinary hearings are held in private;                      they are concerned
only with whether an officer may have failed to conform to police
discipline.       A    disciplinary        hearing    does     not   consider     wider
 issues.


But, a further point about police disciplinary hearings which is
 often forgotten is that whilst there are a number of punishments
 which    can    be     imposed     for    bad    discipline     the    most    serious
 punishment       a    disciplinary        tribunal    can     impose    is    that   of
 dismissal or of a requirement to resign.


 This is the heaviest punishment which it is possible to award an
 officer for the very worst offence which he could have committed.
 It means that his conduct must have been so bad that it would be
 inappropriate for him to remain an officer.


 In the event Mr Duckenfield retired because of his ill health in
 advance of a disciplinary tribunal's ruling on whether or not he
was guilty.          But by doing so he took on himself what the worst
disciplinary          judgement could have             imposed upon him to do.            He
stopped being a police officer. The disciplinary hearing could
not continue because such hearings can only be held on police
officers.


On   13 January         the Police      Complaints Authority           announced         that
disciplinary proceedings against Superintendent Murray would be
withdrawn. When explaining their decision the Authority stated
that     the    retirement       of    the    Chief     Superintendent       on    medical
grounds     meant      that what       in effect was           a joint allegation of
neglect of duty could not be fairly heard in the absence of the
more senior officer. But, some time later, Superintendent Murray
also decided that he did not wish to remain as a police officer.


So that        is three       separate examinations of events                surrounding
Hillsborough;          each    one    with     a     separate   purpose.     The    fourth
examination was the judicial review of the Coroner’s proceedings.



Review of the inquest


Again it might be helpful if I remind the house that neither the
Home Secretary nor the Attorney General has the power to order
 a fresh inquest. That can only be done if my rt hon and learned
 Friend        makes an application under section 13 of the 1988 Act.
 There    is     a    statutory       requirement       that    in   order   to    justify
 directing       a    fresh    inquest:      -here    should    not only     be specific
 grounds,       such    a     fresh   evidence,        but   circumstances        that    the
 interests of justice require a fresh inquest.


 The High Court has also developed a doctrine of judicial reviews
 so that the vast majority of issues arising from the conduct of
 inquests can be considered by the High Court. Mr Taylor whose son
 Kevin was so tragically killed put forward an application under
 section 13 of the act ; the main points were:



                 that the coroner wrongly failed to direct the jury as
             to the verdict of lack of care or accidental death due
             to or     "aggravated by        lack of care" relating              to the
             negligence of the police which caused the tragedy.


        •    that the coroner wrongly excluded evidence of lack of
             care in the emergency services and police reaction to
             the deceased initial injuries, wrongly insisted on a
             cut off point of 3.15 pm for the evidence heard at the
             main inquest.
and
             wrongly failed to direct the jury on the availability
             of a verdict of accidental death by lack of care or
             lack    of   care    based     on    the   failure   of       the   various
             responsible         agencies    to    provide the     deceased         with
             adequate medical attention after                they had sustained
             their original injuries.


It was also asserted in relation to Kevin Williams that there was
evidence to justify the coroner in concluding that he was alive
beyond the 3.15 pm cut off time adopted by the Coroner and that
pressure had been put on two witnesses to retract their evidence
about the signs of life they described in Kevin Williams after
3.15.


My      Hon and   learned        friend   the     Attorney General           carefully
considered the evidence and concluded that none of the matters
raised      afforded      a   realistic          likelihood of         a    successful
application to the High Court.


The applicants proceeded by way of judicial review. In giving the
judgement of the Divisional Court,                 Lord Justice McCowan ruled
that none of the procedural or technical points raised justified
the intervention of the Divisional Court. It found that the cut
off point of 3-15 was a reasonable and sustainable point.


As a Minister        it is clearly not possible             for me to know the
truth of what happened on that terrible Saturday. None of us here
can. But we can be satisfied that those dreadful events nearly
seven years ago have been fully investigated and examined. It is
impossible to guarantee that a tragedy will never occur again but
measures have ben taken to ensure that British football stadia
are among the safest in the world.


The hon Member for now calls for a further public inquiry into
these events.          I fully sympathise with those families who feel
that in some way they have not been given the truth about their
loved one's deaths.              Certainly in an appalling tragedy such as
Hillsborough it is perhaps inevitable, though deeply distressing
for     the    families,         that    there        will    be   confusion   about            some
details. After all the investigations and examinations that have
taken to place, could we ever achieve greater certainty about the
events        after    nearly     seven        years?       I believe   we   could         not.    I
believe that Lord Taylor did an excellent job at the time and one
for     which    sports      fans       have    reason       to be grateful.       1       do    not
believe we could better it now.


what     would        be   the    purpose        of     a    further    inquiry?       I    fully
understand that some families still feel bitter about the way
 that events were handled that terrible day; things were done, or
not done, things were said that should not have been said but the
 fact that we know about them proves there has been no cover up.
 Lord Taylor criticised the police; South Yorkshire have accepted
 that they were partly responsible for the consequences and have
 paid    compensation.            The DP? considered and rejected                      criminal
 proceedings against any police officer and though disciplinary
 proceedings          were   not    taken:           Superintendent      Duckenfield,             who
 might,       and we must remember this,                    not have been found guilty,
 chose himself to take the strongest measure which he could be
 forced       to take and stop being a police officer.


 Positive lessons have been learnt. Lord Taylor made far reaching
 recommendations which have been implemented:
                  All clubs of the Premier League and First Division
                 have      converted       their       stadia to all      seated grounds.
                 Second and Third Divison clubs should have all seater
                 stadia by August 1999.


                 The       Government          has    made     £139m    available          to     the
              Football      Trust   to    fund    Taylor    related   work    at
              foortball grounds for projects totalling £437m


British stadia are now recognised as being amongst the safest in
the   word.    This   was     commented    on    by   overseas   visitors    and
officials during EURO 5 6 .Thankfulkly there have been no major
incidents since Hillsborough. So, we should not forget the very
positive things which have been achieved.


My current belief is that a further public inquiry would serve
no useful purpose.


What if there is fresh evidence? Now a drama documentary is not
in itself evidence. I d o n ’t often agree with the hon Member for
Blackburn but he too recognised that it was important to examine
the evidence, not the programme.


But what if in making the drama, the researchers have discovered
new information? As 1 have explained I am not yet convinced that
they have. But if they have, what then? The Chief Constable of
South Yorkshire has already made clear that if there is fresh
evidence he would wish to have it examined. I understand that if
there were fresh evidence he would not wish it to be examined by
police from the South Yorkshire force, who might be considered
to have a vested interest in the outcome, but by officers of a
different force. Furthermore, he would wish this investigation
to be supervised by the independent Police Complaints Authority.
The Police Complaints Authority have themselves indicated their
willingness     to undertake chis supervision.             If evidence of any
wrongdoing were uncovered those papers would be passed to the
Director of Public Prosecutions in order to determine whether
charges should be brought against anybody.


But all this is, at present, entirely hypothetical. At present
we have no new evidence. As I have already made clear I am not
convinced that it exists.
                                           Interventions


How is that police officers have been awarded substantial sums
in compensation and the families have not?


The judgement on the management of the claims for police officers
was a matter for the Police Authoroity. I understand that on the
basis of legal advice the police authority settled 14 cases out
of court. There are a further 25 cases outstanding. Five cases
have   been   taken       to court;   of    these,    four were     successful   in
achieving compensation: one was not. The Police Authority have
said that they will appeal against the four successful claims.


The question of compensation for members of the public is one for
the    courts.        I    understand       that     the   courts   have   awarded
compensation only in thoese cases where there is a close familial
tie. I understand that over £12m has been awarded in damages and
costs to members of the public.


If further pressed
This is entirely a matter for the courts.


Background
The fact that police officers have received substantial sums in
compensation when many friends and relatives appear not to have
done     is a matter       of continuing controversy.          South Yoprkshire
Police Authority received 1,567 claims in respect of the tragedy;
33 are still outstanding. Many claimants have been found not to
be eligible.


Damages and costs to members of the public have totalled £12m;
South Yorkshire Police say that they cannot immediately provide
details of how many claimants have been succesful. The figures
 involved suggest that the sums going to relatives will in some
 cases    nave been smaller than those going to police officers.
 Whilst this appears unjust the courts reach their decisions on
 the basis of loss of expected earnings rather than the grief
 suffered by family members.
Why was an officer from the former West Midlands Serious Crime
Squad chosen to undertake investigations into the tragedy?


I     understand    West       Midlands      was    chosen      to   undertake       the
investigation       of   the    Hillsborough        tragedy     because      it   was   a
negihbouring       force.   This was a choice approved by the Police
Complaints     Authority. The         head     of    the      investigation       wasthe
Assistant Chief Constable Mervin Jones now Chief Constable of
Cheshire; he was reporting to Geoffrey Dear now an HM Inspector.


Background
A story cmplainin that Detectiuve Superintend Stan Beechy former
head of the controversial West Midlands Serious Crime Squad which
was disbanded in Auugust 1989 after a PCA investigation.He was
said by the report to be the second most senior policeman. Mrs
williams     is    claiming      Mr   Beechy       was   in    charge   of    evidence
concerning her son Kevin and should have presented the jury with
 the evidence to suggest that an ambulance did not stop which
 could have saved her son. Mrs Williams also claims that she has
    a witness who says that Kev^n was alive after 3,15. The Attorney
    General’s office     ex p lain    that    the medical        evidence     has   been
    examined and they are convinced that the 3.15 cut off point for
    time of death was correct.         This was also the conlusion of the
    judicial review.

  We have now received the video of the drama/documentary and both Ailsa and I have
  watched it. We have also completed our reading of the Taylor Reports and the information
  is beginning to assemble itself in our brains in something approaching the correct context
  and emphasis.

  The points that struck us from the video of the drama/documentary were really as follows

   1.                  We missed the reference to the unidentified doctor but, as has been pointed out to
                       us, there is a clear statement from the anaesthetist Dr Edward Walker which of
                       course had been taken shortly after the disaster and which was available to Lord
                       Justice Taylor. Presumably Dr Walker can be reminded of this. Also we can
                       presumably prove, for example by way of affidavit (perhaps of PC Greenway), that
                       the statement made by Dr Walker was made available to the Inquiry, the Inquest and
                       the D.P.P. at the time of the original investigation.

  2.                 There was reference in the documentary to the fact that ambulances and medical
                     teams were not allowed through to tbe pitch more or less as an operational police
                      decision. That is not the way that the Taylor Report read. I rather gained the
                     impression there that the first few ambulances to arrive did not go onto the pitch
                     because of the difficulty of gaining access to it although eventually a St John’s
                      ambulance did. I did not appreciate that there was an operational decision not to
                     admit ambulances to the pitch. Could you please confirm whether this was in fact
                     the case.

   3.                It is clear from the medical statements and in particular those of Dr Wardrope, who
                      of course had an overview of the whole emergency, that medical teams were not

       dispatched to the stadium until well into the emergency and that was because of lack
       of resources at the casualty units. There is also evidence, though, that emergency
       resuscitation activity was going on at the stadium and in the gymnasium. There were
       presumably doctors and first aiders present including ambulance crews who had gone,
       on foot, into the stadium. Presumably there are extensive statements to explain this
       better. I think it will become relevant to re-examine the amount of trained medical
       and first aid help that there was available inside the stadium.

4.     The drama/documentary was pure drama throughout the entire inquest sequences.
       However if that drama is to be believed, evidence was being given that there were
       still compacted people on the terraces at between 3.20pm. and 3.25pm. That may
       be contained in existing evidence If that is the case, it may result in a request for
       further expert opinion in relation to the cause of death in respect of people either
       unconscious or semi-conscious and in a compacted state post 3.15pm.

5.     The above could have a bearing on the police and other emergency services’ conduct
       of the disaster.


The other issue of course relates to the video evidence. From the drama/documentary there
were sections which were clearly acted and others which were taken from a number of
different sources. There were what looked like one or two shots which could have come
from police/Hillsborough CCTV but I am at the moment substantially unversed in this area.

We do however need to "nail" the whole question of whether there is any new footage of
any kind. Despite what was said in the drama/documentary I of course understand that the
missing videos have nothing to do with the actual disaster and were fixed cameras looking
at particular turnstiles (in one case obscured by a wall). The target we were trying to
achieve with PC Greenway was to identify the bits of footage which were used in the
drama/documentary and to demonstrate that they were all drawn from material which had
been supplied by the police to Yorkshire Television and to confirm and explain that the
missing videos had nothing whatever to do with the disaster itself.

The final stage in all this is the method and way which we propose to adopt for informing
Lord Justice Stuart-Smith of the absence of any new evidence and/or the submission of any
new expert evidence in the grey "causative" a*ca which we have identified. The terms of
reference of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith make it clear that he is to decide:-

(a)   Whether there is indeed any new evidence; and

(b)   Whether that new evidence is sufficient to justify a new inquiry. His terms of
      reference also provide for him to draw to the attention of both the D.P.P. and the
      Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police "any evidence not previously considered
      by them which may be relevant to their respective duties".

We will need to consider further, both with you and at some stage through making
                                           -3 -

representations to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, how exactly he will interpret these terms of
reference. If we can show conclusively that the "new" video evidence was made available
to the Inquiry, the D.P.P. and the police for disciplinary purposes and that a statement was
taken from Dr Walker which again was made available then on a very simple view of the
matter there is no new evidence. However Lord Justice Stuart-Smith may consider that the
evidence of people breathing after 3.15pm. constitutes evidence which ought to be brought
to the attention of the D.P.P. and the police at this stage because it is evidence to which
nobody gave proper consideration at the time. Since this is very likely to be the case we
will need to verse ourselves much better with all the medical evidence and it is likely we
will also need further expert medical opinions.

Yours sincerely

I am most grateful to you, Mr Daines and PC Greenway for the extremely focused and
succinct introductory meeting which took place yesterday. We emerged from it with a
reasonably clear idea of the way forward at this stage although of course events that we are
not yet aware of and factors which have not yet been taken into account will inevitably
change the present plans and the present horizon.

It seems that the present Scrutiny has been brought about by pressure from bereaved
relatives and others who allege that hitherto unseen video recordings have been unearthed
and that there is new evidence to suggest that victims were dying after 3.15 pm. from causes
which were either new or continuing after that time - on the 15th April 1989.

It seems that the concern over the video evidence is a sort of hysterical linking of the
knowledge that there were two video tapes which were lost or went missing on the night of
the 15th/16th April and these related to specific fixed video cameras covering specific
turnstiles. The drama/documentary produced in December last year used video footage
which Yorkshire Television had "discovered" in their archives. There is a popular belief,
and it seems to be one of the factors which has led to the current Scrutiny, that the video
material produced by Yorkshire Television was drawn, in part at least, from the two video
cassettes which went missing shortly after the disaster.

As you explained so ably yesterday, nothing could be further from the truth. The videos
of the turnstiles have still not been found and the other videos, allegedly "discovered", had
in fact been made available at the time of Lord Justice Taylor’s Inquiry but were of poor
quality and may not have been given a lot of attention.

The other element of the "new evidence" is more in the nature of medical expert opinion
than actual new evidence. It also seems to be sparked by the drama/documentary and it has
caused deep concern from Dr Edward Walker who was the anaesthetist who went to the
Northern General Hospital at Sheffield when he learnt about the disaster and coped, first
hand, with several resuscitations in the initial wave.

With proper investigation and possibly with the assistance of further expert medical opinion,
it should be perfectly possible to show that there are no inconsistencies between what the
Coroner found, the basic factual information that Lord Justice Taylor was working on and
what Dr Walker now recollects in the light of the drama/documentary. This may however
be a slightly more grey area partly because death by asphyxiation is probably not an exact
science and partly because there are other contributory factors in each victim’s case.
Nevertheless the causative background must be very similar and the only area for further
investigation, if it be due, will be the extended period from 3.15 pm. onwards when the
terraces were still being cleared and/or treatment and resuscitation was being given as best
they could. To that extent medical evidence of the scene at the time will be significant.
Even so the causative effects may be difficult to distinguish post 3.15 pm. compared to pre
3.15 pm.

The way in which we intend to tackle this is to apply appropriate resources with appropriate
experience to the case but not to treat it as a cause celebre and either do more or react
further than is actually necessary. Both I and Ailsa Lawrence have experience of this type
of tribunal but certainly not of any disaster of this scale. The most recent case we have been
dealing with, as I believe Chris Porteous has explained to you, is an Inquiry involving the
Essex Police where one prisoner killed another whilst on remand at Chelmsford Jail, having
been held in custody for a few days by Essex Police. The role and duties of the police and
the sometimes differing considerations between Essex Police as an entity and the individual
officers in it come into relief in such cases. We are familiar with the law and practice and
procedure of such tribunals although we would highlight the fact that the subject matter of
these instructions has been called a Scrutiny and as such its status is somewhat unclear.

It will be for Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to say how he thinks the Scrutiny should proceed
but we hope and believe the intention is reasonably clear to identify whether or not there is
genuinely any new evidence and the bearing any such evidence would have upon the
findings of the Taylor Inquiry, the criminal investigation and the PCA investigation. If there
is new evidence it will of course have to be fully disclosed and it was absolutely apparent
to us that that of course is the intention and desire of South Yorkshire Police. The other
outcome of this Scrutiny may well be to bring the public inquiry aspect of this disaster to
a conclusion or at least to an end. As Mr Daines pointed out in his opening remarks, it may
have some bearing on the findings of the Inquest in which case the likelihood of a full
blown inquiry would greatly increase.

The terms of reference of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s appointment are -

       "To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at Hillsborough
       Stadium on 15th April 1989 which was not available:-

               (a)    to the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or

               (b)    to the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the
                      purpose of discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or
                                            -3 -

              (c)     to the Chief Officer of South Yorkshire Police in relation to police
                      disciplinary matters.

       And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
       such significance as to justify the establishment by the Secretary of State for the
       Home Department of a further public inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw
       to their attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be
       relevant to their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action
       which should be taken in the public interest."


We therefore decided to proceed as quickly as reasonably possible:-

1.     to view the drama/documentary which has sparked off this renewed concern and has
       given the impression that there is new evidence;

2.     to identify what video evidence was made available to Yorkshire Television and if
       possible to identify the evidence relied on for the drama/documentary and to prove
       beyond all doubt that it was not new video evidence and had been made available to
       Lord Justice Taylor;

3.     to prove and confirm that the video footage in respect of the so-called "new"
       evidence is in no way associated with the two lost video tapes;

4.     to review the existing factual and medical evidence about the time of death and the
       findings of the Inquest in that respect with a view to identifying whether further
       expert medical opinion would be appropriate on that subject and the incidence it
       would have on the findings of the Inquest and the other findings of fact relating to
       the disaster and its management immediately before and after 3.15 pm. on the day;

5.     to request from Lord Justice Stuart-Smith the guidelines and procedures he proposes
       to set up for the carrying out of the Scrutiny;

6.     to advise and consider on the involvement of the other agencies, individuals and
       authorities involved in the disaster, its immediate aftermath and its management
       having regard to any findings of fact or revised expert opinion in the light of the
       above factors;

7.     to advise you throughout with regard to the interests of the police authority and any
       conflict which may arise or divergence between those interests and the interests of
       individuals or other agencies as mentioned above;

8.     to have regard to any conflicts of interests which might exist or might become
       apparent between the advice being given by other solicitors in relation to civil actions
       or claims for compensation arising either in connection with the proceedings now
       being taken to the House of Lords, any new proceedings which are not statute barred
       and any claims for compensation in relation to serving officers which are in process;
       to advise you of any conflicts and the appropriate steps to be taken to perform your
       duties and obligations as a police authority in the light of the Scrutiny, any
       subsequent inquiry and such civil litigation and associated matters as you have
       informed us of;

9.     to liaise with you and keep you informed of developments and likely consequences
       in which case for general purposes of course our client is South Yorkshire Police and
       we are ultimately answerable to the Chief Constable. For immediate purposes
       however we would regard our day to day client as you, the force solicitor. If there
       are matters of policy that we wish to be informed of or alert you to or in respect of
       which we have questions to ask we would refer the matter to the Assistant Chief
       Constable, Mr Ian Daines and for daily fact gathering purposes and for access to the
       archive of material we would refer directly to PC Greenway.

I must point out that the parameters of these instructions cannot be regarded as exhaustive
and facts, directions from Lord Justice Stuart-Smith and other developments may alter these
considerations. However the above sets out the intention and the starting point of the
working method and objectives. Perhaps, although not so specific, the overall objectives
which so clearly emerged from our discussion were that if there was any new material it
should of course be disclosed immediately and that South Yorkshire Police would continue
with their policy of the fullest possible co-operation to the public and the Scrutiny in
general. However in view of the Scrutiny itself immediate steps have been taken to make
the archive of material secure and, as was evident from our visit, it is currently under a 24
hour police guard. During the review of the evidence for the purposes of reporting to Lord
Justice Stuart-Smith I believe you may temporarily suspend your policy of providing copies
of any documents or other matters referred to which are in the archive and this I think
would be a prudent move otherwise it might appear that new information is being
disseminated at a point of increased and renewed public interest. In fact everything which
is within the archive was made available to Lord Justice Taylor and it would not be in the
interests of the Scrutiny for any impression to the contrary to be given.

I am also taking this opportunity of enclosing my firm’s standard terms and conditions of
engagement. As I am at the moment the Managing and Senior Partner, in the event of a
complaint or of a serious lack of satisfaction other than the day to day management of any
team operating under me that matter should be referred to the Partnership Chairman, Paul
Morris who of course is a fellow partner of mine. In the event of any difficultly or review
of the conduct of the case falling short of a complaint then the matter should be referred to
me.

I am enclosing a diagram showing the organisational structure of the firm. We are in fact
a client-led firm. That means that our departments are divided up by client or client type
rather than work type. Similar skills exist in various departments but the underlying
objective is that each major client or client type should receive a one-stop service in the
department in question. For special cases we can marshal cross-department teams. In the
event of a public inquiry the team would be based on the element responding to you now,
CGS-Commercial and Tax, where you already have one of the assistant solicitors, Ailsa and
we would probably draw on CGS Litigation and also our Parliamentary Department (they
are always doing public inquiries).

The circumstances of this case are such that it could require enormous commitment and it
might demand very significant legal resources if it goes to a public inquiry. For the
purposes of the Scrutiny however I think that I myself and Ailsa Lawrence with suitable
support and backup are sufficient to cope with it with all the co-operation that I know we
will have from yourselves. In the event of more help being necessary then, as the matter
is reviewed and as the liaison and instruction process takes place, you will be made aware
of that and the team will be enlarged if that is necessary. I start however from the premise
that such resources as are necessary to deliver the professional result which is agreed will
be provided and, within the boundaries of reasonableness, no more and no less resources will
be put into this case than is necessary to achieve that proper professional result.

So far as the involvement of counsel is concerned we do not think it is necessary at this
stage and in particular not before some form of representation is needed with Lord Justice
Stuart-Smith in connection with the terms of reference and conduct of the Scrutiny. We did
however suggest that it would be sensible to identify a suitable counsel and possibly even
retain counsel to be certain that the person of the right calibre and knowledge was already
retained on behalf of South Yorkshire Police. We put forward the name of Jeremy
Gompertz QC in that respect.

Finally we touched on the question of charging rates. Having due regard to all the
circumstances I would suggest that a flat charging rate of       per hour be applied whether
the work is done by a partner or Ailsa Lawrence who is an experienced and senior solicitor.
We quote this figure because it is an "out of London" rate and is aimed at being competitive
with the sort of price that we believe you should oe paying for the right level of advice from
a local firm. The figure is put forward for agreement and is not regarded as immutable.
Equally it is put forward as a serious figure and is not simply meant to be a bargaining
factor.

At the moment we are learning about the case and the facts of the whole matter. However
we think it should be possible to advise you in the initial stages on the above basis without
ourselves carrying out a massive review of all the evidence. That is in accordance with our
policy of using resources sensibly and in conformity with agreed objectives to thorough
professional standards.

I submit this letter to you therefore as the basis for formally entering into a professional
relationship as described.

Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Owston

New Hillsborough Enquiry

I was pleased to meet you in London on 3 July 1997.

On the basis and in the expectation that we will be able to settle an appropriate fee rateSouth
Yorkshire Police propose to retain the services of Winckworth & Pemberton. These instructions
extend to your firm representing the Chief Constable and senior officers of South Yorkshire Police
Force and the Police Authority in connection with the forthcoming scrutiny of possible new evidence,
which will be conducted by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith.

The Chief Constable's representative who will be in charge of an internal team                   of officers in
connection with the scrutiny will be the Assistant Chief Constable, Mr Ian Daines.

We would be pleased to meet you and your colleagues here at Police Headquarters, in order to
discuss the situation. We would then be very pleased to show you the archives held by South
Yorkshire Police arising from the Hillsborough Disaster.

I would be grateful if you would arrange for your secretary to contact Mr Daines' secretary,
          1 on 0114 252 3405, in order to arrange the meeting.

Yours sincerely

Dear Miss Adlington

Phillips Report

You recently asked for a copy of the Phillips report. I have sought legal advice on this
subject. I am advised that the report is not relevant to any current civil action against the
Chief Constable. That being the case, I am now pleased to be able to release it to you.

I have asked Constable Ken Greenway to produce a copy. You will appreciate that the
volume of requests for material, and the scale of some of those requests, mean that it may
take some days before you receive the material.

Yours sincerely

Dear Ms Adlington

I am in receipt of your lettter of the 12 August, and perhaps I can go some way to resolving
your confusion.

The policy in relation to unpublished statements has been in existence since 13 June 1991.
There is no wish to hide behind any issue, but our legal advice is that we should not publish
these matters without the consent of those people that made them. We are actively
seeking that authority.

The second point relates to the statements of Miss Moffat and Dr Bull. These statements
were tended in evidence at the Coroners Inquest and therefore published. The fact that
neither were called as witnesses is immaterial.     They are public documents and we
pleased to released them to you.

Finally, we will do everything we can to corporate fully with the Independent Scrutiny. Our
approach has been discussed with Mr Richard Bone at the Home Office, who is assisting
Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, and he has expressed no concern over the policy.

I hope this letter will go some way to clarify issues for you.

Yours sincerely

SUBJECT:              HILLSBOROUGH - THE PHILLIPS REPORT




I refer to the telephone conversation on Monday. A request has been made by the solicitor to the
"families support group" for a copy of this report.

I understand that the Phillips Report was commissioned at the request of Mr Peter Wright. Mr
Phillips was the secretary of the Football Hooliganism Committee. I understand that it contains
professional expert opinion instead of or perhaps rather more than it summarises matters of fact.
It was envisaged that the report might be used in connection with civil proceedings.

Whether a document of this kind is to be accorded legal professional privilege depends upon the
character of the document and the purposes for which it was brought into existence at the outset,
i.e. whether it was directly in contemplation of pending litigation. The courts had recognised that
the public interest in the proper administration of justice may well demand disclosure of vital items
of evidence, so that privilege may only be claimed where the preparation for the purpose of
litigation can be shown clearly to be " the dominant purpose" for the preparation of the report.
Moreover the High Court has a residual discretion to investigate what is the dominant purpose and
decide accordingly upon the merits of disclosure in the public interest. Furthermore it is not
conclusive, as a matter of law, that a document purports on the face of it to have been prepared
for such a purpose. Considerable care needs to be given to whether the Phillips Report might
genuinely qualify as a document of legal privilege or on the other hand whether the public interest
prevails.

The possibility that the Phillips Report would attract such privilege was addressed in a meeting with
Mr Daines last week. As indicated I should be pleased to research this matter further and contact
Peter Metcalfe, should it be necessary.

Dear Ms Adlington

I refer to your letter dated 17 July 1997 asking for copies of statements.

We have always co-operated fully with all such requests. However, in view of the
establishment of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s Scrutiny on aspects of the Hillsborough
Disaster, I feel we must take a slightly different approach now.

I have written to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to ask his permission to comply with your
request. I am anxious not to cut across his work. As soon as I hear from him, I will contact
you again.

Yours sincerely

Dear Superintendent,

I refer to a conversation which I had with P.C. Greenway on
Tuesday 15th July concerning the release to me of witness
statements. At his request I enclose a copy of the signed
authorities of Roger Houldsworth and Dr. Ed Walker.

You may be aware that Lord Justice Stuart Smith has requested that
the families written representations should reach him by the end
of August.  In the circumstances I should be grateful if you would
let me have the above mentioned statements by return.

 I thank you for your assistance.

 Yours faithfully,

RE: HILLSBOROUGH SCRUTINY

I refer to correspondence between yourself and Assistant Chief Constable Ian Daines, regarding
the report you produced for the then Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police, following
Lord Justice Taylor's enquiry.

Following legal advice that the report is not relevant to any current court action, the
Chief Constable has decided to release it to the Hillsborough Family Support Group in Liverpool.
I am therefore writing to inform you that Ms Ann Adlington, solicitor for the Group has been
provided with a copy of the report and its appendices.

Dear Mr Phillips

Hillsborough Disaster Scrutiny

Following our conversation yesterday, I enclose a copy of your report, together with a letter
received from our Solicitor, Mr Owston, explaining how he feels about any privilege that
would be attached to your report.

Additionally, I have been in touch with the solicitors to the apportionment action to which
your report was germane. Their view is that it would be possible to claim privilege but that
there is nothing contained in your report which is prejudicial to South Yorkshire any more
than is already known and it could be released. This would be in accord with Richard
Wells' statement on openness and assisting Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's Scrutiny.

Yours sincerely

                                                                                          r
                          Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s Scrutiny of Hillsborough

                 Thank you for your letter regarding the above. At the time of the Hillsborough
         Disaster I was the Secretary of the ACPO Football Hooliganism Committee and had done
         much to promote a universal approach to the problems of policing football. As a
         consequence I was asked by the then Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, Peter Wright, if
         I would provide a professional expert opinion which might be relied upon in the civil
         proceedings which were anticipated, I prepared my report on that basis both by reference
         to the evidence which came before the hearing; statements obtained in the course of the
         enquiry led by then ACC Mervyn Jones of West Midlands and by interviewing a number
         of people myself and examining documents. The real weight of my report is interpretive.
         For example, I think it was highly significant that the football ground had hardly ever
         been at capacity in the preceding 12 years whereby there was no local knowledge of the
         problems relating to overcrowding; I think that the evidence relating to the previous
         overspill which Mr. Gosling dealt with and the correspondence thereafter, was of great
         importance; I believe that the failure of John Motson and so many other commentators to
         recognise overcrowding was significant; I believe that the engineering of the ground,
         particularly in relation to the lack of secure connection between turnstiles and parts of the
         ground with crowd limits, was a matter of greater importance than the enquiry considered;
         and finally I think there was a good deal of evidence about the conduct of the late arriving
         Liverpool supporters which seemed to be minimised as the enquiry concentrated upon the
         tragic blamelessness of those who suffered.

                 I hope my observations are of some value.

                                                     With respect, -

You will no doubt be aware that I retire at the end of August. When I concluded my investigation in
the Hillsborough Inquiry in 19911 kept copies of certain documentation relevant to the Inquiry.
These were kept for reference should I have to refer to them subsequent to the conclusion of the
investigation. In addition, I kept my personal notes which I intend to retain. However, the question is
whether the South Yorkshire Police wish to receive the duplicate material which I presently hold.
There are no original documents, merely duplicates of certain parts that were passed to you by
Detective Chief Superintendent Foster at the end of the Inquiry.

The question again, therefore, is would this duplicate material be of any assistance to you? If not I
will make arrangements for it to be confidentially destroyed.

With best wishes

Dear sir

Hillsborough

Thank you for your letter of 25 July 1997 relating to material which you hold. The Chief
Constable is on leave now but I mentioned to him your letter and he asked me to reply on
his behalf.

Your bundle of documents would be of use to us. I note your comment that it may well
duplicate items that we already hold, but we would rather have the material than run the
risk that an item would be lost. Constable Ken GREENWAY monitors our Hillsborough
Stadium Disaster archive. I will ask him to contact your secretary to discuss how the
material can be passed over to us.

Yours faithfully




Ian Daines

          Dear Chief Constable

                                         Hillsborough and Beyond.

          I am greatly encouraged by your letter.

          And my thanks to Anne Taylor - Anne must have presented my ideas with great clarity and all
          from a brief phone call. As a direct result, my basic idea has:
               a) reached the right desk,
               b) has been fed into the system (which to me is unknown territory) and
               c) Has been upgraded from what I would call "instructions" to "statutorily backed
                  instructions".
          Which in my book adds up to a lot of positive progress.*

          Hopefully we both understand that much more is involved than we have spelled out so far. The
          concept of vital instructions may not be new, others must have thought of it, the point is that
          these vital instructions must be put into place.

          You are probably ahead of me. I am also saying that "people", including pedestrians, must be
          responsible for the way they drive and what they do. This is unfashionable thinking.

          In your letter you point out that the Home Secretary's call for a judicial examination is restricted
          to new material. Sadly I fear that the press will be looking for sensation: real, manufactured or
          imagined. I am suggesting that some preparatory work would not be amiss.

          By the same token, an Independent can properly say things which a player cannot.

          I am attaching further notes from which you can select any points of interest, plus some personal
          notes.




          * You can have negative progress. In Engineering we call it "improving things worse", and there
          is a lot of it around.

                                             Introducing
                                   David H.Young.
      Chartered Engineer and Practitioner in Hazard Reduction and Control.




1) Background.

     David Young is a Chartered Engineer with more than 45 years industrial experience spanning
everything from concept to batch production including user training and aftersales service. He now
concentrates on consultancy specialising in matters connected with Health and Safety, offering his
clients the benefit of his long experience including hard lessons he learned from some projects
which didn't work out exactly as planned.



2) Negative Safety.

      From Derby Technical College (with its strong connections with Rolls Royce) David Young
joined the army by which time the war in Europe was over except in places like Palestine. Looking
back he sees the armed forces as a massive organisation dedicated to the manufacture and delivery
of negative safety. He now realises that exposing the enemy to negative safety was extremely
difficult whilst accidents to our own troops/aircraft/ships occurred all too easily. One unhappy
example was the death of a soldier on a troopship in harbour, killed by the accidental release of a
heavy liferaft. Fate was particularly unkind - the soldier who was on his way home from a danger
zone, was killed by safety equipment designed to save his life.
       Few people understand negative safety and sadly history repeats itself. The safety fence at the
Hillsborough football stadium turned into a death trap.



3) Emergency Equipment.

     In the 1960s David Young designed oxygen equipment used in airliners and in the 80s he
designed rapid access fire extinguisher holders for use on the roads by petroleum and chemical
tankers.
     After the Summerlands disaster in the Isle of Man, in which customers were still being admit­
ted at the front of the building whilst staff were fighting a losing battle against fire at the back, he
designed a new fire extinguisher stowage The stowage would prevent staff from fighting a fire
without first raising the alarm. Basic indeed but its importance has not yet been recognised.

   Introducing David Young - contd.


   4) Fashionable Thinking and Untested Solutions.

         Fashionable thinking, lateral thinking and politically correct thinking all combine to produce
   untested solutions to real problems which do not understand new thinking.
         For example it is more cost effective to send a young arsonist on holiday than place him in a
   borstal. This progressive thinking is fine for everyone except those who travel with him on an
   aircraft or who stay in the same hotel. Meanwhile the transport operator and the hotel owner are
   faced with an unknown hazard against which they cannot take the necessary precaution of transfer­
   ring the arsonist to secure accommodation.
        Recently a Chief Constable was targeted by an editor who homed in on an unguarded com­
   ment and put the Chief Constable's career at risk. DHY wrote a letter to the Head of the Metropoli­
   tan Police (probably with many others) and the matter was dropped.
        Why is this important outside the Police Force? For Chief Constable read Managing Director,
   Proprietor or anyone like you in a position of responsibility.


5) Computer Control Of Hazardous Operations.

     Computer control is fine while it is working properly but computers can lead to massive
problems when something goes wrong or something occurs outside the predetermined program. An
example was the shooting down of two helicopters by US warplanes in Iraq. Sadly the helicopters
were also American and there were heavy casualties. Visibility was good, the helicopters had
radios and all the aircraft concerned were under radar surveillance. The moral is that you can have
negative safety and sophisticated negative safety.




6) Independent Survey.
     People who work in or next to a dangerous situation are the least likely to spot the hazard.
Thus David Young can render a valuable service if asked to carry out an independent survey.
     For example one of his clients operated from premises bordering an urban motorway less than
2 m away from heavy traffic. A steel barrier and a second concrete barrier gave good protection
against an errant vehicle but no-one connected the factory situation with the North country farmer
whose land bordered a motorway. The farmer burnt stubble and the smoke billowed onto the
motorway causing a pile-up for which the farmer was held responsible. My client has strict rules
banning any fires in his yard.
     Whilst on the subject of motorways, David Young has designed a BIG crash absorbing vehicle
to reduce the risk of an errant truck ploughing into roadworks. Sadly this conflicts with work done
by the Road Research Laboratory who seem content with a small crash cushion rig.

7) Crime

     Crime is a growth industry and Industry must take note of this fact. Fine if you are in the
security business but otherwise you (not the criminal) face severe financial penalties. Consider
Woolworth Stores who now have to employ a security guard in every outlet because in one of their
stores the Manager was murdered for petty cash.


8) Boundaries.

     In military strategy the boundary between two armies is of special interest as being an obvious
weak point. In the same way the boundary between departments is a weak point in any organisation
and represents a hazard. Similarly the joint between one component and another is often a point of
weakness in a machine or structure.
     David Young spends time looking for boundary hazards and tries to anticipate the after-smash
comments "No-one told me" or "The bow door hinges were tom away".


9) Soomansoo.

    If an accident occurs a pack of solicitors are ready and waiting for business. The keyword is
Soomansoo and you could be the recipient of a gleefully presented writ, claim or criminal charge.


10) Practicalities.

     It is difficult to talk about generalities. If you have problems now or can see problems in the
future regarding Health and Safety, maybe we could arrange a meeting to discuss your situation. It
is much easier to talk about practicalities.

Mr D Young




Thank you very much indeed for telephoning through to my office offering your
services in respect of professional advice to any review of the Hillsborough Disaster o
 1989.
You will have seen from yesterday's announcement by the Home Secretary that the
judicial examination of supposed new material is actually to be quite limited in its
 scope I don’t think that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will be addressing the question of
 ground safety and so there will probably be no need to bother you in that context.

 However, what you suggest sounds eminently sensible and I will pass your details if I
 may to our Assistant Chief Constable (Operations) Tim Hollis and ask him to feed
 your interesting idea about statutorily backed notices into the appropriate regulating
 authorities at national level.

 I cannot, of course, guarantee that they will follow up an enquiry with you but I shall
 certainly indicate to Tim Hollis that your suggestion is worthy of further consideration.

HILLSBOROUGH

Took a call from David Young who is a Chartered Engineer
interested in health and safety. He described himself as a "very
independent character which means that I may not come to the
same conclusions as other people".

He has been looking at the final conclusions of the court of inquiry
and believes that one or two things are "flawed". He made
comment that he doesn't think that even now there are notices in
stadia with legal backing that people "must not run they must walk",
and if such a basic thing has been omitted a whole lot o f other
things have been omitted too.

He believes that he may be of some service to SYP, and wanted to
know who he should be talking to.

Dear Sir

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s Scrutiny of Hillsborough

I enclose a letter I recently sent to Mr Chris Bone who is the Secretary to Lord Justice
Stuart-Smith’s Scrutiny of Hillsborough. Lord Justice Stuart-smith’s Scrutiny was set up to
establish whether there is any fresh evidence relating to the Hillsborough Disaster that was
not available to previous enquiries.

In that context, I have become aware of the report you prepared in August 1990, after Lord
Justice Taylor’s enquiry had concluded.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith requires us to notify him of any fresh evidence in our possession
by 1 September 1997. As you will see from my letter to Chris Bone I am a little unsure of
the background and purpose of your report. You will recall that we bumped into each other
on the afternoon of Thursday 24 July 1997 when we were both at the Buckingham Palace
Garden Party and that I said I would be contacting you about this.

I would be obliged if you could, at your earliest convenience, write to me a letter which I can
forward to Mr Bone which gives the purpose and background of your report. This will allow
Mr Bone to determine whether your report represents new evidence.

Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

Yours faithfully




Ian Daines

Dear Mr Bone

Report by David Phillips on Hillsborough Disaster

I attach a report dated August 1990 by Mr David Phillips, then Deputy Chief Constable of
Devon and Cornwall Constabulary, now Chief Constable of Kent.

The provenance of the report is a little unclear. At paragraph 2.1, Mr Phillips says;

       “On 20th October, 1989, I was asked to consider documentary material emanating
       from the Inquiry conducted by Lord Justice TAYLOR into the disaster at
       Hillsborough. I have confined my research to a consideration of documentary
       evidence although I have spoken to other senior police officers, serving and retired,
       in relation to this match and other issues in general, (none of whom had any direct
       involvement in the game at Hillsborough).”

In response to your request for “fresh evidence” to be submitted to you, I forward this
document. I do not believe it represents fresh evidence but is principally another
perspective on pre-existing evidence. However, as with all similar material, the Chief
Constable would prefer to lay material before you rather than pre-judge the material’s
freshness. I will cause enquiries to be made into the background that led to this report and
will contact you again as soon as I have more information.

I would be obliged if you could acknowledge receipt of this letter.

Yours sincerely




Ian Daines
Assistant Chief Constable

Thank you for your letter of 15 May to Joyce Quin about the calls for a new inquiry
into the Hillsborough disaster. I am replying as this issue falls within my remit at the
Home Office.

As you will be aware, the Home Secretary announced on 30 June that Lord Justice
Stuart-Smith is to conduct an independent scrutiny to ascertain whether there exists
any new and significant evidence relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough football
stadium which was not previously available.

I am grateful for your offer to meet and discuss the events at Hillsborough. At the
moment, however, you will understand that these are issues for Lord Justice Stuart-
Smith to consider in his scrutiny.

I will ensure that your helpful letter is drawn to his attention.

 General Note
     A local authority, being a corporation, is subject to the doctrine of ultra vires (see hereon   2-249
  Ashbury Railway Carriage Co. v. Riche (1875) L.R. 7 H.L. 653, and Att-Gen. v. Fulham
   Corporation [1921] 1 Ch. 440). As to the doctrine of ultra vires (see General Introduction
  para 1-10 et seq. and Chapter 4. The courts have held that a corporation may do not only
  those things for which there is express or implied authority, but also whatever is reasonably
  incidental to the doing of those things: Att.-Gen. v. Great Eastern Ry. (1880) 5 App.Cas.
  473, per Lord Selbome at p. 478. This common law rule is now given statutory force.
     It should be noted that Part V of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 contains
  a statutory code relating to companies in which local authorities have interests. Those pro­
  visions sub-divide local authority companies into three broad categories: local authority
  controlled companies; local authority influenced companies, and companies in which a local
  authority has a minority interest, liie purpose of controls over local authority companies
  set out in Part V of the 1989 Act is that, when a company is effectively under the control of
  a local authority, the most significant controls that Parliament has laid down for the conduct
  of local authorities should apply to that company. The company is treated as an extension
  of the local authority.
    The legislation contained in Part V of the 1989 Act from a study conducted by the
  Government in the light of the report of the Widdicombe Committee of Inquiry into the
 Conduct of Local Authority Business. The Government concluded that it was anomalous
 that, although there is detailed statutory regulation of the way in which local authorities
 discharge their functions, there was no control over the operation of companies subject to
 the control or dominant influence of a local authority.
    Part V of the 1989 Act does not prevent local authorities from continuing to set up, or
 participate in, companies, either as formal members or by appointing directors. All such
 cases, however, are now brought within a framework of regulation contained in Part V
 (ss.67-73) of the Local Government and Housing-Act 1989. These controls do not impose
 any new controls on companies but regulate the conduct of local authorities participating in
 them. The subsidiary powers of local authorities contained in this section are widely drawn.
 Since they authorise the doing of any thing which is calculated to facilitate, or is conducive
 or incidental to, the discharge of a function of the local authority, the section would author­
ise the formation, acquisition or control of a company under the Companies Acts. A local
authority may enter into a contract with a company in which it is involved, to do thinoc on
its behalf, in the same way as it can contract with an independent contractor. The Local
Government and Housing Act 1989, s.67(2), provides that a local authority may not exer­
cise any constitutional involvement in a company to which the controls apply; that is to say,
a local authority may not subscribe for or acquire shares in the company; nor be a member
of a company limited by guarantee; nor exercise any power to nominate any person to
become a member of a company; nor appoint a director of a company.
   Controlled and influenced companies are therefore subject to regulation of local auth­
ority activity and dealing in them. The Secretary of State may direct that individual compa­
nies shall be excluded from the categories of controlled and influenced companies.
   See Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982, s.33 (post, para. 3-222) for

                      subject to the provisions o f . . . any other enactment” This is to be taken to include a
                                delegated legislation: Allsop v. North Tyneside Metropolitan Borough Council
                  (1992) 90 L.G.R. 462 (see para. 1-12).
                      incidental to." This is not equivalent to the phrase “in connection with”; it has a nar­
                  rower meaning: see remarks of Lord Macnaghton in Amalgamated Society o f Railway Ser­
                  vants v. Osborne [1910] A.C. 87, at 97. It will not justify a corporation engaging in activities
                 which the court considers were not contemplated by the legislature: see Att-Gen. v. Fulham
                 Corporation [1921] 1 Ch. 440 (laundry service not authorised by the Baths and Washhouses
                 Acts 1846 and 1878); Att.-Gen. v. Manchester Corporation [1906] 1 Ch. 643 (parcels delivery
                 service not authorised apart from limited power to use tramways for that purpose under a
                 private Act). But the modem tendency has been for the courts to adopt a more liberal
                 interpretation; see Att-Gen. v. Smethwick Corporation [1932] 1 Ch. 562 (establishment of a
                 department to carry out the council’s printing and stationery work, intra vires); Att.-Gen. v.
                 Crayford U.D.C. [1962] Ch. 575 (collective insurance of council tenants’ household goods
                authorised by the general power of management under s .l l l of the Housing Act 1957 but
                P.®1 “ecessarily      asPects ° f        welfare of tenants); Grainger v. Liverpool Corporation
                [1954] 1 Q.B. 351 (employment of a private consultant to advise on rating proposals); cf. R.
                v. Kensington and Chelsea Royal Borough Council, ex p. Brandt, The Times, December 21,
                1995 (payment of interest not incidental, etc. to payment of housing benefit, and in any
                event impliedly prohibited by the housing benefit legislation: see para. 1-12). The more
                liberal interpretation may well be encouraged by the phrase “calculated to facilitate” used in
                this subsection.
                    “functions” In Hazell v. Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough Council [1990] 2
                Q.B. 697, 722-723, Woolf L.J. said. “What is a function for the purposes of the subsection is
                not expressly defined but in our view there can be little doubt that in this context ‘func­
               tions’ refers to the multiplicity of specific statutory activities the council is expressly or
               impliedly under a duty to perform or has power to perform under the other provisions of
               the Act of 1972 or other relevant legislation. The subsection does not of itself, indepen­
               dently of any other provision, authorise the performance of any activity. It only confers, as
               the sidenote to the second indicates, a subsidiary power. A subsidiary power which author­
               ises an activity where some other statutory provision has vested a specific function or func­
               tions in the council and the performance of the activity will assist in some way in the
              discharge of that function or those functions.” This was approved by the Court of Anneal:
              [1990] 2 Q.B. 697, 785, and the House of Lords: [1992] 2 A.C. 1, 29.
                   In R. v. Greater London Council, ex p. Westminster City Council, The Times, December
              27,1984, it was held that the maintenance of good staff relations was a proper function of a
              local authority and a decision to release staff for that purpose was within s .l l l subject to
              the Wednesbury test of reasonableness. But if the object, or a major object, of the decision
              was to conduct a political campaign in opposition to government policy that was an irrel­
              evant consideration and the decision would be invalid. On that basis a decision by the Inner
              London Education Authority to release one member of staff to a joint committee or body
              of trade unions made in the interests of good industrial relations was valid but a decision of
              the GLC to release seven members of staff with pay to the same body in support of the
              GLC’s campaign against government policy was invalid. (See also annotations to s.142 at
             para. 2-326).
                  In R. v. Inner London Education Authority, ex p. Westminster City Council and Others
             [1986] 1 W.L.R. 28, it was held by the House of Lords that decisions by the G.L.C. to
             allocate funds to the Inner London Interim Education Authority and to various voluntary
             organisations to meet their needs during the financial year 1986-87 were ultra vires and
             unlawful: see para. 1-12, ante.
                  In R. v. Eden District Council, ex p. Moffat, The Times, November 24, 1988, the Court of
             Appeal held that s .l l l enabled the council to appoint a working party comprising council­

not discharging any of the council’s functions under s.101. Furthermore, the officers would
not have been members of such a committee or sub-committee by virtue of s .1 0 4 (1 ) and
s.80(l)(a).                                                                                     2-250
   In R. v. Richmond Upon Thames London Borough Council, ex p. McCarthy & Stone
(Developments) Ltd. (1989) 58 P. & C.R. 434, Popplewell J. held that s.lll(l) gave a local
authority power to raise money by charging an individual company for pre-planning appli­
cation discussions. The words in brackets in subs. (1) were inclusive and not exclusive. The
charges were calculated to facilitate, or conducive or incidental to the discharge of the auth­
ority’s functions. The wording of subs. (3) made it clear that the raising of money by rate,
precept or borrowing was within the scope of subs. (1). The restrictions in subs. (3) that
raising money had to be in accordance with enactments relating to those matters applied
only to the methods of raising money specified, and did not restrict the power to raise
money by charges. This was affirmed by the Court of Appeal: [1990] 2 W.L.R. 1294, but
reversed by the House of Lords: [1992] 2 A.C. 48. The House held that a power to charge
had to be authorised by statute either expressly or by necessary implication; that the giving
of pre-application advice was not itself a function of the council, although it was incidental
to the discharge of the council’s planning functions; that charging for such advice was
accordingly “incidental to the incidental”; and that this was too remote to be permitted by
section 111(1). The House rejected the council’s argument that a distinction was to be
drawn between functions which a council has a duty to perform (in respect of which it was
accepted that no charge could be made) and those which it had a power to perform, where
a charge would be made. On the other hand, it also rejected the developers’ argument that
charging under section 111(1) was prohibited by section 111(3).
   In Hazell v. Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough Council [1990] 2 Q.B. 697, 722-
726, the Divisional Court held that the interest rate swaps and similar transactions conduc­
ted by the council were not authorised by s.lll. They did not facilitate the management of
a function (borrowing) but only the consequence of a function (the obligation to pay inter­
est on borrowing). Moreover, they constituted a trade or business conducted to make a
profit, R. v. Greater London Council, ex p. Westminster City Council and R. v. Eden District
Council, ex p. Moffat, supra, were distinguishable as they were not concerned with the
financial activities of a council, for which express provision was made by Schedule 13. This
position was endorsed by the House of Lords: [1992] 2 A.C. 1 (see para. 1-12). Similarly, in
R. v. Wirral Metropolitan Borough Council, ex p. Milstead (1989) 87 L.G.R. 611, the Div­
isional Court held that a “factoring” agreement to sell, for a current payment, the right to
receive the proceeds of future sales of land was not lawful under s.lll. Entering the agree­
ment was not incidental to sale of the land, but was concerned with the sale of sums of
money derived from the proceeds of sale of the land: “To my mind disposal of the proceeds
of sale cannot be said to be incidental to sale of the property” (per Stuart-Smith LJ. at p.
618). See also para. 3-294/8.
   In Allsop v. North Tyneside Metropolitan Borough Council (1992) 90 L.G.R. 462, the
Court of Appeal held that payments under an enhanced voluntary severance scheme in
excess of the limits prescribed by delegated legislation were not authorised by section
111(1) and were contrary to law (see para. 1-12).
   In R. v. Elmbridge Borough Council, ex p. Health Care Corporation Ltd and Prime Com­
mercial Properties (1991) 63 P. & C.R. 260, Popplewell J. noted that in reaching a determi­
nation that an outline planning permission had lapsed, the council was not exercising an
express statutory power under the Town and Country Planning Act 1971, but its power or
function as a planning authority pursuant to section 111 of the 1972 Act
   See s.137 of this Act for the power of local authorities to incur expenditure for certain
purposes not otherwise authorised by statute.

                local authorities of any description or committees of local authorities to
                appoint a specified officer shall, to the extent that it makes any such pro­
                vision, cease to have effect.
                   The reference in this section to committees of local authorities does
                not include a reference to any committee of which some members are

   This section derives from a number of provisions in Part IV of the Local Government             2-253
Act 1933 (ss.98 to 104) which, in addition to granting a general power to appoint officers,
laid down a number of statutory appointments. Local authorities are now given a much
wider discretion in the appointment of staff for the proper discharge of their functions,
although the officers listed in subsection (4) must still be appointed. S.220 contains a
requirement to appoint coroners. The term “officer” is not defined in the Act but in the
context of this section it obviously covers all employees of the authority. In R. v. Hertford­
shire County Council, ex p. NUPE [1985] I.R.L.R. 258, C.A., however, the Master of the
Rolls suggested obiter that for the purpose of an application for judicial review an employee
may only be considered an “officer” if he holds an office independently of the person filling
it. The case concerned the council’s decision to dismiss their school dinner ladies and offer
them re-employment on less favourable terms which the union unsuccessfully sought to
challenge on the Wednesbury principles of unreasonableness and failure to take into
account material considerations such as the relevant NJC national agreement. See also R. v.
East Berkshire Health Authority, ex p. Walsh [1985] Q.B. 152, where an application for
judicial review was rejected by the Court of Appeal in connection with the dismissal of a
Senior Nursing Officer as not a public law matter and R. v. Derbyshire County Council, ex
p. Noble, [1990] I.R.L.R. 332, C.A., where it was held that there was no public law element
in the post of deputy police surgeon. Cf R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department,
ex p. Benwell [1985] Q.B. 554, where the dismissal of a prison officer was held to be subject
to judicial review procedure in the absence of a private law remedy. See also post, paras.
5-32 et seq.
   If an authority proposes to embark on an employment or redeployment policy which is in
breach of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 or the Race Relations Act 1976, or is otherwise
unlawful, the public law remedies should be available to the unions and employees affected:
R. v. Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough Council, ex p. NALGO [1991] C.O.D.
397.
   A local authority may not terminate the appointment of officers necessary for the proper
discharge of its functions for an unlawful reason: R. v. Liverpool City Council, ex p. Fergu­
son, The Times, November 20, 1985 (decision of council to dismiss its teachers as a conse­
quence of its failure to fix a legal rate declared ultra vires).
   Section 5 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 provides a duty on a local
authority to designate one of their officers, who is to be known as “the monitoring officer,”
to perform the duties specified in that section. These duties include a duty to report to the
authority at any time it appears to him that any proposal, decision or omission by the auth­
ority or a committee or sub-committee of it, contravenes any enactment, rule of law or code
of practice or is likely to lead to maladministration or injustice as defined in Part III of the
Local Government Act 1974. The officer designated by a local authority in pursuance of
this section may,be the head of the authority’s paid service but shall not be their chief
finance officer.
   Section 8 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 enables the Secretary of State
by regulations to require local authorities to incorporate such provisions as may be pre­
scribed in the regulations in standing orders relating to their staff, including provisions reg­
ulating the appointment of persons or the dismissal of persons. The section goes on to
detail matters which may be included in regulations.

SUBJECT:       THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER 1989


I met this morning with representatives of the Force's superintendents at Niagara - one of a series
of regular meetings for up-dating each other informally on key issues at play within the South
Yorkshire Police.

 My first item on the agenda was to up-date them on aspects of the Home Secretary's deliberations
on the Hillsborough Disaster and his recent appointment of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to conduct a
judicial examination into purported new evidence.

After my up-date Superintendent Steve King shared with the group an aspect which had been
troubling him. This concerned reports of an incident in 1981 at a football match at the Hillsborough
ground when, it is said, there had been some crushing of fans. Steve King went on to say that,
even after the Taylor Enquiry, there had been reports of a similar occurrence at the Sheffield
Wednesday ground in November 1989.

Steve King's belief is that the then capacity of parts of the ground had, as I understand it, been
over-stated in the numbers allowed to enter those parts of the ground by SWFC. Steve King had
always thought that somehow this was material to the findings of Lord Justice Taylor.

Some members of this superintendent group confirmed that speculation to this effect had been
circulating the Force at junior level since the Disaster.

Now in possession of this suggestion, I am duty bound to take professional cognisance of it, even
if it is deleterious to the Force or any other party to the Disaster. It is possible that we should make
it available to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith as part of his review of the supposed new evidence, even
though it may not fall within the terms of reference that we have to date. It is also possible that it
will open up a completely new avenue to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's examination, including the
possibility of a full public enquiry.

However, before we move further in that direction, we have to establish whether there is any
substance to the suggestions - in other words, does what is being speculated about amount to
"new evidence"?

As the portfolio-holder responsible, and with your comparative freshness to the SYP, I believe that
we must now take appropriate steps to assure a professional regard for these matters, as
mentioned above.

This formal report to you is the first step in the proceedings, an hour after this morning's meeting
concluded. The next step should be an analysis of what is being said and the extent to which it is
supported by credible fact. A further aspect of this analysis is who is best placed to carry it out in
order to ensure objectivity and transparency of process.
It is even a possibility that the material was presented in some form to the Taylor Enquiry, even
though it did not emerge in his final reports. With such a bulk of available information, Lord Justice
Taylor could not, after all, cover all aspects in detail.

Another aspect to consider which was mentioned at this morning's meeting was to the effect that
local press, it is suggested, published similar assertions.

I would value your early recommendations in this direction and, when you have them to hand I
suggest that they are given urgent attention by the SCT.

AGENDA ITEM FOR SENIOR COMMAND TEAM MEETING


Home Secretary’s announcement re Hillsborough and Subsequent House of
Commons Debate

On 30 June 1997 the Home Secretary made an announcement in the House of Commons.
His statement and responses to subsequent questions about the Hillsborough disaster can
be distilled to:-

i)     The DPP is, and the last Government’s Attorney General was, satisfied that there
       was no new evidence to warrant criminal proceedings or re-opening the inquest.

ii)    The PCA ruled that the Chief Superintendent and Superintendent should face
       disciplinary action. The Chief Superintendent was allowed to retire on ill-health
       grounds. The PCA decided that the Superintendent should not face disciplinary
       action in the absence of the Chief Superintendent. The Home Secretary was
       pressed by Alan BEITH and Nicholas SOAMES on the issue of police officers
       retiring while discipline is pending. The Home Secretary said that police regulations
       expect Chief Constables not to permit retirement on ill-health grounds when
       disciplinary proceedings are pending. There is the issue of “whether Chief
       Constables are properly fulfilling the terms of regulations".

iii)   Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will;

       a)     Examine all the written and other evidence that has been submitted.

       b)     Advise the Home Secretary whether any evidence not previously available
              would justify a further public enquiry; his advice will be made public.

       c)     Identify for the Attorney General, the DPP and the Chief Constable of South
               Yorkshire Police any evidence relevant to their functions that has not been
                previously considered. This report will only be made public if it does not
               jeopardise any future hearing (criminal/inquest/ disciplinary).

       d)     Start work in July, start proceedings in September and report by end of year,

       e)     Decide whether examination will be in public.

       f)     Allow the families and others to be legally represented.

       g)     Report on why any new evidence was not previously available.

iv)    Evidence will not be on oath. There is no reference to compelling attendance.

I recommend that;

i)     We identify human and financial resources for the enquiry (progress will be limited
       until we know how Stuart-Smith proposes to conduct the enquiry).

ii)    We begin to plan how we approach this enquiry.

       The House would like to know, if not today perhaps in tomorrow's deb^e, how much money are Her
       Majesty's Government are prepared to earmark to ensure that Mont^frat is viable in future.

       Mr. Foulkes: I will certainly try to ensure that the hon. Gentleman's final question is answered in
       tomorrow's debate—if not in the introductory speech, thenj*fme reply for which I am directly
       responsible.                                              /

       It is not right to compare dependent territories witj/other countries. We have a special responsibility
       for dependent territories as long as they remain i/fihat role, which is why I said that we accept, jointly
       with the elected Government of Montserrat, odr responsibility to the people of Montserrat; and that
       continues                                   /

       No doubt if the hon. Gentleman catcj>ds Madam Speaker's eye, he will have the opportunity tomorrow
       to extend his contribution and tell what the previous Government did. I do not believe, however,
       that he will be able to say that tjj^y acted with the sense of urgency that has been shown in the past
       eight weeks.                   /

       Mr. Andrew Miller (Etfesmere Port and Neston): My hon. Friend will be aware that, last year, I saw
       the devastation in M^rftserrat from a Lynx helicopter flying from the back of HMS Argyll, the West
       Indies guard ship oft station at the time. In view of the risk to Lynx helicopters because of the nature of
       the dust from th^volcanic explosion, is my hon. Friend satisfied that, in the event of there having to be
       a major evacuation, there is sufficient seaborne support to bring that about?

       Mr. FoulKes: Yes. As well as providing the ferry service, which started yesterday, we have had
       discussions with the Governments of the other islands in the area, and we are satisfied that there is
       sufficient seaborne capacity to carry out an evacuation. I can say, however, that we are currently
       rev isin g the evacuation procedures~the second issue of which was produced earlier this year-in the
       light of recent happenings, to ascertain whether any updating and improvement are necessary.

                                                    Hillsborough Disaster

       3.47 pm

       The Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Jack Straw): With permission, Madam
       Speaker, I should like to make a statement about the Hillsborough stadium disaster.

       Ninety-six people lost their lives as a result of the Hillsborough disaster, which happened on 15 April
       1989. That was more than eight years ago, but no one who saw the news reports on that dreadful
       Saturday will have forgotten those terrible events. For those who lost loved members of their family,
       the pain is ever present . Following Hillsborough, Members of the House were united in their
       determination to do all in their power to prevent anything like that ever happening again.

       After the Hillsborough disaster, a number of inquiries and investigations took place. The most thorough
       and wide ranging of those was the public inquiry led by the late Lord Taylor The terms of reference of
       that inquiry encompassed not only inquiring into the disaster, but making recommendations about
       crowd control and safety at sports events.

       Lord Taylor's inquiry took oral evidence from more than 170 witnesses at public hearings during May
       and June 1989 and considered many hours of video evidence from different sources. In his interim
       report in August 1989, Lord Taylor found that the disaster had a number of causes. He did not attribute
       all the blame to a single cause or person, but in paragraph 278 he made it clear that, in his view,


              "The main reason for the disaster was the failure of police control".
House of Commons H a n s a . ..for 30 Jun 1997      (pt 7 ) h t t p : / / w w w . p a r l i a m e n t .... 0 7.h t m # 7 0 6 3 0 - 0 7 _ s p mi n 0



      Lord Taylor made 43 recommendations in his interim report. His final report in January 1990 made a
      further 76 recommendations. The developments that have taken place since then in safety at football
      grounds and in the policing of football matches have been based largely on those recommendations.
      Football in this country has been transformed since the Taylor report. To a large extent, that is due to
      Lord Taylor's wide-ranging and soundly based conclusions.

      The deaths that occurred on 15 April 1989 were also the subject of inquests conducted by the coroner
      of the western district of South Yorkshire. After examining the evidence, the jury at the coroner's
      inquest found in March 1991 that the cause of death of those who died at Hillsborough was accidental
      death. A further investigation was conducted by the West Midlands police, supervised by the Police
      Complaints Authority, to establish whether there were any grounds for criminal proceedings and to
      consider whether any police officer should be subject to disciplinary proceedings.

      That investigation involved the taking of more than 5,000 statements and the scrutiny of all the material
      that had been examined previously by the Taylor inquiry. After that investigation, the evidence was sent
      to the Director of Public Prosecutions, who concluded that no person should be subject to criminal
      proceedings.

       The Police Complaints Authority decided that the chief superintendent and the superintendent in charge
       on the day should face disciplinary charges for neglect of duty. In the event, the chief superintendent
       retired due to ill health in advance of a ruling by a disciplinary tribunal.

       Column 25

       Under police discipline rules, a disciplinary hearing cannot proceed when a police officer retires before
       the hearing takes place. The Police Complaints Authority decided later that disciplinary proceedings
       against the superintendent should be withdrawn because the retirement of the chief superintendent
       meant that what, in effect, was a joint allegation of neglect of duty could not be heard fairly in the
       absence of the more senior officer.

       Hon. Members will be familiar with the unhappiness of the families of those who died regarding the
       outcome of the inquest. They later applied for judicial review of the coroner's proceedings. In
       November 1993, the divisional court ruled that none of the matters raised in the judicial review
       proceedings justified intervention by that court in the verdict of the inquest jury. The events
       surrounding the disaster have, therefore, been subject to investigation on several occasions. However,
       concerns have remained about whether the full facts have yet emerged. I have met relatives of the
       Hillsborough victims whose suffering is exacerbated by their belief that there are unresolved issues that
       should be investigated further.

       Representations were made to my predecessor and have been made to me, to the Attorney-General and
       to the Director of Public Prosecutions. A Granada television programme in December last year
       dramatised the disaster and raised a number of issues that, in the view of the programme makers,
       represented new evidence. The programme prompted an Adjournment debate on 17 December 1996,
       which was led by my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Kilfoyle), and to which my
       predecessor, the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr Howard), replied. I
       know how seriously my predecessor viewed the matter.

       Since that programme, further material has been submitted on behalf of the Hillsborough families
       support group. Those representations have related in particular to video evidence of the disaster and to
       medical evidence about the time of death of the victims. My Department, the office of the
       Attorney-General and the Crown Prosecution Service have considered very carefully all the evidence
       that has been put forward in recent months. The Director of Public Prosecutions has taken the view
       that the material so far presented to her would not justify fresh criminal proceedings. The former
       Attorney-General, the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Sir N. Lyell), also
H o u s e of Commons H a n s a ... for 30 Jun 1997         (pt 7 ) h t t p :/ / w w w . p a r l i a m e n t .... 0 7.ht m # 7 0 6 3 0 - 0 7 _ s p m i n0



       took the view--again, on the basis of the material presented to him—that any application to the High
       Court for a new inquest would not have any realistic prospect of succeeding.

       None the less, I am acutely conscious that the families of those who died at Hillsborough and many
       others, including hon Members, are very concerned that unresolved issues remain. I am determined to
       go as far as I can to ensure that no matter of significance is overlooked and that we do not reach a final
       conclusion without a full and independent examination of the evidence.

       The Attorney-General, the Director of Public Prosecutions and I have, therefore, agreed that it is in the
       public interest to establish an independent scrutiny to ascertain whether there now exists any new
       evidence relating to the disaster which was not previously available.

       Coiumn 26

       We are appointing Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal, for that
       purpose. His full terms of reference are as follows.


             "To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough Stadium on 15 April 1989
             which was not available:


              (a) To the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or


              (b) To the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the purpose of discharging their respective
              statutory responsibilities; or


              (c) To the Chief Officer of South Yorkshire Police in relation to police disciplinary matters;


              And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of such significance as to justify
              establishment by the Secretary of State for the Home Department of a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b)
              and (c) to draw to their attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to their
              respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should be taken in the public interest.

       I shall place a copy of those terms of reference in the Library.

       We have asked Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to examine all the written and other evidence that has been
       submitted. He will also consider any further material that interested parties wish to submit to him. He
       will have two tasks. The first is to advise me whether any evidence not previously available is of such
       significance to justify a further full public inquiry. His advice to me will be made available to the House,
       and will be made public. Secondly, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will identify for the Attorney- General,
       the DPP and the chief constable of South Yorkshire police any evidence that might be relevant to their
       decisions that has not previously been considered.

        I hope that this examination will enable us to establish conclusively whether material evidence about the
        causes of the Hillsborough disaster has been overlooked. I assure the House that, if it has, I will take
        whatever action is needed. We owe it to everyone who has been touched by the tragedy, but, above all,
        to the families of those who died to get to the bottom of the matter once and for all

       Dr. Brian Mawhinney (North-West Cambridgeshire): I thank the Home Secretary for his statement
       and for his personal courtesy in relation to it.

       What happened at Hillsborough was a tragedy of almost unimaginable proportions. Thousands of
       people—young and old alike—went to a football game; 96 did not return and others were injured. Those
       realities have blighted the lives of thousands of people for ever. There remain hurt and loss from which,
       in varying degrees, those people may never recover, and we are all affected by their suffering.

       We owe it to the families and friends of those who died, to members of the police force and the other
       emergency services and to all who believe injustice to ensure—in the Home Secretary's words—


              "that no matter of significance is overlooked and that we do not reach a final conclusion without a full and
              independent examination of the evidence."

       I agree with the right hon. Gentleman on that. I welcome his announcement and will support Lord
       Justice Stuart-Smith in pursuing that important examination.

       I have four specific questions to ask the Home Secretary about his statement. First, given the urgency
       involved—not least for those most affected by those

       Column 27

       terrible events; primarily the families, but also the police officers—what timetable does the right hon.
       Gentleman envisage and can the House have his assurance that the process will begin immediately?

       Secondly, the Home Secretary said that he would make Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's advice to him
       available to the House and the public. Will he also publish all the evidence considered by the lord justice
       on which that advice was based?

       Thirdly, the right hon. Gentleman has said that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will consider any further
       material that interested parties wish to submit. Will such material be examinable in public and will those
       who may be affected by such material be given the opportunity respond to it before the lord justice
       reaches any conclusions?

        Finally, given the sensitivity of this matter and the Home Secretary's constructive attitude, which I hope
        he feels that I have reciprocated, will he undertake to agree with his right hon. Friend the Leader of the
        House that the House can debate this matter further when Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has concluded his
        investigation?

        Positive responses by the right hon. Gentleman to those four questions will help to reassure the families
        that we are genuinely seeking to help.

        Mr. Straw: I thank the right hon. Gentleman for his remarks and for his courtesy. If it is not wholly
        inappropriate, I also congratulate him on his appointment as shadow Home Secretary. I am extremely
        grateful to him for his welcome for these proceedings. This is not and never has been a matter of party
        controversy. As I have said, I know how seriously my predecessor, the right hon. and learned Member
        for Folkestone and Hythe took this matter.

        The right hon. Gentleman asked four questions, the first of which was on the timetable. Lord Justice
        Stuart-Smith has told me that, subject to a case that he is currently hearing in the Court of Appeal being
                                                                                                                            r\n / r v o Jc\n
H ouse of Commons H a n s a . . . f o r 30 Jun 1997   (pt 8 ) h t t p : / / w w w . p a r i l a m e n t   0 / d e b t e x t / 7 0 6 3 0 - 0 8 .htm



       Stuart-Smith has told me that, subject to a case that he is currently hearing in the Court of Appeal being
       concluded as soon as possible, he intends to do some work in respect of the new duties before the end
       of July and to start his proceedings in September. We hope that the matter will be concluded and that
       he will be able to produce his report by the end of the year. However, the House will understand that
       that is a judgment which only Lord Justice Stuart-Smith can make in the light of all the representations
       that he receives.

       Secondly, the right hon. Gentleman asked whether, in addition to publishing the advice that I receive
       from Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, I will publish all the evidence that is considered by him. My answer to
       the right hon. Gentleman is provisional. I shall do my best to ensure that that is the case, but there may
       be good reasons—for example, in respect of criminal or disciplinary proceedings—why such evidence
       cannot be published at the same time as the advice is published. However, if evidence is to be
       unpublished, I shall make that clear at the time.

       Thirdly, the right hon. Gentleman asked whether there can be examination in public and whether the
       families and others would be able to make representations. The answer to the latter part of the question
       is yes. As the House would expect, the exact proceedings of the scrutiny are

       Column 28

       matters for Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to decide and he will base his decision on his long experience as a
       senior member of the judiciary.

       The fourth issue that the right hon. Gentleman raised was whether, when the advice is received, I
       would discuss with my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House the matter of a debate. Of course I
       shall do that.

        Maria Eagle (Liverpool, Garston): I congratulate my right hon. Friend on his statement. I also
        congratulate Granada Television and Jimmy McGovern whose efforts have brought this matter back to
        the attention of the House. Can my right hon. Friend assure the House that the families who have
        fought for so long will have the opportunity of legal representation to enable them to present their
        cases, whether orally or in writing, to the Lord Justice? Will they receive some financial assistance to
        enable them to do that?

        Mr. Straw: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for her remarks and for her welcome for the statement.
        The costs of those who have to travel to appear before the scrutiny will be met by my Department. My
        hon. Friend asks about legal representation. That issue has not been raised by me during my discussions
        with the families. I understand that they already have legal representation. If a further issue arises, I
        shall, of course, consider it.

        Mr. A. J. Beith (Berwick-upon-Tweed): Is the Home Secretary aware that Liberal Democrat
        Members welcome this focused re-examination of the evidence, including recently found evidence, on
        these terrible events, which have been etched into the minds of all the people who saw the television
        coverage at the time and etched dreadfully into the lives of the people who lost family members, but
        will he confirm that it is very unlikely—and perhaps impossible—that police discipline proceedings could
        be reopened as a result of what might be found in the inquiry? Does he recognise that the public find it
        difficult to understand how police discipline proceedings can be brought to a halt when retirement on
        health grounds takes place before the hearing has begun? Given that Lord Taylor's main
        recommendation was that, although there were many factors, the main reason for the disaster was the
        failure of police control, that will leave questions in the public mind, which will pass beyond the inquiry
        into what can be done when conclusions are reached.

        Mr. Straw: I thank the right hon. Gentleman for his welcome for my statement. He asked me to say
        that further police discipline proceedings would be very unlikely. That is to anticipate the view that
of Commons H a n s a . . .f o r 30 Jun 1997   (pt 8 ) h t t p : / / w w w . p a r l i a m e n t ....0 / d e b t e x t / 7 0 6 3 0 - 0 8 .



Lord Justice Stuart-Smith may or may not come to and, with great respect to the right hon. Gentleman,
I shall not do that. He also invites me to make general comments on police discipline regulations. There
may be an occasion to debate the generality of such regulations, but I do not believe that now is the
time.

I say only that the police discipline regulations exist and have been approved from time to time by the
House; they are statutory regulations. It is, of course, open to Secretaries of State and to the House to
change them in the light of circumstances.

Helen Jackson (Sheffield, Hillsborough): I am sure that the Home Secretary realises that the most
tragic

Column 29

trauma of the event was suffered by the families of the Liverpool fans who attended the match, but it
was also one of the most traumatic events in their history for the people of the Hillsborough area of
Sheffield—the links that they have made and maintain with families in Liverpool bear witness to that.
While he considers the evidence that, I believe, he is rightly having another look at, will Lord Justice
Stuart-Smith consider in detail the lessons to be learned both for the communities living around big
football stadiums and for the policing of football matches?

Mr. Straw: I accept entirely what my hon. Friend said: this tragedy went beyond the people directly
affected who were supporters of Liverpool football club and traumatised the people living around
Hillsborough and all the people in Sheffield and in south Yorkshire as well. We should not forget that,
on that day, there were many individual acts of great courage by people from south Yorkshire, by
people in the police, fire and ambulance services and by many other ordinary citizens.

My hon. Friend asked me whether wider lessons, including lessons about the policing of football
matches, can be considered by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith in his scrutiny. The answer to that, I am
afraid, is that we do not anticipate that they can be. The scrutiny will look at new evidence that has
come forward since the earlier inquiries, to find out whether that evidence is sufficiently significant to
trigger either a new public inquiry, ordered by myself, or action by the Attorney-General, the Director
of Public Prosecutions or the chief officer of South Yorkshire police. I do not believe that, at any stage
since the late Lord Justice Taylor reported, there has been any criticism of his wider recommendations,
most of which have been implemented, on the policing of football matches and on crowd control.

Mr. Tony Baldry (Banbury): I am sure that no hon. Member would challenge the judgment that the
Home Secretary has come to today, but will he confirm that, in his statement, he said that, on the
evidence submitted to her, the Director of Public Prosecutions had concluded that nothing justified
fresh criminal investigations? Could he give two undertakings to the House: that, in due course, Lord
Justice Stuart-Smith will make it clear what new evidence he is considering that was not available to
the Director of Public Prosecutions in making that judgment, and why that evidence was not available
earlier?

       Mr. Straw: I can confirm exactly what the hon. Gentleman says. I said that the Director of Public
       Prosecutions has taken the view that the material so far presented to her would not justify fresh
       criminal investigations. I also referred to a judgment made by the former Attorney-General, the right
       hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Sir N. Lyell), but I ought to make it clear that,
       as I understand it—as I am informed—he based that judgment on information other than that which
       arose following the television programme screened last December.

        It is in the nature of asking a senior and highly respected judge of the Court of Appeal to look at all the
        fresh allegations and the fresh evidence that he may come to a different view from that which the
        Director of Public Prosecutions has so far come to on the evidence that she

        Column 30

        has available. That is not in any sense to imply any criticism of the work of the Director of Public
        Prosecutions or the Crown Prosecution Service.

        Mr. Andrew Miller (Ellesmere Port and Neston): On behalf of constituents of mine who were so
        tragically affected by this event, may I ask my right hon. Friend whether the fresh inquiry will bring
        about some consideration of the way in which the coroner's court conducted its affairs during the
        inquiries immediately after the deaths? Does it constitute the possibility of fresh evidence—evidence that
        should have perhaps come to the coroner's court earlier—now becoming more widely available?

        Mr. Straw: There has been continuing concern about the way in which inquests generally are
        conducted. There was a working party report into large-scale disasters and inquests, which
        recommended significant changes, including a change whereby if there were, God forbid, a disaster of a
        similar scale and nature in the future, there would be one inquiry similar to that conducted by the late
        Lord Justice Taylor, which would be the general public inquiry and also take the form of an inquest, so
        that the relatives would be spared going through the agony caused by two separate inquiries.

        The issue of the way in which the first inquest was conducted was the subject of great consideration by
        the divisional court when there were proceedings for judicial review. It is a matter for Lord Justice
        Stuart-Smith, but I expect that he will not wish to go over that ground but will instead, as part of his
        scrutiny, wish to consider with great care the new allegations of evidence not put before the
        inquest—especially, as the House is well aware, arguments about the time of death which, in the view of
        the relatives and programme makers, the inquest was not properly able to take into account.

        Mr. Nicholas Soames (Mid-Sussex): I warmly welcome the right hon. Gentleman's statement and the
        measured and sensitive way in which he outlined his plans. I take the point about the issue of police
        discipline in respect of this inquiry, but will he nevertheless undertake to consider a re-examination—not
        necessarily in the light of these events, but more generally—of the police disciplinary code, which
        provides that once an officer has retired, any matters under investigation lapse? Does he agree that that
        should be reconsidered, and will he undertake to do so?

        Mr. Straw: Yes, without reference to this particular case, I accept that many members of the public
        regard it as odd that when an officer retires, that is the end of all disciplinary processes. However, one
        of the things on which I am currently taking advice is the fact that, as I understand it, regulations
        expect chief officers not to permit the retirement of officers on grounds of ill health where disciplinary
        proceedings are still pending. There is, therefore, an issue not only of whether disciplinary regulations
        should be changed, but of whether chief officers of police are properly fulfilling the terms of existing


                                                                                                                   m   tr\n / a n   i r\ . n o . g o

        regulations. Both of these matters are subjects that I wish to investigate.

       Ms Louise Ellman (Liverpool, Riverside): I welcome the Home Secretary's statement in that it opens
       up the

        Column 31

        possibility of justice for the families whose lives have been so cruelly devastated. Is my right hon.
        Friend able to assure the House that while the inevitable legal considerations take place, he will keep in
        mind the prime consideration of the feelings of the families involved and their belief that they have been
        denied justice, in that information was not brought forward at the appropriate time?

        Mr. Straw: Of course I give that assurance to my hon. Friend. I made the decision to ask Lord Justice
        Stuart-Smith to conduct further scrutiny because I felt that there was fresh evidence that required
        proper and independent examination. In reaching that decision, of course I took full account of the
        profound distress and grief felt by relatives of those who lost their lives. As I said in my statement,
        those feelings have been compounded by a belief that some aspects of the tragedy—its causes and the
        culpability of those whose actions may or may not have led to the tragedy—have not been fully
        examined.

        Mr. Damian Green (Ashford): I am sure that the Home Secretary will be aware that although the
        events of that day were particularly traumatic for the people of Liverpool and of Sheffield, they were
        traumatic also for football fans across the country. He will also be aware that, in the past 12 months,
        after years in which incidents of hooliganism at and around football matches was declining, there have
        been worrying signs that hooliganism is beginning to increase. In the light of his answer to the hon.
        Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Helen Jackson) that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will not be able to
        consider the wider issues arising from the Hillsborough tragedy, will he tell us whether,
        ultimately—should the incident be examined by a public inquiry—a public inquiry will be able to consider
        the wider issues of crowd control and policing at football matches?

        Mr. Straw: For well over the past 10 years, I have taken my children to football matches. The hon.
        Gentleman is right to say that, since implementation of Lord Taylor's recommendations, there has been
        profound improvement in football fans' behaviour at and around football grounds. The
        recommendations have led also to significant improvements in policing football matches. Now—as we
        saw during Euro 96—it is a pleasure to take anyone, including one's children, to football matches. Ten
        years ago, as I know for certain, it was often a frightening experience. I have received no
        representations that there need to be changes in the criminal law to deal with crowd control at football
        matches, although I will consider any such representations that might be made.

        I should make it clear that the purpose of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's scrutiny will be to consider the
        fresh evidence that has become available on the Hillsborough tragedy I cannot anticipate the full terms
        of reference of any full public inquiry that I may establish. As I said earlier in answer to my hon.
        Friends, however, what is clear and beyond peradventure is that no one has criticised Lord Taylor or
        the way in which he conducted his inquiry, particularly on crowd control at football matches.

        Mr. Edward O'Hara (Knowsley, South): May I again express my condolences to the Hillsborough
        families?

         Column 32

         Those of us from Merseyside know that, to this day, the nerves are still raw and the pain is still tangible
         when Hillsborough and Leppards lane are mentioned. I should therefore like to associate myself with
         the remarks made by my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Ms Ellman) that, in the
         previous inquiry, the feelings of Hillsborough families were shamefully neglected.

                                                                                                                         m   /no ) m     i n . m   .c o

       May I pursue that point and ask my right hon. Friend whether Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's terms of
       reference will extend to consideration of past and possible future governmental support for those
       families? Although very strong support was provided—particularly locally, but also nationally—to those
       families in their grief, the amount of Government support was pitiful. Will the Lord Justice's terms of
       reference extend also to examining certain newspapers' disgraceful accusations about the behaviour of
       fans who were killed, at a time when their families were feeling such pain?

       Mr. Straw: I understand entirely the feelings of my hon. Friend, expressed on behalf of his
       constituents. He asked me whether the terms of reference extend to future Government support to the
       families. They do not. With great respect to my hon. Friend, I make no apologies for that. The scrutiny
       by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith is to ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the
       Hillsborough stadium that was not available to the Taylor inquiry, the inquest, the Director of Public
       Prosecutions in respect of criminal prosecutions or the chief officer of the South Yorkshire police. As
       has been said, it is a focused scrutiny, led by someone who is senior and respected on the Court of
       Appeal bench to carry out a specific task that I believe the families have asked us to do.

       Mr. Ronnie Fearn (Southport): I welcome the statement as a Merseyside Member, at the end of a
       line that connects most supporters of Liverpool football club. From what I remember—I was in the
       House at the time-many people said that they had recollections of what happened, but never came
       forward because they were terrified to give evidence. Can we make an appeal—from the House or
       through the lord justice—to ordinary people and ask them to stretch their memories once more and, if
       they were frightened to do so at the time, to come forward now with any new evidence? That is a
       crucial part of the procedure.

       Mr. Straw: If there are any individuals who have material evidence that was not produced at the
       inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor, at the inquest or in relation to the police disciplinary
       investigation by West Midlands Police, I appeal to them to come forward.

       I did not properly answer the second part of the question from my hon. Friend the Member for
       Knowsley, South (Mr. O'Hara) in relation to allegations by newspapers. Although I shall not go into
       that, let me make it quite clear that Lord Taylor's report dismissed entirely the allegations made by
       certain newspapers and clearly came to the view that the principal reason for the disaster was the failure
       of police control. I hope that remains a matter of reassurance for the families.

       Mr. Joe Ashton (Bassetlaw): I declare an interest as a director of Sheffield Wednesday football club
       and an eye witness to the event who was no more than 50 yd away

        Column 33

        before and after the game. The only other hon. Member who was an eye witness was Eddie Loyden,
        who has since left the House. Sheffield Wednesday football club has the deepest sympathy with the
        victims and will be happy to co-operate in any way with the inquiry.

        I have two questions for my right hon. Friend. First, will the evidence be given on oath? There is a
        great interest in that. Secondly, he will recall that the previous inquiry cost some £250,000, excluding
        compensation. Will the Government pay for the inquiry and refund all the expenses to the parties
        concerned, including the witnesses and relatives of the victims? Will it be possible to reopen the matter
        of compensation? Can he give us some information about that?

        Mr. Straw: I am very grateful to my hon. Friend, especially given his position as a director of Sheffield
        Wednesday football club. He asked whether evidence before the scrutiny by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith
        will be given on oath. We are not planning that that should be the case. If Lord Justice Stuart-Smith
        considers that he has inadequate powers to conduct the scrutiny, I shall actively consider any such
        representations from him, but I do not expect that it will be a problem, given the nature of the scrutiny
        that we are asking him to undertake in respect of the new evidence.

        My hon. Friend asked whether the Government will pay the costs of the inquiry. We shall certainly pay
        for the cost of the inquiry itself and will refund the travelling and incidental expenses of those who
        appear before it to make representations. I dealt with the issue of legal representation, which is a much
        wider issue. So far, I have had no calls for legal aid. That would involve some large decisions to which
        I cannot commit myself. With respect to my hon. Friend, the issue of compensation for trauma suffered
        does not arise as a result of this scrutiny.

        Mr. Dennis Skinner (Bolsover): Does my right hon. Friend recall that, a short time before the general
        election, traumatised policemen were awarded substantial sums because they had witnessed the horrific
        events? It is well known that many of the Liverpool families of the victims have not received anything. I
        take it, from his answer today, that compensation will not be dealt with by the inquiry. Will he give a
        guarantee that if the results of the inquiry lean in the direction that many of us hope for, consequential
        payments could be made to those Liverpool families?

        Mr. Straw: The issue of some police officers receiving compensation while some of those who were
        on the terraces have not is not a matter for this scrutiny—not because it is unimportant, but because it is
        not directly related to the need for the scrutiny, which is to examine allegations of new material


                                                                                                                  m   /no I an   in.na-lfi

      evidence. If that new material evidence is found to exist, it should trigger a new public inquiry or action
      by the Attorney-General, the Director of Public Prosecutions or the chief officer of the police. I fully
      understand the concerns that have been expressed by hon. Members on both sides of the House about
      the payment of compensation to police officers and its unavailability to others who were there. The
      issue could be raised in the debate that I promised to discuss with my right hon. Friend the Leader of
      the House in response to the shadow Home Secretary.

      Mr. Mike Hall (Weaver Vale): I represent a number of families who lost loved ones in the
      Hillsborough

      Column 34

      disaster and a number of people who were severely injured there. I am sure that the Hillsborough
      families support group will welcome the independent review of the evidence. Will that review look at
      the events that took place between 3.15 and 5.30 pm? The issue is very important for many of my
      constituents. I hope that what my right hon. Friend has announced today will lead to a full public
      inquiry.

      Mr. Straw: The answer to my hon. Friend's first question is an unequivocal yes. One of the major
      issues raised by the Granada Television programme and by the families support group is the time of
      death—whether it was 3.15 for all those who died or whether it was later for some. Lord Justice
      Stuart-Smith will examine that critical issue.

                                                 Points of Order

      4.26 pm                        N.

      Mr. Michael Ancram (Devizes)rOn a point of order, Madam Speaker. With reference to the point of
      order raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) on Friday, have you had time
      to complete your consideration of the letter that he sent you about the behaviour of the Secretary of
      State for Wales and its implications for tne rights of Members of this House?

      In particular, as the further public utterances\*f the Secretary of State and the hon. Member for
      Blaenau Gwent (Mr. Smith) are so contradictofv that they cannot both be telling the truth and given the
      Prime Minister's categorical assurances to the Hoi^se last Wednesday, is it not paramount for the
      reputation of the House and the rights of its membere that the Secretary of State for Wales should
      make a personal statement to the House at the earlieXopportunity?

      Madam Speaker: I have now seen the letter written to r^e by the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr.
      Evans). As the House will understand, I do not divulge deM s of correspondence between myself and
      individual Members. I have responded to him today. I have n» comment about the particular case that
      the right hon. Gentleman has raised, as the full facts are not aviab le to me. As a matter of principle,
      however, I say clearly that freedom of speech is one of the most\herished privileges of parliamentary
      democracy. I expect Members to exercise that fundamental right a^all times to the fullest extent.

       Mr. Simon Hughes (Southwark, North and Bermondsey): On a pomt of order, Madam Speaker. Is
       it appropriate to ask you, about half an hour before the end of British rule in Hong Kong, to express on
       behalf of the House two thoughts that are probably strongly in the minds Vail Members of
       Parliament—those who have been privileged to go to Hong Kong and those\^ho have not? First, very
       simply, will you pay tribute to all those who served the Crown and the peopl^of Hong Kong during the
       past century and a half, including those in the legislative council? Secondly, willwou express the hope
       of this Parliament that the democracy that has been cultivated in Hong Kong willN^e able to continue
       from midnight tonight throughout the years ahead?                                    \

necessary adjourn the hearing to consider what action is appropriate as a
result.

CONCLUSION OF HEARING

10.26   As soon as possible after the conclusion of the hearing the tribunal
should submit a report to the police authority, together with the transcript of
the hearing, giving their recommendation on finding and punishment. It is he
view of the Secretary of State that the police authority should as a matter of
course regard the report of the tribunal as binding on them as to finding but
that, where the finding is one,of guilt, it is within their discretion to accept
or reject the recommendation as to punishment.

10.27   If a punishment is imposed by the police authority the accu®?<|
should be informed that he has the right of appeal against both finding and
punishment to the Secretary of State.      If he indicates tha.t h®
appeal, a copy of the transcript of the hearing should be supplied to him.

Thank you for your letter of 7 July 1997 to Mike Hedges on the above topic.

As discussed on the telephone on 10 July, the Chief Constable has asked me to lead on
this topic for him. We will be assembling a small team of staff to deal with this “scrutiny” (I
am told that this is the word we must use).

I have read the cutting from the Daily Mail. Like you, I am confident that the writer is
mistaken when he says that lies were told about the video footage. The Chief has written
to a number of newspapers to correct inaccuracies but I fear that it is too late to write to the
Mail.

Thank you for your offer to be available if needed. I will bear it in mind and may well call
you in due course.

       NEW HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

       I write to you Mike as I have lost track of whom might be overseeing the issues arising
       from the Hillsborough Disaster. Perhaps you will forward my note to whoever has this
       responsibility.

       I was sorry to see that the new Home Secretary has raised hopes and expectations by
       calling for a new inquiry. Nevertheless, I hope that it does, in the words of Jack Straw,
       “settle things once and for all”.

       I was particularly intrigued by a reference in the Daily Mail dated 27 June. Please see
       paragraph four of the cutting attached. “There is equally no doubt that lies concerning the
       existence of video footage of one part of the disaster were told to the original inquiry”.
       Aside from the tortured grammar of this sentence, I do not understand the reference. In
       particular, my recollection of the Taylor Inquiry is such that I would feel confident in
       rejecting the assertion of the paragraph.

       I know that most of the people that were engaged on the Inquiry within South Yorkshire
       have now retired. If the person who is going to respond to the new inquiry would wish to
       speak with me about any issue arising from the 1989 investigations, I should be happy to
       help.

                   tC —

events at th at tragic FA Cup

manner always commensurate
with their professional training.
       re is equally no doubt th at
lies concerning the existence of
video footage of one part of the

former Lord Chief Justice, Lord I

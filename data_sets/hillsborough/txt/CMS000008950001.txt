Dear

Thank you for your recent letter to Mr Moynihan
which have been passed to this department in view of our
responsibilities for the Safety of Sports Grounds Act.   I
apologise for the delay in replying to you.


Your view that all seated accommodation at football grounds
will not solve the problems of crowd safety and control has
been noted.  However, it is a view which the government does
not share and which does not equate with the views expressed
by Lord Justice Taylor in his Final Report on the Hillsborough
Stadium disaster.   He recognised that there was no single
solution to achieve total safety and cure all the problems of
crowd control.  However, he was satisfied that seating does
more to achieve these objectives than any other single
measure.  Furthermore this is in line with the policies of
both FIFA and UEFA.

                                                          Yours sincerely

 Detective   Inspector.



 Spys:


 Approximately 11.10am on Thursday 8th J^ne, 1989 as a result of
 Detective Inspector G^nn saying said to me I watched a complilation tape
 of the H llsborough event.     The tape was number MRE      2/r and at a
 point ma. ked 1200 on the tape which came up on the screen, the scene showec
 Leppings Lane turnstile and a crowd situation crushing to g:t through
 the turnstiles.    When the view moved across to the other side of the
 xaaui area showing a group of fans not taking part in the efforts to get
 into the turnstile two different voices were heard Both voices were of
 a Liverpool accent and the voice giving instructions about getting in at
 a turnstile appeared to be giving instructions than making a comment and
 he also appeared to be talking to a group of persons and giving them
 specific instructions as opposed to advising them.

 The video then panned to another area.

 The footage concerned ran for approximately 1200 to 1216.

 I caused the tape to be taken to the TechMcal Support Unit based at the
 West Yorkshire Police Metropolian Headquarters where a voice recording
 was obtained on a cassette tape.

 I have since iisrk played and listened to this tape on a number of occasions:
 and the following conversation can be heard.

1st man       'That’s alright, we’ve just got here1
2nd man       Them coppers don't know what’s fucking going on '.
1st BBan.     ’We've got to get in there, at the turnst les, we’ve   got to
               get in there ’.
Th re are also several unintelligable voices.

so    I de cl in ed the offer.

I s t r e s s e d the     point to Ken C AS T L E Y that                                          w o u l d only

All                                identity       cards and because              they were going          to the

match    in a n o n- wo rk in g         capacity,      no      i n st ru ct io ns were g iven as to the

w ea ri ng    of jackets,         tabbards,       etc.

During       the   following week           I did speak          to K en C A S T L E Y    by t e le ph on e   to

a rr an ge a me et in g      point at        his g ro un d a nd a time and                I told him that

A m b e r l i n e Coaches,     having b ooked toget he r                some    f/riends a seat on the

coach.        We   t rave lied along         the M 6 S , M 1 .         We s t /p p e d at a pub c a l 1ed

the T r a v e l l e r s Rest      for    lunch at about           12.30^.       1230.      We s ta ye d at the

pub for about            one a nd a half         hours        before    ilasumi ng the j ou r ne y w h i ch

took about 20 mins             to the ground.               We were      d ro p pe d off     in L e p p i ng s Ln

at a bout 2. 2 0 p m       1420.        We w al ke d up to the           ground.         There were quite

a few    people         outside    the ground but              there were       o rd er ly queu es and

there were         no    problems.        We joine d the queue and went                    t hr o ug h the

t urn st il es w i t h i n minutes.            I have         been to this       g round before a nd knew

where    I had to go and            I made my way to the N o r t h S ta nd quite                     easily.

      There were no ofy/ious problems                    that     I saw at this           time.        I found my
      h i o ojzvr « r r
      seat w it h no p r o b l e m at all.

      T here was      trie usual      pre -m at ch      c on v er s at i on s    b e tw ee n the     people a r ou n d

      me.      At about 2.3 3 p m       1435 w he n the         players were            having a w a r m up knock

      a bout    I noticed how the m iddle                s ec ti o n/ o f    the terraces at the L e pp in gs

      Ln end of the ground a p p e a r e d             to be/full.              T here was      no free m ov e me n t

      of    people    in that a re a but what was more                      obvi ou s    to me was        that the

      wing     s ection of the terraces were                  r e l at i ve l y empty.

      In my own m ind          I felt     that    the end s e ct io ns w o u l d start to fill as the

      start     of the game        came    closer.         I d i d n ’t pay any         p articular a t t e n t i o n

      to that     end of the g ro un d a ny more               until     after         kick o f t i m e       when      I

 •      o r r
      saw someone
                     fiwo                     h
                         climb over the fencing and come onto                            the /pitch.          N ot h in g

      had h a p p en ed on the        field of         play to     cause any           pitori inva si on w h ic h

      caused me to realise              that s omethi ng was w rong                in the       c e nt r a l v t e r r a c ing

      area.      I st ar te d to      pay more a t t e n t i o n       to that amd of the g ro un d and                          I

      saw more and more            people      climbing       up and over          the    fencing.          The game

      was s t o p p e d and the       players        left the field.              Scor es      of people         came

      onto     the   pitch.       Some were       very d i s t r e s s e d and some were
                                                                                                        /
                                                                                                       We i ng   h el pe d

      out of the        terraces.         It was s ho r tl y after              this    that    I Realised          people

CAT   were dead w he n        I saw fans,        P olice and St J ohns                 p eople/car ryi ng bodies

      o n makeshift          stretchers.         The    bodies had their               face/    covered over.
      ----------------------------
       T he re was a lot of c onfusion on the                    pitch and even thou gh                  I w o u l d have

      liked to have gone            onto    the      pitch to give any a s s i st a nc e               I could,         I

      felt     it was    best to      let the ones a l r e a d y on the                 pitch    carry on as more

      people w o u l d only add to the                 confusion.

      There was       no c o -o r d i na t i o n b et we en the Police,                St Johns and fans as

      they a t t e m p t e d to    rescue      the     people    from the         central       terrace area,

      they were all acting              on their own          initiative.              It w asn't      until      the

      Fire B ri ga de a r r i v e d     that     there was a ny a s s e m b l a n c e          of order and

      o r ga ni sa ti on .     I feel     that once this           p ro bl em had s ta rt ed there was                      no

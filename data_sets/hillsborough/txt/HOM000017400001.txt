I am writing to inform you that the NATIONAL UNION OF PUBLIC EMPLOYEES
would wish to give evidence, to the Inquiry into the Sheffield Football                                    ^
Disaster.

The NATIONAL UNION OF PUBLIC EMPLOYEES is the major union for ambulance
staff in this cbijntry and members of.ours employed in the ambulance
service attended the tragedy. They would like to give evidence to the
Inquiry about their experiences that Saturday afternoon and express
our criticisms at the manner in which ambulance cover is given at large
sporting events.

It is our view that extended trained ambulance crews with vehicles and
equipment including defibrillators should be on hand at such events and
that lives would probably have been saved had they been on duty that
afternoon. Additionally, all large sports stadia should consult with their
local ambulance services about accident and emergency arrangements.

We would appreciate hearing from you about the arrangements to be made.

Yowffsjsincerely,

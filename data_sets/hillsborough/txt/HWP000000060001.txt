To the Chairman, Councillor Harry Chase.



          As requested, I am sending you some b rie f notes r e la tiv e to the v i s i t
to Hillsborough by the Working Party on Friday, 19th May, 1989. These notes
are purely,my own personal observations and in no way represent the o f f i c i a l
view of the City Engineer's Department since the Department's only input
with respect to Football Ground Areas is in the making of T raffic Regulation
Orders to a s s i s t residents in t h e i r parking problems and ensure reasonably
free t r a f f i c flow. The Police deal with all aspects of crowd control and
t r a f f i c control on the public highway during match times.


      My observations are those of a person who does not attend football matches
and, therefo re, will view the situ a tio n from a d iffe re n t angle. Since the
majority of the time, during the v i s i t , was spent at the ground, my observations
are r e s t r i c te d to th is area which, of course, is the City Building Surveyor's
domain, but I am sure Mr. Bush will not take exception to me making my comments
more or less from a layman's point of view.

     My comments are as follows:-


1.   During discussions on the coach, you quoted figures for the numbers of
     t ic k e ts issued, capacity allocated to Liverpool fans, number of t u r n s t i l e s
     availab le, and Mr. Bush advised on t u r n s t i l e c a p a c itie s. I t would appear
     t h a t th e o re tic a lly i t would take some 3 | hours to get the Liverpool fans
     into the ground. I f the figures and calculations are c o rre c t, then c le a rly
     3 | hours is an unacceptable length of time and i t would, th e re fo re , appear
                                                                                                ';.W:
     th a t th ere were very serious problems th a t would have been apparent a t
     the planning stage. I would have thought th a t 1| hours would be a more
     r e a l i s t i c figure to work to and t h a t i f t h i s was not achievable, then the
     question should be asked was Hillsborough the correct choice of ground
     fo r such an event?


                                                / continued..........
Moving into the ground I f i r s t examined the "anti-surge" barriers and
found th a t t h e i r height measurement to the top of the r a i l s varied
between 36|" to 4 8 |". The 34 steps in the terrace were approximately 3"
high and in at le a s t one location, the b a rrie rs were so close to the
next step th a t t h e i r e ffe c tiv e height was reduced by 3". My height
i s 5'8" and the location of the' Barriers on my body varied between the
lowest part of the trunk and the mid-chest position. The e ffe c t of these
b a rrie rs under pressure I thought may cause one to topple over or s lip
under. I would have thought t h a t t h e i r height should have been more
co n sisten t, probably at the higher level with a second r a i l at the
mid-position. Most of the r a i l s were of 2|" diameter tube which would
exert a g reater pressure on the body than the rearmost r a i l s which were
of a f l a t cross section and would consequently be less harmful.

I next examined the gates leading from the terra ce s to the pitch. These
gates a ll opened outwards towards the pitch and were controlled by a heavily
constructed latch mechanism containing a powerful spring. This mechanism
could only be operated from the pitch side. Additionally, they were
fu rth e r secured by a su b stan tial chain and padlock.      Their width varied
between 29" to 37" (bear in mind the standard width of a door in a house is
30") and there was some v a ria tio n in t h e i r "effective" height. More
importantly was the d i f f i c u l t y of using some of the gates caused by the
f a c t t h a t the pitch perimeter wall had only been partly cut away for the
gates and in some cases had not been cut away at a l l .
S tarting with the gate on the northwest terra c e to the Leppings Lane side
enclosure and working round to the gate next to the Police control box,
the s itu a tio n i s as follow s:-
The concrete perimeter wall had not been cut away which meant you had to
negotiate i t s f u l l length of 39" from the te rra c e with a drop of 31" to
the pitch side. Although the height of the gate was 84", the e ffe c tiv e
opening was only 70" due to the gate overlapping the wall. Above the
gate opening was a 12" section of mesh angled at 45° towards the terra c e
and spiked which tranversed the fu ll length of the pens.
The next gate which was only 29" wide required a threshold height
of 18|" to be cleared.
The th ir d gate was for Police use and was situated between fences 741"
apart, spanning between the perimeter fence and the rear of the pens
 (.there were gates at the rear, allowing Police ae.cess. t a the. adjacent
pens). The width of the gate was 33" but in th is case, wooden steps
were provided reducing the threshold height to 13".
The fourth gate was 33" wide with a 6|" concrete step upto a
threshold height of 9".
The f i f t h gate was 37" wide but in addition to the concrete perimeter
wall, which was 44|" high, an additional mesh panel was fixed giving
a to ta l threshold height of 48i".
The sixth gate next to the Police box was 30" wide with a hreshold
height of 12".
There does not appear to be any lorjical reason for the v ariation in
threshold heights, but quite obviously t h i s would have a dramatic e ffe c t
in t h e i r usefulness in emergency.    These gates contrast sharply with
those at the Kop end which had r e l a ti v e ly easy access with one step up.
(Widths varied between 29§" - 43").
I am not clear as to the purpose of these gates. Were they ever intended
to be used in an emergency to allow fans onto the pitch?          I f not, then
th ere was c le a rly no escape from the pens. I f they were for emergency
use, then why seriously reduce t h e i r capacity.with threshold obstructions
and p ra c tic a lly render them useless in two locations. Additionally, why
chain and padlock them which only causes fu rth e r delay in t h e i r use in
an emergency. The only reason I can see fo r locking them is in the event
of a pitch invasion, fans may attempt to open these gates from the pitch
side, thus causing more trouble.
I suspect th a t they were never intended fo r emergency use, but only to
be used fo r Police purposes or to remove someone taken i l l . In any
case, t h e i r design would hamper these a c t i v i t i e s .

                                                    / continued.......

    I t would appear to me t h a t in all buildings where the public are
    admitted such as th e a tre s , Public Houses, h o sp itals, o ffic e s , m ulti­
    storey car parks, e t c . , e t c . , adequate emergency e x its must be
    provided and properly signed, but none of t h i s , i t seems, applies
^ > to -fo o tb all grounds. I c'aYi lonly assume th a t to p r o v i d e ' ^
    f a c i l i t i e s would weaken the "defences" and make i t e a sie r to get in
    without paying and reduce the effectiveness of the segregation of rival
    fans. There appears to be double standards, safety f a c i l i t i e s are
    provided when i t i s r e l a ti v e ly easy to do so, but not when they a ffe c t
    law and order and the "nuisance" value of matches being disrupted.

   I next moved outside the ground to view the arrangements fo r gaining access
  at the Leppings Lane end.
  There were no physical means such as b a rrie rs to segregate queues to
  the t u r n s t i l e s so t h i s would depend e n tir e ly on Police con tro l. I t is
  understandable t h a t as kick o ff time approached and many fans were
  s t i l l outside, order would eventually break down and increased pressure
  would be put on the perimeter wall by fans desperate to get in. I
  understand th a t at t h i s point, the Police were concerned t h a t fans would
  be crushed against t h i s w all. I t i s apparent now t h a t the wall has
  become unstable (as evidenced by the fac t th a t i t i s now shored
  up on the inside) and the w all, i t s e l f , may have come down on fans. I
  would, therefo re, suggest t h a t such walls adjacent to t u r n s t i l e s should
  be constructed as reta in in g walls to reduce any p o s s ib i l i ty of t h e i r
   collapse.
   When fans had passed through the         t u r n s t i l e s , there did not appear to
   be any method whereby they could be evenly d istrib u te d to the groups of
   pens situ ate d e ith e r side of the Police access "corridor".              Maybe
   t h i s was intended to work by means of t ic k e t numbers but c le a rly i t
   f a ile d .

                                            / continued......
I f i n a l l y moved to the t u r n s t i l e s at the Kop end which are situated
adjacent to a very busy and f a s t dual carriageway and separated from
i t by a footway in the region of 4m wide (I did not measure i t ) .
There were no pedestrian guardrails and I would consider t h i s is a very
hazardous situ a tio n with a large concentration of fans so close to
f a s t moving t r a f f i c . aPre&0WTafr1y -thiS-is why only some of the
t u r n s t i l e s were in use on the day.
To provide more space in fro nt of the t u r n s t il e s would require the
temporary closure of one carriageway of the dual carriageway. In
my opinion i t would not be fea sib le to operate a contra-flow system
due to the number of t r a f f i c signals and pelican crossings, apart from
the inherent potential accident problems associated with these schemes.
I t would be safer to d iv ert the t r a f f i c to another route, but given
the volumes concerned, i t i s most unlikely th at any other route would
be s u ita b le . I f the carriageway adjacent to the ground was reduced
to one lane, t h i s would provide some additional space but for safety,
timber baulks would need to be used to protect pedestrians. This would
not be practical fo r the r e l a ti v e ly short duration of time required
for the r e s t r i c t i o n . I f any reduction in capacity was made to the dual
carriageway, I think i t would create t r a f f i c jams. Normally when such
closures are made fo r say sewer works, they l a s t for days or weeks not
hours and t r a f f i c has a chance to re d is tr ib u te i t s e l f . I t i s unlikely
th a t the general public would accept the t r a f f i c chaos caused by such
closures fo r reasons of entertainment and not essential road works.

STATEMENT TO THE PUBLIC MEETING ON THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

FROM CLLR. HARRY CHASE, CHAIR - HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER WORKING PARTY


1.   This meeting welcomes both the City Councils Hillsborough-initiatives and
     the work of the F.S.A in their submissions to Lord Chief Justice Taylors
     Inquiry

2.   We recognise the need to take-up those issues already identified with
     Hillsborough recognising.that the events of April 15th were neither a
     tragedy parochial to Liverpool nor a set of events which happened in
     isolation.    Therefore we need to look beyond the immediate tragedy to the
     issues of spectator safety and facilities; the threat to civil liberties
     inherent i n t h e I.D. schemes; and the involvement of supporters in effecting
     change within the football industry.

3.   We condemn the media coverage of Hillsborough and its aftermath which
     portrayed the city of Liverpool and its football supporters as the
     perpetrators of the tragedy which took place.  We call on the Hillsborough
     Disaster Working Party to investigate and contest such smears and vindicate
     the heroic role of fans in the life-saving evacuation of Hillsborough.

4.   We are determined to effectively involve football supporters in resolving
     the problems they have long-highlighted.  For too long we have, as
     supporters tolerated the entrenched dictates of clubs^ and administrators,
     and the blind prejudices of Governments.

5.   The inertia of the F.A in the wake of both Hillsborough and the Government's
     proposed I.D. scheme bears testament to a body which neither recognises
     nor understands the concern and protestations of fans.

6.   We call for a full independent investigation into the administration and
     financing of football to expose the greed and mismanagement that permeates
     the professional game.

7.   We urge all football fans to co-operate with the work of the City Council
     and the F.b.A in their efforts to ensure that those responsible for
     Hillsborough are exposed and brought to justice and that football'j future
     is secured through meaningful representation of supporters within the
     football industry.

  CHARGES FOR POLICING FOOTBALL MATCHES IN LONDON


  This submission seeks Ministers'            agreement to the revision of the

  DOErM S S -fr P°liCing f°0tba11 "at°heS in LOnd°n - » s“99ss^ that
  imoli t        f      bS alSrted t0 ttS Changes- 9lve" the financial
  implications for football clubs, the sensitivity of the issue
  the Foot! T   H 1 U s b °r°u9h ai^ster, and the probable enactment of
  the Football Spectators Bill.

  Background

  2.   The    view     of    successive   governments               has    been     that,         in

              thS* f U U °°StS ° f ea°h ° ffiCSr          inside a
  football ground should be charged for.   m practice, however, the

  o u t s l d f t h 1 f U U ,°°StS 1S n0t alWayS P0ssible'   on duty
  outside the ground, for the purposes of crowd and traffic control
 are regarded as performing proper police duties, and the oost is
 itiet from p o l i c e f u n d s .


  •    Although      these   principles   seem    to       be        generally observed
 throughout the country, the amount charged is at the discretion of
             ce authority, as laid down by the Police Act 1964.

 Metropolitan Police Arranaemgn-hg
 4.    The present agreement for charging at London football matches

  n
  7 rh: LbydM1T ers' was reachea betwsenths
 and the London football clubs in 1984 and introduced at the start
                                                                                          PdL;
E.R.
   of    the   1984/85   season.     Under the arrangement,          the Metropolitan
   Police and each club agree on the number of officers to be deployed
   inside the ground at a "normal" match, and the increased number to
   be provided at "problem" matches.            The charge is then calculated on
   the basis that each officer is employed for 3 hours at the standard
   rate, with an additional charge levied for overheads.                   No charge is
   made for travelling time,             or for the fact that many officers are
   employed on overtime.


   Review of the Present Arrangement«
   5.     The Metropolitan Police have reviewed their charging policy,
   and concluded that the clubs are being undercharged.                    The primary
   causes of this undercharging are:


          i.    in practice, more officers are having to be deployed
                inside the grounds than the agreements with clubs
                stipulate;


        ii.     in practice, officers are working more than the standard
                3 hours inside the ground;


        in.     travelling time, for which officers are paid, is not
                included in the charge;


        vi.     officers at football matches are often employed on over­
                time.


  6.     The Metropolitan Police have estimated that these factors lead
  to a shortfall in revenue of about £l.lm.                This is almost exactly
  the sum charged to London clubs at the moment, so full recovery of
  costs would double the charges to clubs.

  New Charging Proposals
  7.     The Metropolitan Police propose that from the 1989/90 season,
  the force should base            its    charges   for   policing    of    individual
  football matches on:
         a.    the actual number of officers deployed on duties inside
               the ground (to be agreed in advance with club officials);
               and
E.R.

          b.       an estimate of the actual number of hours required for
                   those duties (the estimate for each type of game to be
                   agreed in advance with           club   officials),    subject       to    a
                   minimum of 3 hours;


   In addition, but not to be introduced until the 1990/91 season:


          c.       the charge for each officer to be increased by a further
                   one hour in order to achieve at least partial recovery
                   of the cost of travelling time.


   8.     The changes in charges proposed for the 1989/90 season simply
   represent an adjustment to reflect changes in practice: they do not
  amend      the   practice     agreed     in   1984.   The proposal     to     include a
  charge for travelling time from next year is, however, a departure
  from agreed practice, since a decision was taken in 1984 not to
  charge for travelling time.


  9.     The Metropolitan Police have rejected the notion of trying to
  charge clubs           for overtime.      since it could be argued that,              with
   rastic alterations to police rotas, it would be possible to police
  most football matches without any overtime being incurred, the Met.
  have concluded that it is not worth taking the clubs on on this



  10.    Annex A gives details of the actual                charges     levied on each
  London club for the 1987/88 season and, for comparison, an estimate
  of    what       the     charges   would       have   been    under    the    proposed
  arrangements.           it will be seen that almost every club would suffer
  a substantial increase in charges, ranging                    from   15% to    247%    in
  1989/90, and between 32% and 334% in 1990/91.


  11.   we     understand     that   the    football    clubs   are aware that very
  substantial       increases are in the pipeline.              The Met. argue, with
 some justice, that the clubs suffering the largest increases are
 not being penalised, but rather have been very favourably treated
 in the past.        For example, Millwall, whose fans have a particularly
  a     reputation,        have enjoyed far greater police presence              in the
E.R.
   ground    than    they     have     paid     for.          Increasing    the   charge
   substantially will       give   them    an   added    incentive to       improve the
   behaviour of their fans,          since the proposed contract will enable
   the police to scale down their presence,               and hence charges, if a
   club's crowd behaviour improves.

   Conclusion

   12   The Metropolitan Police proposals are in line with government
   policy.  They will, however, undoubtably create protests from the
   clubs, who may claim that the policing levels required to promote
   crowd safety - especially following the Hillsborough disaster - are
  being put out of their reach.            On the other hand, now that we have
  a clearer view of the true costs, the Home Office and the Met would
  be open to criticism for requiring the rate and taxpayer                           to
  subsidise the clubs in a way contrary to Government policy.


  13.   we have no reason to suppose that any club would really be
  unable to afford the new charges, but if it really appeared that a
  c u   was likely to be faced with bankruptcy, it might be necessary
  to ask the Met. not to charge the full cost.                  This would, however,
  be very much a last resort.


  14.   It   would   be     sensible      to clear      the     proposals    with the
  Department of Environment before the Met.               approach the      clubs.   a
  draft letter for Lord Ferrers to send to the Minister for Sport is

             charges for football matches;

        METROPOLITAN POLICE CHARGES FOR FOOTBALL MATCHES             ^ S'GNAT° RY)

        You may be aware that the Metropolitan Police have been undertaking a
        review of the charges they levy for football matches.            As a result of
        that review, they have asked for Home Office approval for increased
        charges for policing London football matches.


        The review has concluded that London      clubs have been                seriously
        undercharged for their policing, for four main reasons:


          i.     the Metropolitan Police often have to supply more
                 officers than are stipulated in the contract with each
                 club;


           11.    the clubs are charged on the basis that each officer does
                 3 hours' duty, whereas in practice they      usually do
                 considerably more;


          .111. no charge is made for the travelling time of officers,
                 despite the fact that this is often considerable, and'
                 they are paid for it;


           iv. officers' time is charged at standard rates (plus a


        H.O. EST. 112

                                                                                35688 9 85 XNW
          charge for overheads), despite the fact that many of them
          police football matches on overtime.


 The Metropolitan Police propose to remedy points i. and ii. in their
 contracts   for the      1989/90 season,        and point iii. . in the subsequent
 season, thus phasing the increases.              They do not propose to charge for
 overtime,   since      the   clubs    may   claim   that    it would be       possible to
 arrange police rostas to avoid it (though in practice, this would be



 The new arrangements will lead to considerable increases in charges.
 In 1989/90 the rises will range from 15% to 247%; and in 1990/91, by
  etween 32% and 334%.           The clubs suffering the highest increases will
 be those which, like Millwall, have enjoyed but not paid for very high
 police presence to control their troublesome fans.


The net's proposals are in line with Government policy,                        agreed with
DOE   Ministers    in    1984,    to   recover    the   full    costs    of policing
inside football grounds.            The clubs know that considerable rises are
imminent, though I have no doubt that there will be protests when they
are   announced.        The   clubs    may   also    claim     that    the   Government    is
pricing adequate policing out of clubs' pockets, at the same time as
they are urging improved safety in football grounds.


If there are genuine oases in which clubs are unable to meet the full
costs,   I shall ask the Commissioner to look at them sympathetically,
but   in general,       I fully support the Met's attempts to recoup                     full
costs.    I believe the Home Secretary and the Commissioner could be
exposed to well founded criticism if, now the charges were analysed,
it were known the rate and taxpayers were in effect subsidising the
clubs,   despite    the Government's general            policy on charging.             Apart
from this and the public expenditure considerations, there is also a
strong   argument       for   encouraging        football      clubs    to    improve     the
behaviour of their fans.           This may be a good means of doing it.                  The
contract allows the police to scale down their presence at matches,
and hence their charges, if fans' behaviour improves.


The Met. are anxious to get new contracts in place before the start of
the new season, so there is very little time.                  I should be grateful if
    you could let me know whether you are content for me to tell the Met
    to go ahead.

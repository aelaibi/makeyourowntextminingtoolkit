I w o u l d say that about 2 . 3 0 pm the Sport Kop end of the ground w o u l d

have    been almost           full    to    capacity,         the    crowd     in that a rea           I would       say

that    the m a j o r i t y    of the       fans     both L i verpool          and N o t t i n g h a m Forest

were    in good humour,              a l t h o u g h one    or two of the           fans were          ejec t e d    from

the ground by officers                  prior      to kick       off    for    being      the worse        for      drink

I recall      one L i ve r p o o 1 s u p port e r aged a p p r o x i m a t e l y           18 years        was

o f fensive      conduct,       he was       ejected        from     the ground.          Some    ten minu t e s          or

so before        the kick       off,       he was a gain         the S p i o n Hop,        this    time wearing

a different        coloured jacket,                he was a g a i n        ejected       form the       ground and

I was    given to u n d e r s t a n d        that       he had      paid twenty          p o u n d s to galn

entrance      into      the m a t c h on the s e c o n ci o c c:a s i o n »

Some    10/13 minutes           before       the kick         off    the S p i o n Hop was         full       and the

 fans were        pushing and           shoving         to gain space.

As   players      entered onto             the    pitch the         crowd     became      exci t e d and       the

pushing and        shoving       became a c c e l e r a t e d as           did the       noise    of    the    crowd

making     it impossible             to hear any           c o m m u n i c a t i o n between     fellow officers

When    the   game      commenced at a p p r o x i m a t e 1y 3pm a nd a ma11er                        of moments

later,     the    crowd       roared at          this    time    1 was      not    looking       towards       the

pitch but at         the      crowd,       and    it was as         if a goal       had been scored,

s h o r 1 1y after      I looked        towards         the West S t a n d        side    of the gr o u n d

(Leppings        Lane    s i d e ) and saw a large               number       of supp o r t e r s and Police

on the     pitch,       iiy first       impre s s i o n was         that    some    fans    had    invaded the

onto    the   pitch that         the       situation        looked more           serious.       The Forest

supporters        I believe          thought       likewise at          first      because       they began          to

chant    obscen i t i e s      towards       the Liverpool             suppo r t e r s and w hen         they too

stood           near      to me,      identified             themselves          as     doctors          and       wanted       to

assist.             I was      instructed             by    Inspector         Calvert         to       take      them      through         the

Hop at the                back and onto               the    pitch,       w ith extreme                d i f f i c u l t y you had to

    squeeze         through         the    crowd,          not    that     they did not want                     to    clear a path

to       let us through               but       the    fact       that    they       c o u l d n ’t move           to do so,          1

    remember         thinking         that       if     1 fell      to the ground the                     likel i h o o d       of    being

    injured         or    regaining my            feet w ould have               been        tremendous.

However,             having         reached the             ptich from the              entrance             betw e e n the S pion

the       body of a youth,                     heading       towards        the gymnasium,                   he was       having

OBSERVATIONS

During          my P oli ce          Service          I have       worked       at    other        Semi-Final             matches          at

Hillsborough.                  As    regards          communication             difficulties,                  I was      not      issued

with        a      radio,      however           I can      sa y    that w h e n s p e a k i n g         to      an o ff ic e r       at

    previously            I took      the       doctors          through      the     Hop     at       the     back     and     through

many        for      safety         and    I reiterate             my    greatest        fear          was     falling        to     the
